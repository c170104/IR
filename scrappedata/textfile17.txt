Yes, it sustains, infusing their cold, lifeless bodies with energy that could be gleaned from any other source. But it is more than that. It is life, captured and contained. Less a taste and more of a full-body sensation. It makes them remember, although whether the memories are really theirs or if they are simply imagined remains a mystery. Even drawn cold, sterile and inert from a sealed canister, it still possesses a unique power, though nothing will ever compare to drinking it fresh. For a few brief seconds, their cold bodies feel warm, their own still blood remembers a time when it pulsed, their hearts constrict in the ghost of a beat. They take a deep breath, remembering a time when their lungs required the oxygen, when breathing was not simply a habit or a formality. They close their eyes, seeing for a second the brightness of the sun that used to warm them. All things they sacrificed, willingly or not. The price of immortality. It is the closest any of them will come to living, truly living, ever again. It lasts seconds, or perhaps an eternity. It's all relative now, time. A minute means as much as a century to them, frozen in time yet pressed on mercilessly into infinity. Vague? Yes. Short? Yes. Oh well. Hope you enjoyed it anyway!

Bonne lecture! La pièce est silencieuse, c'est inhabituel. Adam est encore couché, las des événements des derniers jours et de notre récent retour à Tanger. Il est étendu sur les draps du lit à baldaquin, les rideaux légers ondulent doucement. Je n'ai plus sommeil et j'ai besoin de m'activer pour ne plus réfléchir. Dans l'escalier, mes livres semblent m'appeler. Ceux que j'ai emmenés à Detroit sont encore rangés dans les valises, je n'ai eu pas le cœur d'y toucher, comme si ça pouvait m'aider à nier le passé. Un livre, pourtant, retient mon attention. Un livre en anglais, acheté dans la rue alors que nous vivions à Londres avec Adam. Je l'ouvre et mon regard se pose sur une photographie qui sert de marque-page, celle de notre avant-dernier mariage. Je passe mon pouce sur le visage d'Adam et souris. Son expression est sérieuse, comme toujours sur les photos. Il porte un costume noir, et je porte une robe blanche chargée de bijoux. C'était le premier mariage auquel Christopher Marlowe assistait. Adam l'avait rencontré avant la mort de William Shakespeare et nous nous étions fréquentés de plus en plus au fil des décennies. Christopher, cher Christopher. Son esprit de contradiction était tel qu'il ne vint à Tanger pour la première fois que lors d'un de nos voyages. La photographie de notre dernier mariage, avant qu'Adam n'aille s'exiler à Detroit pour renouer avec la musique - et fuir les humains - est plus lumineuse, d'autant plus qu'elle est en couleur. Elle est enveloppée dans le foulard en soie que je portais dans mes cheveux ce jour-là. J'ai gardé également la robe brodée. Adam est en costume noir, plus léger et plus moderne que celui de Londres. Nous avons beaucoup voyagé, jusqu'à trouver des endroits qui nous convenaient. Mais même dans ces cas-là, il était toujours nécessaire de bouger, deux ou trois fois par siècle au moins, afin de ne pas attirer inutilement l'attention. En seulement une décennie à Detroit, Adam a rassemblé plus de curieux autour de lui que nous deux les cinquante dernières années. La fuite a été cette fois un peu précipitée et un peu plus douloureuse qu'à l'accoutumée. Vous me demanderez quel sens trouve la vie lorsque tous les repères qu'on a disparaissent à une allure folle, lorsque tout ce qu'on pensait savoir n'est plus vrai un battement de cil plus tard. Justement, ce qui donne du sens, c'est ce qui vous ancre dans le présent, et dans mon cas, il s'agit d'Adam. Nous continuons à nous retrouver malgré nos séparations. Nous continuons à avoir besoin l'un de l'autre, envers et contre tout. Nous avons assisté à des pans d'histoire incroyables - même si Adam en a manqué un certain nombre. Le XXIe siècle offre des possibilités inouïes en termes de communication, bien que le romantisme des lettres écrites à la plume me manque parfois. La musique d'Adam plaît au gens. Elle transmet tant de choses... Pour moi qui le voit composer et qui suis à ses côtés depuis longtemps, pour les gens qui le prennent pour un excentrique musicien reclus chez lui. Elle transmet son expérience, son impression de cette vie riche et qui lui semble trop difficile à porter. Bien entendu, personne d'autre que Christopher et moi ne sait ce qui se cache derrière la mélancolie des reprises d'anciennes chansons et les accords lancinants de violon. Qui le pourrait, qui serait à même de croire cette vérité ? Quand on a vécu aussi longtemps que nous, on ne croit plus en grand-chose, sinon en l'Amour - et nous sommes chanceux sur ce point. L'idée de Dieu ne nous fait rien, de même que les menaces de souffrance éternelle. Évidemment, point de salut ou de paradis pour nous, ces siècles d'existence ne se sont pas faits sans heurts ni péchés. Adam a toujours trouvé ironique l'origine biblique de nos prénoms couplée avec son désintérêt total pour la religion, ainsi que mon propre intérêt dénué de foi. Qui voudrait aller au Paradis, de toute manière ? Enfin, qui voudrait faire autant de sacrifice dans l'espoir mince de quelque chose de meilleur dans l'après-vie? À de nombreuses reprises dans l'histoire, des prédicateurs ont réussi par leurs menaces à effrayer suffisamment les gens. Mais je crois que la liberté, le choix de pouvoir faire ce qu'on veut de sa vie est bien plus important que ça. Il faut respecter les règles, juste assez pour ne pas avoir de problème. S'ils s'avèrent inévitables, la fuite rend les choses plus faciles. Choisir où vivre, avec qui, et comment, c'est extrêmement précieux. Je suis reconnaissante de cette opportunité qui nous a été offerte, même si je n'irais pas jusqu'à dire que nous n'avons rien fait pour le mériter. Nous nous sommes battus, nous avons passé des siècles à essayer de garder notre secret sans qu'il se retourne contre nous. Aujourd'hui, la fin semble plus proche que jamais. Elle n'est pas encore pour tout de suite, mais d'avoir perdu Christopher nous a montré que même notre existence hors norme devrait un jour s'arrêter. Alors jusque-là nous devons continuer à profiter de notre propre version du Paradis, cette liberté dans le présent. C'est venu tout seul en lisant le prompt. C'est intéressant de prendre la voix d'Eve pour écrire. Merci d'avoir lu ","Summary":" OS écrit pour le NaNoWriMo de novembre 2016, sur le même prompt qu'Oxeneo. Bonne lecture!

He had showed up on my doorstep just as the sun had gone down. Then he had thrown me in his car and drove us out to the middle of nowhere. He had been dragging me through the forest for the past hour. I couldn't see anything, but with Adam's night vision, I imagine it didn't matter. Adam turned to me and shushed me. After walking for 30 more minutes, we stopped. I felt Adam's cold body behind me and a cold hand covered my eyes. \"Keep walking\", he told me. I took a few steps forward. \"Stop\", Adam said. He uncovered my eyes and a saw a lake in the middle of a clearing. The light from the full moon illuminated the water. \"It's beautiful Adam\", I told him. I turned and saw him stripping off his shirt. I blushed as his long, pale, torso was exposed. He took off his pants and shoes leaving him in his boxers. \"Adam…?\" I asked him. He walked over to me and took a hold of the bottom of my shirt. I allowed him to lift it off my body. I slipped off my shorts and Adam took my hands in his. He walked backward, his eyes never leaving mine. Soon, we were waist deep in the water. We swam around in the lake for a while, completely losing track of time. I noticed the sky slowly turning pink. \"Adam, we have to go. The sun is coming up\", I told him. I started to swim away from him, but he grabbed me by the waist and turned me around. I wrapped my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist. My fingers tangled themselves in his thick black hair. He was quiet as his blue eyes stared into my hazel ones. \"Adam? What is it?\" I asked him softly. There was sadness in his blue eyes. A sadness I hadn't seen since he had returned from Tangier without Eve. \"Would you stay with me?\" Adam asked me. \"Of course I will Adam. You know I'll always stay when you ask\", I told him, cupping his cold cheek in my hand. \"Not just for tonight\", Adam said, \"Forever. I want you stay with me forever\". Forever? I had thought about spending the rest of my life with Adam, but never eternity. A thousand thoughts were flying through my mind. \"Please stay with me\", Adam begged. \"Okay\", I breathed. Adam's lips met mine and I could feel the tips of his fangs poking my bottom lip. I was terrified, but I loved Adam more than anything. I knew I would never come close to what he had with Eve, but I knew he cared about me. I also knew that he would probably try to kill himself if I died and I just couldn't bear the thought of that. That was the last night I was human.

He had the strength for little else. Eventually, his eyes began to fall and slowly he slipped into another dreamless slumber. He thought. The room was dark, black and void of any light. The air was so stale he felt he could choke on it. As he looked around, Adam knew something was watching him from the darkness. It wasn't followed by the unease of being spied on, but there was no doubting that something somewhere was watching him. Adam felt comfortable which made it worse. \"My sweet Adam.\" The greeting was softly whispered from the shadows. It surrounded him, wrapping the vampire in familiar warmth and comfort. \"Where are you?\" he asked. Adam didn't bother yelling because something told him it wasn't needed. \"Close.\" She whispered back. Adam spun in his spot, turning multiple times to try and see her. \"I want to see you.\" He said, still turning and searching for her in the dark. \"Why are you hiding? Where are you?\" Adam felt panic course through him the longer he couldn't find her. \"I'm coming, my darling.\" She sang. \"I'll be with you soon.\" Adam suddenly shot up, awake and panting heavily. Adam felt like he was sweating –an impossible task to be sure- but he felt it. His eyes darted around the familiar layout of his living room. Nothing was out of place, not an instrument nor a speck of dust shifted. But something was wrong. Something was new. He couldn't place his finger on it until he remembered the dream. \"Lilith.\" He breathed the name quietly and felt no safer for it. Feeling the memories begin to bubble inside his brain, Adam leaned forward in his seat and rested his elbows on his knees. He readied himself for what was to come. Like every other time he spoke her name, Adam knew the surge of emotions were coming. Oh how he lamented them… Her perfect voice still echoed in his brain, calling to him and making his feel safe. And then the rest of her would always follow. Adam could see her slate grey eyes, the way they changed depth of color like soapstone, jumping from the brightest shade to the darkest tone. Then her face would gradually fill in around them, her ivory white skin, her sculpted features and her beautiful lips. Her tresses would always stay hidden, consumed by the blackest black that would surround her in his mind. She was beauty to him, pure and terrifying. She was perfection. She was a part of him and him a part of her. She was his mother. Adam felt the inevitable sting of hurt and the pain of her abandonment after recreating her image in his mind. It was the part he hated. While he could swim forever in the love he felt for her, it would eventually turn frigid with the memory of her sudden departure. Without warning, Adam launched himself across the room and slammed his fist into the wall. He froze. Drywall crumbled to the ground and he sighed. As he pulled his fist from the wall, Adam cursed himself for still caring. He'd moved on with his life. He'd met a new love, a better love, and no longer needed Lilith. Adam reluctantly returned to his couch and sank once again into the cushion. He hated lying to himself, but it never stopped him from doing it. He would always miss her and worse yet, he would always love her. Very short, but I liked how it came out. I still haven't decided if I should turn this into an actual story or not. Let me know what you guys think. ","Summary":" Adam continued to lazily strum his guitar. He had the strength for little else.

Only three days ago did I discover the movie, Only Lovers Left Alive. To be perfectly honest, I only went searching for movies that Tom Hiddleston had been in as a result to watching Infinity War. I watched the trailer for Only Lovers Left Alive and immediately thought, \"Oooh Vampire Loki and Vampire Ancient One, this will be interesting\". Well I admit it that Only Lovers Left Alive has completely distracted me from Infinity War and after rewatching this movie again at 2 am I suddenly felt the urge to write. This takes place just a few hours after the last scene from Only Lovers Left Alive. There is no plan for more chapters, but I could be tempted to write more. Also I really enjoyed writing from Adam's point of view. I hope you enjoy these short paragraphs and who knows? Maybe I'll write more or even write a Loki story while I am at it…? Only Lovers Left Undead She was scrambling around. She tried to sit up, but she was too tired. All she managed was to flap her arms towards me. She panted at the pain. But Mine and I let the zombies lie in anguish on the ground. I laid together with Mine. Our heads back as we forgot the red staining our lips in perfect round droplets. We were so hungry, now we were bloated and overstuffed from our meal. Nourishment and nutrients rushed through our veins and it was a high incomparable to any drug. The male that belonged to Mine gently thrashed and quietly moaned. The female echoed back in despair. \"Dawn approaches,\" Eve whispered into my ear, her cool lips against my flesh. I resisted the shudder her skin against mine always brought. Slowly I pulled myself up, I brought Eve up with me and together we gazed upon the violence we made together. I looked away from the perfectly shaped bite marks the zombies shared. I looked into Eve's eyes. I looked for traces of illness. We feasted on untested blood and neither of us sampled either zombie's blood for traces of contamination. Eve looked back at me. She touched my cheek affectionately before she leaned in. I leaned forward and we embraced and kissed each other deeply. She pulled away for just a second, to lick away the stain of blood from the corner of my mouth. Then again we kissed. I held on to her in fear she would vanish. What would I do without My love? I would surely perish. She pulled away again and abruptly stood. She turned and squinted at the horizon, almost as if she were in pain. I quickly stood too. Dawn was nearly here, dragging up the sun and ready to burn us in this awful desert. I fetched our glasses and quickly placed the dark shades over Mine's before protecting my own eyes. Eve did not have to say a word. I followed her lead as was my default. Eve lifted the female as I reached for the male. Their weight paled in comparison to the strength in our veins. As we passed our bench from a few hours before, I fetched Mine's gloves and pulled the Oud strap over my shoulder. I'd prefer leaving the zombie to the sunlight to keep the beautiful instrument from injury. However Mine still retained her human empathy and she was more romantic than I, though she was quick to always deny it. Now we run. Race through the back alleys and up the bricked roads and steps. The previous two nights seemed such a long time ago. I barely remember the first night that we paced agonizingly up the road steps. I was so tired, so hungry and now the sun was creeping towards us, we had zombies and instruments on our shoulders and it felt like we were flying. I gave Eve a half smile at the thrill alone. It was romantic in a way, two mythologies, racing up the road stairs, trying to make it back home before the sun rose and burnt us to dust. My half smile lasted only a fleeting moment. The back of my neck and the exposed skin on my wrists and hands began to smoulder and sizzle. I stumbled and I cried out as the brick road raced up to strike my face. A hand shot out, grabbed a fist full of my jacket and jerked me into the shadows. I dropped the zombie and fell to my knees. I grunted as I examined my wrists and hands. The flesh was gone, revealing blacked ash for muscle and pale gray bones with bits of orange coals nestled within them. Eve was there, her zombie out of her arms as she gently held my arms for me. I looked over her body, but she had managed to escape without any damage or injury from the sun. I sucked in a painful breath as smoke smouldered from my wounds. \"Shhh, now, baby, you will heal,\" Eve told me. Of course she was right and as soon as the words were out of her mouth the wounds were gone. The live coals that were my bones and tendons faded back to pale grey and the burnt black of my muscles disappeared. It became a healthy red before my flesh knitted itself back together. All trace of the damage was gone, but the memory of that agonizing pain remained. Until Eve ran a trail of kisses over my wrists and hands. I closed my eyes and sighed in perfect contentment. \"I have somezing special vor you,\" a voice whispered to some passerby from around the corner. Eve immediately pulled me up and unlocked her home. We dragged in the zombies and laid them in the floor. \"What are we going to do with the zombies?\" I asked Eve as she drew me to her bed. She kicked off her shoes as I sat down, my eyes on their sleeping forms. \"They aren't zombies anymore, they are our children,\" Even replied as she removed my shoes for me and pulled me back against the mattress. It was hard to keep my eyes open as my head touched the silk covered pillows. \"We should have left them,\" I told her. Eve tsked before her reply, \"You know only a portion of that pain, or have you forgotten when you had live coals in your bone?\" she grabbed my hand and traced the bones in the back of my hand, outlining where the sunlight burned me. \"Eve, we drank from them because we were starving and we had no supply. Now there are four of us in Tangier and we are to avoid the hospital. How are we going to feed four of us?\" Eve frowned. She snuggled into my chest and wrapped my arm around her shoulders. She turned her face away and sighed. \"I'll have to come back later for my books.\" \"Eve, I…\" I stopped, my eyelids drooped. I was completely over full from my desperate dinner, I was ready to sleep now. Eve turned her face back to mine. She put her hand over my cheek. \"Tell me.\" \"I don't want to travel again.\" \"We can't just release them though. They would devastate Tangier. Though it might be a bit of fun with a little chaos.\" My jaw locked tightly as I gritted my teeth. I looked back at her, unsure if she was making a joke. \"Of course we can't do that, now can we? Kit was right, there is enough chaos in this world as it is. Therefore we cannot abandon our children. We'll have to teach them everything we know. Before we let them go.\" My eyes were closed by her last word. \"No,\" I whispered to her. I felt her lips against mine, a kiss good morning. Not a real response to my declination, but I was too tired to pursue a vocal response. I returned her kiss before I snuggled my face into her feathery white hair. The two of us faded into a world of dark swirling colors with no difference to Van Gogh's Starry Night. ","Summary":" Disclaimer, I own nothing.

Incorporó su cuerpo y, brevemente, recordó lo que había hecho la noche anterior, beber. No es que le gustase mucho la sensación de constante martilleo en su cabeza, a la mañana siguiente, pero, por lo menos, en las horas en las que estaba sumido en el agradable sopor del alcohol, se olvidaba del camino que le había impuesto su padre. Casarse con una noble que apenas era una niña, engendrar herederos sanos que continuasen el linaje a través de los siglos y pasar grandes temporadas en la corte para poder caerle bien a la reina. Toc, toc – Añadió unos efectos sonoros al golpe - ¿Estás presentable? Me acabo de despertar, ¿Cómo crees que voy a estar? – Puso los ojos en blanco – Entra, no creo que te vayas a asustar a estas alturas – La puerta se abrió y la figura que entró no tardó ni cinco segundos en acabar en la cama y aplastarlo hasta volver a dejar su cabeza sobre la almohada. Sus enormes ojos claros lo miraban con esa vivacidad que la caracterizaban y esa sonrisa no presagiaba nada bueno. ¿Cuántos cumples, Adam? – El hombre sabía lo que significaba esa pregunta, y lo que le pasaba cada vez que le decía el número – Este año me portaré bien. Me lo creeré cuando la cocinera logre que las patatas tengan algo de sabor – La mujer sabía que eso era imposible, y que su hermanastro mayor no la creía – El año pasado tuve que salir con las manos puestas en las orejas, de lo rojas que me las dejaste – Eres un aburrido – Se movió y se quedó sentada a su lado, permitiéndole incorporarse de nuevo – Antes no te importaba – Refunfuñó, cruzándose de brazos – Anne, que tienes 25 años, compórtate como una mujer – Le espetó - ¿Qué hombre te va a querer si andas tirándole de las orejas cada vez que cumple años? Yo no pienso casarme – Afirmó con rotundidad – Los hombres, excepto tú, son aburridos y huelen mal – Ella siempre tan sincera – Si nuestros padres no se hubiesen conocido después de enviudar y casado, puede que ahora mismo tu fueses mi prometido – Ella adoraba a su hermano, comparaba a todos los hombres con él – Te aseguro que no, porque antes me hubiera tirado por un puente – Se tapó las orejas para reafirmar sus palabras – Anne y él no eran hermanos de sangre. Su padre enviudó cuando Adam sólo contaba con nueve años y él no se iba a encargar de cuidar a un crío que, según él, sólo le daba problemas. Conoció a una bella mujer en el duelo de un amigo y, tras entablar una conversación, descubrió que era viuda y que tenía una niña de un año. A los dos meses se casaron y ellos dos se convirtieron en hermanos. Aquella mujer se convirtió en su madre y Adam nunca tuvo ninguna queja de ella. Anna, simplemente, era esa hermana pequeña a la que protegía de los monstruos y cuidaba como si fuera un preciado tesoro. Su hermana, su mejor amiga, la única persona en la que confiaba y con la que se mostraba tal y como era. Los años le habían conferido una belleza sin parangón, que dejaba a todos los hombres de la corte babeando por ella. Pero Anne tenía un carácter muy particular, poco dado a la docilidad que esperaban aquellos pomposos nobles. Adam le había enseñado a defenderse en caso de ataque indeseado y ella había sido una alumna muy aventajada; algunos hombres huían de su presencia después de que ella les diera un rodillazo en el lugar justo. Si él se casaba con aquella joven y se iba a la casa de la familia de ésta, ya que su nobleza era más pura que la suya, la dejaría sola, a merced de su padre y de los hombres que quisieran desposarla y tomarla como a un objeto. Ella tenía mucho que ofrecer y se merecía a alguien que la tratara como a un igual, que no viese sólo su cuerpo sino también lo que guardaba tras aquellos bonitos ojos claros. Adam, ¿te encuentras bien? – Le había pasado la mano sobre la cara para comprobar si estaba en este mundo o en otro – Te veo confuso – Nada, simplemente pensaba en el tedio de tener que ver como recibo felicitaciones de personas que no pueden verme si no fuera porque padre les da dinero – La amargura se hizo patente y recibió un cálido abrazo de la joven – Como me gustaría poder vivir mi vida, decidir lo que haré al día siguiente. Sí algún día te atreves a emprender ese viaje, dímelo – Le dio un beso en la frente y salió de la habitación para que la doncella no le riñese por dejar el agua del baño enfriar – Como temía, aquel día de cumpleaños había sido tedioso y lleno de sonrisas falsas. Las únicas personas sinceras en aquella estancia, su hermana y su madre, estuvieron imposibilitadas por culpa de todas aquellas damas que no se cansaban de dar consejos a Anne. Parece que estás en un funeral – Su padre le espetó – Si no sonríes un poco, Lady Gale te tendrá miedo – Tiene 16 años, padre, le doblo la edad – Le aclaró - ¿Cómo no va a tenerme miedo? Si aún es una cría que debe vivir su vida y esperar unos años hasta casarse -. Las mujeres, cuando antes se casen, más hijos darán – El hombre le recordó, en un hiriente susurro – Por eso, todas las criadas de menos de 20 tienen bebes que, sorprendentemente, se parecen a mí recién nacido – La ironía enfadó a su padre, pero no podía pegarle delante de nadie – Teniendo una bella mujer con la que tener más descendientes, decidiste cogerla como cuidadora para mí y así poder realizar tu actividad favorita, el sexo fuera del matrimonio -. No te di demasiados azotes de pequeño – Bufó con voz ronca y amenazante – El problema es que me diste demasiados, padre – Le aclaró – Si me disculpas, necesito respirar aire, aunque este esté viciado – Anne observó con ojos tristes como su hermano huía de su propia fiesta y salía de la casa para poder aliviar la creciente tensión de sus músculos. Ella no podía huir de la fiesta, por el momento, pero de nada que todo el mundo se fuese, y el regresara, iría a su habitación y lo ayudaría. Los invitados se fueron, ella subió a sus aposentos, se cambió y se dedicó a esperar, desde su ventana, que el caballo de Adam apareciese por el camino. El sueño pudo más y acabó dejándose dormir sobre la colcha, con las velas encendidas y el aire frío del mes de febrero entrando por la puerta. Anne – Una seductora voz la llamaba – despierta, pequeña tormenta – Adam la llamaba así porque siempre que entraba en un lugar, éste acababa de patas arriba, física y espiritualmente – La joven abrió los ojos y lo que vio la dejó asustada, completamente temblorosa. Los ojos claros de su hermano habían sido sustituidos por unos dorados y de su boca sobresalían unos colmillos, aún con el rastro rojo, posiblemente de sangre. A, Adam – Balbuceó - ¿Qué te ha pasado? – Tragó saliva, asustada y sintió como los ojos del hombre se dirigían a su cuello – Que ahora puedo elegir que hacer – El dedo del hombre siguió la vena del cuello femenino – Sangre virgen – La pupilas de aquellos ojos dorados se dilataron más mientras su lengua, primeramente, lamía la palpitante zona – Anne quería moverse, pero no podía. Se sentía como hipnotizada, embriagada por algo que no podía describir. Su hermano se había convertido en vampiro, unas criaturas que, al contrario de lo que se podía pensar, eran conocidas y temidas en el mundo de los humanos. Sintió la punzada de aquellos dos colmillos sobre la piel y como su sangre era transportada a la boca y al nuevo organismo de su hermano. Su sabor era perfecto, puro, sin nada que lo contaminara. Ella era hermosa, siempre se lo había parecido y, si no la hubiera visto siempre como su hermana, habría disfrutado de lo que su cuerpo podría ofrecerle. Ahora le estaba dando alimento y, si la dejaba sin vida y, luego, cuando despertara con una extraña sensación, como le había pasado a él, y embebía su sangre, también se convertiría en vampiro. Podrían vivir juntos para siempre, visitar todos los continentes y convertir a más gente. Ella tendría la libertad de vivir su vida, pero dejaría a su madre sola y triste, a merced de un hombre insensible. Se apartó, antes de saciarse por completo y se alejó hasta la ventana. Anne lo observó con ojos tristes, mientras con su mano tapaba la marca que le habían hecho los colmillos en su cuerpo. Adam, no te vayas – Le suplicó – Te necesito – La joven no tenía fuerza para levantarse, así que estiró su brazo en un tonto intento por alcanzarlo – Por favor Debes vivir tu vida, Anne – La sed se había calmado y volvía a mostrar sus ojos claros – Enamorarte, tener unas hijas iguales a ti y cuidar de madre. Cuando la veas, dile que la quiero, que ha sido la mejor madre que un hijo puede soñar y que no tema, que sobreviviré – Por lo menos, déjame sentir un beso de tus labios – Aquellas palabras frenaron la incesante salida del vampiro – Al menos un recuerdo que pueda guardar en mi corazón – La suplica que salía de sus carnosos labios y esos ojos húmedos, empapados de tristeza – Sólo uno y te dejaré ir – Adam regresó a la cama, al lado de Anne. Sus largos y fríos dedos rozaron la húmeda mejilla, y sus labios recogieron las gotas que caían de los conductos. Ella siempre había sido su compañera, su igual y le dolía en el alma tener que dejarla sola, a merced de las decisiones de su padre. Pero su madre se merecía tenerla a su lado y luchar juntas ante las cuestionables decisiones del hombre. Su cuerpo se alzaba levemente sobre la mujer, con las palmas puestas a cada lado del colchón, cerca de su cintura. Anne definía con sus ojos en lo que se había convertido y sus labios se llenaba de humedad, ansiando que, por fín, los probara. Con cuidad, su cabeza descendió y juntó su boca a la de ella. Primero, un roce liviano, un ligero toque que los impregnase del sabor del otro. Se sintió muy cómodo besándola, como si ella fuese la persona adecuada para él. Sus bocas se amoldaron y en poco tiempo se olvidaron del peligro que podía entrañar ese pequeño contacto. El cuerpo de Adam se aflojó y pegó su anatomía a la de ella, excitándose al instante, pero controlándose para no matarla de un mordisco. Anne tomó una de las manos del vampiro y lo obligó a que asiera su seno, aún cubierto bajo la tela del camisón. Fue el contacto más exquisito que había sentido en su vida y, unido al beso, hizo que su fuerza se multiplicara y rompiera la tela del camisón, dejándola totalmente expuesta, a su merced. Adam dejó la boca femenina y siguió el reguero de caricias por su cuello hasta alcanzar la cima de sus hermosos y plenos pechos. Disfrutó del néctar salado de la transpiración que la llenaba y sus labios se ensartaron en una suculenta lucha con sus pezones. Anne no podía controlar las sensaciones y quiso gritar, pero el ruido fue frenado por la mano de Adam, que ahogó el sonido mientras él seguía disfrutando de los senos. Ella le había pedido un beso a un vampiro, y ahora debía pagar las consecuencias del aquel acto. La mano continuaba posada sobre su boca, y ella tuvo algo que morder cuando los colmillos se clavaron en la piel de su seno y bebieron el jugo que corría por su cuerpo. No quería morderla, pero ver las venas dibujarse bajo su blanca piel fue más de lo que su autocontrol podía soportar. Buscó una zona carnosa e hincó los colmillos; al mismo tiempo, disfrutó extasiado de cómo Anne mordía su mano. El placer y el dolor se juntaban en una simbiosis afrodisiaca. Ella aún era pura, y si la tomaba la imposibilitaría para el futuro. Pero era tan hermosa, tan deseable, que su viaje por aquellos mágicos valles continuó. La saliva de su boca se posó por las marcas en su seno y luego prosiguió por su estómago, hasta alcanzar la prohibida zona de rizos castaños. El aroma a mujer excitada volvió a sacar su lado salvaje y su lengua abrió los labios y paladeó el salino sabor que desprendía su interior. Como hiciera con sus pezones, jugó de forma meticulosa con su clítoris y sonrió al ver como ella arqueaba su cuerpo y movía sus caderas pidiendo más. Sus orgasmos se sucedieron, uno tras otro. Parecía que no tuviera fin, pero ella quería que continuara, que la saciara por completo, que la dejara totalmente agotada. En el último, aprovechando que fue el más fuerte de todos, él volvió a hincar los colmillos en la blandura de sus níveos muslos. Bebió y ella se sintió drogada, pero al mismo tiempo entusiasmada. Se deslizó por su cuerpo hasta volver a encontrarse con su rostro. Lo que vio en él lo llenó de ternura y pasión a partes iguales. Su belleza se había multiplicado con el desaliño y el sudor que empapaba su rostro. Sólo faltaba el último paso y ella lo empezó a dar cuando abrió la palma en la parte delantera de sus calzas buscando su virilidad. Consiguió sacarla y su mano se deleitó con su tersura, además de con el tamaño que había alcanzado. Sus más oscuros sueños se cumplían, Adam iba a ser el primer, y único, ser que la tomara por completo, en cuerpo y en alma. Después de la placentera caricia, él le tomó las manos y las inmovilizó sobre su cabeza. Sin guiarse con su propia mano, encontró el lugar justo y, mientas ambas miradas se internaban en la del otro, penetró de un solo empujón, rompiendo la barrera de su virtud, su futuro. Si ella sintió algo de dolor no lo demostró en su rostro. Con la boca entreabierta y sus ojos pidiendo más, Annie demostró ser una entregada amante. Las caderas se movieron acompasadas y los dos se dejaron llevar a un mundo sin tiempo, sin reglas, sin dolor. Adam intuyó cuando llegaría el grito de liberación de Anne, así que, antes de que lo hiciera, atrapó su boca en un hambriento beso, mordió ligeramente y aprovechó para vaciarse en su interior. En ese momento, ella se quedó completamente dormida por el agotamiento y el efecto narcotizante de las mordidas. Adam aprovechó para recuperarse y desaparecer, no sin antes, después de darle un tierno beso en la frente, decir estas palabras. No te olvidaré, \"pequeña tormenta\" – Saltó hasta su caballo y se esfumó, como el humo, de la vida que había llenado su existencia – Adam se alejó lo más rápido que pudo de la casa y, a medio camino de ninguna parte, se volvió y se despidió de aquella anodina vida de noble. Su padre ya no lo obligaría a casarse con una joven, los nobles antipáticos ya no tendrían que fingir una sonrisa ante él y ya no volvería a probar las patatas sin sabor de la cocinera. Lo único que echaría de menos de aquella casa eran las dos mujeres que, a pesar de no ser de su sangre, habían sido las personas más cercanas y que más lo comprendieron. Pero, sobre todo, extrañaría a Anne, su sonrisa y, aunque no lo quisiera confesar, sus tirones de orejas en los cumpleaños. Cuando Anne despertó y divisó la luz del sol reflejándose en las sabanas, mostrando los estragos de lo que allí había sucedido, la tristeza inundó su semblante porque eso significaba que Adam ya no volvería nunca. Las lágrimas empezaron a brotar de sus ojos hasta formar una catarata imposible de frenar. Él era, junto a su madre, la única persona que entendía su interior rebelde, las ganas que tenía de conocer mundo, de vivir sin atarse a las conveniencias de la sociedad, a amar sin límites. Ella estaba enamorada de su hermano, y ahora llevaba la marca de su pasión por todo su cuerpo. La tendría ahí para siempre, jamás dejaría que otro hombre la tocase y borrase el aroma del único hombre que ocupaba su corazón, su vida. CAPITULO 1: SELENE EN LA ACTUALIDAD Eres mía, sólo mía, y lo sabes – Aquella voz susurrante iba acompañada de unas suaves caricias por la piel desnuda de su ombligo – Sólo podrás entregarte a mí, tu cuerpo está impregnado con mi aroma; y tu sangre es la que me alimentará siempre, siempre, siempre. Despertó con un sobresalto, totalmente excitada y con la respiración formando torbellinos en la habitación. Temblaba, pero pudo sacar los pies de la cama y dirigirse hasta el espejo de la habitación. Comprobó el estado de su rostro y continuó mirándose durante un buen número de minutos. Si mucha gente supiera la edad que tengo – Se dijo, mientras sus propios ojos analizaban la tersa piel de una joven que aparentaba 25 años, pero que realmente tenía 440 – AÑO 1600: ¿Y cómo sucedió todo? Empezó después de que Adam se fuera de su vida, tras tomarla en cuerpo y alma, además de haber bebido de su sangre virgen. Todo le dolía, pero logró levantarse de la cama e ir hasta el espejo de cuerpo entero que llenaba una esquina de la habitación. Marcas de colmillos por todos lados, las manchas rojas entre sus muslos, la prueba de la pasión del vampiro. Debía estar agotada, pero se sentía pletórica, más viva de lo que nunca había estado. Logró lavarse y ponerse un camisón, pero no le dio tiempo de quitar las sabanas antes de que llegara su madre y descubriera lo que había sobre la tela que cubría su cama. ¿Qué ha pasado? – Había preocupación pero no acusación en su voz - ¿Has sido mordida por un vampiro? – A Anne le sorprendió más esa pregunta que a la propia mujer - ¿Cómo has dejado que uno entre en la casa? – La pregunta estaba cargada de curiosidad – Porque ese uno era Adam, madre – Respondió con franqueza – Ahora es un vampiro – Le explicó – Y dejé que me mordiera y me tomara – Miró con disimulo la cama – Sabemos que los vampiros existen, los estragos que provocan en los humanos cada vez que muerden. Adam me ha mordido pero, en vez de sentirme peor, es todo lo contrario – Alegó – Es como si en cada mordida me diera más vida – Vio a su madre suspirar – Creo que el día ha llegado – Como si lo oliera, una figura apareció por la ventana, una que era muy parecida a la de su difunto padre, pero con un color de pelo diferente – Alfred, ha sucedido – La mujer habló con el hombre, de una forma tan tranquila que Anne no entendía – ¿Por qué el tío parece como si tuviera 30 años, igual que la última vez que lo vi? ¿Por qué ha aparecido de repente, sin recibir ningún mensaje? – Las preguntas se agolpaban en su mente al ver la mirada cómplice de aquellas dos personas – Anne, debemos contarte algo muy importante con respecto a ti y a lo que era tu padre – El tío puso las manos sobre los hombros – Así que será mejor que te sientes y escuches – El ruido de unos nudillos tocando la puerta hizo que se alejara de aquellos recuerdos y fuese a abrirla. Detrás de ella, justamente, su tío Alfred, con ese porte leonino y los ojos más verdes que había visto en su vida. ¿Ha habido movimiento? – Ella sabía que, cada vez que tocaba a su puerta era porque un grupo de vampiros andaban cerca – Y es numeroso – Añadió, con una sonrisa – Cambiate rápido y espérame en el garaje – Lo mismo de todas las noches – Se puso sus pantalones vaqueros, sus botas, la camisa y una chaqueta de cuero. Cuando estaba en casa era Anne, pero cuando salía a cazar vampiros era más conocida como Selene. Bajó las escaleras, totalmente pertrechada con sus armas y su fuerza, llegó al garaje y allí la esperaba su tío con el Jeep. Lo tomaron, condujeron hasta un descampado que se encontraba cerca de un callejón y allí avistaron a un numeroso grupo de vampiros, más amplio de lo que solía ser por costumbre. Ambos poseían una capacidad deductiva mayor de lo normal. Pero ella, además, tenía en su interior esencia vampírica, introducida varios siglos atrás, cuando Adam bebió su sangre y se apoderó de su cuerpo. Rápida, hermosa y letal, esa era la combinación que la definía a la perfección. Su velocidad la llevó hasta el grupo de vampiros que, como siempre, pensaban que podían con ella por ser mujer. Esos aún no la conocían, no sabían de lo que ella era capaz de hacer, no sólo con las armas, sino también con su cuerpo. Alfred también podría luchar contra ese grupo de vampiros, pero conocía a su sobrina y su gusto por los retos mayúsculos. Cuanto más grande era el grupo, más sola prefería estar; y él no era quien para arrebatarle el gusto. Como animales sedientos de sangre y carne femenina, los vampiros atacaron de forma predecible. Selene esquivó con rapidez, más de la que ellos tenían, todos los golpes que intentaban darle, así como los conatos de mordidas. Ella tenía más de 400 años, la sangre ancestral de su familia la hizo inmortal, como esos seres, para poder pelear con ellos sin desfallecer y sin morir. Uno a uno, fueron cayendo en una nube de polvo, hasta que no quedó ninguno en el oscuro callejón. Totalmente satisfecha de sí misma y, confiándose un poco, no se percató de que otro venía por detrás; pero su tío estuvo más rápido y lo tumbó. Selene viró su cuerpo y vio el del ser caído en el suelo adoquinado, sobre su pecho. Ha demostrado poca resistencia – Se extrañó Alfred ante lo fácil del derribo – Todos los demás parecían fuertes, llenos de sangre y furia animal, pero éste no – Entre ambos lo levantaron y le colocaron una bolsa de tela sobre la cabeza – ¿Crees que sea un vampiro de Valder? – Preguntó acerca del ancestral vampiro, conocido como el primero, de donde manaron el resto – Lo dudo, pero ha estado cerca de los suyos, así que puede saber algo sobre él – Lo metieron en el coche, así inconsciente y se adentraron ellos – Puede que con la justa persuasión logre decirnos algo – Es muy escurridizo, tío, y cada día hay más grupos, más vampiros recorriendo las calles, matando gente inocente sólo porque él quiere tener el dominio de este mundo – Sonaba a película, pero era verdad – Lograremos cazarlo, Annie – Él la llamaba por su verdadero hombre – Pagará por lo que le hizo a tu madre – Arrancó el coche y éste se condujo hasta la apartada casa que habitaban – Aparcaron en el garaje, transportaron el cuerpo hasta un cuarto escondido que tenían en el sótano y lo prepararon todo para que mantenerlo atado a la silla sin que su fuerza la rompiera en caso de que despertase. ¿Puedo encargarme yo, tío? – Le pidió al hombre – No es que tú no puedas, pero quiero interrogar sola, por una vez – Siempre lo hacían los dos, por miedo a que ella se descontrolase demasiado – Prometo mantenerme calmada hasta que hable – Adivinó lo que a Alfred le pasaba por la cabeza en aquel momento - Miraré por el cristal de la sala adjunta – Tenían aquello montado como si fuera una sala de interrogatorios policial, con un cristal en el que él podía ver el interior de la sala, pero el que estaba en el interior no divisaba nada, ya que era un vampiro, y como tal, no se reflejaba – Anne sacó la tela de la cabeza y esta cayó por su propio peso. Tan débil estaba que no podía ni levantar su cara; su pelo negro caía, tapando sus facciones, parecía una especie de animal dormido, esperando atacar. No debía hacerlo, pero había algo en aquella figura que la atraía como un imán. Sabiendo a lo que se arriesgaba, a que la mordiera, alargó la mano para ponerla sobre la barbilla y levantar el rostro del desconocido. Si ese ser trataba de morderla, moriría de forma repentina, y todo gracias a Adam y su posesión. Al beber de su sangre, al tomar posesión de su virtud, de su cuerpo, la impregnó de su esencia de vampiro. Él era el único que podía morderla sin perecer, y con el que podía tener relaciones carnales sin sufrir ese mismo destino; estaba totalmente atada a él con un lazo de sangre desde hacía más de 400 años. Fue rozar la barbilla para alzar el rostro y, de pronto, verse empotrada sobre la pared y mordida en su yugular. O aquel vampiro había fingido su debilidad o ella le había infundido fuerza y hambre nada más verla. Seguía bebiendo de forma ávida, sin frenar, sin desfallecer, sintiéndose más vivo a casa sorbo que tragaba. Al mismo tiempo, su alto cuerpo se pegó al de ella y Anne no pudo evitar excitarse ante ese minucioso contacto. Sus pezones se endurecieron y su zona íntima comenzó a humedecerse ante el roce de aquella dureza masculina que peleaba por salir de sus pantalones. Ese vampiro no moría, seguía allí, con más potencia, con las feromonas manando por toda su anatomía, llevándola hasta él éxtasis aún con la ropa puesta. El olor, ese característico aroma, uno que no percibía desde 1600, cuando se unió a. ¿Adam? – Preguntó y la figura vampírica dejó de beber, apartándose un poco para ver el rostro de la persona que preguntaba – ¿Anne? – Su pregunta estaba llena de terror y de sorpresa - ¿Eres tú? – Las manos de ambos aún se tocaban y ese contacto sencillo todavía la llenaba de deseo – Ella no respondió con palabras, simplemente acercó sus labios hacia aquellos llenos de su propia sangre y los dos se envolvieron en un acto visceral, completamente llevado por los sentidos. El ósculo se volvió más hambriento y la pasión hizo que arrancara la ropa del vampiro con una fuerza que iba más allá de lo sobre humano. Enroscó sus piernas alrededor de las caderas, abrazó su cuello y dejó que él volviera a hacerle sentir el paraíso. 13 ","Summary":" LAZOS DE SANGRE PRÓLOGO LONDRES 1600 Un año más en su anodina vida y ya iban 33.

Only Lovers Left Alive Adam's Decision One-shot Adam gazed down the hallway of the infirmary, he knew where she was, he had her placed there. He had been in gathering blood when she had arrived at the ER. Biting his lip, he sighed, he knew she had been frail and fragile from the beginning. Her life was fleeting, he knew this. She was after all a simple mortal person, while he was an ageless being. He would continue as he was till the end of days, while she would develop, age and in a blink of his immortal life wither and perish. A nurse had told him of her arrival as soon as he had stashed the blood. When he arrived, he was involuntary removed from her operating room. In his haste to get to her he had forgotten in that moment he had forgotten all of his periodical. Someone assured Adam that they were performing the best they can for her. Now here he was waiting, waiting for his courage to find him. Eve and the others had warned him that mankind would never serve anything but bring anguish to creatures like him. However, there had been something about her that had dragged him in and he could not escape. Adam tilted his head backwards against the wall all and closed his eyes, he could sense the eyes upon him as people passed by. A few tried to speak to him, but he never spoke or moved, eventually they gave up and left him alone. What has webbed feet, feathers, fangs and goes quack-quack? Her question slowly came into his head, inducing him to slowly open his eyes. \"Count Duckula\" he breathed as the wraith of her giggle haunted him. He had never told her what he was, but she had determined that he alone seems to appear at night, that he was a sparkling vampire like the one in her favorite motion picture. So every time she'd see him she would have a new vampire joke for him. He never found them amusing, but her laughter always managed to fetch a grin across his face. Adam soon found himself in front of her doorway. It groaned slightly as it gave way gently under his weight. His eyes fell upon her instantaneously, she looked so shattered, so frail and worn. He went closer, the scars that were visible along her small frame devastated him. They were all along her arms, some were fresh while others were at different stages of healing. Tubes were everywhere on her torso, in her arms, down her nose and pharynx. He swallowed hard as he swept her dark hair from her eyes. Adam sighed, \"What did they do to you, dear one?\" The beeping of the machines gave way to new fears, they were irregular and feeble. Something inside him, told him that she wouldn't endure for much longer and she never should have had to experience this at all. Who could have harmed someone like her like this? Why hadn't she told him before? Why hadn't he recognized she needed him? Where the hell was I? Adam wondered, Why hadn't you told me? I should have been there to protect you! Edynn I could of protected you! He wrapped her tightly, protectively into his strong arms. Her body remained limp against him. The machines distressed violently, anguish swelled immediately within Adam's chest. \"Edynn, No, No! Don't do this! Edynn, Please!\" He pleaded, \"Help! Someone Help! Please help her!\" \"No one's coming, Adam.\" The voice belonged to Eve. He looked up desperately at Eve as she continued, \"They can no longer do anything to help her.\" Adam gripped her tighter, burying his face in her hair, he could feel her growing weaker and her skin slowly beginning to change color. \"Only you can save her Adam.\" Eve said lovingly as she wrapped an arm around Adam's shoulders. \"It is forbidden,\" Adam said slowly, her lips were turning blue. \"They will hunt her for eternity.\" \"The choice is yours Adam.\" Eve said as she kissed the top of his head, \" Choose the one you can live with. I will be there to support which ever you choose my darling. But, decide soon before the decision is made for you.\" Adam nodded slowly, could he do this to her? She would be trapped in this stage of her life forever, everyone she cares about will grow old and die, while she would live on. She would never be able to have children, or be able to see the sun again. She would forever be dependent on him and Eve. Her world would forever become darkness. He wondered if he would be able to protect her… would he be able to live with himself if he let her die like this? He also wondered if he could live with himself for subjecting her to his way of life. \"Adam, she only has moments left,\" Eve said, \"You must decide now.\" Adam ran his fingers long her neck and pressed his lips into her hair. \"I love you Edynn\" He whispered as he allowed his head to slowly drift downward.

Ce n'était pas difficile de deviner duquel il s'agissait puisqu'il était assis sur le canapé du salon depuis plus d'une heure déjà. Mais c'était étrange et déroutant de découvrir à quel point les nuances entre chaque objet pouvaient être subtiles parfois. Le velours était si doux sous son toucher, et il avait tout à la fois quelque chose d'opaque, de puissant, d'imposant. Ce n'était nullement comparable à la douceur d'un voile. Il avait son opacité, il imposait sa présence dans l'espace. Là, sous ses doigts, le canapé paraissait si grand. S'était-il rendu compte en le faisant installer, de l'espace qu'il occupait ? Sûrement pas. Il ramena lentement sa main sur sa cuisse, la posant sur le tissu rêche du pantalon. Rien qu'au contact, il savait dire que le vêtement avait vécu. Cela faisait bien des années qu'il était en sa possession et le temps l'avait légèrement abimé, y imprimant son passage. Malgré cela, il ne s'en séparerait pas. Il décida de se concentrer sur un autre de ses sens sur lequel il avait encore du mal à travailler. Il tendit l'oreille à tous les bruits de la pièce mais son écoute était toujours autant perturbée par sa propre respiration. Il détestait l'entendre. Cela lui rappelait qu'il était toujours vivant, toujours présent. Obligé de prendre pied dans un univers qu'il ne voyait plus et qu'il devait s'efforcer à percevoir. S'il arrêtait, il pouvait le dire par expérience, c'était comme si le néant allait lui dévorer les entrailles et l'esprit à chaque fois. Se retrouver dans le noir complet, éveillé, c'était encore plus effrayant que le sommeil. Parce que dans ce cas très précis, il avait l'impression d'être à moitié mort, sans possibilité de revenir du côté de la lumière, ni celle de s'enfoncer du côté des ténèbres. Il stagnait sur une ligne imaginaire comme un funambule. Le gouffre sous ses pieds, il ne le voyait même pas. Et pourtant il savait à quel point il était profond et sombre. Terrifiant. Il essaya de se détacher de sa respiration, de s'en défaire, la rendant aussi lente et discrète que possible. Au-dehors, grâce à ses sens aiguisés, il pouvait entendre le vague grésillement d'un réverbère. Une voiture passa, beaucoup plus loin, certainement au coin de la rue. Le bois craqua quelque part dans la maison, dans la toiture ou à l'étage. Il y eu le hurlement étouffé d'un loup. Plus près de lui, il percevait le silence des lampes éteintes, le silence de chaque pièce, le silence de ses instruments, le silence tout autour de lui. Et au-delà, le vacarme de son cœur. Son instinct lui fit rouvrir les yeux brutalement. C'était un réflexe stupide dont il n'arrivait pas à se défaire. Pourtant il le savait. Il savait que le noir ne le quitterait plus jamais. Il entendait les battements cardiaques jusque dans ses tempes et il savait que c'était ce silence angoissant qui le faisait paniquer. Il aurait voulu combler le vide avec de la musique, mais alors il aurait voulu la mettre tellement fort qu'il n'aurait plus entendu Eve rentrer. Il entendit la porte au rez-de-chaussée, un grincement, puis son ouverture, le frottement du bois sur le sol. Il entendit les pas légers de la femme, le jet de ses gants en cuir blancs sur les siens, noirs. Rien n'avait bougé, mais tous les mouvements et les présences se lisaient autrement. Il y eu ensuite ses pas sur les marches en bois qui craquaient faiblement. Elle montait habilement les escaliers jusqu'à l'étage. Il pouvait même percevoir, s'il se concentrait mieux, le glissement de sa main sur la rambarde. Puis elle atteignit l'étage. Quelques bruits de pas dans le couloir. Il savait qu'elle le regardait. Il savait que dès qu'elle entrait dans la même pièce que lui, son regard se posait sur son être. Il pouvait presque sentir sa peau frémir, mais ne pouvoir confirmer ses pensées lui serra la gorge. Il l'entendit enlever ses chaussures. Il y eu le frottement léger du matériau contre la peau fine de sa cheville, puis de son talon. Les semelles touchèrent le sol dans un bruit sourd. Il l'entendit vaguement soupirer alors qu'elle se redressait. Même le plus petit effort ébranle la respiration, il venait de l'apprendre. Il n'y avait jamais fait attention auparavant. Mais ces derniers temps, trop de détails longtemps ignorés se dévoilaient au grand jour alors qu'il éprouvait ses autres sens. Il y eu ses pieds nu sur la moquette. Elle s'arrêta. Plus aucun son ne lui parvint jusqu'à ce qu'elle appuie sur l'interrupteur et le grésillement très discret d'une ampoule allumée lui parvint. Il l'entendit prendre sa respiration avant de parler et il ne lui laissa pas le temps de dire quoi que ce soit. « Viens… » Il tendit la main vers le vide devant lui. Il n'entendit alors plus rien, l'espace d'un instant, puis il y eut un bruit de pas léger, et il sentit de l'air passer sur la paume de sa main. Le mouvement lui échappa alors qu'il refermait ses doigts sans rien saisir. Il resta une seconde dans l'incompréhension avant qu'il ne comprenne qu'elle venait de se rapprocher beaucoup plus près de lui. Il la sentit se pencher doucement en avant et put sentir brièvement ses lèvres sur son front. Apaisé par le contact, il referma ses paupières. Il ne lui infligerait pas plus longtemps la vue du désastre de ses yeux. Il sentit la paume de ses mains se presser sur ses joues avec une délicatesse infime. Fallait-il qu'il soit privé de la vue pour apprécier autant son toucher ? Non, mais tout semblait pourtant tellement plus intense. Elle parla à voix basse, ne voulant visiblement pas le brusquer. « Comment vas-tu ? - Je suis… Fatigué. » Elle acquiesça par habitude, et en réalisant, mit des mots sur ses pensées sans trop attendre. « Oui, c'est normal. Ton corps a besoin de récupérer. » Il sentit ses doigts se promener sur sa tempe, puis sa mâchoire. Il dut se retirer de frissonner. Si le toucher était plus intense, les réactions qu'elle pouvait lui arracher l'étaient tout autant. « Ta peau va déjà beaucoup mieux. Elle ne te tire plus au visage ? » Il hocha la tête, répondant par la négative. « Et ta main ? » Il leva doucement le bras et il sentit une de ses mains quitter son visage pour reprendre contact avec ses doigts un instant après. Elle avait presque les mains froides. En même temps, elle était sortie. Combien de temps était-elle restée dehors ? Il détestait ne plus être en capacité de conduire. La savoir seule dehors, à Detroit, était une idée qui l'inquiétait et le faisait se détester. Il aurait dû être celui qui se risquait à l'extérieur, parmi les zombies. Mais il préférait affronter cela, si ça signifiait qu'il avait réussi à lui sauver la vie. Prendre le soleil à sa place en l'arrachant aux griffes d'un de leur congénère rendu fou par du sang contaminé, il n'avait pas réfléchi à deux fois. Si l'un d'eux devait quitter ce monde avant l'autre, ce serait lui. Parce qu'il savait pertinemment qu'elle serait capable de lui survivre, alors qu'il serait incapable de poursuivre seul en ce monde sans elle à ses côtés. C'était peut-être égoïste, mais chacun d'eux le savait et aucun ne pourrait énoncer l'évidence à voix haute. Il avait sa fierté, elle avait sa tristesse et sa volonté inébranlable de le protéger de ce monde extérieur qu'il craignait tant. « Ça a l'air d'aller mieux. Le dos de ta main est encore dans un sale état mais ça s'est déjà amélioré. - Mh… » Il reprit sa main d'entre ses doigts et la poussa plus loin devant lui jusqu'à rencontrer le tissu de son pantalon. Sans aucun doute, elle avait mis son pantalon blanc en sortant du lit, un peu plus tôt. Il l'avait senti se réveiller contre lui mais il n'avait rien dit et l'avait laissé partir dans le silence de la nuit qui venait de tomber. Il effleura sa hanche du bout des doigts par simple besoin de confirmer son existence devant lui, et releva la tête vers la sienne. « Qu'est-ce que tu faisais ? » Il ne put le percevoir, mais elle esquissa un mince sourire et elle écarta légèrement sa hanche de ses doigts pour glisser contre sa paume un objet métallique et froid. Il frissonna au changement de température. En appuyant son toucher avec plus d'insistance, il devina de quoi il s'agissait. Elle devança la question. « J'ai repris contact avec ton ancien receleur, expliqua-t-elle. Il a vérifié son stock plusieurs fois avant de se décider à le distribuer aux nôtres. - Au nôtres ? - Il parait qu'un anglais s'est installé il y a quelques jours à l'autre bout de la ville, avec sa fille. » Il ne savait pas si la nouvelle était bonne ou non, mais il n'avait pas véritablement envie d'y réfléchir à l'instant. Elle détailla son visage pendant qu'il repoussait un peu l'objet et retrouvait le tissu du pantalon. S'il n'avait pas soif, tant pis, elle le garderait pour plus tard. Elle abandonna la bonbonne sur le canapé sans le quitter des yeux et posa à nouveau ses mains sur son visage dans un geste protecteur et prudent. « Ouvre les yeux. » Ses doigts s'arrêtèrent sur sa hanche. Il n'avait vraiment pas envie qu'elle voit ça. Elle l'avait déjà bien trop ausculté cette semaine pour qu'il ait envie de lui infliger cela à nouveau. Il savait à quoi ressemblaient les yeux d'un aveugle. Et elle lui avait dit à maintes reprises à quel point elle aimait les siens. Non, décidément, il ne pouvait pas. Malheureusement, devant son silence, elle insista. « Adam… Regarde-moi s'il te plait. » Il serra les dents. Elle réalisa seulement à quel point ses mots avaient pu être déplacé compte tenu de la situation, mais elle ne rajouta rien. Ce fut à son amant de dire ce qu'il avait sur le cœur. « Ne me dis pas ça. - Excuse-moi… - Je suis… Je… » Sa main caressa doucement sa joue. Ses doigts à lui se refermèrent sur le tissu à nouveau. Il crevait juste de la revoir. Rien qu'une dernière fois. Il avait pu la contempler pendant des années, des siècles, cela ne semblait pas suffisant. Ce n'était jamais suffisant. Il avait l'impression d'avoir tant perdu en perdant la vue, qu'il ne pouvait pas supporter qu'on lui ait arraché la possibilité de contempler son âme sœur. Il avait l'impression qu'un poids venait d'écraser ses poumons. Malgré lui, elle put déceler sa souffrance dans les seuls traits de son visage. Elle ne lui demanda pas davantage d'ouvrir les yeux. « Cela ne change rien. - Pour moi si. » Elle eut un regard triste. Elle n'avait jamais vu son amant ainsi désemparé devant elle pour une raison autre que l'ennui ou le mal de vivre. Il pouvait y avoir tellement de raisons pour lesquels il puisse se sentir mal, mais le connaissant si bien et en se mettant à sa place, elle put deviner avant qu'il ne l'avoue, l'origine de sa détresse et de son mal. « Je ne peux plus te regarder, Eve… Tu comprends ? Je ne peux plus… - Si, Adam. Bien sûr que si tu peux. » Il n'osa pas la contredire, et de toute manière, elle ne lui laissa pas le choix. « Tu me connais par cœur. » Elle referma ses mains sur les siennes et les plaça sur sa taille, faisant un pas pour se rapprocher un peu plus de lui jusqu'à ce que ses genoux bloquent contre le rebord du canapé. Le mouvement de l'air lui fit comprendre qu'elle n'était plus qu'à quelques centimètres de son visage. Son contact soudain et le mouvement de sa taille sous la paume de ses mains le fit frémir. « Tu n'as plus qu'à me redessiner sous tes doigts… Et je sais que tu peux le faire. Tu connais ce corps mieux que personne, Adam. » Elle ne relâcha pas ses mains, en contraire, elle les serra un peu plus et les guida sur son corps sans rien attendre de lui. Sous ses doigts, il devina le cuir de sa veste blanche, flirta avec le haut de son pantalon, puis elle entraina ses mains sous le tissu léger de son haut, sur sa peau. Il eut un frisson. Quand avait-il eu un tel contact avec elle ? Ils s'étaient embrassés dans le noir de la chambre, ils étaient même allés beaucoup plus loin. Mais là, totalement dépourvu de la vue, il ne pouvait que la redécouvrir d'une autre manière. Elle le guida sur son ventre, remonta lentement sur son corps. Sa tête se mit presque à tourner. Elle était capable de le rendre fou en l'espace d'une seconde. Le pire, c'était qu'elle en était pleinement consciente. Il n'avait plus aucun secret pour elle. « Eve… - Mh ? » Il ne tenta pas de l'arrêter cependant. Elle redescendit sur sa peau et guida ses mains sur ses hanches alors qu'elle faisait un autre pas en avant, monta sur le canapé, le surplombant. Il n'avait pas à avoir peur de l'avenir, il n'avait pas à avoir peur de ne plus jamais pouvoir la regarder, car elle savait, au fond d'elle, qu'il était capable de retrouver tous ces siècles partagés gravés dans sa mémoire, et qu'elle était capable de lui prouver son amour et sa fidélité encore et encore, autant de fois qu'il aurait besoin pour ne douter de rien. Quand elle se mit à chanter, il sentit son cœur se soulever et ne put faire autrement que se concentrer sur sa voix malgré la déroute de sa peau sous ses doigts. « I've seen the world Done it all Had my cake now Diamonds, brilliant And Bel Air now Hot summer nights, mid-July When you and I were forever wild The crazy days, city lights The way you'd play with me like a child » Et alors qu'elle chantait, elle continuait à mener sa peau sur la sienne. Il frissonna davantage, enivré par sa présence aussi puissante et grisante juste devant lui. Il reprit le contrôle doucement et finit par glisser ses doigts avec aisance sur son chemisier, se défaisant de son guide. Il ne lui fallut pas longtemps avant de céder à l'envie de faire glisser ses vêtements sur ses épaules. Sous ses mains, les poumons de sa femme se soulevèrent, entrainés par la chanson. Il la débarrassa du tissu comme d'un voleur qui n'avait pas la place sur sa peau pâle et immaculée. Tout ceci lui appartenait depuis des années. Elle était sienne, et ne pas la regarder, ne plus en être capable, ne signifiait pas qu'il ne la reverrait plus jamais. Elle était là, entièrement à lui, à jamais. « Will you still love me When I'm no longer young and beautiful? Will you still love me When I got nothing but my aching soul? I know you will, I know you will I know that you will Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? I've seen the world, lit it up As my stage now Channeling angels in the new age now Hot summer days, rock 'n' roll The way you play for me at your show And all the ways I got to know Your pretty face and electric soul » Il redescendit sur sa peau, griffant faiblement sa taille au passage, et ses mains s'arrêtèrent sur son pantalon. Eve ne le priva de rien. Elle n'aurait jamais pu se refuser à lui. Elle glissa une main dans ses cheveux noirs. Adam ne put résister à l'envie irrépressible de poser ses lèvres sur sa peau, de se perdre dans son odeur, alors il embrassa la naissance de l'os de son bassin ainsi que son ventre à plusieurs reprises. Il la sentit frissonner sous ses lèvres, et il s'en sentit incroyable fier. Au diable ses yeux. Il avait donné sa vie pour l'âme qui vivait entre ses mains, et cela, il ne le regretterait jamais. « Will you still love me When I'm no longer young and beautiful? Will you still love me When I got nothing but my aching soul? I know you will, I know you will I know that you will Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful? Dear lord, when I get to heaven Please let me bring my man When he comes tell me that you'll let him in Father tell me if you can Oh that grace, oh that body Oh that face makes me wanna party He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds » Il fit glisser son pantalon sur ses hanches et une de ses mains remonta dans le dos de sa femme. Ses ongles s'y enfoncèrent sans trop d'insistance, et au gémissement qu'elle émit en fermant les yeux, il ne put résister plus longtemps. Il ne la laisserait pas terminer la chanson, mais elle lui pardonnerait, il en était sûr. « Eve. Embrasse-moi. » Il sentit les doigts de son amante se crisper dans ses cheveux sous la demande soufflée dans un soupir brûlant. L'instant d'après, elle se pencha vers lui pour l'embrasser intensément. Il frissonna sous l'assaut. Il ne désirait rien d'autre au monde que celle qui se trouvait sous ses doigts. Eve, encore et toujours, à jamais. Peu importe qu'elle l'empêche de respirer, peu importe qu'il ne pouvait plus poser les yeux sur elle, peu importe qu'il en vienne à mourir, son âme serait toujours liée à la sienne. Il répondit à ses lèvres et l'attira à lui d'un geste possessif. Elle l'aimait et l'aimerait au-delà de la mort. Il n'en doutait pas un seul instant. « Will you still love me When I'm no longer young and beautiful? Will you still love me When I got nothing but my aching soul?

It fills him to the edges of his being. Sedates the pain inside. It makes him feel as alive as his dares to allow himself to feel. For this one moment, nothing matters. Not the fear of exposure, nor the smell of the coming sunrise, nor the vision of a dying friend. Not even Eve matters in the moment. He has chosen his pray without much care. He wanted the girl because to him she seemed to be more alive. They sat there, his love and him and watched the two young lovers in their passion. The girl seemed to be consumed by her lover's lust, his need for her. He had wanted to be the girl, felt a familiarity to her in a way that he had seldom felt for one of these zombies. Blood. There is nothing but the taste of it. The rush is exquisite. He hopes this blood is pure, he convinces himself that he knows it is. The girl' pulse is slowing; the blood is coming in intervals now. He drank a lot. Too much. Suddenly he is overcome with the desire to watch Eve in her moment. He lifts himself off the girl and a second passes before he can clearly locate his own body again. Than even before he has found himself completely, his eyes spot Eve. She is sitting on the floor her head tilted back eyes closed. She is holding the boy but to Adam nothing exists but Eve. The boy is a nuisance distracting him from her. She is always beautiful when she feeds. He can never get enough, watching her. The hunger to see her is never as strong as the hunger for blood but it rivals it at times. And it has been so goddamn long since he had seen her feed, truly, as they were meant too. Eve smiles. Her fangs visible just a little. There is something childlike in her expression, something secret as well. As if the part of her that she carries within, is visible for a moment. To Adam these moments are essential. They are his way of knowing her, the real her. the secret 'her' that is true and unique and all Eve. Her eyes suddenly open and she watches him watching her and smiles her regular Eve smile. Her lover's smile. 'Are you all right darling?' 'Are you?' he echoes, suddenly worried. 'I am fine' Eve says 'I think we got lucky' 'The sun is coming up' he says. He can feel the goose bumps run down his back. Everything is more alive now, more highlighted like staring at a diamond in the sun. Eve nods silently. 'What are we going to do with them?' she asks gently stroking the boys forehead. Both are still alive, their breathing shallow, but there. He knows what he would like to do. 'Turn them' his chest tightens as he utters the words. He looks from the boy to the girl. He is half sitting up propped up by Eve's shoulder. He has long eyelashes and there are fine hairs standing alert on his arms. Adam can bet he tasted sweet. The girl is still where he left her, on the cold ground. Her head is turned, locks of think dark curls spilled all over the naked tiles. Her eyes are closed, her body displayed in an unnatural position. She does not look like she is sleeping. But Adam cannot see the girl at all. Blood is all he sees. Oh but how he wants Eve to turn them. He is almost mad with the desire or it. It is like being a child again. He turns to Eve and says it again. 'Turn them' Eve blinks at him, her eyes unfocussed still. 'You do it' she says throwing the words at him like a line that could have been left out of a novel for all the meaning it has. But to Adam it feels like his world is tilted on his head. He follows, Eve does. He has no strength to commit himself to a gesture like this. To bring these...these zombies...But these lovers are not zombies. Or no longer. They were, when they were kissing in the alleyway before the transformative power of himself and Eve touched them. Now they are in-between. A source of life, becoming death, as Adam and Eve wait for the killing sun. He has no strength to give them life again. Eve is behind him in a flash, her forehead resting against his shoulder. She is warm, the blood has made her almost feverish. 'You are ready' she whispers. He is trembling. He can feel all of the strength the blood has given him leave his body. He feels alone and unloved and lonely and pushed to a limit he always knew he had. He can't act. He can't do this. It is as if he is back home writing that one symphony, that one piece of music that he knows is in inside him but that just does not come out. He feels like he is unable to reach this far into himself and still see a way back to the survive. And the sun is coming up. 'Eve' She digs her nails painfully into his arm. 'You have always been able to do this' she says and her voice washes over him like a wave. It bring courage but it stings as well. 'Both of them?' he manages finally, her presence chokes him. Eve steps away from him and sits back on the ground hugging her knees, her expression calm, waiting. The sun is almost upon them, he can smell it in the air. He can also her the heartbeat of the girl slowing like a clock that is losing time. He bends, leaps over her again. She is cold now, the ground has taken her warmth and there is a second, a moment there where Adam is enraged enough to actually start hitting the greedy tiles. Then he sits on his knees, his eyes on his beloved as he slits open his wrist, his own blood pouring into his mouth. It tastes sour. Burning his tongue and making him grimace. Eve's eyes hold his and she reaches out to him her body swaying lightly as it reaches for him. Within her there is a strength I'll never know. It is the last thought he has as he bows to the girl and presses her lips to the open wound on his arm. At first there is nothing, she is a limp weight in his arms, her motionless, cold body mocking him in a way that pierces him throughout. But then her lips part and she finds the blood.

In truth I always work late at the clinic. Supplies are easy to get - comparatively easy - from our Western supporters, but staff are a different matter. And the local staff we train have homes and families to go to. It might as well be me. Her eyes were tired and wild and grief-stricken all at the same time. Her face was covered that night with an orange scarf in imitation of the niqab worn by some of my patients, but the cut of her shirt and leather pants told me she was not a Muslim. She looked around with a powerful gaze, seeming to take in everything at a glance. \"Can I help you?\" I asked. I realised I had spoken in English - I was tired - but before I could switch to one of the local dialects, or French which everyone seems to think the doctors should speak, she answered, \"I need... blood.\" The request was so strange and so desperate it stuck in my mind, but she pulled herself together and began again, \"I'm a nurse at a private clinic in the city. The hospital blood isn't safe, and I need to arrange a transfusion.\" \"This is a charity , \" I protested, \"People who can pay go elsewhere. We don't just...\" She handed me a roll of currency that would feed our whole caseload - and the staff - for a week. \"What type do you need?\" I asked weakly, fool that I was. \"O negative.\" I went to our store, leaving her alone in my office. I was so confused I didn't even think about theft or confidentiality - anyone with that much money to throw at me didn't need to steal my simple supplies, but I should have thought about our client files. There were two bags of the right type that would soon go out of date. I handed them over and she left the clinic. I tried to forget what I had done. I made no effort to hide the disappearance of two bags of O negative blood from the stores list, but no one noticed. The only person who paid any attention, I discovered, was me. I spent all the money on food for our patients, and a week later we were struggling again. What can I say? We were always struggling. When she reappeared, I was easily tempted. That time she had a name tag which read 'Dr Krempe', though she is no more German than I am. And she is no more a doctor than a nurse. She held out a wad of money that would pay our local staff's wages and I barely hesitated. The third time it was a young man who came. Apart from the labcoat, his clothes were dark and his was face uncovered, though he wore heavy sunglasses in the early evening. 'Dr Polidori'* said his name tag, but I'm not that stupid. I equivocated then, \"It will have to be destroyed tomorrow.\" He answered me harshly, \"We'll use it tonight,\" and again gave me enough money to buy antiretrovirals for all our HIV positive patients. When did I begin to suspect? What form did my suspicions take? I did investigate the other health care providers in the area, but I found nothing. I don't even know what I expected to find. The fourth or fifth time they came to me, I realised the woman's eyes were a different colour - more peaceful blue than lupine brown. I asked one night - it is always at night, as if the paleness of their skin cannot stand the sunlight - if she sourced blood for her patients from elsewhere? We maintain the fiction of her patients, just as we maintain the fiction of me asking for blood type. She answered, \"You can't trust the hospital here, too much contamination. No, only from you.\" There is money for medicines, there is money for training and employing local staff, there is money for outreach into the surrounding areas, for antenatal health promotion, to provide safe water for drinking and washing. We couldn't continue, now, without the untraceable influxes of cash. 'Dr Polidori' came again tonight. I had not yet closed the clinic, and in my scalpel blade and the stainless steel trolley he cast no reflection. He said nothing and behind his dark glasses, I couldn't tell if he noticed the direction of my gaze. They take the blood that will go out of date - or is out of date. They fund the saving of so many lives. In taking from me they do not endanger others. How far can you extend, \"First you shall do no harm\"? I heard the other day that the doctor who ran this clinic before me died of a massive stroke just days after arriving home in France. Too much stress out here, apparently. I'm afraid I've ended up on his road - the one paved with good intentions. *Author and personal physician to a certain \"pompous ass\". When Dr Watson didn't toss this name at Adam, it was the genesis of this story. ","Summary":" I first met the lady when I was working late at the clinic.

If this be error —white-blue fluorescent lights bruise her eyes, the stale airplane oxygen acrid in her nose and so is the blood. Blood . The human swears and she reverberates the sound. A grin curls around her sharpened teeth. She always preferred Economy. Told Adam she wanted to listen to their heartbeats, close and vibrant like so many moths. He cursed them, called them ugly and creased that beautiful brow of his. How exhausted the city is. A cardboard box under too much weight, sagging at the corners. She knows he can't bear to leave.

You always go to there.\" \"I know. That's because it's lovely. Why don't you come with me?\" \"You know why.\" \"Adam . . .\" \"Eve . . .\" Eve sighed, filling the phone line with static for a second. Adam knew she got frustrated sometimes when he refused to go places with her. \"I ran into my sister on the way out of Paris,\" she said after a moment. Adam groaned and threw his head back on the edge of the couch. \"What is she up to now ?\" Eve laughed. \"She said she was going to London with a group of friends she met in L.A.\" \"I say that she will drink at least one of them by the end of the trip–maybe all of them. I wouldn't put it past her.\" \"Adam,\" Eve chided, \"you may not like her but she is my sister.\" \"That doesn't give her the right to drink every human she sees.\" \"Darling–\" \"She's going to wind up killing herself by drinking someone's rotten blood.\" \"She isn't–\" \"I mean, she's just so fucking impulsive .

Outside was a group of young guys drinking from bottles and then throwing them at each other. He snarled and drew the curtain. \"Just some zombies being assholes,\" he sneered. Zombies were the bane of his existence, always drinking or shooting up heroin or– \"Don't let them get to you, Adam,\" said Eve. \"I just – it's so – they're so–\" He struggled to find the words. \"Sad,\" he finished lamely. \"Oh, Adam, you care so much for them,\" she murmured. \"I do not ,\" he said firmly. \"They are self-destructive and ignorant and impetuous and they throw their wonderful lives away for nothing when – I mean–\" He stuttered and came to an abrupt stop in his rambling. \"They have such beautiful things. Why can't they be happy with them?\" There was a long minute of silence. Then: \"Darling, you do care.\" Eve yawned and the bed made a creaking sound through the telephone as she stood from it. \"I have to go, my love. I'm set to meet Marlowe tomorrow, and I still need to pack.\" He looked forlornly at the ceiling and said, \"Are you to call again?\" \"Of course,\" she replied. \"Oh, and Adam – do you have enough rations?\" \"Hold on.\" He looked around the room for his flip phone (he had figured out a way to have all of the phones that were lying around his house be connected to each other), found it, and wandered downstairs to the refrigerator, smiling softly when he opened it and grabbed the silver thermos that sat on the top shelf. \"Yes, Eve. I always do.\" \"Not always . . .\" \"That was once –\" he protested. \"Three times, actually. And it was your own damn fault, too.\" Her tone softened as she added, \"But I'm happy to hear that you're taking care of yourself now.\" The fridge shut, blowing a rush of cool air at Adam. \"I love you, Eve.\" \"You, too, darling. I miss you.\" He hummed in agreement making Eve laugh before she hung up. He turned around to the kitchen table where his little glass sat, innocent and untouched since he last fed. The thermos was almost empty when he peered down into it. \"I'll have to get more,\" he muttered before pouring the last of it into the glass and tipping it into his mouth. There was a constant fog that hung about in Detroit. It slithered in between the street lights and alleys, stuffy and humid and demanding to be walked through. It made the street seem more like the smoke that rolled out of the crumbling warehouses sometimes rather than the normal black tar road. From the fog covered street, the tops of the ancient houses that dotted the sides of the road looked like dark castles from old time movies. Every now and then an odd spiral shaped something would emerge from the fog making anyone who saw it feel uncomfortable. It's a peculiar feeling, the people who passed the spiral shaped somethings said during their alcohol-induced stupor. It's the kind of feeling that you get when you don't belong somewhere. But it's the strange because it's the buildings that don't belong there, no? No, Adam thought as drove passed a group of drunken teenagers who stood in front of a house with a miniature tower on the side of it. It's more like your ignorant minds don't belong there. He hated humans. No, hate was too strong of a word. He was disappointed in them. The humans had had numerous gifts given to them over the years–a place to live on, art, technology, life –and they had wasted it all on drugs. They poisoned themselves and sat inside their houses doing nothing all day. There was a world to be discovered, diseases to be cured, people to meet, and all the zombies did all day was stick needles in their arms. He was disappointed in them. He parked his car on the grass beside his house and slammed its door angrily. His night had not been going well. First there was the group of teenagers who were high as the damn sky who had approached him when he'd left to go to the hospital. It'd taken all of his self-control not to break their necks. Then when he got to the hospital to see Doctor Watson for his blood supply, the Doctor told him that he couldn't provide Adam with the blood. Look, I'm sorry, the Doctor said, but I can't give you the blood. Now go away before someone walks in here. He'd hustled Adam from the lab, shut the door, and locked it. Adam had stormed back to his car and drove home. Damn zombies, he'd thought. He pulled of his hospital gear and threw it on the couch in the front room, then headed up the stairs into his sitting room. His raggedy robe was thrown across the couch and he put it on, tying it at his waist. A faint pang of hunger electrified his stomach as he grabbed his Michael Hedges acoustic from where it was leaning against the wall. He placed his headphones over his ears and rolled his neck. He was going to need to distract himself for the next few weeks if he was going to be without food. Making music, he decided, was the best way to do it. Adam received a phone call from Eve a week later. He was plucking at the strings of his viola, listening to the rain tap against the window, when his phone rang. He walked over to the table that was crowded with records, music sheets, guitar strings, and other miscellaneous things, and picked up the phone that was connected to a white receiver. \"Hello?\" \"Adam.\" \"Eve.\" He could hear Eve's smile through the speaker. \"Hello, darling. How are you?\" Adam sighed and picked up the receiver. \"Bored without you. There are more and more zombies coming to the house, and they interrupt my sleep and when I write my music.\" \"They're called humans, Adam.\" He groaned. \"But, Eve, you don't live with them. The bad ones, anyway. They're all drunk and in some other world. I can't even take a drive without seeing some teenager shooting up on the side of the road. I mean what the hell? They have the audacity to poison themselves in the middle of public for God's sake–\" \"Adam, please,\" Eve interrupted gently. \"What else have you been up to?\" He paced around the room, twirling the curled wire that connected the phone and the receiver in his fingers. \"I told you already: nothing much. I've written a bit, but that's nothing. What about you, love?\" \"Tangier is lovely as it always is. I still don't understand why you won't come here with me\"-Adam decided to ignore the statement-\"but I'm afraid I'm in the same predicament as you. Nothing particularly interesting has happened to me, either.\" \"Sorry.\" \"So I've decided that I want to go to Venice for a bit.\" \"Venice? We haven't been there in the last few decades . . .\" \"Yes, that's why I want to go back.\" There was a noise that filtered through the speaker that resembled that of a door being knocked upon. \"I think that's Marlowe. He's doing well, since you didn't ask. I must bid you adieu. But before I leave, I must ask: are you getting enough food?\" \"Yes, Eve.\" \"And are you feeling well?\" \"Yes, Eve.\" \"And Adam?\" \"Yes, Eve?\" \"I love you.\" \"I love you, too, Eve.\" He heard her kiss her end of the phone and the line went dead. He threw the phone on the couch and rubbed his hands over his face. Lying was something that made his mind spin for whatever reason, especially when he was lying to Eve. The truth was that he hadn't eaten in the past week and hunger was taking its toll on him. His mind tumbled a lot and his knees often felt weak. Unpleasant aches dug themselves deep in his bones and moved throughout his muscles. His insides felt knotted and made him uncomfortable. Adam promised himself that he would go see Doctor Watson next week. If hunger hadn't tightened its chains around him, that is. Adam stared down at the letter in his hands. It was written in neat cursive-black swirls on white paper. The envelope had been sealed with red wax, as if it was sent a hundred years ago, but the date on the paper said it had been sent just two months ago. He placed the letter in a small glass bowl sitting at the center of the kitchen table. Then he picked up the matchbox sitting next to it, lit two matches, and threw them into the bowl. The flame was small at first but it caught onto the paper and the white was consumed by orange and yellow. He watched the paper singe at the corners and then turn blue and finally black as it was incinerated. The words were burned, much like the letter itself, into his mind's eye. When he blinked, the swirls of black were plastered against the back of his eyelids, shining painfully bright. The opening of the letter was particularly irritating: Found this hidden in the back of the first copy of Macbeth-your favorite, I remember–and when I finally found where you had gone off to, I copied it and sent it to you. The original note was a bloody, scribbled mess, so I hope this suffices. Hope you and Eve are faring well. -Tyranny After he read that, Adam had gotten up and taken out the glass bowl from the cabinet and grabbed the matchbox off of the steps. Tyranny had been one of his and Eve's friends when they had been in a cult back in 1603 through God knew how long. Ironically enough, Tyranny was the one who had gotten thrown out of the cult first because he'd argued with the rest of the cult when they had decided to start drinking children. It was not long after that – when two of the vampires had brought back a dead child's body and demanded they drink from it – that Adam and Eve left as well. But Adam's curiosity had gotten the best of him and the letter was suddenly opened and read in under a minute. The letter was written by a woman to her lover explaining that she was never going to see him again because she was dying. Dying because she had been bitten by a demon. She told him how much she loved him, compared their love to the sky where each star stood for how many years she would wait for him, faithful and loving, so that they could be reunited someday. It was the last sentence that made Adam make the final decision to burn it. Do not seek out vengeance upon the demons that killed me, for they were simply God's gifts to Hell who were twisted until their only thoughts were to kill. The damned woman was dying, bleeding out onto the letter she was writing to her only love, and she had the audacity to tell him to take pity on the things that killed her. She had the audacity to call the monsters that half-drained her of her blood and left her to die a slow death gifts ? And why the hell would Tyranny think it was okay to send him this in the first place? He knew that Adam was the one who fed on this woman. He knew how distraught Adam had been when he'd drank this kill (because halfway through sucking the life out of her, he heard her gasp out that she was with child, and he had fled). He fucking knew . The letter was no more than a pile of ash now, sitting innocently in the bowl in middle of the table. Adam lashed out suddenly and sent the bowl flying into the wall, shattering it into a hundred tiny pieces. His insides twisted painfully as he choked on tears. His mouth watered at the thought of fresh blood, warm and sweet and smooth in his mouth, dripping down his throat and filling his aching stomach. This was not okay. This was not fucking okay. The human should not have taken pity on him. He was an animal who killed innocent people, a monster who drank blood to survive, a demon who was now crying and shaking, and God his body hurt and he felt so, so dizzy. He was not okay. Adam lay on his bed, his fist wrapped around a ball of red fabric from the blanket that was spread out on the mattress. His other hand – which was stroking his small plush rabbit – was shaking. The bones in his fingers creaked when he bent his knuckles to brush the soft fur of his stuffed animal – back and forth and back and forth. His stomach ached. Back and forth – the fur went from white to grey as his fingers lightly brushed the rabbit's neck. He wished Eve were here. Back and forth, back and forth. There was a knock at the door. He could hear people's excited but hushed voices filtering through the dark hall. The muted noise sounded more like a blaring death march to Adam than voices. He made no move to get up, just continued to lay there and feel his ribs expand when he breathed. \"Adam?\" one of the voices said – a girl. She added in a muffled whisper that made Adam involuntarily strain his ears to hear, \"I thought you said that this was where he lived.\" \"It is,\" another voice said – a boy. A couple. Adam parted his cracked and dry lips and exhaled a stream of cool air. He continued to stroke the rabbit as he debated on whether or not to answer the door. He was so weak and the door was so far . . . But if he answered it, then he would get a meal. His first meal in two weeks. He missed Eve. She would know what to do. \"Well I guess he doesn't live here. Sorry, Annie. Let's go somewhere else.\" Adam sighed as the couple left his doorstep. A potential meal had walked away. A potential kill. He promised himself a long time ago that he wouldn't kill anybody again. Zombie, he thought to himself. The word just floats around in his head, the rest of his mind concentrated on how his insides hurt with hunger. So he laid there on his bed, his shaking hand gripping the stuffed rabbit, his other hand still balled in the blanket. He laid there and breathed and felt his stomach contract in hunger and thought about how much he missed Eve. (There was a boy in dirty trousers with holes in the knees standing in a cornfield. The boy's white shirt was only half-buttoned so that it exposed his skinny shoulder and prominent collar bone. He had no shoes on, and paper-thin cuts were scattered on his shins, oozing small droplets of red. \"Marie,\" he called. A crow cawed when the boy ran past its sitting place – a particularly tall corn stalk – and took to the sky, a black dot on crystal blue. The boy ran in the cornfield for hours and hours, frantically searching and calling for this Marie. When the sun was far below the horizon and the stars had started to speckle the sky, he stopped his search and trudged back to the edge of the cornfield. The crow cawed again, and the boy looked sullenly up at it. \"Marie,\" he called for the hundredth time, his voice coming out in no more than a croak. With a sigh, he started to walk to his house that was at the top of the hill, right above the corn field. \"Jacob!\" The boy – Jacob – spun around, eyes darting in every direction to find the source of the voice – to find Marie. \"Jacob! Help!\" He sprinted back into the field, running and running, ignoring the hard husks that slapped his face and tripped him up. He fell on a sharp rock and gasped as it made a deep cut on his knee but determinedly jumped up and limped to a small, circular clearing in the middle of the field. \"Marie!\" he cried when he saw the girl who was dressed in a white silk dress. It was torn in multiple places as if she, too, had fallen many times. Her back was right up against a stalk, her eyes wide with fear. \"Jacob,\" she sobbed. \"Run, brother, run. You must go.\" \"Marie, what are you doing out here? I've been calling for you for hours and hours–\" \"Shh. I think I hear them.\" \"What–?\" But the boy felt a hand on his shoulder that made his blood run cold. He turned, slowly, slowly, until he faced a woman with white hair and a kind face. \"W-who are you?\" The woman smiled sadly at him, eyes taking in his startled expression. \"I'm so, so sorry,\" she said softly. Jacob turned back to Marie who, to his horror, was staring at a tall, lanky man with dark eyes and long, disheveled black hair. In the dark, the stranger looked more like a humanized monster taken right from one of Jacob's nightmares. He, too, had a hand on Marie's shoulder. \"Please – let my sister go,\" Jacob whispered. \"She has done nothing wrong. Just – have mercy on her. She's only eight years of age.\" The man and woman shared a long, lingering look before the man pulled his hand delicately off of Marie's shoulders. \"Go, Marie.\" Jacob felt his eyes sting. \"Go! Go! Run and don't look back.\" Marie was hesitant and slowed her steps when she was at the edge of the clearing. \"Please,\" Jacob whispered, tears streaming down his face. \"Farewell, brother. I promise to come back.\" And she bolted out of sight. Jacob felt his heart turn to lead and sink down into his stomach. His blood pounded in his veins, pulsing, pulsing, until he felt as if they might burst. He turned back to the woman. \"Are you . . . are you a demon?\" The woman shook her head and knelt down in front of him. \"You are a brave child, you know. Look at the stars with me.\" She turned her head to stare at the sky, and Jacob followed. It was as if diamonds had been thrown over a dark blanket. There were hundreds of stars in the nighttime sky, glinting and shimmering like tiny mirages. A sudden bright line streaked across the almost black backdrop. The woman beside him laughed. \"Shooting stars are my favorite.\" Jacob scolded himself for answering her so curiously. \"Why?\" \"Because they stay up high in the sky, watching everything that happens down here, and they wait and wait for the right moment where they can fall down to the Earth and see what life is like down here from a different perspective. It's quite amazing, the life of a star. An infinite amount of possibilities lies within one tiny dot in the sky . . .\" \"Eve,\" the shadowy man said quietly. Jacob took this as a sign – a sign of mercy, of death, he did not know – and suddenly felt very scared. He reached for the strange, charming woman's hand which had moved from his shoulder to hang by her side. She looked down, surprised. \"Whatever you plan to do to me, make it quick.\" He bit his trembling lower lip. \"Make me one of the falling stars, if you can. Make me see the world in a different perspective.\" \"Be gentle, Adam,\" the woman said. She looked at the boy with sad, sad eyes when he suddenly felt sharp pricks on his neck. There was the sensation of being sucked dry – his emotions, his organs, his body, his soul – before he looked at the stars again and focused on one that fell down across the sky, wishing sleepily that he could fall from the sky, too.) Adam did not remember many dreams in his long life. He remembered one that was fuzzy around the edges that had occurred when he was nearly starving a few decades ago, but he could not really recall what it was about. But what he did know was that this dream was different than the few that he'd had. It scared him to realize that he was reliving August 12th, 1709 (the date would always be a prominent one in his mind) – the day that he had drunk his first child – through his victim's point of view. Adam hated dreaming. He hated drinking humans. He hated humans. Adam stayed up all day, lying on his bed, bending his fingers, and petting his stuffed animal. He watched the sunlight slowly trickle through the frosted window of the front door to his house and pool at the bottom of his open bedroom door. The light was too bright and it burned his eyes, so he closed them. He gave a faint start when he woke up a little while later, not even realizing that he had been sleeping. Unwanted exhaustion overcame him a lot now. He thought about Eve and what she was doing in Venice right now. Perhaps sleeping, if it was light out. Or maybe, if it was night, she was sitting in a gondola, drifting through the city with an Italian guide who told her how beautiful Venice was. But she could see how beautiful Venice was on her own. She could see how anything was beautiful on her own. The sunlight was dim now, not burning Adam's eyes as much, but he let them shut again and dozed off once more. It was night when he woke up, this time because of his hunger pains. He realized then that he hadn't moved in over two days. The bed creaked a little when he sat up, slowly, mechanically, as if he were a robot. Zombie, he thought with a bitter smile that stretched his lips until he felt the skin split and identified the tang of blood. It tasted stale and was cold. It reminded him of himself. Adam's body hurt when he stood up; still, he forced himself to walk out of his room and down the hall to the small room where he kept his instruments. He crossed the room and sat down on the couch, a groan that sounded like the scrape of sandpaper against wood escaping him. He was parched and felt as if his throat were filled with sand. Swallowing was idiotic; he could barely work the muscles in his throat. His mind worked as he stared at his guitar. It wandered back to the couple who had stumbled onto his doorstep the other day. God, they smelled so good - but now they were probably on the other side of the city, lost in the crowd. He fell asleep ( again ) thinking about how, centuries ago, he had drunk goblets of blood and never thought of what it would be like to be starving. The time when Eve came back from Marseille was one of Adam's favorite memories. It had been a cloudy day and had turned into a rainy night. Adam was surprised when he saw a car pull up to the front of his house, its headlights reflecting light through the raindrop-streaked windows. He ruffled his hair with a sigh. He didn't want to deal with any humans tonight. There was a knock on the door which made Adam wince. Insufferable creatures, he thought. The floorboards creaked softly as he padded across the smooth wooden floor, his feet bare. Not insufferable creatures, he corrected himself. More like lovely, confused, ignorant, self-destructive creatures. He opened the door and his mouth went dry. Rain water dripped off of Eve's blond hair making it stick out in awkward places. Even so, Adam thought she looked beautiful. \"Eve,\" he said. Eve blinked before breaking out in a warm smile. She set her suitcase down and walked into Adam's opened arms. She wrapped her own arms around his waist, and they stood there like that for a while, his hand stroking her wet hair, the tap tap tap of the rain hitting the ground the only sound between them. He unlatched his arms from around her and reached behind his back to pull one of her gloves off of her hands and brought her cold hand up to his lips where he kissed her palm. His eyes stayed locked with her thorughout the simple ritual. A few hours later Adam found himself staring at the ceiling, his head resting in Eve's lap. He listened to her talk about Marseille with its warm nights and the magnificent Palais du Pharo. \"It rained in Marseille a few times. God, the city was beautiful at night when the rain fell,\" she said. Her eyes were bright and the corner of her lips was turned up in a half smile of delight. She loved talking about the places she went to, and Adam was more than eager to hear about them. \"Sounds lovely,\" he murmured. His hand intertwined with Eve's and his fingers traced the veins on the back of it. \"Darling, what have you been up to while I've been away?\" The concern in her voice made Adam smile a bit. She knew about his struggle with depression. \"Have you been eating?\" \"Yes. Doctor Watson has been slow with getting me the blood, though,\" Adam said with a frown. The Doctor had not been at the hospital the last time Adam had gone to see him. He didn't tell Eve that. They sat in silence before Adam asked, \"How were the zombies?\" Eve laughed. \"They were . . . human. But the French are really lovely people. They seem to care more about their . . . opportunities – the things they have – more than others, I suppose. Why don't you come with me the next time I go? You would love Marseille now. You haven't been there in forever.\" \"The last time I was there I recall lots of lights and rain - and sweet blood, I believe.\" He brushed his lips against her wrist, feeling the ever-so-slight beat of her pulse. \"Their blood was sweet, was it not? I can't quite remember.\" He couldn't remember lots of things, like when he was turned (Eve never told him who turned him; she said she saw him turn). \"It was because of the wine, I think.\" Wine was a drink that rang a distant bell in Adam's head. He sometimes remembered some sweet, dark red liquid that wasn't as thick as blood but wasn't as watery as, well, water. But he could never be sure if his memories of wine were just made up out of his imagination or if they were real. Adam had lived such a long time that it was hard to sort things out. Eve ran her fingers through his hair. \"Adam, darling, come home.\" Adam blinked, shaking his head a bit and let his free hand wander up to her face. \"I'm here,\" he said quietly. \"What troubles you?\" Eve always asked that question. \"Why can't I remember things?\" She was quiet for a moment, pondering his question. Her eyes flicked to the ceiling as if she might find the answer there. After some time she said, \"We live such long lives, Adam. All of those memories that we have, that we make, in the long years that we live – well, there's just too many. Our minds are just as fragile as the humans', I'm afraid, and even we cannot survive the tidal wave of emotions that accompanies memories. There's just too many to count, too many to hold onto.\" She paused, letting Adam mull over her words, waiting to see if he wanted to say anything. \"Too many,\" was the only thing he murmured. \"I think,\" Eve continued, \"that we subconsciously block out the memories that we do not want to hold onto anymore; the ones that cause us too much heartbreak or joy.\" \"Too much joy?\" \"Even happiness can become overwhelming.\" \"But if we block out the memories that cause us emotion, wouldn't that make us monsters? Zombies like the rest of the world?\" Eve bit her lip, choosing her next words carefully. \"We only ignore the ones that cause us too much emotion.\" And then she thought of something. \"Do you remember your parents?\" \"No,\" Adam replied flatly. He wasn't exactly sure he wanted too, either. \"They're dead,\" he added as a dark afterthought. \"Exactly. So if you remembered them, don't you think that you would be overwhelmed by grief every time you thought of them?\" \"I suppose . . .\" \"And that would be a burden that nobody wants to bear. So, you see, my point is is that some things are just too much to cope with.\" Eve looked down at Adam, tracing his jaw. He said nothing but tilted his head to one side, still staring at the ceiling. Monsters and zombies don't like to feel things, he thought. He added it to his mental book of things to dwell on later. Extreme things, he added as a hazy afterthought. \"Pick up your violin, Wolfgang, and write me something.\" Eve's voice was soothing as if she were talking to a child. Adam sat up and grabbed his violin off of the side table. He plucked the highest string and nodded. \"I do love it when you play for me.\" Adam agreed with a content sigh, feeling much like a cat with its owner. He hadn't seen Eve in the last – how long ago was it? He couldn't remember. But she was here now and that was all that mattered because he loved when she sat there, listening to him play his instruments. She was beautiful and she was his and that was all that Adam cared about. It had been two years since that day, and Adam was in the same situation. He had gathered his strength after three full days and nights of sleeping to finally get up and go to the hospital earlier that night. It hurt to walk, to push the keys into their slot in the car, to breathe. As he had made his way around the familiar disinfectant smelling building complex in his sunglasses and scrubs, he ran into a nurse who he throatily asked where Doctor Watson was. She said he was on vacation. Adam was too weak to shout or storm out of the building. Instead he slammed his hands down on the wheel of his car when he was parked in the grass near his house and groaned, \" Fuck. \" The Doctor was on goddamn vacation . He just got up and left, not even bothering to tell Adam when he was leaving or where he was going. The blood supplier was gone for God knew how long. Adam sat on the crescent shaped couch with his Jean Reinhardt guitar sitting on his thighs and his head craned over the top of the cushions, staring at the ceiling. His fingers throbbed as he strummed the Reinhardt, causing a strained sound to emanate from the instrument. He remembered when Ian had acquired it for him. It was one of the first guitars that he'd received from the kid. Ian had delivered it with a smile, practically radiating enthusiasm, for he had been absolutely honored to supply one of his idol musicians with instruments. Adam's sorrows swallowed his brain, causing his vision to blur and black to cloud the edges of his eyes. Or that might have been his hunger. The pain in his stomach was a dull ache, lessened steadily by the month of unwanted fasting that passed by in long, sleep-filled days and nights. He blinked once, twice, and his eyelids were getting heavy. Rest. He needed more rest. Just for a little while, just a doze, just– The buzzing of his doorbell woke him. (When had he fallen asleep?) It was a single buzz, so Adam assumed it was Ian. He felt around the couch until he found his old telephone between the cushions and dialed Ian's number. The human picked up. \"Adam.\" \"Ian.\" \"Hey, man. I'm outside the house–\" \"It's unlocked.\" Adam unceremoniously hung up. He could hear banging downstairs as Ian came through the door and bounded up the stairs. \"Hey.\" Ian stood in the doorway to the room with a guitar case in his hand. \"Hey,\" Adam replied, dully. One of his hands fell over his stomach and traced nonsense patterns on the tie of his robe. \"One of my guys got this,\" and here Ian held up the guitar case, \"for me. Said it belonged to Jimmy Page, and he found it in a pawn shop or something. I figured you could take a look.\" Ian walked over to Adam and set the black case down next to the table. He shrugged. \"Listen, I don't know if he was lying or not, I mean it didn't cost me much so it could be a load of bullshit, but I thought it'd just be another thing to add to your collection, you know?\" Adam said nothing in return. \"But – um – are you okay? You look kind of–\" \"What day is it?\" Adam interrupted. Ian tapped his chin and glanced down at his watch. \"The twenty-third at one in the morning,\" he said. Adam sighed. He had slept for eighty-four hours straight. When had time become so irrelevant? \"I'm fine,\" he mumbled. It was more to reassure himself rather than a reply to Ian. His muscles ached and he could practically hear Ian's blood running through his veins, and if the zombie didn't leave the house soon, Adam was definitely going to drink him. \"So I'll just take this out for you,\" Ian started, as he flipped the latches of the guitar case back. \" Stop ,\" Adam said. His voice came out suddenly sharp, causing Ian to stop his movements and look at him with wide eyes. The vampire waved his hand in an apologetic gesture and said, in a tone that was less harsh, \"Look – I really appreciate that you brought me that. I really do. But I've had a long day – some more of those rock and roll teenagers came by – and I'm tired. So if you wouldn't mind leaving that there and then leaving – I'd really appreciate it.\" Ian closed the guitar case and nodded his head. \"Yeah, yeah, I understand. Those teenagers; they're fuckin' crazy. I'll just come back when you're feeling better.\" He stood to go but stopped when he reached the doorway. \"Do you need anything?\" Adam's mind felt hazy; through the haze, one sharp thought shoved its way to the front. \"Actually, I need you to go down to the hospital and see if a Doctor Watson is in. If he is, I need you to call me immediately. Understand?\" \"Doctor Watson? Yeah, sure, I can do that.\" \"Thanks, Ian.\" The phone was going off. Adam could hear it from wherever he was (this strange, dark place that was silent and weightless), but it sounded far away, as if it were an echo in a cave. The ringing got louder and more persistent, poking Adam's dark place – bubble, almost – until he just couldn't stand it and had to find out where the hell that fucking phone was. He felt himself rise out of the darkness (his mind, he realized) and opened one of his eyes. He threw his arm out, found the phone sitting next to him, and picked it up. \"What?\" His voice was hoarse as if he had lined his throat with sandpaper. It hurt to talk. It hurt to do anything. \"Adam? You don't sound too good.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Well I was just calling to tell you that that doctor you wanted – Watson or whatever his name was – he's in. Guy just got back yesterday. Funny cause you asked about him two days ago and he arrived the next day. . .\" Ian trailed off at the end of his sentence, moving on to some other topic about a piano one of his guys found that could possibly be from 1854 or something. Adam stopped paying attention after Ian mentioned that Watson was back. \"Ian,\" he interrupted. \"And – oh, yeah?\" \"Thanks for the call. Stop by tomorrow or the next day and we can look at the Jimmy Page that you brought over the other day. I'll pay you, too.\" He tried not to sound rushed even though his hand ached from holding the phone to his ear and his hunger pains hit him with a vengeance. \"Okay. That sounds good. But listen, Adam, you don't have to pay me–\" \"I want to. I've got to go. See you tomorrow night or, um, whenever.\" Adam hung up and idiotically made an attempt to stand. He slowly, slowly, walked over to the door and then had to stand there for a few minutes to catch his breath. His legs shook and his mind felt fuzzy. The room around him spun like one of his records, around and around and around. He threw his arm out to support himself on the wall and closed his eyes. The trip to the hospital was going to take longer than he expected. Doctor Watson was rifling through some papers when Adam walked in. A grim look crossed his face when he saw 'Doctor Faust' standing behind the metal table that sat in the middle of the room. The air was heavy with tension, and the way that Adam was standing – head tilted slightly, back ram-rod straight even though it pained him greatly – made Doctor Watson shift nervously, obviously on edge about Adam's intimidating stature. \"You scared me,\" he muttered. Silence was his answer and he sighed, going over to the cooler that held the packs and bottles of blood. \"I can tell that you're mad that I left. But my boss was growing suspicious of the missing blood samples – there was a problem for a while where I couldn't replace them quick enough. It's all taken care of now so don't worry.\" He pawed through the fridge until he found the thermoses of O-Negative he usually gave to the other 'Doctor'. Adam popped open his briefcase and watched Watson as he placed five thermoses into it. With a snap , he closed it again, reached into one of his pockets to draw out a wad of cash, and threw it at the Doctor. He could feel the Doctor's eyes follow him as he took carefully paced steps (he was desperately trying not to run) out of the hospital. The car purred as he pulled out of the parking lot and onto the deserted road. His giddiness at finally having food made his hands shake and his stomach do flips. Adrenaline mixed in with what little blood ran through his veins and burned his arms and legs forming a pool of warmth low in his stomach. When he pulled into the grass near his house, grabbing the briefcase from the passenger seat and drifting over to the house, as if in a trance. The bag in his hand was heavy, and damn he could smell the blood from here . . . There was something else that he could smell. It was a familiar scent, a lovely sweet-smelling thing, which caused him to inhale and exhale slowly. The door was unlocked when Adam turned the knob, but he hardly noticed, too entranced by the strange smell. What the hell was it? Adam knew, he knew , he just couldn't place where he smelled it before because his mind was too preoccupied with opening one of the thermoses and gulping down the O-Negative. Something white caught the corner of his eye and he spun sideways to find himself face-to-face with Eve. She was leaning against the door frame, arms crossed over her chest with two suitcases on either side of her. \"You look awful,\" she stated. Then she cupped his face with her hands and quietly said, \"Darling, what have you done now?\" Those few words – that one sentence – broke Adam. He dropped his briefcase, pulled her gloves off of her hands and kissed her palms, granting her entrance. His eyes stung as he wrapped her in a hug. \"Eve,\" he whispered. \"Oh, Eve, I don't know what happened. And here you are. You've come to save me just like every other time.\" He was suddenly hit by an overwhelming wave of fatigue and collapsed in her arms. She helped him up the stairs and dragged him to the couch in his sitting room where she left him to shut the front door and retrieve his briefcase. After she returned she sat down on the table so that her knee brushed his and popped open the case, pulling out a glinting metal thermos. Adam felt his dry mouth begin to water, and he weakly reached for the thermos. Eve unscrewed the lid, handing it to him with a concerned look on her face. And he drank. He poured the whole thing into his mouth and relished in the way the sweet blood coated his aching throat and soothed his pained organs. The O-Negative was smooth and so fucking good that he didn't stop to breathe until he finished the container. He let his head fall back on the couch, mouth opening in a satisfied smile that revealed his deadly canines. His breathing was short, shallow gasps at first but slowly morphed into steady inhales and exhales. After a few minutes, Adam lifted his head to look at Eve who patiently sat on the table, legs crossed, elbows on her knees. She offered to take the now empty thermos, and he gave it to her. He ran his tongue over his cracked lips that were stained red and tasted deliciously of O-Negative. \"Now that that's over, would you mind telling me what the hell was wrong with you?\" Eve had her head tilted to one side with her lips pursed. Adam frowned. \"My blood supplier took off without telling me. The zombie just fucking up and left and I had nothing to eat for five weeks.\" \"Why didn't you tell me?\" Eve demanded. \"I called you four weeks ago and you said that everything was fine. You could have said that you were out of blood – I would've come here sooner.\" Adam laughed. \"That's why I didn't tell you,\" he rasped. \"I didn't want you to worry about me. You sounded like you were enjoying yourself.\" \"Adam,\" Eve said firmly, glaring at him. \"Eve,\" he mocked. His eyelids felt heavy. After all of those days of sleeping, he was still tired. Eve moved off the table and curled up next to him. \"Adam,\" she sighed, \"this isn't the first time you've had this problem before. You have to stop doing this to yourself. You're turning into one of the zombies that you're so – how do you put it? Disappointed in? They destroy themselves from the inside out and that's exactly what you do. You say that they aren't beautiful anymore because they're slowly killing themselves. Stay beautiful, Adam. Stay like that for me.\" \"I love you, Eve,\" Adam murmured as his eyes closed. He squeezed her hand in a reassuring way. She pressed her lips to his knuckles. (Kisses, she once said, are the strangest of things. Why's that? he asked. We press our lips to other people's skin – the soft covering that protects their bones – and we take it as an act of love. We kiss each other's faces and lips and take it as a sign of affection. But it is a sign of affection. Bodily contact can be, in some ways. Why don't we just say 'I love you' if we want to tell somebody we love them? Adam chuckled and said, Because this is so much better, before kissing her.) As he felt sleep cloud his brain, he thought about humans and what Eve said. They were animals: they killed each other and themselves for no reason; they destroyed their homes – they were terrible, terrible creatures. But they were also beautiful. With all of their flaws, there were their good qualities like the art they had made, the technology they had discovered, their stubborn attempts at finding love. They were complex things that, even after millions of years to become perfect, continued to make grave mistakes every day. And Adam thought that he did a lot of those things in his own way. He'd killed people and made attempts to kill himself. He played around with the wires that ran through his house. And he pined for Eve through thinking about her every day. Perhaps humans weren't so bad. Perhaps they could learn from their mistakes. Or perhaps Adam had fallen asleep already. ","Summary":" \"I'm going to Tangier tomorrow.\" \"Mm.

A multitude of people had all come for the same reason. Michelangelo was finally finished. The high ceilings of the Sistine Chapel had been completed only a few short days ago and now the church was holding an exhibition in honor of the artist and his remarkable work. All of the finest families from across Italy and the rest of Europe had been personally invited to take part. They now stood about the beautiful room as gentle string music and light conversation flooded the hall. The warmth of the place was oddly relaxed. Inviting. Eve wandered about the space, an oddity compared to the others about the hall. She was alone, unlike the nobles who had each come with a collection of companions. Every family, it seemed, had brought the entirety of their courts with them. Their only job appeared to be standing around their Lords and Ladies. Eve suspected that it was meant to make them appear important. She couldn't be bothered with such things. The woman looked a ghost when set against the background of richly coloured and elaborately garbed gathering. From a distance it was hard to tell where her white linen dress ended and her ivory skin began. The kirtle she wore was from the previous century, no doubt causing her to appear as a long passed phantom. The long sleeves were tight and reached to her fingertips, accentuating her thin frame. Her skirts swept the floor as she moved gracefully amongst the other guests. The backs of Eve's pale hands and long fingers brushed against the different fabrics of women's skirts and men's robes as she picked her way about the room. Information came in slow waves as the fibers touched her skin. This one was crafted in England two weeks past. That one fashioned in France little over a month ago. Another, newly sewn Rome, just for the occasion. So on and so forth. She didn't much care for the peacock-esque look that had come into fashion recently. Although she had to admit to herself that, on them, it did look wonderfully delightful. How beautiful the humans were. Eve weaved in-between the lively bodies around her, taking in their sounds and smells much in the same way someone would savor a cup of wine. She didn't usually make a habit of being amongst their kind save for when it was absolutely necessary. And in those cases she didn't have long to appreciate their splendour before it was gone. They pleased her in more ways than she could ever say. Their short, simple and yet abundantly complicated lived fascinated her endlessly. And why shouldn't they? 'Humans are capable of such beauty.' She thought to herself as she carefully watched the gathering around her, 'It's only a shame they can't be bothered to see it for themselves.' She wandered to an open space in the hall, a place that she guessed would shortly be used for dancing. There she took a moment to study the whole of the room. Soft candlelight washed over the space, setting the smiling faces of the guests in glowing shades of gold. It played off the walls, flickering, causing the room to dance in time with the gentle music. The ensemble responsible for the lovely sound consisted of about four gentlemen, all of which played varying string instruments, and a young woman who sang tenderly in Italian. The group was tucked away in one corner, out of the way of the guests. Eve had always thought it a shame that such talented individuals were seen as servants who's only purpose was to provide entertainment for their betters. She hoped one day all musicians would be recognized for the artist they were. The song ended and the ensemble fell silent for only a moment before one of their members started up again in a solo. He plucked the strings of his lute with such skill that Eve couldn't help but be staggered by the sound that flowed forward. It was unearthly, filled to the brim with feeling and spoke of a sort of longing one cannot describe through speech. She watched him, completely captivated, as his entire body worked to produce the hauntingly beautiful song. His every moment spoke of a great passion for music. He was a master working at his craft, not for the enjoyment of those around him, but for his own pleasure. Eve could see his love for what he did written across his lovely face. And in those short moments she felt herself drawn to another being in a way she hadn't known was possible. When the song ended the musician's mouth pulled into a satisfied smile. Eve was returned to the present and she suddenly remembered why she had come to the Chapel in the first place. The woman turned her attention to the heavenly depictions above. She had always had a weakness for art. She studied the seemingly endless paintings as the musicians took up another, more lively, tune. People were beginning to fill the previously empty space now, confident enough to spread out instead of clumping together. Eve ignored them. She studied the biblical works above her in awe. She recognized most of the figures from the Christian Mythology and the stories being told. It was the Book of Genesis. Their creation story. She smiled. There, just off center, was an image of Adam and Eve. She walked into something, her back lightly bumping into whatever it was. The woman jumped a little and tore her eyes from the ceiling so she could see what it was. 'It' was the musician. Apparently he had taken a leave from playing so he might also admire the ceiling. Eve smiled. \"Scusami.\" She said, her voice gentle, \"Non ho visto voi.\" The musician laughed nervously, \"Milady. Non... non, umm, parlo Italiano. I... I don't actually speak... umm. My apologise. I did not see you.\" \"It's quite alright.\" Eve reassured him, \"You're English?\" \"Very.\" He nodded, smiling at her. He stood maybe half a head taller than her and was comprised mostly of long limbs. He was clad in a simple, darkly coloured tunic and trousers which contradicted her white kirtle in a lovely sort of way. He was also (she couldn't help but notice) terribly handsome, with angular features and high cheekbones. Long, jet coloured, hair hung in loose waves to his shoulders. He was in want of shaving. Thin roughage, perhaps a day's growth, surrounded his mouth and lined his jaw. Over all he was rather agreeable. His eyes, though, were what captured her. His light gaze was direct. It wasn't the sort of stare she was used to receiving. He looked at her the way she looked at the Humans. As though she were beautiful and fascinating to him. And as she studied him, she couldn't help but feel as though she had just found something she hadn't realized had been missing. \"Adam.\" He offered her his hand. \"Eve.\" She took it, feeling his warmth against her skin, and information poured forth from his touch. 'Adam. Born 1481 in Westminster, London.' \"You play beautifully, Adam.\" She grinned at him. \"Thank you, Milady.\" He smiled and visibly relaxed. Eve opened her mouth to ask him about his music, but was cut off by a rather large and important looking man, \"You there! Musician! You are to be playing music. Not irritating the guests.\" Adam scowled, but gave the man a short bow before hurrying back towards his fellow musicians. Eve watched him as he went, her eyes taking in his shape as though she were afraid she would forget what he looked like. \"My deepest apologies, Signora.\" The man, clearly the person in charge of maintaining the help, said as he bowed to her. \"It's just occurred to me that I have not congratulated Signor Michelangelo.\" Eve told him, still watching Adam, \"Excuse me.\" She had to tear her gaze from Adam's figure as she turned away from the man who had interrupted them. She would just have to find the musician again later. The woman glided back between the ever growing crowed with a mind to get away from that unpleasantly boisterous fellow. She decided to seek out the artist she had come such a long way to see. Michelangelo was standing in the center of the room. He had a gathering of people around him, listening as he spoke of what a trying ordeal the completion of the work had been. Eve joined the dialogue and, when the time was right, offered her sincerest compliments on the piece. She spent several moments speaking with the artist, but her mind was not in the conversation. \"Vorrei sdraiarmi sulla schiena per ore la pirrura.\" Michelangelo told her in an exasperated tone. \"In realta, vi sono una meraviglia moderna.\" She said, but her attention wandered back to the musical ensemble. From across the room, Adam was staring at her as he played. A smile crept across her face when she met his gaze. His expression softened, but not for long. The man from before, the one charged with keeping the servants in order, was hovering over the collection of players. He saw the silent exchange and cuffed Adam upside the head. Eve flinched. The side of her face suddenly felt warm, as though she had been the one who was struck. The music stopped. Adam flew to his feet and stormed form the room with his lute in tow. The man called threats after him, then, turned to the staring crowed and begged their forgiveness for the interruption. Eve took the opening she had been given and offered Michelangelo her best wishes. Then, she slipped from the hall as the music started up again. Outside, the night air was cool and fresh. Eve swept along the side of the building. She could see Adam next to one of the massive columns that lined the front of the Chapel. The sight of him made her go completely still. He was leaning against the pillar, his eyes closed and his head tilted back so the moonlight kissed his face. His long, graceful fingers plucked absentmindedly at the strings of his lute. The same heartfelt and desperately lonely music from earlier filled the space around him. With his head reclined the way it was, Eve could clearly see the veins in his neck. She couldn't look away. Oh, how she wanted to feel his throat against her lips. A gentle evening breeze danced past. It was full of his intoxicating scent. Eve had to do something to distract herself. She wouldn't let him be like all the others. 'Not this one.' She told herself firmly, 'He's special.' She took a step forward and forced herself to speak, \"I'm so sorry about the way that man treated you.\" Adam's eyes opened slowly and he turned his head to look at her, \"Unfortunately, I'm rather used to it. They're all the same.\" \"I wanted to ask you,\" She took another half-step towards him, \"before, about your music. About the piece you were just playing. I've not heard it before.\" He cracked a grin, \"I should hope not, Milady. I wrote it.\" \"Such a gift.\" She folded her hands before her, \"Whatever are you doing playing here? In front of people who don't appreciate your skill?\" \"You speak as though I have a choice.\" He's smile widened and he slid down the length of the pillar until he was seated on the ground. \"Something tells me,\" Eve said sitting next to him, \"that there is more to you than first meets the eye. Tell me your story, songwriter.\" He plucked away at the instrument, playing the song once again, as he spoke, \"I was, believe it or no, the second son to a prominent English family.\" \"What happened?\" Eve pressed. Adam watched her carefully, \"Oh, my story is the same as all the rest. I wasn't happy and so I set out to try and find what I felt was missing from my life. I had romantic notions about living by my music. I didn't realize what it would be like. And now I take what work I can to keep myself from starving.\" Eve nodded slowly, \"What is it you set out to find?\" He took her in with a contemplative expression, \"That's just the problem. I don't actually know. But... for some reason... when I look at you...\" \"Yes?\" Eve raised her eyebrows a little. \"Never mind.\" He turned away. Eve was quiet for a long time before she said, \"Adam, why don't you come with me?\" \"With you?\" He looked at her in astonishment. She laughed a little, \"I know it's rather a rather strange suggestion. But anyone can see that you aren't happy here. Come with me and play for joy rather than your supper... and find whatever it is you're looking for.\" \"You can give me that?\" He sat up and leaned towards her. \"Yes. I believe I can.\" Her voice was soft, \"I don't know why, Adam, but I feel strangely drawn to you. And I think... you feel it too.\" He only stared at her. \"Come now, Adam.\" Eve touched his arm lightly, \"I've been around far too long to waste time with wondering and waiting.\" \"I don't believe in love at first sight.\" He said mater-of-factly. \"Who said anything about love?\" She laughed. Adam's cheeks flushed, a delightful pink colouring his skin, \"Then... what exactly are you suggesting?\" Eve rose to her feet and offered him her hand, \"I find you wonderfully fascinating and desire to know all I can about you. And I can see in your eyes that you want to know just as much about me. Come with me, Adam.\" \"Milady, just where would you take me?\" He asked, taking her hand and standing. She beamed at him, \"Anywhere you want to go, My English Lord.\" They stood in silence for a moment. Eve could see that his mind was working, trying to logically weigh his options. She could also see, in his eyes, the moment he decided to accept her offer. He gave her the slightest of nods. And, with a smile on her face, Eve lead Adam away from the Chapel and into the cool night.

Time had seemed to fly by up until now; the decades passing like mere seconds, then hundreds of years gone by in a whirl of endless colorful experiences. She had spanned the globe, soaking up all of it with gusto; now suddenly, inexplicably she was tired. Even being back in England on her home soil hadn't stopped the weariness she felt starting to creep into her bones or the apathetic mood beginning to take hold. It was taking longer for her to wake up each night; she found herself wanting to burrow deeper into her comfortable and safe tomb and never come out again. Her appetite wasn't nearly what it once was; she'd barely fed for a week and felt only vague hunger pangs. Was it finally time for her to meet the sun? She pondered this as she lounged languidly on the soft mossy ground of the cemetery, looking up at the sky full of countless stars. Suddenly she cocked her head to one side as she heard the faint strains of music floating on the night air. She got to her feet and leaped deftly over the wall, walking towards the sound. Eve's unfailingly keen sense of hearing led her down dark and nearly deserted streets to the source of the music. She paused in front of an elegantly designed stone mansion and crept soundlessly up to the only window on the ground floor that glowed with candlelight and peered in. A young man stood in the middle of the room playing a violin, his eyes closed in intense concentration. She guessed him to be about 25 years old, a mere boy. Pale, tall and slender, with sleek dark curls that gleamed in the candlelight. Both he and the room he stood in were dressed simply but luxuriously in fabrics that proved obvious wealth. She was surprised to find that she didn't recognize the tune he played, though she had studied every conceivable form of music from across the world over the centuries. She realized with a startled thrill that this music was entirely new; being brought up from the depths of this young man's soul and out through his fiercely flying fingers. He was exquisite. She leaned against the cool stone of the house and closed her eyes with a satisfied smile, letting the music wash over her, breathing in every glorious note. Her joie de vivre began to return. How could she even think of leaving the world when there was such beauty in it? It was almost like feeling the sun on her face again, after centuries in the dark. The sun ! Her eyes popped open with a start as she realized the sunrise was very close and if she wanted to survive it she'd have to hurry home. Reluctantly she moved from the window and rushed quickly away. The following night, she awoke alert and refreshed, knowing exactly what she wanted to do. She sang cheerfully to herself as she dressed in her most flattering garments, then headed directly to the house of the young musician. When she was still yards away from his house, an overpowering scent of fresh blood almost buckled her knees. She knew without question that the blood was the musician's. She hurried to his front door to find it wide open. The smell of his blood was stronger still and she was suddenly ravenous as if she'd hadn't fed for years instead of days. She fought to control herself when she walked further into the room and saw him on the floor, sitting upright but slumped against a settee. His right hand rested limply on his lap, a pool of blood growing around him that gushed from a long deep gash on his wrist. In addition to the cut, she could see the hand was quite obviously broken as well, his long slender fingers crushed and gnarled. A bloody knife lay on the floor beside him. When the man heard her strangled gasp, he raised his head to look at her, his face covered with still-flowing tears. Without preamble, as if he'd known her always, he moaned miserably, \"They took my VIOLIN!\" She knelt beside him, breathing heavily. \"Who did this to you? What happened?\" \"I came home and there were two thieves in here, taking my possessions. One of them was holding my violin. I begged them not to take it. I didn't care about anything else. I told them, they could strip the entire house bare, just please...PLEASE leave the violin.\" He paused and let out a jagged sob. \"They LAUGHED at me! One of them shoved me to the floor and held me down and the other one jumped on my hand to crush it. And he said, 'That's okay, lad, you won't be able to play it now anyway' and they both LAUGHED.\" He looked down at the hand hanging uselessly in his lap and sobbed broken-heartedly. She picked up the bloody knife and it took all of her willpower not to lick it clean. \"And this? Did they do this to you too?\" He shook his head and closed his eyes, resting his head back on the settee. When he answered, his voice was fainter. \"I did it myself...I don't want to live anymore, not without my music. It was everything to me.\" With gentle fingers Eve wiped away the tears rolling down his cheeks. \"Look at me,\" she commanded softly. He opened his eyes and stared at her, glumly at first, but as his eyes remained fixed on hers their expression softened. \"What if I told you that you COULD play violin again? Would you want to live then?\" \" Look at my hand...you know it's not possible-\" \"EVERYTHING is possible, if you just trust me.\" She stared into his eyes. \"Will you? Trust me?\" \"Yes,\" he breathed drowsily, his head lolling. She stroked his cheek with the back of her hand. \"Then, dear boy, you shall play the violin again. You shall play any instrument in the world that you like...now, close your eyes.\" As soon as she saw his eyes flutter closed, she picked up his bleeding, broken hand, brought it to her lips and drank. End Note: I was listening to some of Bach's Sonatas for violin as I wrote this little fic (YouTube them, they're beautiful), and although Bach came along AFTER Adam was already a vampire, I decided to make it my headcanon that Adam was composing in a similar vein before Johann was, so Bach was actually sorta/kinda stealing from Adam. Adam is a bloody little prodigy, what can I say... Also, apologies for using such modern language in a story set in the 16th century, I wrote the dialogue down as I heard it in my head and it just flows better (to me) than using more stilted formal language.

A/N- Written for this week's FFF on Tumblr. Both Adam and Tessa hated Valentine's Day, but for different reasons. Tessa hated it because she always seemed to be alone for it. Adam had been turned on Valentine's Day. Of course, back then, it had just been another February 14th. Adam had met Tessa at the bar one night, shortly after the thing with Ava had happened. Eve had stayed in Tangier after Marlowe's death, so Adam was alone. She had befriended the melancholy vampire. Adam missed having someone to talk to after what happened to Ian, so he didn't mind when the zombie girl decided to sit down next to him. That night, he had taken her back to his house and told her everything. Eight hours of watching couples being lovey dovey. Eight hours watching her co-workers get presents from their lovers. Tessa was sick of it. She wished Valentine's Day never existed. A knock at the door brought her out of her thoughts. She got up and answered it. \"Adam?\" she asked shocked. He was standing there in his usual black jeans, shirt, leather jacket, and gloves. He pulled out a bouquet of flowers from behind his back. \"I believe it's customary on this zombie holiday to present a gift to a loved one\", he said holding them out to her. \"It is, but those are wooden\", she said. \"Yes\", he said. \"And you're a vampire…\" she continued. \"Look, do you want them or not?\" he asked her. \"Yes, thank you Adam\", she said taking them from him, \"Do you want to come in?\" Adam entered her flat. \"So why wooden flowers?\" she asked him. \"I think it's stupid how zombies buy each other real flowers. They just die. These, however, last a lifetime\", he said. \"Unless you have a termite problem\", she said. That got a small smile. \"Have you fed yet?\" she asked him. Adam didn't say anything, but she could tell by his eyes. The pupil had completely covered the blue. She walked over to him and cupped his face in her hands. Adam nuzzled her wrist with his nose, breathing in her scent. \"I can't\", he said taking her hands in his. Tessa wanted to pout, but she brushed it off. \"Oh! While we're exchanging presents…\" she said. She disappeared down the hallway and came back with a guitar case. She set it on kitchen counter in front of Adam. \"Go ahead! Open it!\" she said excitedly. Adam opened the guitar case and found a Gibson, identical to the one Ava had broken. \"It's not quite as old as your other one, but I know you loved that guitar. I had a…\" she was cut off by Adam's cold lips on hers. She gave into him and kissed him back, threading her fingers in his thick black hair. Adam pulled away. Tessa's eyes fluttered open. \"What was that for?\" she breathed. \"I'm sorry\", Adam told her. \"Don't be\", she said pulling her hands from his hair. Adam's hand caught her wrist and he breathed in her scent again. \"Adam? Why did you come here tonight?\" she asked him. \"I guess I didn't want to be alone anymore\", he told her, \"I was turned on Valentine's Day, you know? I used to hate it, but if I hadn't been turned, I wouldn't have met Eve. Eve and I used to celebrate today together.

She seemed kind of...heartbroken, and I think she may have been. Here's my take on it. Enjoy, and please review:) Jenny Everdeane walked up the stairs of the brothel just as she had every Thursday evening for the past 4 years. This was the first time she'd gone to attend to The Butcher in about six weeks, though. She'd recently been recovering from having a child removed from her womb. Aside from a scar on her stomach, she had healed perfectly fine, and she was back to normal, ready to slake the lust of Bill Cutting once again. He'd taken her in when she was about 12 years old. He made her useful as 'The Butcher's Apprentice', assisting him in 'matters of impalement', which in actuality were parlor tricks intended to woo any audience The Butcher saw fit. Bill Cutting gave Jenny a place in the world. He gave her some self-worth and dignity, and for that she loved him. The Butcher had always, and would always have a special place in Jenny's heart. She knew the reality was that Bill didn't feel the same way about her, and she lived with that. She would never be Mrs. Bill Cutting, no girl ever would. But, she felt as if she had to give something back to Bill for taking care of her like he did. So, she took care of him as well. When he was wounded, she was ready with aid. When he was hungry, she had no problem making him a meal...and when he fancied the company of a woman, she always volunteered to be with Bill. And so, now, 4 years later, Jenny was 19. Being Bill's company had become a sort of regular thing for her, and she revelled in that. She loved Bill and being with him, in any way she could. She knocked on the door across the 2nd floor of the brothel. \"Come in!\" said Bill's resounding voice through the wooden door. She opened it up to find him sitting in a chair by the fireplace, smoking his pipe and scanning over a newspaper. He looked up unenthusiastically, but his mouth widened into a smile when he saw Jenny. \"Jenny! There's my girl...\" he sat back in the chair, and was silent for a moment, taking a puff on his pipe. \"Come here,\" said Bill, motioning with his index finger. He set his pipe down on the mantel above the fireplace as she walked over to him, smiling. \"I've missed you,\" she said. Bill raised a finger. \"Shh,\" he said, never looking her in the eye. He was silent, intent. He took his hand, and ran it from Jenny's navel to her collarbone. He traced her collarbone almost admiringly, his hands now moving over her shoulder and up and down her back. Bill seemed almost as if he were remembering or savoring. Finally, he brought his hands back around onto her stomach, tracing the area where the scar would be with his thumb. He sighed. \"Get out, Jen,\" he said simply, still refusing to meet her eye. Jenny was stunned. \"But, Bill! Please...please!\" she pleaded, dropping to her knees in front of his chair, and holding his hands. \"I said get the fuck out, Jen! And get off your knees! You're not some common fucking whore, you're a lady! You got that?\" he yelled down at her. Jenny just wiped her tears, and sighed a resigned sigh. \"Yes, Bill.\" She turned around and left the room immediately, intending to send another girl up in her place. \"I love you...\" she whispered so only she could hear, feeling that the only thing that made her life worth living was now being taken away. \"I love you, Bill...\" ","Summary":" A/n: I was inspired by the moment Jenny said 'he doesn't fancy girl that scarred up'.

It was a blisteringly chilly morning in March when their voyage began, America bound. They were not alone in their passage, as it seemed to Nicholas that hundreds of other families crowded onto the boat's deck. So much so that Nicholas feared the boat would surely break if any more people got on. Stacks of barrels and crates lined the docks, making the perfect resting place for birds and rats. Large nets hoisted a good majority of the cargo onto the ship, unintentionally bringing the rats with them. Men with push-carts rolled along the side of the ship, selling last-minute wares to boarding passengers for the journey. Nicholas had so wanted something warm to drink, as the chill stung him to the bone. But his father insisted that they hadn't enough money to throw away on such needless expenses. After all, he said, they would need to save their money for when they got off the boat. If they got off the boat, his mother thought wearily. Nicholas watched the sailors scurrying down ropes and ladders, and several of them took up the gangplank as the last of the passengers came aboard. It was then that he knew there was no going back. His family was leaving Ireland for good. Leaving behind his grandmother and aunts and uncles. Though young Nicholas was only four-years-old, he understood that he wouldn't likely see any of his relatives again. He watched the other Irish families, much like his own, crowd together as they waved goodbye to those on the land. Some were cheerful in spirits, and others were sobbing. Nicholas hadn't wanted to leave in the first place. Although, the decision was of course not up to him. He filed in line with his brothers and sisters, each clutching a small sack holding their clothes and a few precious belongings. Nearly all of their furniture was left behind, along with most of the children's toys and all the family's animals. Unlike most of the passengers, Nicholas's family were Protestants, and that made the difference among the others who were predominantly Catholic. His family had booked passage for America on what seemed like a whim. Though Nicholas's mother was from Belfast, his father came from Cornwall and had become involved with a group of Northern Irish who were loyal to the king. One such man in that group had been killed for taking the side of the English, and another's house was set on fire, killing him and his entire family. After that, Nicholas's father and mother had decided it was time to go. Birds squawked and screeched overhead under the unusually bright sun as Nicholas leaned over the side of the boat to look over. \"Go on,\" Nicholas could hear his father's low voice behind him as he ushered his family to move more quickly onto the deck. He took off his hat and ran a tired hand through his sweat-saturated hair. \"Pick up your feet now.\" Nicholas's mother was just behind his father, carrying two-year-old Thomas in her arms - Nicholas's only younger sibling. \"Why was I cursed to have such a brood of ungrateful little beggars?\" His father muttered, and Nicholas saw his mother's expression fall as he said this. \"Sure America doesn't need any more of your kind. Should have smothered you when I had the chance.\" Nicholas turned and stared up at his father, trying to make sense of his words. But there was no making sense of them. He and the rest of his family had become accustomed to Edward Saul's hateful ramblings. Nicholas wondered why he had married his mother in the first place, or why he had even stuck around long enough to raise Nicholas and his siblings. He was certain that without his father, the family would be a lot happier. But he was also certain that the family would also be in financial trouble if his father decided to abandon them. It was an odd paradox, but there it was. His mother, Mary-Kate Saul, set young Tommy down onto the ship so she could take a rest. Nicholas saw her sway from exhaustion, clutching the side of the boat before colliding audibly against the floor of the ship. This turned a few heads from the noise, and Nicholas's father was quick to offer his words of disgust. \"Clumsy woman!\" He roared, striking her face with the back of his hand and sending her sprawling as she cried out. All Nicholas could do was watch as his mother struggled to stand with the help of one of his older sisters, Pauline, who was the eldest at fourteen. He felt his other sister, twelve-year-old Margaret, take his hand in hers and Tommy's as she walked them toward the opposite side of the ship so they could look over the edge without feeling so crowded. Tommy was hoisted up by Margaret so he could see the water, and Margaret pointed out the different boats that were anchored in the harbor. Beth, who was nine-years-old, lifted Nicholas up for a better view of the Irish Sea, and Nicholas asked how cold she thought the water to be. \"Oh, freezing I would imagine,\" Beth replied, her red braid toppling over her shoulder as she stared down into the water. \"It's no water for swimming in, I will lay.\" \"Then I should not like to fall overboard,\" Nicholas said quietly, giving his older sister a decidedly serious expression as if in warning. Beth laughed and said she would not allow that to happen. And if he somehow did manage to do so, she would immediately dive in after him. As Beth set Nicholas back down, he turned and saw Pauline helping their mother with the carpet bags. \"You should sit down, love,\" Their mother urged Beth, placing a steady hand on the young girl's back. \"You don't look well.\" Mary-Kate Saul, who had left her own mother back in Belfast after many a sorrowful goodbye, adjusted her daughter's bonnet to shield the sun and pulled her woolen shawl tighter around her shoulders. \"I am not feeling myself at all,\" Beth mumbled as Pauline took a carpet-bag from her hands to ease her balance. \"I don't know what ails me.\" \"Do you think you are sick, Beth?\" Pauline asked, taking the back of her hand and placing it against her sister's forehead. \" rather warm.\" Nicholas watched as his mother grew quiet for a moment, looking down at the water and then back at the people on the docks. \" changed my mind. I don't want to go. It's not worth the trouble if you are ill,\" she said suddenly, beginning to turn away from the side of the ship. Pauline and Margaret stopped her, steadying her movements and speaking softly to her. Beth brought Nicholas and Tommy below decks before any more of a disturbance could be caused. The crowded quarters below the deck were crowded, dark, and filthy. It reeked of human and animal waste, and the ship rocked unsteadily, throwing people from one side to the other. Nicholas wondered when he would see the light of day next. It seemed too crowded to be sanitary, especially with the chickens and dogs running around, not to mention the rats. Margaret once awoke screaming because a rat was nesting near her hair. Water poured in from the holes in the floorboards above, drenching the cramped quarters with sea water. There were people vomiting in buckets from sickness, and babies crying so loudly that Nicholas couldn't hear himself think. Pauline sat on one of the rickety beds that were bunked one on top of the other. She held Margaret, Nicholas, and Tommy close, while their mother sat with Beth in another bed. When cholera and typhus broke out among the passengers, Beth was one of the unfortunates to catch the latter. Nicholas watched as his mother helped Beth to her feet and held a bucket for her to vomit in. He felt his stomach churn and wanted nothing more than to be the ship. Nicholas got up and slowly made his way over to his mother and older sister, pushing his way through the crowded path. His father had spent most of the voyage drunk and of no use. It seemed no one in the family knew where he was at any given time. And the boat was so rocky from the storms and so crowded with sickness that they hadn't bothered to look for him. There were men fighting over something in the corner, throwing punches at one another before both were knocked down by a gush of water that washed in from above decks. Rats and fleas were infesting the waste buckets. The groans from the children and adults alike as the boat swayed relentlessly back and forth, violently tossing passengers, made Nicholas wish they had stayed in Ireland. There was a Reverend on board who read scripture and lead the others in hymns. It seemed to do little to raise their spirits. Nicholas sat by Beth's side as she coughed non-stop, lying on the hard wooden bed in damp clothes. \"It hurts, Ma,\" she cried as their mother sat stroking her hair back. \"It hurts right here.\" She pointed to her abdomen, wincing from the pain. \"A-and me back feels like it's being poked with a knife.\" When the ship doctor examined her, he pointed out the dull-red rash on her stomach that had begun to spread down her legs. \"She has a high fever, to be sure,\" the doctor stated as Mary-Kate looked at him worriedly and then back down at her daughter. Beth began coughing a dry, hacking-like cough. \"My head aches every time I cough,\" she sobbed, holding her own head, her eyes watering. \"I have been coughing so much. Surely my head will explode.\" \"I doubt if it will come to that,\" the doctor confirmed. He looked to Mary-Kate. \"She's experiencing bodily pain, is she? Frequent nausea is typical of sea-sickness.\" \"Her forehead's all but burning,\" Mary-Kate fussed, feeling her daughter's forehead, the doctor doing the same. \"But she says she's cold as an ice box.\" \"Keep her as warm as you can,\" the doctor advised, pulling the ragged blanket back up on the girl. \"If she succumbs any further, she could become delirious.\" \"Can't we take her above decks?\" Mary-Kate asked. \"To get some fresh air and stretch her legs?\" \"No, her eyes will be too sensitive. Besides, I am sure the captain would like to contain any diseases to down here. If the crew falls ill, the ship might be in peril.\" \"Well, what can we do?\" The doctor shook his head, staring regretfully at Mary-Kate. \"Her blood pressure is too low for her to stand.\" He stood coughing slightly and covering his nose and mouth with a cloth smelling of oranges. \"The stench down here is enough to floor an ox,\" he remarked, taking his bag and hurrying back up the ladder. Beth lay in the bed, coughing and breathing ragged-like as her mother fretted and went to fetch another bundle of rags to keep her warm. Nicholas silently curled up besides Beth, snuggling against her shivering, thin form. \"Is that you, Nicholas?\" She asked in a hoarse whisper, giving a small smile as she turned to face her little brother. Nicholas looked up at her, concern in his big baby-blue eyes. \"I don't want you to be sick,\" he said quietly. \"Then I must stop immediately,\" she teased, laughing between her coughs. \"After all, I have to recover if I am to set foot in America.\" Nicholas took her larger hand in his smaller one, squeezing it and burrowing himself against her frozen body to warm her, hoping that would be enough. She died anyway. Nicholas sat up the next morning when he noticed his sister staring at him in the dim light of the day. Her eyes were wide open, her mouth closed and her muscles stiff. He felt her hand still in his, and it was colder than ever. \"Ma!\" He called, his voice shaking from the tears. \"Ma!\" In less than an hour, the Saul family was above decks, saying goodbye to Beth as her body was laid out on a narrow plank, her eyes turned shut. Each sibling placed a kiss on her cheek, Pauline and Margaret sobbing with their mother. Tommy was too little to understand that Beth was gone forever, and Nicholas couldn't find it in himself to cry as he felt his father's sober glare on his back. The Reverend stood near, reading out of his Bible as a few sailors took off their hats out of respect for the young girl. Beth's corpse was wrapped in a cloth sack, and heavy chains were placed around her legs and middle. At the Reverend's nod, the sailors dumped the body overboard, making a splash in the waves below. Nicholas walked to the edge, looking over as Beth slowly disappeared under the steady rock of the sea. Once he was alone below decks, and his family had gone to sleep, Nicholas sat in a corner and cried silently, drawing his knees toward his chest. When the ship finally docked in New York, Nicholas followed his father off the boat and onto the crowded pier. It felt refreshing to finally breathe fresh air that wasn't foul or full of disease. He looked up as nets carrying furniture and barrels were being lowered onto the docks by sailors. The sky was cloudy, and the air was damp, promising rain. Thousands of people were hurrying off the ships, pooling onto the docks and shuffling along. Pauline kept a tight grip on Nicholas's hand, her other one carrying a one of the bags. Margaret held little Tommy as their mother followed behind. Stacks of burlap sacks and barrels full of goods and imports lined the walls of the shipyards. Several ill passengers were huddled against there as well, too sick to move. Several of the dead were brought off the boats on planks, covered with cloth to hide their post-mortem expressions. The people of New York seemed to be diverse in appearance and language, something that was strange to Nicholas, having not been accustomed to seeing such vibrance of culture. Following the docks, the road was a mix of mud and cobblestone, and it was easy to step off the paved street and sink one's feet in the muck. The tenement room which was to be their new home, was only slightly more accommodating than the ship's quarters. The Saul children slept on the floor, sharing a large blanket and snuggling together for warmth. With Edward Saul taking to drink and most of the time passing out from hitting the bottle, their mother was forced to get a job in a nearby wallpaper factory. One morning, with their mother having already left for work at the crack of dawn, Edward awoke his sleeping children with a loud string of curses. He dragged Pauline up from the floor by her hair and told her to go down to the fish market to fetch breakfast. Nicholas pretended to be asleep while peaking at his father and sister through one eye, all the while staying silent. He watched as Pauline hurried to put on her dress over her nightgown and then fumbled with the laces on her boots. \"Hurry it up, you slothful hussy!\" Edward growled as Pauline quickened her pace, her hands shaking. Nicholas knew she was afraid of him, just like the rest of them were. Even their mother, it seemed, was too fearful of her husband to calm him. \"Be quick about it.\" Pauline put on her bonnet and began searching for her shawl. Edward watched her for a moment before growing impatient and stormed over. \"You ignorant, disrespectful slut!\" He yelled, grabbing her by her shoulders and throwing her against the table. She hit the table with a loud thud and fell to the floor in a crumpled heap. Nicholas didn't see her move for a while. Later that night, when it seemed everyone was asleep, Nicholas heard Pauline's whimper and cries somewhere in a further corner of the room, followed by his father's insistent hushes for her to be quiet. Not fully knowing what to make of it, he quickly closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep and not get in his father's way. He didn't want whatever was happening to Pauline to happen to him. The next morning, their mother was at the factory once again and the children were left alone. Pauline and Margaret were mending some clothes at the table while Nicholas was chasing Tommy around the room, their giggles echoing off the walls. When their father walked in, the four Saul children grew quiet. Edward stared at Pauline and shook his head, a disgusted look on his face. Pauline looked nervous, her breathing becoming more unsteady as Margaret took her hand under the table. Nicholas quieted Tommy who was still squealing cheerfully and jumping about. \"Get out of this house,\" Edward said finally, speaking to Pauline who looked up at him in terrified alarm. \"You should be working, like your mother. You are more than old enough now, and you should be making your own way. It's time you earned some money for this family. Unless you want the rest of us to go hungry and homeless, you thieving whore. Go into the town and find work.\" The rest of the children were quiet as he said this. Pauline looked from their father to her siblings. \"But what about them? I will not be able to take care of them if to be working all day.\" \"Margaret will,\" Edward responded as if it were obvious. Pauline was quiet for a moment, exchanging a look with her sister. \"I don't think Margaret can-\" \"Don't make me repeat myself,\" he interrupted, crossing his arms. \"Leave and find work, or I will throw you across my knee until you cannot sit down for a week, so help me.\" As he left the room, Pauline stared down at the clothes she had mended and then over at Margaret who looked just as astonished. Slowly, Pauline stood and began gathering her things in a small bag wordlessly. Margaret was sniffling, and Tommy simply cooed and waved his arms for Pauline to pick him up. As she stepped outside the tenement to leave, the three remaining children hurried to her side as she embraced them tightly. Margaret hugged her twice, afraid to let her go. \"Don't leave, Pauline,\" Nicholas urged, frowning up at his older sister. He was terrified that she wouldn't come back, like Beth, and he wasn't sure if he could hold in his tears this time. \"I am not leaving forever,\" Pauline said softly, kissing his hair. \"I will come back for you all. I promise.\" That goodbye was the last Nicholas would see of her for a long time. It wasn't until nearly 15 years later, when he sat waiting in his cell at the Tombs prison that he would see her again. Only this time, it was he who was telling her goodbye. It was only the beginning for young Nicholas Saul, and as soon as he was old enough to run away, he did. He had been a baker's apprentice by age eleven, but after several accounts of abuse brought on by his employer and his father at home, Nicholas had enough and decided he must make his own way in the world. It had been hard to part with young Tommy, but he knew he wouldn't survive long on the streets. Margaret, by this point, was married with a family of her own and couldn't afford to take more mouths to feed. So Nicholas found his way among the guttersnipes and street arabs in the Five Points area of the city. At age thirteen, he fell in with a gang of pickpockets and newsboys where he met his best friend for life; a fellow immigrant and runaway, his name was William Howlett. Once the majority of the gang, including the leader, was rounded up and carted away by the police to juvenile reformatories several years later, both Nicholas and William split from the dwindling gang and moved down to the Fourth Ward along the waterfront. A small gang of young toughs welcomed the friendship of these two well-accomplished pickpockets, and the leader of this gang immediately took a shining to both boys. Before long, William and Nicholas became his right-hand men, and ultimately took over leadership once the previous leader felt there was more money to be made elsewhere and moved on to join a burglary gang with criminals of notorious reputation. By age sixteen and fifteen respectively, Nicholas and William were running the most violent and murderous gang of river pirates to ever terrorize the East River, conducting the majority of their raids in the early hours of the morning. They became known as the break of day thieves, or more commonly, the Daybreak Boys. And both Saul and Howlett were the great war chiefs to be feared by all. But overtime, even the toughest and most brutal chiefs lose the battle. After all, everybody owes and everybody pays.

He had fought for his people, and what had Bill done? Henhad struck him down the thrust of a knife. His young son had lain with himnas the last breath left his body.

And Martin Scorsese does not own American history. So please comment nicely! Bill The Butcher was tired. No matter how many Irish he killed, more kept coming into the Five Points. Unlike Priest Vallon, most of them were cowards, so killing them brought no satisfaction. Half of them wouldn't even fight for the Union, for the government that let them steal the rights and freedom of honest Americans! The Butcher was tired of killing cowards who wouldn't even fight back. As he pushed open the door to his private room, he decided to have a quick tumble with pretty blonde Jenny, his most skilled pickpocket and thief. With her quick wits and elegant looks the girl could have landed a husband and left the Five Points long since, but she wouldn't leave his side. Bill admired loyalty like that. So his anger skyrocketed even higher when he saw Jenny sneaking kisses with that little weakling Amsterdam! \"Boss! How ya doin? We got – we got lots of crimes done today. We stole some bread and milk they was takin' to the colored orphanage!\" Amsterdam's hands were shaking as he dumped his daily tribute on the table. He didn't look anything like a street killer, more like a Fifth Avenue swell. Bill only kept him around because the boy somehow reminded him of Priest Vallon. The Priest was a warrior, who died a warrior's death. Unlike the whining, draft-dodging Irish scum of today, he would never have taken out his hatred on the colored. \"Get out.\" Bill didn't raise his voice, but the chopping sound of his meat cleaver smashing into the table made plenty of noise. So did Amsterdam's high-pitched scream as the blade neatly severed the last joint of his middle finger. The pretty blonde boy ran from the room faster than a black wench running from a whole mob of hate-crazed Irish. \"In the old days you would have taken his whole hand.\" Jenny's chest was heaving, but her eyes were calm and steady as she came close. \"So what's my punishment? The kissing was my idea, Bill. Amsterdam didn't have the nerve.\" \"Or the heart.\" Bill lowered his lips to Jenny's as the young pickpocket pressed herself against him, her slim white arms winding around his neck. \"I've got a job for you,\" he said. \"Huh?\" Jenny looked up, her blue eyes misty with desire. Then her face fell. \"Oh, you mean another common robbery.\" \"Not just a robbery,\" Bill told her. \"A test of loyalty and skill. If you pull this job off, I'll know I can trust you. If you fail . . .\" He gestured to the bloody cleaver still lodged in the table. \"I won't fail.\" The stunning blonde straightened her shoulders, looking Bill in the eye with a crooked half-smile. \"I'm your number one girl, Bill. Your number one thief.\" Jenny was up long before sunrise the next morning. It was going to be a sizzling hot summer day, and there was sure to be trouble in the streets if any more poor men got drafted. Jenny didn't like the war, but she didn't hold with slavery either. If only there was a way . . . But she had to keep her mind on business. Last night Bill the Butcher had nearly frightened her out of her wits, and he'd done even worse to poor noble-hearted Amsterdam. Jenny blamed herself for making Bill jealous. It was just that she got so lonely sometimes. But if she couldn't pull off this robbery she was dead. And it wouldn't matter to Bill one bit. The key thing was to get there before sunrise. The swells that lived in the old mansion would be out all night, drinking champagne and eating oysters at Delmonico's. They were entertaining some sort of countess from Europe, and she traveled with a fortune in jewels. As always, an insider in the servants' hall had left the back door open for her. Jenny could move like a cat and she could memorize a floor plan with just a single glance. She floated up the stairs and eased her way into a darkened bedroom, already counting the sparkling jewels in her mind. And then . . . \"If you're stealing jewelry, my dear, shouldn't you light the lamp? You'll want to see the valuables before you put them in your bag.\" The low voice was female, the accent cultured. \"I'm not stealing!\" Jenny jumped a mile in the air, but she was used to making up lies in a hurry. \"Me name's Betsy Flanagan, and they told me to come and dust.\" \"Why not admit the truth, dear. My good friend the Butcher sent you.\" The lady turned on the light, and Jenny gasped. Her face was beautiful, but it was whiter than snow in winter. Her shining black eyes seemed to see right into a person. She was hauntingly lovely, dressed all in black, yet Jenny had never seen a scarier sight, even in the Five Points. \"You know Bill the Butcher?\" Jenny's hand flew to her throat, her voice a squeak. She wanted to run. But if she went home to Bill empty-handed she was dead. And if she stayed in this room she felt something terrible would happen to her. \"Of course I know him. He sent you to me. Sit down, please.\" \"I don't understand. Who are you?\" A shaken Jenny sank down on the bed, unable to resist the older woman's imperious manner. Her ghostly face took some getting used to, but her voice was low and soothing. \"My name is Countess Maria Zaleska, dear. My father was Count Dracula, of Castle Dracula in Transylvania.\" \"Transylvania?\" Jenny had never heard of any such place. But her fear was starting to fade as the strikingly attractive countess sat down beside her on the bed. She was wearing perfume, and the spicy smell made Jenny feel light-headed. \"It's in Hungary. Wouldn't you like to tour Europe some day?\" Jenny nodded. \"I'd absolutely love it. But I'm dead poor.\" Countess Zaleska leaned closer, and patted Jenny on the knee. \"My old friend Bill promised to help me raise some money by selling off my jewels. Of course I'll be reporting them as stolen, since they are heavily insured.\" \"That's an old Five Points scheme!\" Jenny threw back her head and laughed, feeling safe and relaxed for the first time all day. But suddenly she felt a sharp bite of pain in her neck. And then everything went black. \"Forward, Dead Rabbits! For our fathers and our families!\" Amsterdam felt unbeatable as he led his newly-made army out into the street. This was the day he would avenge his father the Priest, and free the Five Points from the tyranny of Bill the Butcher. Of course Bill still terrified him, and his wounded hand still caused him enormous pain. But that pain was the source of his strength, combined with the loyalty of his comrades and the justice of his cause before heaven. And the love of his woman. Amsterdam hadn't seen Jenny since the Butcher cut off his finger, but he knew she would be his forever once he conquered the older man. Though she was fearless and a real high flyer, Jenny was sickened by violence and cruelty. After the Butcher was dead, the two of them would teach all the gangs of New York to live together in peace. He would be king, like his father. And Jenny would be his queen . . . The fighting got rough almost immediately, with the usual street corner boys throwing rocks and bricks at his outfit. But Amsterdam kept the rabbit on a stick waving high over his head, until he heard a cry of pain from the man beside him. \"They're aiming at me!\" cried tough Jimmy Spoils, the only black fighter in the gang. \"Those mugs are out to get me!\" \"They're out to get all of us,\" Amsterdam corrected, keeping his head up high like the Priest. \"Keep marching, Jimmy my lad. We're the Dead Rabbits. All for one and one for all!\" The rocks kept getting worse, though. And though they were all aimed at Jimmy, they hit quite a few of the other boys too. Pretty soon there were little fistfights breaking out as mobs running around at random collided with the Dead Rabbits. \"Keep back there!\" Amsterdam yelled. \"Keep back!\" He knew how to use a club, and a knife, and he cut down two or three rowdies that broke into his formation. But the formation kept shrinking. His boys kept going down. Many others were breaking off, mingling with their attackers, vanishing into a much larger mob that kept screaming things Amsterdam couldn't understand. \"Down with Lincoln! Down with the draft! Down with niggers!\" \"What the hell is going on?\" Amsterdam swung his club, smacking a twelve year old boy who stuck his knife into Jimmy's thigh. He heard the skull crack, and felt ashamed. Bill the Butcher enjoyed his work. But Amsterdam never thought he would have to fight his own to protect his own. \"Amsterdam, help me!\" Jimmy screamed, and to his horror Amsterdam saw the young black go down. Instantly his body was covered with attackers, not only men, but women and children. One old Irish woman moved faster than the rest, and gouged out one of Jimmy's eyes with his own knife. \"Damn you!\" Amsterdam swung his club with all his might, killing the old hag, scattering the rest. But the moment he looked at Jimmy's face, he knew it was all over for his friend. \"Don't fight no more,\" Jimmy whispered. \"Run, Amsterdam. The Irish have done for me. Run before they kill you too.\" \"And they say the African apes lack human intelligence.\" Still kneeling beside his friend, Amsterdam looked over his shoulder. The towering figure of Bill the Butcher loomed in the center of the street, outlined by the morning sun. He had a meat cleaver in each hand, and a butcher knife at his belt. His stovepipe hat made him look at least ten feet tall. \"I've come to kill you, Butcher,\" the young man said. He picked up Jimmy's knife, and his own club, and stood tall, knowing the Priest was looking down on him. His father's approval meant more to him than victory or life. All the other Dead Rabbits were gone, their proud heritage forgotten, their honor lost in hate-filled frenzy. \"You'll need an army to accomplish that task, my friend,\" Bill said pleasantly. \"And the only army I saw was the band of Irish who just killed Jimmy Spoils. They've been hunting blacks all morning, your Hibernian friends. They won't fight for Lincoln, but that kind of killing they can manage.\" \"That kind of killing has nothing to do with you and me,\" Amsterdam said coldly. He began the dance of warriors, circling slowly and keeping his weapons ready. \"We've got personal business. You killed my father. You killed the Monk. Now it's your turn, Bill. After you're gone, the city will belong to all the people. And Jenny will belong to me.\" Bill the Butcher smiled, the promise of death in his pale face. \"Don't be a fool, boy. The whore is dead. I sent her to the woman in black.\" Any other fighter would have been fooled, or distracted. Amsterdam didn't know the woman in black. But he knew the Butcher. \"You didn't kill her. You want her alive to see me dead. But this time you will die, and Priest Vallon's boy will win. The Priest was my father.\" If Bill was shocked by the true identity of his protegee, he didn't show it. \"One last chance, boy. Turn and run. Join your friends, and take your hatred out on women and children. Be a true Irish-American.\" \"You see this blade, butcher?\" Amsterdam nearly snapped, but smiled as he held up the bloody knife. \"This was Jimmy's knife. Now it's going into your guts, stained by black blood, driven by an Irish hand. The blood stays on the blade.\" Bill the Butcher charged, but with amazing quickness Amsterdam spun and struck. The two men fought, and all around them the city burned and hatred triumphed. \"Jenny, dear. It's time to wake up. Wake up, my love. Wake up!\" Opening her eyes in total darkness, Jenny had a strange sense that she could see everything around her. She was lying in a burial vault deep underground. Yet she felt well, her body singing with life and power. \"What have you done to me?\" When she confronted the ghostly woman in black, Jenny felt no anger, just curiosity. \"Did you kill me? Is this hell?\" \"Yes to one, and no to the other.\" The countess smiled and offered the younger woman her hand. \"Come with me, child. It's time you had your first taste of living.\" The two of them left the crypt and walked the midnight streets together. Not only was Jenny feeling more alive than ever before, but all her senses seemed immeasurably heightened. She could smell the burning flesh and hear the screams of the dying long before they saw the first bodies. Not all the victims were black, but most of them were. Jenny saw charred corpses hanging from lamp posts, and children without eyes lying in doorways. Finally they came upon a woman who was still alive, though her breasts had been hacked off and her entrails torn out. \"Please,\" the woman whispered. \"Please.\" \"You know what to do,\" the countess said. \"This is how we live.\" In the flickering light of the still-burning city her face was as cold and hard as Bill the Butcher's. Jenny had never killed anyone before. She bent over the woman, meaning to offer a squeeze of the hand, a prayer of comfort. But with the kindness done, instinct took over. Her teeth fastened on the woman's throat and she drank deeply, not stopping till satisfaction and pleasure glowed inside her. \"Oh, well done. My father would have been very pleased.\" Dracula's daughter smiled and offered Jenny a perfumed handkerchief. \"Wipe your lips, dear. You're a lady now.\" \"They kill, we live.\" Jenny clung to the older woman's arm as they walked along the street of horrors. Yet the pleasure of her first feeding did not diminish in the least. \"It's like we've become angels who feed on human misery.\" \"We bring peace to the good. We punish the wicked. There's honor in being a vampire.\" \"Ah,\" Jenny said. \"So that's what we are.\" She thought of Bill's code of honor. Vampire was just another word for killer. When they reached the main avenue they found order at last. Police and soldiers were standing guard and there was a long line of dead bodies laid out neatly for identification. Each corpse held a lighted candle in his lifeless hands. \"Say a last farewell to your friends,\" the countess said quietly. \"A ship for Europe awaits.\" \"Yes.\" Jenny accepted that she was now the older woman's property. Her new thirst made her vulnerable. She needed guidance and protection. Yet she couldn't help shedding a few last human tears when she located Bill and Amsterdam. The two of them were laid out side by side, eyes peacefully closed, as close together in death as they had been in life. Their last battle must have been over very fast. Jenny leaned closer, looking for knife wounds, but couldn't find any. A passing copper offered a few words of explanation. \"It was them navy ships, miss. They let loose and killed a score of people before they realized the riot had moved on.\" Jenny laughed softly, grateful to have escaped the horror of this violent new world. \"Poor Bill missed the chance to kill poor Amsterdam. I guess killing is all men really care about.\" \"Bill the Butcher cared about you,\" the countess said softly. \"You mean because he served me up to you like a fresh steak?\" \"Don't be a fool. The Butcher sent you to me, but it was out of love, not hate. Bill Cutting served my father honorably, like his father before him. Both the Cutting men were able to help our kind to find fresh victims, when necessity forced us to leave our native land.\" \"That's just what I expected.\" Jenny bit her lip, and turned away. She leaned her cheek on a lamppost, tears flowing. The countess reached out for her. \"You don't understand, dear. Bill wanted me to drain you just a little, enough to make you sleep and keep you safe till the trouble was over. He didn't know I'd lose control and turn you permanently.\" \"I grew up in the Five Points,\" Jenny said bitterly, staring off into the fires of the dying city. \"I know a lie when I hear one.\" \"He didn't know, my sweet.\" The countess chuckled. \"Neither did I.\" When Jenny turned around, she saw the firelight gleaming in the eyes of Dracula's daughter. This world was hell, all right. But hell was just another word for living. ","Summary":" Another Word For Living I do not own these characters.

La canicule est rude est les maladies prolifèrent par l'eau,nmême la meilleure de tout le quartier des Five Points. « Gini ! -Je me sent vraiment pas bien Am. -Je vois ça. -Laisse tomber. Tu ne pourra rien faire. Ça fait une semaine que j'ai lanmigraine on aurait du s'y attendre. -Dis pas ça ! C'est peut-être que la chaleur ! Il la prend dans ses bras et la conduit à l'intérieur de l'église toujoursnen travaux, descend dans les sous sols de l'usine sur laquelle elle a éténconstruite. Là, il fait frais mais l'air est plutôt nauséabond. Il lancouche dans leur piaule sur leur lit. Elle a la fièvre et sut abondamment.n« Je vais chercher un médecin ! Tient le coup ! -Amsterdam !! Le temps que tu le ramène il sera trop tard. J'en ais soignénmoi des grippes de ce genre. A ce stade on ne peut plus rien faire et luinles médicaments sont en rupture tu le sais. -Je t'interdit de dire ça ! !! Il sort tout de même dehors à la recherche d'un homme de science. Il finitnpar en trouver un et lui expose la situation. Mal de crâne, pertend'appétit, et forte fièvre. Le médecin le suit à travers les dédalles denl'usine pour trouver la jeune fille. Elle a encore les yeux ouverts. Maisnsans plus aucune lueur. Le médecin s'arrête en voyant son état et se met ennmouchoir sur le nez avant dans passer un à Amsterdam. « Mettez ça avant dencontracter la même infection ! -Am. /Elle lève la main sur lui. Tremblante./ Ecoute le je t'en prie. /Lenjeune homme se jette sur elle en pleurs/ Prend mes économies. Ellesnserviront plus à toi qu'a moi. /Elle esquisse un sourire puis ferme lesnyeux./ La main qu'elle avait posée sur sa joue retombe, flasque et sans vie. Lenjeune garçon dépose un dernier baiser sur ses lèvres avant de se lever versnle médecin toujours masqué. Les yeux humides, il se lève et prend lesnéconomies de Gini, les fourre dans sa poche et demande au médecin de partirnaprès lui avoir donné une pièce. « Pour le déplacement. -Toutes mes condoléances monsieur. Mais il n'y avait vraiment rien à faire. Il décide de laisser la jeune fille sur place. Les autres couloirs de cettenusine servant de catacombe aux familles ayant habité ici. Maintenant c'estnréellement un cimetière. Il rassemble ses affaire, la couvre de son drap etnsort. Laissant derrière lui tous ses amis de guerre. Maggy la tigresse, lenbriseur de crâne et bien d'autres soldats de son gang. Les lapins morts lensont définitivement. Dans la rue, il remarque que malgré ses efforts, toutnest toujours comme avant. Les irlandais et autres peuples ne sont pas plus acceptés qu'auparavant.nRien à faire. Rien. Sa décision était prise, il allait bosser. Dans unnautre quartier. En sortant, il se fit bousculer par une jeune fille à lanchevelure rousse et bouclée. Il mit la main à sa poche et remarqua que sesnéconomies avaient disparues. « Hé ! Toi ! Attend ! » Il partit, commenl'escamoteuse, dans le sens inverse de la foule et finit par la rattraper.nIl crut un moment que c'était Gini. Les même cheveux. Lorsque sa mainnrencontra son bras il tira fortement dessus pour la bloquer contre lui.n« Rend moi mon argent ! -Votre argent ? Je ne voit pas de quoi vous parlez ! Sourit-elle. Il tilt sur son visage. L'image de Maggy la tigresse luinrevient soudain. Les même yeux verts perçants. Elle n'avait pourtant pas denfille. « Oh ! Tiens Am ! J'ai appris pour Gini et je suis désolée. -Déjà ?! Qui es tu ? -Maxime. -Qui ? -Ah ! Je vois ! T'es pas au courant c'est vrai. Maxime. Le petit garçonnroux. Le petit dernier de Maggy. -Tu ? -Oui j'était une fille. Mais Maggy m'a toujours fait passer pour un mec.nC'était plus facile de vivre dans la rue en étant un garçon. Sauf qu'avecnl'âge. C'était difficile à faire croire. Sauf quand je me déguise mais bon. -Je. Je ne t'avais pas reconnu. Mais t'as quel âge ? -Je viens d'avoir 16 ans. Leurs mains étaient restées les unes dans les autres alors qu'elle luinrendait l'argent de bon c?ur. « Alors comme ça tu es escamoteuse ? -Oui. Faut bien vivre. -Apprend moi ! -N. -Je sais ! Tu travaille seule ! Mais apprend moi s'il te plait j'ai besoinnde bosser ! Tu vit toujours ici ? -Oh non ! A la mort de Maggy on nous as tous jetés dehors et on a pas eutnun rond ! On vit dans un quartier bien plus propre. Mes frères bossent cheznun forgerons irlandais et moi j'arrondit les fins de mois. -Ce serait possible d'avoir une piaule ? -Peut-être. Seulement si tu trouve à travailler. -Montre moi. Elle l'entraîne dans la foule et ils passent rapidement le quartier desnFive Points. Puis ils arrivèrent dans les quartiers huppés. Entre deux ruesnde ce genre, la rue des domestiques, très pauvres. Au même niveau que lesnFive pour certaines familles, mais mieux entretenus tout de même. « C'estnpratique parce qu'ici je suis tout près de mon butin. » Ils montèrentnensuite une espèce d'escalier de bois tellement escarpé qu'on aurait putnl'appeler échelle. « L'étage là est à nous. » En face de ce balcon unentaverne à étage elle aussi. « C'est pas trop dérangeant ça ? -Ben. Si tu veux mon avis entre la taverne, le catch et le bordel. -Ouais c'est vrai. -Tu as de la chance on a une chambre de libre ! On la loue l'hiver. -Vous vous en sortez bien. -On s'accroche. Payer le loyer est pas toujours une mince à faire avec lenbois et la bouffe. Surtout que Justin est marié et a un gosse. -Tu. t'entend bien avec sa femme ? -Pas vraiment non.. C'est une véritable sainte ! /Elle ouvre la chambre etnle fait entrer. Il s'assoit sur le lit en détaillant l'intérieur./ Ellenvoudrait que j'arrête de voler parce que je ne montre pas le bon exemplend'après elle. /Maxime sort des draps et les pose sur le lit. Puis ellens'avance vers la fenêtre pour tirer les rideaux. Le soleil s'engouffrenaussitôt dans la pièce./ Je lui ais rappelé gentiment que c'est mon fricnqui lui as payé la médecine pour son gosse ! -Elle n'as pas dut vivre dangereusement. -Ça c'est sûr. Son père était plutôt bien lotis, mais il est mort et toutnest partit à la famille. Ça t'iras ? -C'est mieux que ce que j'espérais ! Merci. -Ma chambre est en face si t'as besoin. Je te laisse le temps de trouver unnjob ! -Merci. -C'est bien parce que ma mère t'adorait Am ! La jeune fille sort de la chambre et referme la porte derrière elle.nAmsterdam se lève et range ses affaires dans l'armoire. Il y trouve lesngants griffus de Maggy. A l'intérieur, une broderie rouge sang. « A Max. »nIl les range et referme la porte. Puis, le soir il rejoint Max dans lancuisine en train de préparer une salade de légumes frais. « T'as de lanchance d'être arrivé un jour de marché toi ! -Et la femme de Justin ? -Oh. Aujourd'hui nous sommes mercredi. C'est le jour de sa réunion sur lenféminisme. Demain, elle va broder avec d'autres de ses amies et je ne tenparle pas des autres jours de la semaines. C'est moi qui fait à boufferndans cette barque. Mais bon. Au moins je mange. -Et le gamin ? -C'est Jus qui va le chercher à l'école. Marc lui finit toujours sonntravail plus tard. Ensuite les hommes et moi on va à la taverne certainsnsoirs. Je vais avec eux pour pouvoir les ramener. Madame dors avec sonnfils. Et Justin ne dit rien. -T'es un peu la boniche en gros ? -Non. Ce n'est pas moi qui fait le ménage, c'est chacun sa chambre et ellenles autres pièces. Faire à bouffer c'est pas être la boniche, c'est avoirnle pouvoir. Parce que c'est moi et Marc qui faisons les comptes et moi quinachète de quoi vivre. Elle c'est une gamine. On lui donne son argent denpoche pour ne pas qu'elle siffle tout l'argent de Justin. Tu sais quoi ?nL'amour ça rend pas aveugle, ça rend idiot. Amsterdam se met à rire et propose de mettre le couvert. Maxime lui indiquenle buffet et la belle dont on parlait il y a un instant rentre à ce momentndans l'étage, tenant par la main un petit gamin tout à fait adorable, quinlui rappelle, quand il avait son âge. Elle est grande, brune, tout à faitnmagnifique en effet, pas trop mal habillée. Elle retire ses gants et vientnfaire la bise à Max. « Dîtes moi ? Qui est cet agréable jeune homme ? -Notre nouveau locataire. Un ami. Justin lui rentre à cet instant dans la baraque. Il embrasse sa femme, sonnfils, sa s?ur et vient serrer la main à Am. « Salut vieux frère ! Chérie,nje te présente Amsterdam ! Un ami de ma mère et de Marc. -Oh. A l'époque de vos.. Histoires de gang ? -Oui. C'était le fils du chef des lapins morts. -Comme dans l'histoire que tu m'as raconté papa ? -Oui Josh. -Alors tu es un héros ! -Aller ! Finit vos histoires ! Marc arrive ! A table tout le monde ! C'est Maxime qui a arrêté toutes ces divagations. Amsterdam a l'impressionnde faire tâche devant toute cette petit famille mais Max le rassure.n« T'inquiète, ils font les parfais parce que t'es là. Demain se seranfinit... » Quand Marc est arrivé à table, Am se sentait déjà mieux. Ilnretrouva son ami avec joie et il se racontèrent leur souvenirs, devant unnbon verre de rhum agricole alors que Max partait se coucher après Justin,nMary et Josh. Ils partirent aussi au lit. Demain il se devait absolument de trouver unntravail pour ne pas abuser de leur hospitalité. Dans la rue, ce n'est pasnce qui manque ce dit -il en trouvant presque à chaque façade de boutique ound'atelier, des offres collées. Il vit Maxime sortir de l'appartement ennrevêtant un châle de demoiselle aisée. Il la fila pendant un temps. La mêmentechnique que Gini. La fausse main et la vraie qui fouille les poches. Ilnsourit doucement en voyant les gens se faire berner. Puis, elle arrivaitnchez le coiffeur. Elle y entra et en sortit une heure plus tard. Il sendemanda se qu'elle avait bien put y faire tout ce temps. Puis, il lanregarda continuer un bon bout de temps son travail de pickpocket. Puisnaccoudé à un coin de rue il la chope par le bras. « Apprend moi. -Ok. Mais demain. File moi une cigarette. Cela t'arrive souvent de suivrenles filles comme ça ? -Non. -Et pourquoi moi ? -Je veux apprendre. -Les hommes sont trop rustres pour apprendre ce genre de métier. Regarde lanfaçon dont tu m'a empoignée ! T'es incapable d'une caresse ? Mmm ? Tu veuxnapprendre hein ! Viens ! Maxime le tire par le bras et l'entraîne dans un coin plus exiguë. « Moinc'est comme ça qu'on m'a appris. » Elle le plaque contre le mur et passe sanmain dans sa poche pour en sortir portefeuille et tout le reste. Les yeuxnplongés dans les siens, passant ses mains dans son cou, le coinçant encorenplus contre la construction, un genoux entre ses jambes. Puis ellens'écarta. La chaîne de St Michel pendant à sa main. Le temps qu'il senremette de ses esprits il remarque qu'elle lui a absolument tout volé etnqu'a part quelques caresses il n'a absolument rien sentit. « Alors ? Tu esncapable de faire ça ? » Il dut bien avouer que non. Lui, quand il caressenune fille, c'est appuyé beaucoup plus fort. L'image de l'homme pickpocketnefféminé lui revint. Une main sur la hanche elle soupire. « A ta place jenne m'obstinerais pas. Aller. Je t'offre un pot. » Il fut particulièrementnsidéré de la façon dont elle l'a dissuadée de devenir escamoteur. Il finitnpar trouver un boulot chez un menuisier du coin. Max est passée le voir unnaprès midi. « Salut toi ! Alors ? Tu viens avec nous ce soir ? -Ouais avec plaisir.. -La vache ! Tu vois ! Tu as bien fait de mettre tes mains a profit dunmeuble ! Tu fais des choses magnifiques. -J'ai une surprise pour toi. Tient regarde. J'ai profité de la meule. Maggynles aiguisaient tout le temps. J'ai pensé que ça te ferais plaisir. -Oh ! Ils sont restés dans l'armoire. -Oui. -C'est très gentils merci. Elle ramasse les gans dans son sac en cuirs qui déborde de bijoux. « Oh !nça a été très lucratif aujourd'hui !!! -Ouais ! C'est pour ça qu'on va fêter ça ! -Bien. A ce soir. -Ok. Merci encore. Tu sais. C'est ton père qui les a fabriqués pour Maggy. -Ah ! Tient je ne savais pas. -Lui aussi faisait des choses extraordinaires de ses mains. -Pour moi ça a loupé. Je ne veux plus entendre parler des lapins morts. Etnencore moins de Bill. -T'inquiète. C'est de l'histoire ancienne ici aussi. -Pas sur. J'ai eut du mal à trouver du boulot à cause de ça. -Tu inspire le respect bébé. Et ça fait peur. -Bébé ? -J'appelle tout le monde comme ça. Te fais pas d'idée. La jeune fille rebrousse chemin. Sourire aux lèvres Am s'élance « Hé ! J'menfais pas d'idée !!! » Il perd vite son sourire alors que la fille de Maggyns'enfonce dans la foule. P'tain. Elle est jeune mais elle lui ressemble. Unnmélange de Maggy et de Gini. La figure sombre, il continu son boulot ennsoupirant. Gini. Il faut dire qu'en ce moment, il voit son fantôme partout.nUn coup souriante et l'autre triste. Il revoit surtout toute les nuits sonnvisage affolé alors que la faucheuse venait la lui voler. Encore un être cher disparu par sa faute. Si il s'était décidé à se rangernbien avant, elle ne serait peut-être pas tombée malade. Ils seraient sansndoute tout les deux ce soir et les autres soirs aussi. Dans la petitenpiaule que la famille de Maggy lui réserve gentiment. A faire l'amour. Ounpeut-être encore elle serait sur ses genoux pour manger à leur tablenirlandaise. Au milieu des rires le sien résonnerait. Max aurait fait unenaussi bonne salade que la veille. Et le lendemain elle aurait été escamoternensemble.. Ou alors non. Elles travaillent seules. Il s'arrête après avoir manqué de se couper les doigts dans la machine.nPréoccupé par ses pensées. Il fait défiler encore l'image de la jeunenMaxime rentrant dans la foule. Pour un peu il l'aurait encore prise pournGini. Sa main passe sur son visage. Il est l'heure. Il pose l'éponge pournse diriger vers la taverne. Après quelques verres partagés avec maxime qui ne tient pas si bien que luinl'alcool, il l'entraîne sur la table pour danser. Cela fait longtempsnqu'il n'avait pas eut cette impression d'être un peu en famille. Etnpourtant d'après Justin, il a l'air préoccupé. -Evidement idiot ! Occupe toi de ton verre et fou lui la paix bon sang ! Le rabroue Max. La petite moue qu'elle a esquissée sur son visage faitnremonter à grande vitesse une autre image de son esprit. Pratiquement lanmême se trouvait sur le visage du petit garçon roux. Le petit dernier quins'était arrêté sur Maggy pour récupérer ses gants et lui dire adieu.nC'était la dernière bataille. Elle n'avait réussit qu'a faire couler dunsang sur les Five Points. Il s'en voudrait presque d'avoir été si égoïste.nDe les avoir ré entraîné dans une guerre sans issue seulement parce qu'ilnavait besoin de régler un compte avec Bill. C'était seulement entre euxnd'un certain coté. Et sur cette pensée, il vida un troisième verre denwhisky. ","Summary":" Eté 1850. La guerre des gangs à pris fin.

The translations are after the story. \"Ní tír gan teanga.\" \"This was a right good idea,\" said Amsterdam, settling down in the dirt, fingers grasping the neck of a pilfered bottle of whiskey. Johnny slumped down next to him, head bobbing in agreement, \"Aye. I'm full of 'em, it seems.\" Amsterdam chuckled, swirling the bottle, it's amber depths seeming to shimmer in the candle light. The two young men were sprawled out in the dirt and dust, underneath the old brewery that loomed majestic over Paradise Square. Johnny had known it as a refuge these past years, but Amsterdam remembered it as home. The banner outside said it was soon to be a mission; a place for those who had put their faith in the Lord God to lead them through this land. A place of sanctuary and hope. But the only faith this heathen place had ever known had died in red snow some sixteen years ago. Here, in this very room - if one could even call it a room - was the last time Amsterdam had ever spoken to his father, before the Priest was struck down at the hands of the Butcher. Here is where Amsterdam had buried his father's blood and memory, and here is where Amsterdam had come to forget. But only for this night. \"You been stayin' here, Johnny?\" Amsterdam asked, turning half-lidded blue eyes on his friend, setting the bottle down in the space between them. Johnny sniffed, blinking dust out of his eyes, then nodded, \"Aye, from time to time. I don't much have a right place of my own, but I only stay down here when I need to keep outta sight, you know?\" Amsterdam nodded, crossing his arms and leaning back against the rock wall, staring blankly at the wall opposite them. Lost in thought. Johnny watched him for a moment, them smiled, grabbing the bottle. He held it up, eyeing it for a moment, then glanced back over to Amsterdam, raising the bottle to him, \"Sláinte chugat,\" he muttered, then took a sloppy drink. Amsterdam blinked, knitting his brow, \"'Eh?\" Johnny laughed a bit, wiping his mouth with the back of his sleeve, \"Right. You was brought here young, as I was. You wouldn't know the tongue, would you?\" Amsterdam frowned, \"The tongue? And what tongue is this?\" Johnny smiled sheepishly, handing the bottle back to Amsterdam, who all but snatched it away. The frown on his face was quickly threatening to transform itself into a pout. He hated not knowing things - being left out. That was the one things he resented his father for - never including him in the important things. \"The tongue. Our native tongue,\" Johnny said with inflection. Amsterdam stared at him blankly. Johnny laughed and rolled his eyes, \"You know, Gaeilge?\" Amsterdam blinked, his frown a bit more pronounced, \"I don't know the language. I was raised here, as were you. How do you happen to know it, then?\" Johnny shrugged, \"Me Da taught me. Said it was the only words we could use that would be the easiest kept private. Said not many folk here knew the language, unless they was kin. I expect your Da knew it, too.\" \"I expect,\" Amsterdam mumbled, bringing the bottle to his lips. He contemplated briefly, then turned back to Johnny, \"Say something' else,\" he insisted, a small smile playing about his lips. Johnny grinned, \"What shall I say?\" Amsterdam shrugged, sliding down the rocky wall to rest on his elbow, his face only inches now from Johnny's leg, \"Don't care. Whatever strikes your fancy. The words sound nice,\" he grinned, clutching the bottle close to his chest. Johnny giggled a bit, then cleared his throat, \"Ní cheileann meisce rún,\" he said, nodding to himself. Amsterdam smiled, \"What's that mean, then?\" \"That drinkin' makes a tongue more loose,\" Johnny said, snickering to himself. Amsterdam nodded, the smile faint on his lips, \"It does that.\" Johnny sighed deeply, reaching out for the bottle. Amsterdam passed it to him, glancing up at Johnny as their finger's touched, \"Johnny?\" The taller boy blinked a few times, then lowered himself to the ground with Amsterdam, \"The dust appears to be risin',\" he muttered, his face close to Amsterdam's, \"Air's better down here.\" The fact that that statement was more false than the two of them claiming to be Natives registered with Amsterdam, but his drink-addled mind dismissed it. Didn't matter. \"Johnny? Say somethin' else. Somethin' pretty,\" Amsterdam asked, laying his head in his arms. He could feel the heat from Johnny's own head close to his, and if he moved himself, he could feel Johnny's hair brush his forehead. It wasn't altogether unpleasant. \"Somethin' pretty?\" Johnny asked, laughing softly. \"Aye,\" Amsterdam said, his voice slightly defensive, \"I was locked in Hellgate for sixteen years, wasn't I? Not much pretty in there.\" He felt Johnny nod, \"All right, then. Sure I can remember a verse or two of somethin'.\" As Johnny began to speak, Amsterdam felt his eyelids flutter shut. *** Go raibh tú daibhir i mí-áidh He was running through the soft green grass, chasing an imaginary butterfly... Agus saibhir i mbeannachtaí He knew the cliff was nearby, so he should slow his pace. Go mall ag déanamh namhaid, go luath a déanamh carad The butterfly was gone, and it was nearing twilight. Ach saibhir nó daibhir, go mall nó go luath The salt tang of sea air filled his nostrils, and he was home. Nach raibh ach áthas agat There was Da. His embrace was warm and strong. Ón lá seo amach Today was the day. They were going on the boat - To sail to the new world. *** Amsterdam hadn't realized he'd been crying until he felt Johnny's fingers upon his face, pooling themselves in glistening tears. \"Amsterdam,\" Johnny whispered, looking stricken, \"I didn't mean... I'm sorry, then. I didn't mean to make you sad.\" Amsterdam sniffled pitifully, rising up to swipe at his eyes with his sleeve, bringing his face close to Johnny's, \"I'm all alone, Johnny. I ain't got no one at all,\" he whispered, the realization that his father was actually dead and gone, finally sinking in after all these years. Johnny's eyes widened slightly in surprise, and he shook his head, \"No... no, never. You got me, Amsterdam. I won't never leave you all alone.\" Amsterdam tilted his head and smiled softly at those words. He felt his heart warm as it hadn't warmed in the past score of years. \"You mean that, then?\" he whispered, a spark of hope in his eye. Johnny nodded, \"Is iomaí cor sa tsaol, Amsterdam.\" \"Aye, there is many a strange twist to life,\" Amsterdam, reaching out to clutch at Johnny's sleeve, not even realizing that the words had made sense to him, \"And this is one of them, ain't it?\" he said, meaningfully. Johnny blushed softly, lowering his eyes, \"Aye, it is... but I stick by what I said - I won't never leave you alone... Not even if you sic Hellcat Maggie on me,\" he giggled softly, looking back up at Amsterdam. Amsterdam smiled, shrugging lightly, \"Maybe later. Right now, I'd rather have you for myself.\" Johnny returned the smile and leaned in close, kissing Amsterdam softly. As Amsterdam felt Johnny's lips touch his, he swore he could hear the waves crashing on the rocky crags, on the cliff outside of his home in Ireland. END. *** Craic. Good company and good times.

I am making no money offnthis. Gangs of New York: PreludenBy Eppie Black New York City ca. 1845, The Old Brewery Tenement In one tiny crowded room of the maze that was the Old Brewery Tenement thenDead Rabbits held a council of war. Earlier in the night the nativists hadnforcibly cleared a vacant lot of its Irish squatters and burned theirnshanties. Priest Vallon realized that Cutting and his crew had been in the pay of thenlegitimate owners of the property - the Irish had indeed been therenillegally. Furthermore, to the credit, however grudging, of Bill Cuttingnthere had been no loss of life in the incident and only minor injuries. Itnwas not an encounter to go to war over. On the other hand, women and children had been terrorized, pride had beennoffended, effort wasted and much of the genuine movable property of thensquatters, much of it cherished mementos from the old country or the toolsnof skilled trade, had been destroyed. Many of the Rabbits were calling fornNative blood. Vallon was trying to redirect this understandable energy toward the problemnat hand of finding shelter for the fifty or so displaced squatters while,nat the same time not dampening the warriors' hunger for eventualnconfrontation with the Natives. He was just saying to \"Happy\" Jack Mulrahney, \"We are nothing, Jack, if notnour brothers' keepers.\" When a loud high-pitched shriek resembling that ofnthe legendary Banshee reverberated through the subterranean warrens of thenold brewery. This was followed shortly by a cheer from a chorus of mostlynchildish voices. The Dead Rabbits followed their leader out of the room to observe and/ornassist in the restoration of order. It wasn't suprising to Vallon that things had gotten out of hand. Althoughnthe Rabbits normally did a good job of keeping order inside the Old Breweryntenement; packing extra people into the already overcrowded building wasnbound to cause problems. He also was not surprised to hear the new commotion emanating from his ownnroom. Since only he and the boy shared a room that other families wouldnhave made do for six or seven, there was a lot of extra space for emergencynneeds in there that had undoubtedly filled up with displaced persons fromnthe vacant lot. As he strode commandingly down the hallway, a dark haired boy-child nearlynran into him at a breakneck speed. Stopping just in time, the boy looked upnat him and said: \"Fadder.um Misther Vallon, Sir. Your boy's fightin' a girlnand I 'tink he's losin.\"nBefore Vallon even had time to react to this statement the child resumednhis mad dash, only to be caught by McGloin who gave the child a quick slapnon the rump saying:n\"Snitchin' ain't a good survival strategy, boyo.\" The child took off again as if nothing had happened. \"Sirroco's, the Tinker's, son.\" Said McGloin, by way of explanation. \"Soft in the head.\" Added Jack Mulrhaney. .. Priest Vallon surveyed the chaos that was normally his monastically orderednroom. Children crowded the room in some sort of hysterical affray, whilenwomen, the mothers of these children, nipped at the edges of the commotion,noccasionally bringing a few of the children under control. \"Whistle, McGloin.\" The Dead Rabbit's leader ordered. McGloin, fingers in mouth whistled loud and sharp. Heads turned and voicesnstilled to see Priest Vallon standing there. The general commotion was thusnabated. Except, Vallon was disappointed to see, for.The Boy. His own boy,nwho had, it was very apparent, been right in the center of the children'snaffray after all. The Boy was pinning to the floor, by the basic expediantnof sitting on her chest, a wild red-haired girl-child who wasnconsiderably older and bigger than him. The girl struggled to either thrownhim off or to at least free her hands, to which he was holding on tight. The gang leaders stared at this odd sight for a moment. Vallon foundnhimself analyzing the situation from a tactical viewpoint. The Boy alwaysndid have a knack for using larger opponents strength against them, but thenother boy's assessment was probably ultimately correct - he couldn't keepnher hands pinned forever and once they were free she would easily be ablento turn the tables. Behind Vallon, Mulrhaney and McGloin sniggered. \"The boy's got good taste,\" Said Mulrhaney, his permanent smirk taking on anlascivious edge, \"she's awfully shiny for a kinchin-mort.\" McGloin laughed, nodded his head and added slyly, \"I think she like bein'nwhere she's at.\" Vallon decided quickly and silently to redouble his efforts to assertncontrol over the situation. \"Son,\" he said decisively. \"Get up off that girl now. That is not how younare to treat a member of the opposite sex.\"nThe boy's reply was distorted by effort and even a touch of fear. \"Father,nif I let go of her, she'll murder me dead.\" \"You bet I will.\" Growled the girl. \"I'll scratch your eyes out. Then I'llnstrangle you blue. Thief! Thief! He's a dirty little thief! He tried tonsteal my mammy's shawl right off her back!\" For some reason much of the crowd found this outburst hilarious. Vallonnlooked around to see if he could discern who was responsible for the girl.nHe concluded that her mother must be the shawl wrapped heap passed outndrunk on his own bed. He could see the boy's favorite blanket peeking outnfrom under her and that seemed to be the gist of the refutations to thengirl's charges his boy was currently loudly pleading. \"Up, both of you.\" He said to the children, grabbing both of them by theirnclothes and hauling them to their feet. The boy looked contrite. As thengirl rose, pouting, something fell from her skirts, hitting the floor withna metallic clank. The starring crowd laughed again as Vallon picked up and held for all tonsee a gold plated, inlaid silver watch with a long, fancy gold chain. Thengirl-child's frown deepened. \"It is me own dead father's watch.\" She said fiercely. \"I seriously doubt that.\" Said Vallon evenly, turning the watch so as tonpoint out the inlaid American Eagle and engraved flag-shield. \"You did take this off a Native as they routed you from your shanty, didn'tnyou?\" Vallon said, rather gently. The girl nodded, modestly, truthful this time. Vallon laughed ironically and turned to Jack Mulrhaney: \"Well those of younwanted immediate vengence should me somewhat sated.\" He said. \"If I'm notnmistaken our friend, Butcher Bill, is currently mourning the loss of hisnbest forty dollar pocket watch.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: These characters do not belong to me.

Hij kan op miraculeuze wijzen nog spreken ook. 's Ochtends en 's middags slaapt en eet hij daar, maar 's avonds komt hij uit zijn knusse holletje en gaat hij naar Veenendaal voor big business en bepaalde zaken. Dat doet Peter geheel op zijn eigen, unieke manier. Nieuwsgierig? Begin dan maar met lezen… Deel 1: Peter het sprekende Konijn en de wanbetaler Op een mooie woensdagmiddag werd Peter het Konijn wakker om 3 uur 's middags. Hij had daarvoor een lange nacht gehad en had nog een kater van de grote pullen bier die de avond ervoor in zijn kleine konijnenlijfje gegoten waren. Peter aaide met zijn zachte konijnenpootjes over zijn kleine zachte hoofdje en hopte naar zijn kastje. Dat kastje was eigenlijk een bijouteriedoos maar voor een diertje van zijn kleine formaat was dat al een flinke kast. Peter opende één van de voorste laden van de kast en wipte hier een paracetamol uit, stopte deze in zijn kleine mondje en spoelde het weg met water uit de druppelende waterleiding die dwars door zijn holletje liep. Dit was misschien niet erg sierlijk, maar zo'n watervoorziening was best praktisch, zeker voor een konijntje. Na zijn ontbijt wat bestond uit een dieet van wortelen en bier hopte Peter om 4 uur zijn holletje uit en trok zijn minuscule gemotoriseerde stepje achter zich aan wat een student aan de HTS, die hem toentertijd nog wat verschuldigd was, voor hem had ontworpen. Het stepje werkte op 2 AAA-batterijen die lang meegingen vanwege het kleine benodigde vermogen. Peter startte zijn konijnenbrommertje en racete met hoge snelheid richting de Kerkerwijk. Na een uur arriveerde hij om 5 uur precies bij de voorste linkerpaal van de Scheepjeshof, waar zijn letterlijk en figuurlijk dikke maat Bubba al geduldig op hem stond te wachten terwijl hij een dikke Oud Kampensigaar in zijn rechtermondhoek had. Peter stootte zijn brommertje tegen Bubba's schoen aan zodat deze merkte dat Peter was aangekomen. 'Goedemiddag Don Peter', zei Bubba terwijl hij Peters stepje aannam en het in zijn borstzak deed en vervolgens Peter optilde en op zijn gigantische linkerhand zette waar Peter helemaal in paste. 'Goedemiddag Bubba', antwoordde Peter. 'Zoals gewoonlijk kom ik direct terzake, wat staat er vandaag op het programma?' 'Herinner je nog die lening die we aan ene Jory Verberne verstrekten precies 30 dagen geleden?' 'Ja en ik denk dat ik al weet waar je op doelt. Hij heeft hem nog steeds niet afgelost terwijl de afspraak 20 dagen was en hij al een duidelijke waarschuwing heeft gehad, is het niet?' 'Precies, Don Peter', antwoordde Bubba emotieloos. 'We hebben hem al opgespoord en onze mannen volgen op dit moment elke beweging die hij maakt.' 'Oké dan', zei Peter. 'Laten we dan eerst maar wat gaan eten en daarna ernaartoe gaan, dan bedenk ik onder het eten wel wat ik met hem ga doen.' 'Akkoord, Don Peter.' Dus Peter en Bubba gingen naar de Brasserie waar Bubba een dubbele grote portie patat speciaal met een frikadel speciaal, een nasibal en een bamibal met bier voor zichzelf en een kinderportie patat zonder met een kleine bier met een rietje voor Peter. Hierna gingen ze naar de auto van Bubba. Bubba opende de deur en ging achter het stuur zitten en Peter sprong op de stoel ernaast. 'Don Peter, u weet dat het daar niet veilig is', zei Bubba op vaderlijke toon 'Maar ik wil hier zitten', zei Peter het konijn zeurderig. 'Don Peter, u weet dat als we een ongeluk krijgen uw kleine lichaam gelijk door de hele auto vliegt tegen de voorruit aan en er niet van u overblijft dan een bloederig uiteengespat hoopje dode konijnenpulp.' Peter zuchtte. 'Oké dan, doe het maar.' Dus Bubba pakte Peter op, opende het dashboardkastje en plaatste Peter hierin tussen de pepermuntjes, snoepjes en sigarettenpakjes. En zo reden ze Veenendaal West in terwijl Peter bij elke hobbel luid schold en vloekte vanuit het dashboardkastje. Ze stopten voor een bepaalde straat. Bubba haalde Peter uit het dashboardkastje en zette hem op de stoel naast zichzelf, naast een koffertje. 'Uw gereedschapset, meneer', zei Bubba, terwijl hij de koffer opende die vol zat met pistolen, messen en scalpels in allerlei groottes en lengtes, speciaal gereedschap en gadgets. 'Ik hou het simpel vandaag', zei Peter terwijl hij het grootste slagersmes uit de koffer pakte, een laserarmband omdeed en de koffer weer sloot. Bubba droeg Peter wederom op zijn linkerhand naar buiten en liep naar Jory Verbernes huis, waar al 2 andere gangsters stonden. Bubba vertelde Peter dat John de poort van zijn achtertuin bewaakte. 'Goedenavond Tony en Jack', zei Peter toen ze bij het huis waren aangekomen. 'Goedenavond Don Peter', antwoordden Tony en Jack in koor. Even viel er een moment van stilte. 'Waar wachten jullie nog op?', schreeuwde Peter kwaad. 'Trap die deur in!' Tony rende gelijk naar de deur en trapte deze in. Vervolgens renden Jack en Bubba naar binnen via de gang de huiskamer in, waar Jory nietsvermoedend op de bank televisie zat te kijken. Hij sprong zowat een meter in de lucht toen hij de brede Jack en de dikke Bubba de kamer in zag stormen. Hij keek beiden aan met grote, trillende ogen. 'Zo, meneer Verberne', zei Bubba relaxed terwijl hij rustig op Jory afliep. 'Je hebt nu al 30 dagen het geld geleend en we hebben nog steeds niets terugontvangen. Dat was niet de afspraak, of wel?' 'Nee, maar…' 'Zwijg!', schreeuwde Bubba terwijl hij Jory met zijn rechtervuist neersloeg. Jory belandde weer op de bank waarvan hij zojuist omhoog gesprongen was. 'Ik ga je nu één simpele vraag stellen en ik hoop dat je het juiste antwoord geeft', hervatte Bubba. 'Heb je het geld, ja of nee?' Jory keek van Bubba naar Jack en weer terug. 'Ik heb meer tijd nodig, een paar dagen', zei hij tenslotte terwijl hij weer opstond. 'Verkeerde antwoord, klootzak', zei Bubba en hij zette Peter, die met laserarmband en slagersmes gewapend was, naast Jory's been neer. 'Een konijntje?', zei Jory verontwaardigd. 'Ja een konijn', zei Peter. 'Peter het konijn.' En na deze introductie trok Peter, die op zijn achterpoten stond, zijn slagersmes naar achteren en haalde het vervolgens krachtig uit en boorde het zo in Jory's achillespees, waar het soepel ingleed, daarna door zijn bot drong en bij zijn enkel er besmeurd met bloed weer uitkwam. Peter zette een stap naar links omdat het bloed met grote druk uit zijn been spoot. Jory viel schreeuwend van de stekende pijn op de grond en Peter trok zijn scherpe mes weer uit Jory's been wat ook een pijnlijke uitwerking op hem had. 'Kutkonijn!', schreeuwde Jory terwijl hij zijn been op en neer bewoog en Peter probeerde te raken. Maar Peter was al op zijn been gesprongen en hief zijn mes met beide poten omhoog en ramde het wederom met grote kracht naar beneden en plantte zo het mes diep in het vlees van Jory's bovenbeen, dwars door de spieren en botten heen. Donker bloed liep uit de gapende wond. 'Hou op! Hou op!', kermde hij uit. Bubba en Jack stond sadistisch lachend te kijken naar de geteisterde Jory. Bubba liep op Jory af en greep hem bij zijn lurven. Bubba keek met een woeste blik in de glazige oogopslag van Jory. 'Kun je ineens plotseling geld voor me regelen?', zei Bubba kwaad. 'Of wil je verder door het leven zonder alvleesklier?' 'Ik denk', zei Jory ernstig verzwakt. 'Dat ik wel wat kan regelen.' 'Denk je het of weet je het?', vroeg Bubba op kwade, dringende toon. 'Ik weet het', zei Jory. 'Ik moet alleen even de telefoon hebben.' Bubba gooide Jory met een hand op de bank, die hij helemaal onderbloedde. De telefoon stond op een kastje naast de bank. Jory greep deze beet en voerde even een gesprek met zachte stem. Toen hij ophing zei hij tegen Bubba dat over een kwartier een maat van hem zou arriveren met het benodigde geld in contanten. 'Mooi', zei Bubba gekalmeerd. En zo lieten Peter, Bubba en Jack Jory lijdend op de bank liggen en gingen zij zelf maar in diens stoelen zitten en wat overleggen met mekaar over andere operaties. Nog geen kwartier later stond er een man bij de voordeur die door Tony naar binnen de woonkamer in werd geduwd. Deze deftig geklede heer introduceerde zichzelf als Reijer Renes en had een koffer bij zich die hij overhandigde aan Bubba. Vervolgens keek hij naar links en zag Jory liggen. Toen ging hij over de rooie. 'Oh mijn God, wat hebben jullie gedaan?', schreeuwde hij hysterisch. 'Ik ga direct een ambulance bellen.' Direct richtte Jack zijn pistool op hem. 'Waag het en sterf.' Bubba klapte het koffertje dicht. 'Het klopt helemaal', zei Bubba op rustige toon. 'Bedankt voor uw coöperatie. U bent toegestaan de ambulance bellen over vijftien minuten. Geeft u ons aan bij de politie of vertel u hen wat hier gebeurd is, wij zullen erachter komen en u vinden en dan genadeloos wraak nemen. Gesnapt? Mooi. Kom mee, Jack.' Bubba pakte Peter op en liep samen met Jack en Tony rustig en onopvallend terug naar de auto en reden in westelijke richting. Peter werd wederom in het dashboardkastje gestopt en had geen idee waar ze heengingen. Toen, na ongeveer 10 minuten, stopte Bubba abrupt de auto. 'Waar zijn we?', werd er kwaad vanuit het dashboardkastje geschreeuwd. 'Dat zult u zo zien, baas' En toen Peter uit het kastje werd getild was het eerste woord wat hij las 'Moonlight'. 'Dank je wel Bubba', zei Peter tevreden met een oprechte glimlach. 'Dat heeft u wel verdiend na een dag als deze', zei Bubba, eveneens glimlachend. En zo gingen zij met z'n vieren de populaire coffeeshop binnen en werden meteen warm onthaald. Peter rolde natuurlijk de sterkste joint van iedereen en blowde deze helemaal in zijn eentje op. En na deze geslaagde avond bracht Peters trouwe maatje Bubba Peter veilig terug naar zijn knusse, warme konijnenholletje waar Peter na een laatste slok Courvoisier vredig in slaap viel en eindelijk kon uitrusten na een inspannende doch bevredigende werkdag. Zo begaf Peter zich naar dromenland om zich voor te bereiden op het volgende avontuur. Wordt vervolgd!

DISTRIBUTION: Ask and it's yours. DISCLAIMER: Not mine. DEDICATION: To Gemma. Okay, okay - I won't let you be the only one who writes Bill! You asked, and you shall receive. Thank you Sarah for the wonderful and quick beta :) You're a doll. Every evening, Bill sharpens his knives. He has done so, by moonlight and candlelight, for countless years, and he shall continue to do so until his dying day - which may or may not come very soon. The established routine is soothing for him. A patch of calm in the whirlwind of his life. A bit of solace at the end of a harried day. The eye of the hurricane, if you will. Peace. Calm. Rhythm. Routine. Run the smaller blades along the steel sharpener. The metallic clink and ring and hiss like music to his aging ears. Arms and hands moving faster than an eye could follow - And Bill should know, having but one himself. Tonight, however, he pauses, holding up one of the smaller butcher knives. There is still pig's blood staining the mirrored steel. This blade has not been washed. Bill frowns and dunks it into a nearby bucket of water, then slides the flat sides along his bloodrust-stained apron to dry. The blood stays on the blade. A tradition amongst warriors. He never picked up on its origins, but he assumed it had to do with the ancient warriors drinking the blood of their enemies; a practice they believed would imbue them with the strength of the fallen. Or perhaps it was just a statement, written in gore. Either way, suffice to say, this slaughtered beast was not his enemy, nor was his blood worthy to stay on this knife. And so, it was cleansed. There had only ever been one blade worthy of bearing the blood of his enemy, and that very same blade had been hurled at him this very night, in a pathetic attempt to cut him down. A display of spinelessness so odious, that Bill couldn't even bring himself to kill the boy. No, he would wear his shame like a badge - and a scar. The hand that had wielded that blade flowed with the same blood that had stained the knife: Vallon. That ungrateful whelp of Irish scum wasn't worthy of such a name. Tonight, Bill sharpens his knives to keep his sanity. The routine and rhythm are a distraction. A familiarity to set his mind on. A nice place that he remembers fondly. He must not go raging into the night to cut Amsterdam Vallon down in the streets, like the counterfeit, lice-ridden dog that he is. No - he would do it with honor. The way of a warrior. He would bide his time. Wait until the boy was ready, and then call him out and finish this like men - in the streets. Ending him as he had ended the Priest; but this churl would be given no honor in death. He would carve up the boy like a side of beef, and leave his steaming carcass for the carrion birds. He would take no piece with him, for once he was done with Amsterdam Vallon, he would want no gruesome reminder to haunt the rest of his days. The boy was not worthy of such a father, nor was he worthy of Bill's affections. Not any longer. He was a lying deceiver of the lowest sort, and a coward besides. How that vile wretch could have ever been of the Priest's get, Bill would never know. Bill uses a grindstone for his cleaver, on nights when he is feeling particularly agitated. It is an exhibit of willpower. Discipline. An angry man would abuse the cleaver and press it down much too hard, grinding the blade to powder. But not Bill. His hand is steady, even as the white-hot anger courses through him. He is calm and keen-edged, just as his weapon of choice must be. Tonight he imagines grinding Amsterdam's face into a mess of raw and bloody tissue. White bone and sinew. Grey matter and fluid. He would steep his hands in it, and they would not be washed clean. Bill despises himself for being deceived. He starts to feel his age. His senses have failed him, and he sets his teeth, eyes flashing dangerously in the dim light. There were times when Bill regarded Amsterdam as fondly as he would his own flesh and blood. As close to a son as the scum could have ever hoped to be. Bill should have known better. He should have learned his lesson in Jenny. You children will always turn on you. Especially when they're a second-rate pick-pocket whore, and a revengeful, shit-licking, waste of space Mick. So, Bill estimates that half of his anger is turned towards himself for being so swindled. But, soon it won't matter. Soon it will be over and done with. Bill finds tranquility in the action of honing his blades, but finality and conclusion in sheathing them and sliding them into his belt. Each to their proper place. Fitted and secure. It is the ending of a day. The ceasing of rhythm, and then he can rest. But one of these blades shall not be stowed away this night. The next place it will be sheathed is in the gut of Amsterdam Vallon. This is a kill. Tonight, Bill does not find peace. His knows that his mind will rest only when he has destroyed the boy who has set out to cut him down. Or, if he should fail and the boy does best him... well... either way, Bill's mind will be at rest. And then the calm. END. ","Summary":" TITLE: Inveterate. AUTHOR: Collie.

The only character that belongs to me is Ian. AN: This is my first time trying this. All I ask is to go easy on me in your reviews. Thanks ;-) After the cannons blasted the 5 Points all to hell, and the dust covered like fog, I lay by what was left of a fence. I had been hurled about three to five feet from where I was standing with the Dead Rabbits and back first into that fence. I stayed there as if I were dead when I heard the muskets going off. Being fired by the traitors that had joined the army once they got here. Can't believe they fired on their own people just because that's what they were told to do and they can't think for themselves. In the dusty fog I saw the butcher and Amsterdam. Bill took a crouching position and charged at Amsterdam and sliced the back of his knee. I tried to shout out to Amsterdam to warn him but the shockwave of the cannons rendered me unable to do so. I heard Amsterdam cry out once more. I knew Bill had sliced him again. I at first had lost feeling in me body. But now I suddenly feel me legs and arms again and realize where I be. Now at the current I'm able to stand. I see a piece of the fence, sharp and curved; I pick it up and wait for Bill to charge at Amsterdam again. He had just cut Amsterdam's shoulder and Amsterdam cut him in the back after Amsterdam killed one of those traitors in uniform. Amsterdam may have a tiff of business to settle with the butcher. So did I. Vengeance for me son is all I want. He had told the doctor to pay no mind to me son just because he was Irish. Me son couldn't get the medicine needed. Me son takes precedence over Amsterdam's tiff. The cannons go off again. I duck and take me position. I charge at the butcher after the first explosion. When the dust begins to become a fog again, I keep charging. He drops to the ground and lays like a baby when the explosions began. I dropped to a knee next to him because I know he can't see me through the dusty fog. I brought me arm upward, piece of sharp fence in hand, and thrust it downward. I feel it go into the butcher's chest. I told him me name is Ian and that was for me son as I run off before the dusty fog can settle again. When it does I see the butcher and Amsterdam facing each other when I look back at them. Amsterdam's realizing that someone beat him to killing the butcher! He's gonna have to settle for finishing him off. I meant not to take the glory, but me own business is more important to me. I've gotten me payback I sure have. Then I suddenly see McGloin and me good friend who me and me son came here with, get killed by the traitors in uniform. McGloin's been blown half way to hell by their muskets and Shang charges them only to get thrown to the ground and then kicked and slammed by the butts of their muskets. Before I can shed a tear or react, I turn around and see Bill yank the fence piece out of his chest. Bill looks at Amsterdam and then mutters something and Amsterdam hurls his knife into him to finish him off. This is a beautiful site. I'm watching the life slip out of the butcher. I turn around and face three traitors with their muskets pointed at me. I hear something loud as I turn to run…… ","Summary":" Disclaimer: These characters and gangs do not belong to me.

The smell of fresh meat and old whiskey spread through the air. \"Have I had you before?\" Warning : hints of sexual abuse \"Bill, you say?\" The voice of Bill \"The Butcher\" Cutting cut through the rather stinking air. They were standing alone in Bill's house. The smell of fresh meat and old whiskey spread through the air. \"Have I had you before?\" Amsterdam couldn't believe his ears. \"For fucks sake Bill… stop fuckin around\". Who was he to speak? Amsterdam was damn lucky to be alive, especially when walking around the dragon's tail. He hated him. Amsterdam Vallon hated The Butcher, but yet, here he was: standing in the house of his father's killer. He was head over heels, and he knew it. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. This wasn't closer, this was fuckin' lava. Everybody knew Bill fancied girls, and especially beautiful girls such as Jenny. Bill wasn't a special humoristic man, not around that subject at least. \"Answer the question, or want me to cut your tongue out?\" his famous smile shined towards him, and Amsterdam couldn't think of anything else besides from stabbing that goddamn bastard – and make a kill . Bill started moving towards him. Amsterdam looked around for something to protect himself with. \"Whats up with'cha today?\" his voice sounded unusually small, young and vulnerable. Of course he knew what was up with him today, or more precisely: tonight. He, himself, hadn't even touched the bottles of whiskey, and far from gotten incredibly drunk by it. Slightly afraid of him Amsterdam backed into the walls, with no forms of protection besides from his fists. But what would fists help vs. knives? Absolutely nothing. \"Bill, stay the fuck off me! You've been drinkin' too much for your own healthy good\" Forced to push The Butcher away Amsterdam quickly found himself with a black eye. Stupid idea. \"Have I had you before?\" his annoying American accent sounded, probably fixated on this one sentence with too little logical meaning. \"No, no for fucks sake, Bill\" Amsterdam repeated himself. Bill's warm hands placed themselves on his shoulders and lightly pushed him into the wall. \"Then how dare you… calling me by my Christian name?\" his voice went up and down in levels. Great, now he even sounded like a drunkie. In shock, despair and self protection Amsterdam grabbed both the older mans arms, and pushed them away, angry. Bill grinned, drunk as a pig, his eyes blurry and full of dark desire. He had to get out. Amsterdam looked over at the door, as if he checked how far it was, or how fast he could run. The Butchers breath tickled his tempting ear and neck. Quickly Amsterdam dodged, and ran towards the door. The cold wind threw his hat away, so that his hair hung free in the air. Grabbing the doorknob Amsterdam casted himself out through the door, but didn't come far enough before a chocking pain burned through his soft skin. As he fell to the floor, his hands took a hold of the white curtain, ruining it. The small table fell down beside him, just as well as one of Bill's flower vases broke in a thousand pieces on top of him. Bill's rough, butcher hands took a good hold of Amsterdam's shirt, and dragged him up. The other hand removed the knife from the kid's side, but only to push it towards his throat. Pulling Amsterdam up partly by his hair, Bill threw him amusingly down in one of the many sofas. Bleeding like a stuck pig Amsterdam covered the wound with his hand. \"Bill, stop…\" the sound of his own pathetic words almost killed him. Bill grinned before bending down, kissing the side of his lips. Unable to fight what's happening Amsterdam leaned further back in the couch to escape what would happen. Bill couldn't help seeing Amsterdam's face turning paler and paler. Was this a normal day, he'd help the boy best as he could, but now, he just didn't care. Ripping the shirt open, Bill placed himself on top of him, forcing the kid facedown. Not able to fight no more Amsterdam closed his eyes.

He hitches his pants up over bony thighs, pulling his shirt on over thin shoulders, covering the bruises he has across his back and ribs. He glances back at the girl on the bed, the worn wool blanket pulled over her bare breast, her hair tousled and disheveled. He only meant to toss a few coins her way, payment for her performance and all he had in his pocket for the next few days. But the look in the girl's eyes made him hesitate, giving her the opportune moment to speak. \"Who were you thinking of just then?\" Johnny frowned, turning his attention to his shirt, fingers fumbling with the buttons. He tried to push the thoughts from his head; Jenny pinned against the wall, skirt hiked past her thighs, Amsterdam pressed against her, his slacks down around his shins. He shook his head, trying to clear his mind of those images. But he couldn't push away that smile, or those blue eyes. He knew every inch of that body, every trace of those scares, every curve of an arm or a leg. The salty taste of pale flesh, tender touches as hands caressed his shoulders, over his back, gripping his hips. A pang of hurt seized his heart, gripping it tightly, almost causing him to gasp for breath. The feeling of hurt and sadness was quickly replaced by betrayal. Betrayal, jealousy, anger and hurt all mixed together inside him. He wanted to hit something. Break something. Scream. Yell. Cry. He marched back to the girl on the bed, pulling his shirt back off, not caring about the two or three buttons that tore lose. He pulled her up to him, kissing her ferociously. Their teeth clashed against each other, he tasted blood and heard her inhale sharply as his tooth cut her bottom lip. In a frenzy he was pushing his pants down, assisted by the girl beneath him. He ground his body into hers, gripping her wrists tightly, not taking notice to the look of discomfort on her face. His thoughts were elsewhere. His thoughts were with Jenny and Amsterdam on room away. Jenny moaning Amsterdam's name. Amsterdam kissing her, touching her. Amsterdam, who he loathed with every bone in his body. Amsterdam, who he loved with every fiber of his being. Amsterdam, who was touching Jenny, kissing Jenny, loving Jenny the same way he had loved Johnny just the night before. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sorry that there were no before hand warnings about the slash, I just didn't want to give away that little treat.

One pair conjoined in a passionate kiss their arms wrapped tightly around each other. A man and woman hungrily consumed the others body, soul, so intoxicated they didn't even notice the other pair who were standing not far away watching them. \"We're just gonna turn them though, right?\" Eve said as they slowly pushed themselves off the wall they were leaning on for support. \"How romantic of you,\" Adam replied. The pair were exhausted and starved. Motivated to use the extraordinary effort they required to take even a few steps with the promise of the two lovers whose kiss was surely sending their beautiful blood pumping through their bodies at a fast pace. The pair could feel an adrenaline rush coming forgetting their concerns of infected blood. It didn't matter now. So close to starvation they were that the risk of drinking bad blood or even being seen by a passer bye was pushed to the back of their minds. Eve contacted the other pair first as they sat on a bench still kissing. She looked almost ghost like with the moonlight giving her white hair a silvery sheen. As Adam had requested the woman Eve grabbed the man with both arms around his shoulders. She moved too fast for any human, or zombie as Adam would say, to possibly react to. Barely a second had passed before Eve plunged her teeth into his neck. He was delicious. Oh god he was delicious. Who was it that said a starved man always eats the best meals? Adam was one step behind Eve. The delay giving the woman just enough time to left out one scream before Adam lifted her off the bench. He wrapped his arms all the way around her body so pressing them close together as he drank. At a first glance it may have looked like they were two lovers with Adam passionately kissing her neck. Eve, who was still bending over to reach the mans neck moved to sit next to him on the bench, her fangs not loosing contact. They drank, feeling the life drain from their victims. The pair didn't struggling, overcome with such sudden blood loss and shock. Opportunities to drink blood like this were limited in the modern world. While Adam and Eve would have commonly done this in the centuries past changing times called for blood in plastic packs and delicate glasses. More sophisticated some might say but nothing compared to blood directly from the source. It was raw, almost animalistic. The starved pair drank with such enthusiasm their need for blood almost overpowered their capacity to drink it in so drips began to fall down their chins. Then droplets ran in streams down their necks, some caught in Eves hair contrasting against the white but still they didn't stop. Drinking, drinking, this was heaven, this was pure satisfaction, this was a thirst being truly quenched. Adam was the first to stop. The girl was smaller than the man and Adam could drink faster than Eve. To turn them, not kill them, takes practice, practice that they both had plenty of. He was satisfied that he had managed to fill him self without risking her death. It would have been hard to stop if he had still been hungry, probably impossible. He continued to hold her body close to his, savoring the moment before he gently laid her on the ground. Eve stopped soon after breathing heavily. She looked up at Adam and smiled, her teeth bloody. She followed suit laying the man next to the woman then moved to stand beside Adam. They stared down at the seemingly lifeless couple. Eve turned to Adam, stood on her tiptoes, roughly grabbed a handful of his hair and yanked his head back exposing his blood stained neck. Adam moaned gently while Eve followed a stream of blood up his neck with her tongue as Adam wrapped his arms around her waist. Two pairs of lovers were bathed by the moonlight.[Chapter 2] Cold. Her body felt cold. Like she was facing an icy wind, her skin tightening, goose bumps forming. The possibility that she was dead crossed her mind but she soon let go of that likelihood. Having a somewhat rational discussion with oneself inside ones head was a sure indication there was some brain activity still going on. But it was this feeling of utter coldness that cemented the undeniable truth that life was clinging to her. Dead bodies couldn't feel nor could they consciously acknowledge that they were feeling. But dead bodies turn cold, don't they? Was her heart even beating? Was she still breathing? Doubt crawled under her skin it was making her shake, or maybe it was fear and confusion, or perhaps it was that still ever present cold feeling that wasn't even logical given the warm, humid Moroccan nights. Ah, there it is. A memory. I'm definitely alive . Alive but not quite right perhaps. She could not shake the feeling that there was something inherently wrong with her body. Like all her energy had been drained yet there was still something surging inside her, something awakening inside her like a new energy had taken place of an old one. Her body continued to shudder to the point that she became aware of the hard ground beneath her. She opened her eyes for the first time. Her eyelids felt heavy, it hurt, like they had turned to sand paper. Wincing slightly she was faced with a black night sky and a faint yellow glow from the bottom of her peripheral vision that was probably coming from some shop or streetlight she deduced. She was definitely conscious, although possibly injured in some way, she was definitely lying down on the ground and it was definitely nighttime. Closing her eyes again she attempted to remember what events had led up to her strange predicament. Dinner. Yes she definitely remembered dinner. Then did she go for a walk? No. There was music. Yes! A walk to get to the music. Yasmine was performing and then… then...? She made an exasperated scoff angry with herself for not being able to remember however pleased that she had discovered use of her vocal cords remained in tact. Concentrating hard again she repeated dinner, walk, Yasmine. Dinner, walk, Yasmine, dinner, walk, Yasmine… Fadal! Off course Fadal had been with her. They had watched Yasmine performed then sat enjoying the warm night on the bench opposite the bar. They had kissed. She remembered now. At the thought of him that strange energy surging through her swelled, the cold subsided, it was as if her lungs had once again returned to full capacity. She opened her eyes but this time did not care at the pain. She felt alive. \"Its some kind of ridiculous irony surely,' Adam said quietly as he followed Eve back to her house after their feast. \"What is my darling?\" Eve replied. \"That I'm struggling to walk on my full stomach just as much as I struggled on my empty one, it's almost poetic,\" Adam answered in his usual philosophical, deep voice. Eve laughed quietly. \"Perhaps. Although I'd probably go with pathetic rather than poetic,\" she said still smiling. \"Come on now you really are walking incredibly slow, at this speed the sun will be up before we reach home,\" Eve said extending her arm behind her. Adam reached out and grabbed her hand. \"You're always one step ahead of me,\" Eve didn't reply. Quickening the pace slightly they continued their way home. Eve aught to have been kinder to Adam as it truly was difficult to walk. To gorge themselves like that in minutes after decades of savouring small sips from shot glasses meant their bodies were in shock with this sudden over abundance of sustenance. Finally reaching their home, Eve supposed she should refer to it as theirs now rather than hers, they both collapsed on the large mattress Eve kept in the main bedroom. She preferred it on the floor rather than elevated on a bed although it appeared quite high due to the copious amounts of blankets she liked to get lost under which were piled up. They found their usual comfortable position of intertwined legs and arms and rested silently for a few moments. \"We're going to regret it,\" Adam said suddenly. Eve didn't have to ask what. She knew what he was talking about. Creating two new vampires in one go in one city was dangerous. It was an advantage that her and Adam were here to keep and eye on them but also a disadvantage, as there were now two more bloodthirsty mouths to feed. \"You realise why we couldn't kill them though,\" Eve responded. \"Ethics,\" Adam said. Eve laughed for the second time that night. \"I realise, of course,\" Adam continued. \"It was like looking in a damn mirror,\" They were both silent again, thinking. Adam and Eve had been passionate lovers for many centuries now. In that moment of starvation where death was surely coming the thought of dying together was a comforting one. But then they saw the two, young, vulnerable lovers opposite them consuming each other in a desperate passion Adam and Eve knew all to well. The parallels to their own love was not lost on either of them. Like looking in a damn mirror as Adam had so eloquently said. Sentiment had got the better of them. \"Perhaps we were supposed to die, \" Adam thought out loud. \"Maybe they were the perfect lovers to replace us in this otherwise cold and loveless world.\" \"Or perhaps,\" Eve counteracted. \"It was meant to be like this, maybe there are meant to be two pairs of lovers condemned suffer the perfect agony of each other for centuries more,\" \"Love is agony,\" Adam agreed. \"The best kind,\" Eve replied.[Chapter 3] A/N thanks to the people that have reviewed and followed! It's very inspiring. Just to let you know I'm very busy at uni at the moment with exams and study and what not so I can't make any promises as to when I'll upload new chapters. I write when I feel inspired and when I get the time so thank you for your patience. I'm hoping things will get more interesting in the chapters to come after this. Also apologies for any grammatical errors, like I said its quite full on at uni but I wanted to give you another chapter :) Taking in deep breaths of air she decided the next step was to stand up. Your name is Arlia. You are alive and you're going to stand up. Now. She repeated the words firmly in her mind as she slowly pushed herself off the ground and surprising, and thankfully, she felt stronger the more she moved. Finally on her feet she looked up at the sky taking another deep breath in. Looking down at Farhid who was stirring slightly she bent down grasped his shoulders and called his name. \"Farhid, it's me, Arlia, can you hear me? Can you move?\" Slowly his eyes opened then closed again suddenly as he winced just like she had, no doubt his eyes were experiencing the same heavy, painful feeling. With some effort she helped him to his feet. For a moment they stood still as if time had momentarily stopped both trying desperately to figure out what was happening. They turned to look at each other, both showing extreme confusion. Arlia was the first to talk. \"I…\" she started. \"I don't know what's wrong with us. Do you remember anything from last night?\" Farhid closed his eyes, his forehead creasing as he tried to piece together his memories. \"I remember up to seeing Yasmine perform. Then nothing.\" Arlia continued. After a few more silent moments Farhid let out an annoyed sigh. \"I can't remember, why can't I remember?\" he almost whispered the words as if saying them too loud would only make them more true. \"I feel different too, like I'm empty or cold or…\" Farhid paused. \"Just different, I can't explain it.\" He finished. \"Are we dead Farhid?\" Arlia asked. \"No, I don't think so.\" Deciding that standing around in their confusion wasn't helping anything the pair began walking, slowly at first then gradually speeding up to their normal pace. It felt bizarre walking the streets of Tangier at this hour. So still and quiet and they were thankful for some quiet to collect their thoughts. Eventually they came to a rest again after about 20 minutes on a bench outside a little antique shop they frequented. Farhid peered through the darkened window aided by a perfectly angled street lamp that, although dim, illuminated the display inside just enough that he could see some old books and what looked like perfume bottles. Squinting through the window he hoped to see some antique clocks and watches as he had always had a fascination with them especially old pocket watches that you could open with a little button then snap shut with a satisfying sound that Farhid enjoyed. Last year Arlia had bought him a pocket watch. Not for his birthday or for an anniversary just because she saw it and thought of him. He held that tarnished gold watch whenever he missed her. Momuntarily lost in thought it wasn't until about a minute later Farhid noticed something strange. \"Arlia\" \"Come here for a moment\" he asked his voice steady despite his quickly rising panic. Arlia got up off the bench and stood beside him following his gaze into the shop window. \"What you see another watch you want?\" She replied playfully. Expecting a laugh or at least a smile from Farhid she immediately suspected something was wrong when he remained stony faced. \"What is it?\" Arlia asked apprehensively, hoping she wouldn't have to deal with another shock tonight. \"Look into the glass, Arlia what can you see?\" Arlia followed his instructions. \"I can't see an…\" she didn't finish her sentence. Farhid looked at her filled with concern. They both stood staring at the glass window. Straight through the glass window. Coming to the realization that they could not see their own reflections. \"It must be the light.\" Arlia concluded as she moved from side to side attempting to catch the light from the street lamp but to no avail. She turned to face Farhid again. \"Oh my god. What happened to us?\" \"I suppose we should go and find them.\" Eve sighed. Her head resting on Adam's chest. \"Why. We managed perfectly fine by ourselves when we got turned.\" Adam replied. The two hadn't moved much since they collapsed on Eve's pile of blankets but sleep had evaded them while thoughts and concerns over their most recent meal still plagued their minds. \"Because, my darling\" Eve said as she slightly raised her head to check the time on her antique clock hanging on the wall. \"It's past 2am, they will have woken up by now but will get rather hungry soon I'd imagine.\" Adam sighed. She was right of course. They would have to find them before hunger took over and they killed someone. Non-contaminated blood was hard to come by these days and it was best to keep a low profile if you intended to sneak into hospitals to get pure samples. A pair of vampire serial killers that the media would no doubt give copious amounts of attention to be the definition of bad publicity. Adam understood and agreed with her reasoning but was so content lying with Eve, feeling her in his arms, and on a full stomach even that dealing with two young vampires was honestly the last thing he wanted to do. But, never the less the pair left the house and began retracing their steps from the night's previous events. For an hour they had no luck and the threat of a rising sun was looming closer. Starting to feel slightly stressed they quickened their pace as they searched through the streets. \"We should go to areas with larger groups of people.\" Eve remarked. \"The stronger smell of blood should attract them there\" Adam nodded in agreement. The only area they could think that would have lots of people at this hour was the street near by to where they had feasted, on the now problem couple, not long before. An area with a few nightclubs and popular music venues where more dedicated partygoers may still be gathered. It was the sound of slightly maniacal laughter that sparked curiosity in Adam and Eve who decided to investigate further. Quickening their pace and following the sound they located the pair. \"Dammit.\" Eve whispered under her breath. \"Too late.\" Adam said as they stared down at a bloody and unmoving body with two laughing vampires lying next to it.[Chapter 4] AN: I realised I messed up Farhid's name. It is Farhid not Fadal, I was tossing up between the two and forgot to correct it in the second chapter. They were in a darkened alleyway behind a club that had now closed hopefully meaning there wouldn't be any witnesses wondering by. Adam stepped closer to the couple. They were lying facing each other whispering words in Arabic he couldn't understand, smiling, looking into each other's eyes. It would have been rather sweet if it weren't for the presumably dead body lying next to them. The boy then obviously said something amusing as the girl cracked a massive smile as she let out a joyously loud laugh, the same as the one that had attracted Adam and Eve in the first place. As she gasped for breath and clutched her stomach in her bout of laughter she first noticed Adam. They momentarily locked eyes with each other, remained unmoving for a second before the girl quickly jumped up, stumbled on her feet a bit. Adam was the first to speak. \"What is your name?\" he said slightly sternly, but, in a way one would speak to a child while you were still trying to figure out if she were going to behave or not. \"I'm Arlia and who are you? \" Arlia replied in an accusing tone. Adam was momentarily taken aback by her attitude and it was Eve placing her hand gently on his back as she walked up behind him that clicked his brain back in place. \"My name is Adam.\" He replied. Thankfully, she spoke and understood English so a language barrier was one less problem they would have to face. Eve spoke some very basic, broken Arabic but Adam wanted to communicate first in case they became violent. He could deal with them fairly easily. The boy was shorter and smaller than Adam so he felt confident he could control him and the girl wouldn't be a problem. The boy still lying on the ground started humming a tune which the girl clearly recognised as she gasped and did a dance on the spot which once again sent the pair into fits of laughter. \"They're fucking insane.\" Adam said as he pushed some of his hair out of his eyes and pressed his fingers into his forehead in frustration. He and Eve were a little confused by this constant giddiness they were displaying. They had both assumed they would have to take the pair back to their house for a very solemn discussion about their newfound immortality but it appeared Arlia and the boy had no interest other than having a good laugh. Peering at the couple as the girl pulled the boy to his feet with some struggle, Eve said with a sudden realization \"They look… \"Drunk.\" Adam finished her sentence. After exchanging a quick glance with Eve, Adam walked to the dead body and pressed a finger on one of the messy wounds on the man's neck. Bringing it to his mouth he placed his finger on the tip of his tongue then immediately spat it out pulling a face like he'd just eaten a slice of lemon. \"That's definitely contaminated blood, this guy must have passed out drunk when they found him.\" He said nodding towards the still giggly couple. \"What an unfortunate first meal.\" Eve sighed feeling a pang of sympathy for the couple. Although she was soon trying desperately not to smile at them as it appeared the boy had decided to imitate Adams melancholy pout and slow walk only to trip over his own feet much to the amusement of the girl who let out a cackling laugh at his failed attempt. The performance was not unseen by Adam who was looking ever more annoyed than usual. He rarely found comfort in people other than Eve and most of his experience with young vampires came from Eve's little sister, Ava, who he was most definitely not fond of. Perhaps it was her careless, free and occasionally rather dumb attitude that exasperated him or that she had made a meal of Ian, the only human he hadn't considered a complete zombie in the past century when he was last with her. Either way, the almost disgustingly happy pair in front of him was starting to get on his nerves. He rolled his eyes at them and continued his inspection of the body. \"Eve,\" he said suddenly. \"This guy is still alive.\" \"What? How is that possible?\" Eve replied rushing to Adams side. The victim was covered in blood as were the couple that had feasted on him. It was messy. \"They mustn't have drunk much before they themselves got drunk,\" Eve proposed. \"Well, that was lucky.\" Adam replied. Eve could sense a little relief in his voice that someone who didn't know him like she did wouldn't have picked up. \"Yes,\" Eve responded. She too was thankful that they wouldn't have to add disposing a dead body to their things to deal with tonight. \"Although he's not dead, not even turned, which means they can't have drunk much so they'll only get hungry again sooner. Our problems aren't over yet.\" Eve continued. Adam murmured in agreement. \"Should we clean him up a bit?\" Adam asked. \"Perhaps not. It might look like a dog attack this way.\" Eve replied. Adam and Eve would have left two almost clean puncture wounds each had they fed on this man, which looks rather suspicious, but thankfully new vampires are far less neat during their eating which worked in their favor this time. The wounds merely looked like torn skin and blood something passable as a dog bite to the neck. They attention was drawn from the body when the boy asked them something in Arabic. Adam turned to Eve. She shrugged not understanding fully what he said. \"I think it best to leave the body as is, someone will find him early morning, lets just sort out these two.\" Eve said signaling towards Arlia and the boy who weren't causing trouble at the moment, indeed they were looking rather curiously at Adam and Eve. \"At least they're happy drunks I suppose,\" Eve said. \"Happy,\" Adam replied. \"Lucky them.\" Drinking too much contaminated blood caused a progressively intensifying illness in vampires, much like an addict enjoying too much of a good thing. Adam often craved the momentary release of alcohol but pure alcohol was toxic and blood alcohol eventually became so too, leaving Adam with no real escape from his own mind. Except for his music, and Eve of course. \"Lets just try to get them to the house,\" Eve said, watching Adam. Adam nodded. \"Arlia,\" he called. \"We would like you to come with us.\" \"Come where?\" She replied. \"Stranger danger you know, can never be too careful of strange men in the dark.\" She said jokingly pointing a finger playfully at Adam. \"No! Back away! I'll save you Arli!\" said the boy suddenly as he grabbed Arlia in a massive hug picking her up off the ground. Arlia squealed as Adam turned to Eve. Eve read his expression and stepped forward to have her turn at communicating with the couple. \"Arlia, what's your friends name?\" Eve asked. The boy returned her to the ground as she replied. \"This is Farhid.\" \"You and Farhid were at the concert earlier tonight weren't you? Yasmine's concert?\" The pair's eyes lit up. \"Yes we were, were you there too?\" Farhid replied expectantly. \"Yes,\" Eve said smiling. \"and Adam is very accomplished at playing music like Yasmine, would you like to hear some?\". Eve waited with baited breath for their reply hoping they would agree as she was becoming increasingly aware that the summer sun would rise early. \"Yes.\" They answered in unison. The journey back to the house was easier than expected. They were talkative and Farhid playfully mocked Adam and Eve's names by insisting they call him Jesus but on the whole they were easy to manage even though the alcoholic blood had clearly affected them. They also became progressively more tired as they got closer to their destination. Adam and Eve hoped they would sleep giving them time to plan their next meal, as it seemed more likely that they would have to do something illegal to find some untainted blood. Finally arriving at the house Adam pulled out a spare mattress Eve had that occasionally Marlowe had slept on. The two tried not to think about him too much; the grief over his death was still raw. \"Nice clock.\" Farhid said sleepily pointing to the antique on the wall. \"Thank you.\" Eve replied as she threw some blankets on the mattress. They would all rest in the same room so Adam and Eve could keep an eye on them. Arlia almost immediately fell onto the mattress her eyes drooping. New vampires were usually full of energy after their first feed but alcoholic blood was not good for anyone let alone two that had been turned only hours ago. \"Wait!\" Arlia said suddenly her eyes flinging open again as Farhid joined her on the mattress. \"You promised us some music,\" she pouted. Eve turned to Adam and raised an eyebrow. He sighed and shrugged in agreement. Having left all his instruments and gear in Detroit he would have to play on the dusty, old guitar Eve kept. She didn't play it but she held it whenever she missed him in their many years apart. Eve fetched it as Farhid and Arlia looked at Adam expectantly despite their fatigue. When Adam and Eve settled on their mattress he began playing. He hated playing for strangers but he thought it would be best to settle down the new couple so he closed his eyes to pretend it was just Eve. The tune was soft, in a minor key, which sounded rather sad but built to a slow crescendo that sounded surprisingly optimistic for Adams music. Adam finished his piece and opened his eyes. Being satisfied that Farhid and Arlia were sleeping he turned to Eve who was already looking at him. \"I haven't heard that one before,\" she said quietly. \"Was it for me?\" \"You know it was,\" Adam replied softly as he leaned into her. They down on the bed as Adam put the guitar to one side and allowed themselves what would likely be one last moment of peace before their adventures with this new couple began.

One pair conjoined in a passionate kiss their arm"},{"Movie":"Gangs of New York","Title":"Friends Close, Enemies Closer","Author":"RoseDelion","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6022899","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hey all! So I decided that Gangs Of New York is such a fantastic movie, I should write a story about it. So please lemme know what you all think and if I should continue . I do not own Gangs Of New York, the movie or book. I do own Evangeline. The year was 1863. My brother Amsterdam and I want revenge. Want revenge on the bloody bastard that killed our father. Bill. Vague memories sweep my mind at night. I was younger than my brother, only remembering bits and pieces of my past. One memory will forever haunt my memories. The day Bill murdered my father, and my brother and I saw it. Of course, Bill ordered Amsterdam and I to be 'locked up' for educational purposes. Women were not allowed to be educated, but my brother educated me still. Teaching me what father taught him, and what others have taught him. I stood waiting near the prison like state where my brother was at. He was being released today. I began pacing, wondering out loud to myself. How on earth are we going to get our revenge against Bill? I've heard rumors that he is a feared man, but was it true? Father always told me, \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\" His words rang in my mind everyday. \"Evangeline!\" My brother ran to me with open arms. I was to busy having an argument mentally with myself to notice my brother walking out. \"Amsterdam!\" I replied happily, hugging him tighter. His body warmth protected me against the bitter cold sweeping my body. Amsterdam pulled away from me, eyeing me from head to toe. He looked amazingly like father. Same sparkling blue eyes, soft brown hair, and his tall height. I'd never forget my brother's face. Only about one or twice a month I was lucky to see my brother. He looked skinny, too skinny for my liking. I'd managed to work as a maid in the richer part of New York. I was allowed to live on the property, with three proper meals a day, and was welcomed with nice warm sheets at night. The same could not be said about my brother. \"Ready?\" Amsterdam's voice broke my concentration; he nodded his head at my unanswered reply. I nodded slowly, knowing worry took hold of my face. I lowered my face, suddenly finding my shoes the most interesting thing in the world. A finger, pressed gently against my chin, pressing it in an upward motion. Amsterdam lowered his head, staring hard in my eyes, making my shuddered slightly. Amsterdam pressed his lips gently to my forehead, as if brushing away my worries and fears. Amsterdam suddenly, started laughing. Embarrassment took over my face, which felt burning hot. \"What?\" I barked, stepping angrily away from my brother. Amsterdam let his hand glide over my hair, picking up a large piece. \"You still have that large damn piece of blonde in your hair!\" Amsterdam laughing at me was driving me crazy! Ever since I was little, I was always teased by my brother. My hair was a light brown, having a large chunk of blonde in the front of my face on the right side. I was always trying to pin it up, so it would be less noticeable, but no. My brother always made fun of me for it, while my father said I have my mother's hair. \"Oh shut it! Let's get going.\" I said, slapping his hand away from my face. I raced to walk in front of my brother, letting the cold wind hit my embarrassed face. Amsterdam's laughing became silent, which I was grateful for. Hearing a small splash, I eagerly turned around. Amsterdam was leaning, looking down at the dark water. On top of the water, was a floating bible. My brother had just thrown a bible in the water! \"What are you doing?\" I yelled rushing towards him. His face was emotionless. Our father was a priest, faith to me was important. Apparently, to Amsterdam it was not. We descended down the ships and walked onto the awaiting docks. It smelled horrible, rotten meat, bodies, and God knows what else. Many immigrants flooded the docks, eagerly rushing into the busy streets of New York. I held my brother's hand tightly, afraid I'd lose him again. He clung to me also. Some of the native's were throwing rocks at the new people, even hitting one woman in the face. I had to bite my tongue in order not to scream at the man. Amsterdam pulled on to me, making me stumble over my fresh clean pink dress. Glancing down at my dress, it became dirty. Amsterdam and I continued our walk to the five points of New York.[Chapter 2] The walk was long and tedious. I held thigh onto my brother as we descended the streets. Men were offered fliers and other papers as we walked by. I glanced back to the women who had been hit with the rock. She was kneeling, her face covered in blood. I was scared, but I would not let Amsterdam see it. I tried to fluff up my pink dress while walking through the dirt. It smelled of fish, oil and smoke. Amsterdam pulled me tight as we walked through the crowed streets. Dust flew in my face making me cough. \" You alright?\" Amsterdam spoke with question in his face. His bright eyes met mine and I nodded. I was nervous to speak. My thoughts traveled to Bill. Would he recognize us? Fear swept my body. Would he murder us like our father. I wanted him dead. My brother was strong and smart. He could handle Bill, but could I? \" Flowers for sale! Flowers for a pretty girl! Very cheap! You must buy!\" An older man with a dirty coat screamed jumping in front of me. His face was sunk in and smelled of alcohol. I gagged at it. His wrinkled fingers grabbed mine and I screamed. Amsterdam pushed the old man, his eyes filled with hate. \" We don't want ye'r flowers! Don't touch her again! I'll gut ya from head to toe!\" The man backed up and put his hands up in the air. His face frozen with fear. Amsterdam frightened me! I know he was protective but he seemed..evil. My brothers eyes looked black. I was use to the sky blue ones! We continued our way still in shock of what happened. Since we came into the five points we both are becoming different. \" Stay here and don't ya move.\" Amsterdam harshly whispered in my ear. Causing me to want to itch it. I nodded. Amsterdam entered a brothel it seemed. I didn't dare travel in there. Looking around there were many sights. Many people singing for money or people dancing. I caught an older women gracefully singing and dancing. I smiled and went to walk over. Three men, possibly her sons were playing instruments, some I didn't recognise. I enjoyed watching her lovely red dress and long silver hair flow free among her waist. Soft grey eyes caught mine. \" Come dear! Dance with me!\" Her voice was sweet like honey. The happiness she expelled made me join her. We locked arms and danced around. We kicked up dust and laughed with she continued to sing. I felt free, no worries at all. My hair fell in front on my face as I struggled to keep up with her legs! Clapping was ringing in my ears and the sounded of laughter filled them. I was so dizzy I wonder how she was doing this herself as an older women. \" Ahh!\" I felt my legs betray me as I stumbled farther away from her. Her grey eyes locked with mine for a second before I landed into what felt like a wall! \" Are you okay my dear! Too much dance and sing will get you in trouble!\" A deep voice said behind me. I noticed arms around my waist. Turning around I came face to face with Bill. He was still holding me as I stood in shock. Eyes wide as the moon, my mouth hung open. I stood in shock. \" You better close your mouth before flies come in.\" He chuckled softly. Other chuckled behind him, but I did not dare let my eyes leave his cold ones. Bill proceeded to light his bone like finger up to my chin. Gently, he pushed it closed. \" What's your name doll? He grinned. His mustache curled up towards his cheeks. \" Evangeline.\" I squeaked out. My mouth became dry. Licking my lips I stared back. I am face to face with the man that murdered my father. What should I do? I wanted to strangle him in front of these people. Embarrass him like he did my father. My thoughts became clear. Backing away I again stumbled on my pink dress. Ripping it. I felt as if I had two left feet. \" Sorry sir, I didn't mean to run into you.\" I managed to muzzle out. I lied behind my teeth. I was not sorry, I wish I could have rammed him a little harder! Possibly knocking him over. Hurting him. \" My name is Bill. I'm the butcher here in five points sweetheart! Come see me sometime!\" He still continued to laugh and smile at my clumsy footing. I said nothing and contiuned to walk away. Oh Bill. I'll come see you when the time is right.. ","Summary":" Hey all!

I waited for the guy who supplied me with blood. \"Doctor! Please you need to cone with me!\" A nurse said, grabbing me. She dragged me to room. I wasn't able to tell her anything when people pushed a girl in. She was laying on a gurny. She looked to be in pain, but was trying to play it off. \"Mom I'm fine! There just st scratches.\" I heard her say. But could easily tell it wasn't just scratches. Her arm was twisted, and her leg was was well. \"Uhhh. What happened?\" I asked. \"Car accident.\" A nurse said. \"Eva! I'm So sorry!\" I heard a man said. I saw a man with spiky brown hair. \"I'm fine. Really. I'm ok!\" She tried. I looked at her face. She was beautiful. For a human. Her dark hair. Had some blonde in it. Her big Brown eyes was pure. Pale skin, full pink lips. She had a swollen bump on her forehead. I examined her. \"Well need to get stitches. And your arm is broken and your keg is fractured.\" I told her. I knew what to do. I've had to do this a few times before. As I fixed her up, her innocent eyes, never left my masked face. She fluid flinch and whimper in pain, but other then that. \"You'll have to use a wheelchair.\" I told her once I was finished. \"Can I use crutches?\" She asked. \"Lets see if you can with one arm.\" I said, I wanted to see how far she could go. She looked determined. But she couldn't get far. She huffed when she had to sit in the wheelchair. \"Can I use the crutch when I perform?\" She asked. I looked at her. \"You perform?\" I asked. She nodded. \"Yeah. My band and I perform at my uncle's burger shack. You should come. We perform tomorrow. They've got great food. Great people.\" She said. I felt a smile form on my face, though, she couldn't see it. \"I'd like that.\" I said. She smiled at me. \"Great.\" She reached over, I flinched. \"It's ok. I'm not going to bite.\" She teased. She grabbed my pen then grabbed my hand. She took the glove off, and started to write on it. \"Here you go. We perform at around eight.\" She said. I nodded, trying to get over the sparks that was going off from my hand. She blushed a bit. She was rolled out and then she was gone. I felt... empty again... sad that she was gone. I got my blood and went home thinking about her. Evangeline.[Chapter 2] ,I walked to the burger place that I had been told about. I got a table by the stage. \"Eva you ok? I heard. I looked and saw the girl from the hospital.. Evangeline. She was wearing a black and white dress. \"Yeah I'm fine. Just help me up please.\" She said. A few guys helped her onto the stage. Others went to their instruments. \"Hey everyone! Welcome to Mike's Burgers! We are 'The Fall Out Of Plush'! The first song is 'Titanium'\" She said. The music started then she started singing. \"' You shout it out But I can't hear a word you say I'm talking loud not saying much I'm criticized But all your bullets ricochet Shoot me down, but I get up I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose Fire away, fire away Ricochet, you take your aim Fire away, fire away [Chorus:] You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium Cut me down But it's you who'll have further to fall Ghost town and haunted love Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones I'm talking loud not saying much I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose Fire away, fire away Ricochet, you take your aim Fire away, fire away [Chorus:] You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium I am titanium I am titanium Stone-hard, machine gun Firing at the ones who run Stone-hard as bulletproof glass [Chorus:] You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium You shoot me down but I won't fall I am titanium I am titanium!'\" I was hypnotized by her voice. \"The next song is called 'Half Of Me' I wrote it for my fiance. Who as everyone knows died in the line of battle.\" I saw her eyes water. And heard her voice break a bit. I also felt jealousy in me. \"Please enjoy.\" She said. Then the guitarist started strumming. \"' Where did you go? Where did you go, my mistery You left me alone You left me to drown in misery I can't feel no pain I can't feel nothing but memories So Where are you now? Why would you want to leave me to Go sleep in the clouds and dream still shine and down on me And pieces underneath Cause half of me is gone Half of me is gone Half of me is gone Half of me is gone You took my heart You took the purest part of me You left me alone You made me my own worst enemy Lost in the world Searching for how we used to be When you are there When only you could carry me back to Where we started Before I got so brokenhearted Before you took the best of me Cause half of me is gone Half of me is gone Half of me is gone Half of me is gone Baby please wake up Baby please wake up for me now Uhhhhh Uh Uhhhhh Uh'\" Everyone cheered. That song moved me. It reminded me if myself. \"Thanks y'all! Enjoy the rest of the night. Again we are 'Fall Out Of Plush'\" She said. Everyone cheered again. \"Hey there. You new?\" It was Evangeline. She was in her wheelchair. \"Yes. You did invite me. So here I am.\" I said. She smiled even more, and she perked up in recognition. \"Hey doc. Glad you could make it.\" She said, happily. \"Thank you for inviting me. You are very good. Can you tell me about that last song?\" I asked. She nodded. She then told me about how her fiance was a town hero, and a member of the band. She said he died in an ambush. \"He was supposed to have come home the week after the attack.\" Tears have escaped her. \"We was going to get married then. Try to start a family before he was shipped back out. But...\" I rubbed her back. We've both lost someone we loved. \"You will find someone out there and make you feel loved like his was again.\" I said. But the first thought that came to me was. 'And that person should be me.' She smiled and sniffed. \"Thank you. Sorry for crying like a baby.\" She said. \"I don't mind at all. It's good to cry every now and then.\" I told her. \"You're a sweet guy. Thank you.\" She leaned over and kissed my cheek. \"I need to go. Rides a callin.\" She joked. I gave her a small smirk. Then she rolled off. I found myself missing her.[Chapter 3] I went to every show she was in. And every time, sang the song 'Half Of Me'. After a while, she no longer had any casts on. After a show I went to her. \"Hi. Um my brother wants me to look for an 'Evangeline'?\" I acted. She turned and looked at me. \"Doc?\" She asked. \"No my twin is a doctor. I'm Adam.\" I said. Somewhat lieing to her. She held out her hand. \"I'm Evangeline. Nice to meet you.\" I shook her hand. Feeling sparks. \"My brother told me about your music. I'm a music producer. And I just saw your performance. And was impressed.\" She blushed. \"I would love it if you came to my place and recorded some songs.\" I said. She grinned. \"This isn't an act to kidnap me and rape me then kill me?\" She asked. I laughed with her. Wow that was the first time I've laughed in a very long time. \"No. I would love to work with you.\" I said. She looked at her watch. \"Well I'm off the clock. Um we can head over now if you'd like.\" I nodded. I saw a band member glaring at me. I remember him apologizing to her at the hospital. Jealousy? \"Bye guys!\" She said, waving. I followed her out. \"Ummm. I don't have a car.\" She seemed to be embarrassed. \"That's ok. If you'd like we can take mine.\" She nodded. \"Not having a car is nothing to be embarrassed about.\" I said. She blushed more. I could hear her blood pumping. I could feel my fangs come out. We finally made it to my house. I rushed her inside. \"I'm going to change and get comfortable. Please take a seat.\" She nodded, looking at my instruments in amazement. I quickly went to drink some blood. Quenching my thirst. I had gotten some on me. So I changed. I left my shirt unbuttoned. *Eva's P.O.V* Wow. He's go so much cool stuff! \"Sorry for me keeping you waiting.\" I heard his deep voice. I turned and my jaw dropped. He now had in a different dark shirt. It was unbuttoned showing his chest. He was lean but had obvious muscles. I quickly closed my mouth. \"You're fine. I was just admiring your instruments.\" I said, brushing my finger over a guitar. \"Can I?\" I asked. He nodded. I picked it up and sat down. I started strumming. And started to hum. \"What song is it?\" Adam asked. \"Sweet Child Of Mine. By guns and roses.\" I said. Then giggled. \"My dad and I's song. We love it.\" I said. He had a small smile. \"I have a music sheet. I think with the right lyrics. You can make it amazing.\" He said. \"Can you play it?\" I asked. He nodded, then got up and hit play. A song came on. I nodded along. It was great. Instantly, words popped into my head. I quickly pulled out a note pad. \"Can you start it over please. I may have something. He nodded and started it over. I started writing. Once it was over I handed it to him. \"What you think?\" I asked. He nodded. \"May I make some changes?\" I nodded. *Adams P.O.V* I went to the kitchen hours later, to get her a coffee. When I came back she was sound asleep. I smiled at her. She looked so peaceful. I went over and picked her up and carried her to my room. I tucked her in and fell asleep on the couch[Chapter 4] I woke up in a soft bed. I looked around. Where am I? That's when I remembered last night. Adam. His music. I sat up. There was a knock on the door. \"Ummm. Come in?\" I didn't know what to say. Adam walked in. He gave me a small smile. \"You seemed tired last night. So I let you sleep.\" He said. I gave him a smile. \"Thank you. I should go.\" I said getting out of the bed. He nodded. \"Yeah. Um. If you'd like you can come back and work on that song.\" Adam said. I gave him a smile. \"I'll come back. How about the band and I come by tomorrow?\" I asked. He nodded. \"Sure. Nine?\" He asked. I nodded. \"Alright. Um... I'd hate to ask but... can I get a ride home? I umm. Don't have my licence just yet.\" I was embarrassed. All my friends have theirs. And I don't. \"Sure. Just let me get ready.\" I nodded, and waited. I pulled out my phone. I saw Pete texted me. 'Eve were r u?' I texted back. 'I went 2 talk 2a producer. Ended up fallen asleep. Headed back *Adam's P.O.V* I put on a black shirt. People say that vampires can't go out in the sunlight. Which was true until a few years ago. Now we can. It's hard to explain why we can. I walked out and we left. She directed me to where she lived. When I pulled up, I saw a boy sitting on the front steps. She looked at me. \"Thank you for the ride. Um I'll see you later?\" I nodded. She smiled and hugged me. I froze, but then returned the hug. Embracing her warmth. The smell of her sweet blood hit me again. I don't want to hurt her so I pulled away. She waved at me as she left. *Pete's P.O.V* I saw a car pull up. Finally she's here. I saw a guy in the car with her. They spoke, and she hugged him. Jealousy bubbled in me. \"Hey Pete!\" She greeted cheerfully. I gave her a smile. \"Hey Eva. Who's that?\" I asked. \"Oh. His names Adam. He's a recording manager. He's interested in our music. In fact he wants us all to go back to his place to work on a new song tomorrow.\" She seemed to have a skip in her step as she went inside. \"Oh? I guess that's cool.\" I said. She looked at me. \"You ok? You should be existed! We may just get famous. Out of the restaurant. Get our name out there.\" She said. I sighed. \"I'm fine Eva. I just have a headache. That's all. I'm glade your home safely. I'll see you later.\" I said. She nodded. I left thinking on how much I hated that guy. ","Summary":" *Adam's P.O.V* I walked into the hospital.

(Eve won't be mentioned or anything and all of that is no more in this. I'm making him kind of OC-ish as well...but you all will see! I hope you all like it. :D Criticism would be much appreciated, just try to be easy on me. :D I don't own anything except for the idea, and also my OC Olive. A thanks goes to my best friend Shela, for helping me decide on a name for the fic. Thanks girlie! Sighing to herself was one Olive Winters. The guy at the bar had cut her off after three drinks and a verbal battle brought up about having her 'boyfriend' come and pick her up. She didn't need a man, she was a very happy, single, over dramatic, and over emotional woman. She was happy about how her life was playing out, screw anyone who thought differently. \"Lady, I think it's time for you to leave.\" \"N-No. I...I get one more.\" \"No. -Ma'am, don't make me call security.\" \"F-fine. I'll go and get more someplace else.\" Olive hiccups as she gets off of the stool at the bar side. Even after she had apologized to the guy, he still wasn't budging. She groaned and in her drunken stupor made fun of the guy all the way up to the front door. She let herself out. Outside of the bar was quiet, too quiet, but to Olive, it was perfect. Her alcohol level was too high for her to even know how to walk a straight line, much less notice hardly anyone was outside. The street light over head was starting to flicker; a sign that the light was going to burn out before she made it to her car. The only form of light she would have would be from her cell phone, and it's not bright enough to see your hand in front of your face. Olive yawned as she slowly approached her car. She stopped for a moment, sneezed, and then continued. She made it under the shelter that was storing her car, before it began to rain. It had looked like it was going to rain all day, and even though the weatherman said it was suppose to, she hadn't believed it. Some say she hates weathermen almost as bad as she does politics. Olive, who had just turned twenty-four last month on the seventeenth's life was about to change forever. The closer she got to her car, the louder the rain hit. She could swear that someone was following her if she didn't believe she was just imagining it because she was a bit off. She had felt eyes on her since before she left the bar. Taking her think, auburn, messy hair down from her ponytail and pulling it close to her neck, she sighed. Maybe if she acted okay, whatever or whoever was following her wouldn't try anything. Finally, she took a breath, heard another loud footstep, and turned around. Nothing there. She sighed with relief, wiped sweat from her brow, and turned around. What she was expecting was an empty car lot with only her car and a few of the cars that were always there, but what she saw when she turned around made her stumble back. Before she could scream, a long, slender hand was pressed against her mouth. A man with dark, curly black hair and deep blue eyes was standing before her. He looked like a rock star. Grinning at her he leaned in, and whispered in her ear. \"Hello love. My name is Adam , and you're mine now.\"[Chapter 2] (Sorry for not updating regularly. I just write when the muse strikes. But i hope you all enjoy it, and I hope you all love Olive and Adam like i do! I'm going to try to start on part 3 but it may take me a while. I love you guys! Thank you all for the great reviews on the first chapter. :D I appreciate each and every one of you. Til next time ;) Enjoy!) When Olive woke up the next day, she couldn't think. Her mind was hazy and her vision was blurry. She was hung over and that was all she could tell was wrong. She was sure though that where she was, was not her home. In fact, it looks like somewhere she has never been before. The dark haired man that had got her last night walks in about the time she attempts to stand up. He beams at her and tilts his head. \"Good evening love.\" He says with a genuine tone. He's sweet, Olive would give him that, but if he had done anything to her she was prepared to take action into her own hands and kick his ass right now. \"Thank you, I guess. Good evening?\" She raises a brow at him. His manner has changed a lot since last night. \"Yes Love it's close to 10:30 p.m. You slept all day.\" He grins at her again, and she raises a brow. Was she really that wore out? Had work really been that shitty before she hit the bar last night? She sighs, looking down at her hands in her lap. \"Something wrong love?\" The man inquires as he makes his way towards her. She looks up at him and glares. \"Why do you keep calling me love?\" \"If you don't like it, I can stop.\" He smirks at her, and sits down on the couch beside of her. She looks around and sees a lot of old records and head phones, and she also notices a guitar. She turns her attention to him, and shakes her head. \"No, it's the nicest anyone, has ever called me.\" He bites into his lip, and then shakes his head. \"I'm sorry that no one has ever..\" \"It's alright.\" She said sharply. She wasn't one to have anyone pity her, much less let a member of the opposite sex. She despised most men, and that, well that was due to her father. Growing up she really had no dad. It was just her and her mom. Olive didn't feel bitter about her father no, she loved him. He was a dead beat, unless he had something to gain, he didn't give a shit. Up until she was eighteen she adored the man. After that though, she became what she is now, cold. Olive was just an accident, or so he would tell her mother. \"Olive?\" \"How do you know my name?\" \"I checked your I.D.\" \"You what? You went through my stuff?\" \"Yes…I.\" \"Oh no, no, no. You are a creep and you are going to let me out of here.\" \"You can't leave.\" \"Oh yeah. Watch me.\" Olive stood up fast, and was soon on the floor. She was shaking and her knees couldn't hold her up. What was in her drink last night? \"Love,\" \"What did you do to me?\" \"What?\" \"What. Did. You. Do. To. Me?\" \"I..\" Olive groans as the pain in her neck, literally, begins to throb. It sends chills and lashes of pain up and down her back. She turns and looks at Adam who is now standing, and holding a hand out to assist in helping her stand up. She raises a brow at Adam, and attempts to stand up on her own again. Once again more pain from her neck sends waves through her body, and she is stuck sitting against the couch on the floor. \"Adam, what are you? And what did you do to me?\" \"I'm a musician.\" \"And what you did to me?\" Olive grumbles as she sits. If he wasn't going to cooperate, neither was she. He was beginning to get on her bad side, more so now than what he had last night. \"If you want the truth you're going to have to trust me. It wasn't on purpose, I wanted to save you. To give you something to live for. You're beautiful love. I want to spend the rest of my life saving you.\" She looks at him puzzled before holding up a hand. \"You want to spend the rest of your life with me, basically what you're saying?\" \"In a matter, yes. Could you handle that?\" \"I don't even know you dude, so please just tell me why I feel like shit, besides having too many drinks last night, and I will be on my way.\" \"In time.\" \"In time? In time, what the hell does that mean? Adam!\" By the time she was done speaking, Adam had left the room. He had went outside and locked the door, bolted it from the outside. She was stuck there with nothing to do, and no one to talk to until he got back. Who knows how long it will take him doing God knows what? Or where he went at that matter. Olive grunts as she pulls herself back up onto the couch. While she's here, she figures make herself at home. That's exactly what she is planning on doing.[Chapter 3] I'm so so sorry for not uploading anything in a very long time. I've been busy and unable to write for so long now and then my computer crapped out on me that I had some of Chapter 3 wrote on, so I had to start from scratch. I truly apologize. Thank you all for the reviews, I hope you all like it! It's been hours since Olive has heard from Adam, or even saw him. She thought when he first left she may see him within an hour, but alas as the time passes, he still isn't here. She mumbles to herself before she spots it, after all he was a musician, she figured he would have one somewhere. Grinning she picks up Adam's guitar and strums it. Growing up, she never learned how to play, although she always wanted to. Maybe if Adam heard her playing his guitar, or just playing it badly he would have to show up to take it away from her, right? She could hear the bolts from the outside moving, and she laughs quietly to herself. \"Speak of the devil.\" She murmurs. \"I'm back.\" Adam says as he opens the door, quick to shut it. \"And I have food.\" He flashes her a quick grin before going into the kitchen to grab two glasses. He walks over to her and sits one glass in front of her, moves his guitar from her hands, and sits his glass down too. \"Been playing my guitar? How do you like it?\" \"I would like it better if I knew what the hell you've done to me, and why whatever you have in that bag smells delicious.\" The bag was red, deep red. Olive raises a brow to Adam's grin. \"It's a blood bag, care for a drink?\" \"A BLOOD BAG? What the hell?\" He chuckles, pouring one bag into her glass and handing it to her. Olive sniffs it for a second, the look of disgust fleeing when she takes a sip. She didn't even realize she was thirsty until the first drop touched her tongue. She looks over at him after taking a drink. \"This. Is. Delicious.\" She licks her lips after finishing her glass. \"I thought you might like it.\" He grins at her and winks. She smirks at him, and leans back in the chair. \"All fucking night, I've been so bored and unsure of what to do.\" He smirks at her and points to the blinds. \"Well, soon..we will sleep, until tomorrow night.\" She shakes her head and sighs. \"And you're going to wait until tomorrow to tell me what I am, is that correct?\" He laughs. \"You don't have a guess yet, no?\" Olive shakes her head, then sighs and nods. \"I do, but it is so cliché, and they aren't even real!\" Adam laughs as he walks over to the other couch. \"That…that is the attitude expected I suppose. For now, sleep. Tomorrow, I have things to teach you.\" Olive huffs, and mumbles under her breath. The more he says wait until tomorrow, yadda yadda yadda, the more he is beginning to piss her off. But, he was letting her stay here, and knowing what she possibly could be, she didn't want to take her chance with the sunlight. Grumbling she turns over, and closes her eyes. Tiredness hit her like a bus, and she was out.[Chapter 4] -AN: I know that you all will be mad when I post this, and I am so sorry for never updating to at least a fourth chapter or, at least giving Olive and Adam a closure- but for the past few years- I've really lacked a muse and have had so much trouble writing anything. I've felt that it wasn't good enough, and I've also not felt like myself. I hope though within 2016 I can start writing again and posting things here for everyone who has supported me. Thank you all for taking the time to read the first three chapters, and to leave me feedback. I appreciate each and every one of you and I hope you all will be along for this new journey with me, and wish me luck in writing. If I ever get muse from this idea again, I'll work on it and post for you all to see, but if not- hopefully muse will strike elsewhere soon. – END ","Summary":" I have never saw the movie \"Only Lovers Left Alive\", so this is just my OC meeting Adam. (Eve won"},{"Movie":"Only Lovers Left Alive","Title":"Only Lovers Left Alive - How It Should Have Ended","Author":"TapTapAlways","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12112531","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Here comes my new \"redo and do it properly\" ending, because the ending to \"Only Lovers Left Alive\", is rubbish. There's no blood and no Marlove and we totally need a rewrite of Hamlet before we're through, too. And I am fixing it. And that's final. Oh, and I don't own the film, obviously, or it wouldn't have ended so stupidly. This is how it would have ended if it was mine, in fact: TapTap Eve pounded on the door to the cafe, but not much of a knock was needed before the door was opened. The human writer opened with a smile, ushering them in. The place was lit by candles, and Kit Marlove was sitting by a large table, manuscripts spread out around him as he wrote. He looked up with a smile and greeted them. \"Eve, you're back. And Adam!\" \"And Adam\" Eve agreed, coming to sit next to Kit, peeking over his shoulder at his current manuscript. She was dragging Adam along with her by their linked hands, as Bilal brought out two cool bottles, so very familiar. To her great amusement and satisfaction, it seemed to be another Hamlet . Eve sat next to Kit as he wrote, drinking small sips from her bottle; it was the good stuff, from the French doctor. Her had was still liked to Adam's, where he was drinking some of his own. Adam was half-napping where he sat, still cradling her hand in his. There was the familiar heat, even this late at night, Kit's spectacular company, and the ever so pleasant weight of Adam's head at her shoulder. Oh, yes. It was so good to be home. And for once; both her homes, at the same time. Actually, that's a pretty decent ending, but I thought maybe I'd elaborate just a bit more, what do you say? TapTap[Chapter 2] I still do not own \"Only lovers left alive\", but I felt a want to play some more in their proverbial sandbox. Basically, I am writing fluff again. I do do that at lot. TapTap Eve and Adam woke up in the pleasant, soft heat of the night, looking up into the canopy over Eve's bed. They were in no hurry to rise, but eventually they did, touching each other all the while. Adam was puzzled by all the new technology of his wife, and Eve was amused while she introduced her husband to the intrigues of the new century. They stayed in, this the first full night of theirs back in her home, not venturing out until the next. The next night, Eve wrapped her scarf around her as was her custom, gripped Adam's hand, and led him out into the city. The air was still warm, and there were lights everywhere in the darkness. They talked only sporadically as Eve took her husband to all her favourite places, talking into his ear whenever needed to keep their words to themselves. Like how Adam had shown Eve around his parts of the world, driving 'round the sleeping city with its empty streets for hours during her visit, Eve took Adam around her home. They walked the city for many nights, just like they sat in her home for long hours, relishing the experience of living together. Being together was not something they had been spoiled with, through the long years of their relationship, and they both drunk in the chance. Every few days brought them back to Kit's company for more blood, but they spent very limited amounts of time there, those first few weeks. The nights were mostly silent, but there was usually the soft sound of music from afar. Yes, Eve had missed this place, just like she missed Adam, whenever they were apart. She hoped that they could both stay here, for years and years. Adam seemed to feel it too, if his hand in hers and his soft smile was anything to judge by. They belonged together, and Eve hoped that Adam would come to feel like he belonged here, like she did.[Chapter 3] And here is a very nice rabbit hole the plot bunnies seemed exceedingly determined to pull me into! I do not claim to own the film, I only own my plotbunnies... or more likely they own me! TapTap It was only several weeks after Adam's arrival and Eve's return that they sought back into company. They sat with Kit after Bilal's café had closed, joining the playwright in the candlelight he preferred for writing, watching pure art take place underneath the man's fingertips. Kit was not, much to Eve's delight, only writing a new \"Hamlet\", but several other plays as well, including an all new story about two thwarted lovers. Eve knew Kit for long enough that she'd discovered that her friend still liked the company, even though he was not the most social of men during writing, so they stayed on through several long, warm nights, chatting with Bilal and sipping blood slowly, the two lovers never far from one another. Kit was more than close enough to Eve for him to let her and her husband read the notes and finished passages, and so Eve sat by him for long periodes throughout his weeks of writing, often still liked to Adam by intertwined hands. \"Very lovely\" Adam noted from Kit's right, and the author looked up for the first time since the pair had come and joined him and Bilal for the night. Now when Kit looked up, he saw Eve a few tables over, deeply entranced in his new screenplay. \"Thank you\" the legendary writer said gracefully, smiling. \"I am hopeful for this one, I must say. Eve seems to like it. She has always did have a good eye...\" \"She does...\" Adam smiled at his wife's oldest friend, reading the newly formed sentences flowing freely from the artist's pen. \"I have always been thankful to have such a formidable woman as my friend\" Kit noted, smiling down on his scrolls almost affectionately \"you are lucky to have her for a wife\". Adam smiled, a brilliant, warm, wide smile. \"Oh, I am am. I am very grateful to have found her. I think I shall remain here for quite a while\" he looked over towards his Eve, still deeply taken by the text \"I couldn't be away from her again\". Kit Marlowe looked onto the younger vampire with an approving smile. Even the man's disposition as a romantic hero aside, Eve might just have truly gotten lucky, as well.[Chapter 4] Here comes the fluffy, happy ever after ending. I hope you've all enjoyed the story, and if you did I have more \"fixed\" film endings accessible by my profile. Also fluff, as always... I do not own \"Only Lovers Left Alive\", in fact I am returning it right now! TapTap Eve sat hand in hand with Adam, resting her cheek on his shoulder, as they read it together. The new \"Hamlet\" was even more splendid than Kit's first attempt (if you could call something so sublime an attempt at all) and Eve could clearly see the inspiration in it from Adam. Judging by her husband's slight, thoughtful smile, he could spot the plentiful references as well. \"This story is lovely, Kit\" Eve stated finally, looking up with a smile aimed at her old friend. \"I am glad you think so, Eve\" Marlowe replied, his expression pleased. \"Perhaps I will have time to write one more, before you two... relocate again?\" \"As a matter of fact\" Eve exchanged a smile with Adam, who nodded minutely. \"We are going to stay here. Adam has agreed to live here with me\". Kit's face lit with pleasure at that. He always missed Eve, when she was gone, and her missing her Adam had pained him too. Besides, he liked Adam. \"You have finally stopped living in different places, now then, seeing what the rest of us do. You clearly cannot live without each other. Well, this warrants a toast!\" As Bilal brought them three glasses of the good stuff, Adam smiled and gave his reply. \"Yes, we are incomplete without one another. I am staying right here\". Neither of the three, nor Bilal, who joined the toast with a class of cider, had any reservations against drinking to that. Adam and Eve were together, as they were always meant to be: living happily ever after.

You didn't want to be there, but your best friend had been insistent, threatening to not leave your new apartment; your new apartment that was still in boxes. It had only been a month since your relationship ended, but it felt like it was only a few seconds ago. After 6 years, it seemed like a limb had been amputated, albeit a cancerous, defective limb but a limb never the less. It only took a week to find yourself a nice two bedroom apartment, plenty big for yourself and your new kitten that you had promptly adopted so you wouldn't be so lonely. Realizing now that inviting Katie over had been a mistake as soon as you opened the door and her eyes raked the box filled livingroom. \"You've been here three weeks, when are you going to unpack?\" She had asked. \"I am unpacking…you know…as I need things.\" You pointed to a small stack of DVDs, the single plate, glass, and coffee mug that was being used resting in the dish drainer. Katie just shook her head, \"When was the last time you went out?\" \"This morning, to go to work.\" Duh. \"No, I mean like out, for fun?\" Fun? When was the last time you had fun? Maybe five years ago. \"That's it, you and me, we are going to Mackies.\" \"Why can't we just stay in? I have booze and look a kitten!\" You bent over and scooped up the small orange tabby. \"He's very cute, \"Katie scratched behind his ears. \"But I mean it, if we stay in we are unpacking.\" You had groaned all the way down the two flights of stairs, groaned the 20 minutes that it took you both to get to Mackies and groaned all the way through your first rum and coke. Now, as you nursed your seconded drink, you watched as Katie flirted with boys. You couldn't be mad at her, she was beautiful with her long golden hair, and rockin curves- she was everyone's dream come true. But something felt off…not a bad off…just a sense that someone was watching you, but you couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from or if it was the nice buzz that was building in your brain. \"Hey, that guy is looking at you.\" Katie giggled, face flushed, finally turning her attention back to you. \"Who?\" \"Behind you, sitting in the corner.\" Glancing over your shoulder, you saw who she meant. He was gorgeous. Gorgeous in an Anne Rice vampire novel kind of way, with dark long hair hanging around his face. \"Look at how he's looking at you.\" \"He is probably looking at you.\" \"No, no, it's definitely you.\" Swallowing hard, your heart was pounding; maybe she was right…but you weren't used to be the object of someone's gaze. Even in your last relationship, Cory had other things on his mind. Instinct told you to just ignore it, to wait it out until those blue eyes found someone else. \"He's coming over!\" Katie whispered excitedly, shaking your shoulder. \"Stop!\" \"Hi.\" His silky baritone voice was dripping with a gorgeous English accent your ears had ever had the privilege of hearing, He towered above you, the only odd thing you noticed was he was wearing gloves indoors. \"Hi.\" You replied meekly and saw out of the corner of your eye Katie inching away. \"You are so beautiful.\" The words seemed to fall from his lips like he had no control of them. Your face flushed a deep crimson; you couldn't find your voice, so you just smiled shyly. He didn't seem to mind. \"My name is Adam, would you mind sitting with me?\" He gestured to his table. Taking the gloved hand he offered, which sent a tingling sensation all the way to your toes, you allowed him to lead you back to where he had been sitting. The next morning you could hardly remember the rest of the night, and woke up late the next morning to the sun pouring through your bedroom window. The left side of the bed still had Adams imprint in the pillow. You laid still for a long while, trying to hear if he was still in the apartment but the only sound that filled your ears was from the kitten who was overjoyed that you were finally awake. Disappointed, and slightly ashamed, having never having a one night stand before, you shuffled to the kitchen to get a glass of orange juice. That was when you saw it: a note on the counter. Snatching it, you read the spiky handwriting so many times your head hurt. Adam asked to see you again tonight.[Chapter 2] The next few weeks every night was spent Adam, but as always in the morning he would be gone. The only evidence that there had been a man in your apartment was the notes you would find on your bedside table. The anxiety you felt during the day at finding yourself in a relationship (can you call it that?) this soon after Cory, drove you mad, but it evaporated as soon as you heard the soft knock on your door and Adam gathered you in his arms whisking you off to the bedroom. It would be early morning while the area between your legs would be aching when you would melt into him that he would tell you stories of past historical events and people. You hung on his every word, but there were more than a few times, as you sat in front of your computer at work, in the middle of the afternoon when you would wonder how in the hell could he know these things. \"Day dreaming?\" Katie stopped by your desk, the look on her face said plainly that she had been standing there a while. \"Oh, yeah I guess.\" \"Are you seeing Adam again tonight?\" \"Yeah, probably.\" Katie chewed her lip. \"What?\" You asked. \"Don't you think its weird that he only see's you at night? And that all you guys do is…\" \"Well…\" \"I mean, what does he even do during the day?\" \"I…don't…know…\" You said slowly. \"Look, I am glad you are over Cory, believe me, but I don't know, something just doesn't seem right.\" You silently agreed. Sitting on your couch, you tried to focus on what was on the TV but you couldn't, it was after dark, which only meant that Adam would be here any moment. The thought had barely left your brain when the soft knock made you jump, you nearly tripped over your coffee table in the rush to answer the door. Adam didn't say a word before covering you in kisses, pushing you toward your room, undressing you with each step. \"Wait, Adam, wait.\" \"What is it?\" His face was full of concern. \"I…just…why don't you stay in the morning?\" \"What?\" \"In the morning. You are always gone, and I don't hear from you at all during the day. Do you go home to a wife? A girlfriend? I obviously like what we are doing, but I can't be the other woman, it's not fair.\" You happen to know what it felt like. \"No, I swear it's not that.\" \"Then what is it?\" You had seen many emotions cross Adams' face, but worry was never one of them. \"What is it?\" You asked again, you started to feel cold, but you weren't confident that it was because you were standing in the hallway in just your bra and panties. \"Maybe we should sit.\" \"Okay….\" You followed him into the living room and grabbed the blanket folded on the back of the couch and wrapped yourself in it. Adam stared at his hands for what seemed like an eternity, \"You know all those stories I tell you, there's a reason why I know all those things, I was there.\" You stared at him, fairly sure your eyes were bugging out of your head and thought the urge to laugh would crack your ribs. But something in his eyes told you he was being serious. \"How is that possible?\" Adam took a deep breath, \"I am…a vampire.\" \"Excuse you?\" \"A vampire.\" It figured the first guy you slept with since Cory was certified crazy. \"Adam…\" \"I am being serious.\" He grabbed your hand, making you jump, \"Feel.\" He pressed your trembling hand to his chest and felt...nothing. \"What the fuck!\" You yelled jumping up. How could you have not noticed he didn't have a heartbeat?! Adam said nothing and stared at his now empty hand. \"Get out,\" You said shakily, \"Now.\" Adam only nodded and left your apartment quietly. It was a month before you mentioned Adam again, you tried hard to not think of him, about how much you missed him, and how during the long hours that you would lie awake your body would ache for him. \"So you were right about Adam.\" You and Katie were at Mackies for happy hour and your fourth drink made you forget your \"No Adam\" rule. \"Oh?\" \"I haven't seen him in a little over a month.\" \"Why?\" Katie tried to act surprised. \"He…\" He what? You wouldn't tell Katie that he was a vampire, she might have you committed. \"He was just involved in some iffy things that I wasn't comfortable with.\" Katie looked at you suspiciously but didn't pry. The next day you couldn't stop thinking about Adam. Suddenly an insane thought entered your brain; what was so bad with him being a vampire anyway? Did it really change how much you missed him? Or how you felt about him... \"Oh no,\" You whispered to yourself. It was late November, which meant it was dark earlier, for once you were grateful for that as you grabbed your keys and coat and ran to your car. Where you stopped, frozen in the action of putting your key in the ignition. You had no idea where he lived, Adam had always come to your apartment. Did he even have a house? In your mind, you pictured him living in a spider infest crypt in an ancient cemetery. Frustrated you slammed your hands on the steering wheel, causing your broken sun visor to fall into your lap. \"Well, that's just fucking lovely.\" You mumbled, but your eyes widened at the piece of paper taped to the underside. You recognized Adams spiky yet elegant handwriting at once, nearly screaming when you realized he had left his address. It took nearly five minutes to enter it, with shaky fingers, into your GPS. The robotic voice told you your destination was 40 minutes away, on the other side of town. You had never been on this side before, it was very run down and hardly anyone lived here. It was a hot bed for criminal activity, so you hardly stopped for stop signs and kept your doors locked and eyes opened. \"In 800ft, you destination is on the right.\" Your heart was beating so hard it was actually painful, as the only house with lights on the street came into view. The tires of your car scraped the curb as you pulled off to the side. There was a shadow moving in the upstairs window, so you knew he was home. Making sure you remembered to lock your car you half ran up the steps and knocked or rather pounded on the cracked wooden door. There was movement on the inside and the sound of wood creaking as Adam walked to the door and opened it. He stared at her like he couldn't believe she was there. \"Hi,\" You said sheepily. \"Hi.\" \"I'm sorry.\" Adam held up a hand, \"Don't be, I understand. I am surprised you are here, though.\" \"You left your address.\" \"I know…but that was before.\" \"I miss you.\" You blurted, resisting the urge to fling yourself at him. Relief seemed to wash over him, \"I missed you too.\" You nearly stumbled up the steps and melted into him. \"Do you want to come in?\" \"Yes, please.\" You allowed Adam to pull you inside, up the creaky wooden steps, and onto his bed.[Chapter 3] So this part was based on the imagine that your ex-shows up unannounced at your home. It was a couple days before you broke the news to Katie that you were back together with Adam. You took her lecture with grace and promised her it was simply a misunderstanding. Adam had surprised you by inviting her along on nighttime outings, and after a few weeks Katie was finally won over; even if she found the fact that Adam was only around at night suspicious. One of your favorite things to do with Adam, on the nights that you stayed at either your apartment or his house (you didn't stay there much, even though he had bought food and drinks for you for when you would visit, the sight of the blood bags in the fridge made you a smidge uncomfortable) was to watch popular vampire flicks, if nothing else to see his reaction. You started with the original Nosferatu , a 1922 silent film, and other than he mouth hanging open, you did get him to laugh with your creative dialog. Then came the 1932 Dracula , then Salem's Lot , 30 Days of Night , True Blood , and then finally Twilight , the latter caused the best reaction in which he almost fell over the coffee table to turn it off when Edward showed off his sparkly self-causing you to collapse in an intense laughing fit. It was almost three months to the day when you turned up on Adam's doorstep when the text messages started from Cory. He had found out you were dating, that one of his friends had seen you with Adam at Mackies and he was offended that after only 6 months of being broken up you would dare to be in a relationship. You deleted the texts, mostly without reading them, causing Cory to get angry. You didn't let on to Adam what was going on, but he knew from your body language that something was up. \"It's a shame we can't go out for food,\" You said one night, wistfully watching a commercial for your favorite eatery, your stomach rumbling. \"We can go out.\" \"And just have you sit there while I eat? I don't think so.\" \"How about you order in? I'll even call it in for you.\" \"Well, I can't say no to that.\" After 10 minutes of deciding between Chinese food and pizza, (you chose Chinese), you wrote down what you wanted and handed the list to Adam. \"It will be here in a half an hour.\" \"Good, come here and watch TV with me.\" Adam settled in on the couch, pulling you onto his lap, and started kissing your neck causing you to moan. His cool long fingered hand slid under your sweatshirt to caress one breast then the other while your bottom ground against his lap, causing his hands to tangle in your hair, moaning against your neck. You both almost didn't hear the first round of pounding on the door. \"I know you're in there! I saw your car in the parking lot!\" Cory's voice made you jump up. \"Who is that?\" \"Cory, my ex.\" Adam looked at you, then fixed a frightening glare at the door, such a glare that you half expected it to burst into flames and stood. \"What are you doing?\" \"I am going to answer the door,\" He replied simply, a hand on the door knob. Your stomach dropped when the door swung open and you saw Cory's face, whose eyes flicked between you and Adam. \"What the fuck are you doing here?\" Adam's voice was dripping with venom. \"I just had to see if this was true, that she managed to find someone else. I didn't quite believe it at first.\" Cory gestured at you. \"And what the fuck is that supposed to mean?\" \"Oh, please, by now you know what I am talking about.\" Cory tried to push past Adam and get inside your apartment, but Adam held his ground. \"No, I really don't think I do know what you are talking about.\" Pushing Cory back out into the hall. \"Oh, come on you can't be serious.\" \"Try me.\" In all the time you had spent with Adam, he never seemed more supernatural than he did as he loomed over Cory, and you had to admit, you loved Cory looking like he was going to crap his pants. Cory mumbled something he seemed to afraid to say any louder, and took one last glare at you and left. Adam closed the door and quickly took you in his arms, it wasn't long before there was another knock at the door. \"Oh, it's just the food.\" You sighed relieved, as you saw the usual delivery driver when Adam opened the door, worried Cory might have come back with one of his friends. Once everything was paid and you settled onto the couch with your food, you realized Adam hadn't stopped looking at you. \"Why don't you move in with me?\" He asked when your mouth was full of rice and broccoli. You choked down the food, \"What?\" \"Move in with me.\" \"What?\" \"Look, Cory knows where you live; which makes me pretty uncomfortable for during the day, to be honest.\" \"What about Butters?\" You pointed at the orange tabby asleep on the window sill. \"He can come too, of course. And it actually would cut about 10 minutes off your drive to work.\" \"You've been thinking about this before tonight?\" \"Yes.\" He smiled widely. \"Okay then,\" You said matching his smile. \"Really?\" \"Yes!\" Adam almost knocked the plate of food out of your hands in his excitement to kiss you. It only took a day and one small moving truck to take all your things to Adam's house, and he was waiting outside to help bring the boxes inside. Adam had picked up the place since the last time you had been over, all of his instruments and music recording equipment had been organized, the kitchen had been fully stocked with food, and, speaking of the kitchen… \"A second refrigerator?\" You asked staring at the new stainless steel appliance. \"Yes, that one is yours, and the old one is mine.\" \"Thank you.\" You stood on your tippy toes to reach his lips and squealed when he picked you up and wrapped your legs around his waist to carry you to the bedroom. \"New sheets?\" You laughed when he dropped you on the bed. \"I love you.\" It took a moment for you to find your voice, \"I love you too.\" Adam couldn't stop smiling even as he kissed you, and couldn't stop smiling until dawn broke; and even as he slept you could still see a smile on his face.[Chapter 4] You were settled into the couch in front of the TV you had snuck into the house almost the day after you had moved in, Adam and his friend Ian's voices murmured from the far corner of the living room where Adam had all of his music things. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw Adam pass him a wad of cash for another priceless instrument, something Adam seemed to have an endless supply of money for. You didn't mind, though, there were many nights where you would be curled up, watching Adam play and record his music, feeling the vibrations of each strum of the cords tingle throughout your body. But tonight the TV was on your favorite show, and Butters was curled in your lap purring happily. And that was when it happened. The trailer for the new James Bond film. You had seen all of them, from the originals down to the one a couple years ago. And it was opening this weekend. You grabbed your phone and checked the movie times for the theater in town, and screamed for a second when you saw they were having a special midnight showing. This was it. You had to go. Jumping up sent Butters spilling onto the floor, causing him to glare at you and slink off to the bedroom. \"Adam, we aren't doing anything this weekend right?\" He opened his mouth to answer, but you cut him off, \"No? Good, we are going to see the new James Bond movie. They are having a midnight showing, and we are going.\" \"Uh…no,\" He said slowly. \"Uh….yes.\" \"I hate going to the movies.\" \"Oh come on. It's one movie\" \"No.\" \"Please?\" \"No.\" \"Please?\" \"No.\" \"Pretty please?\" \"No.\" \"Pretty please with me on top?\" \"Tempting but no.\" You crossed your arms glaring at him. \"Well, not that I wouldn't be happy to be in the middle of a domestic dispute, I gotta get out of here.\" Ian said awkwardly standing, and said his goodbyes to you and Adam, and left. \"Fine.\" You said, but you had an idea of how to get him to give in. You settled in his lap, and started kissing him, moving away from his lips and kissed his jaw line to his ear, and gave a soft tug on the lobe with your teeth, causing Adams breath to become heavier. \"I guess we can just stay in, and do this I guess.\" You did your best sexy voice as you breathed in his ear, a hand sliding down his torso, feeling the bulge that had already formed under his jeans. \"See that's exactly what I'm saying.\" He moaned, as you continued to nip here and there on his neck, as you hand easily undid the button and fly of his pants, letting his length spring free. \"I guess, we could spend all night doing this.\" Your lips found his again, you tongue tracing his thin bottom lip, your fingers lightly traveling up and down his shaft. A loud tortured moan ripped from his throat. \"But, I am really not in the mood,\" You said brightly, standing up, walking away from him, \"I think I'll be too depressed from not seeing James Bond.\" You couldn't even turn to look at him because you knew the face he would be making, and laughing would ruin the point you were trying to make. \"Fine. We will go.\" Adam said stiffly, \"Now come back over here, you can't leave me like this.\" \"No,\" You sighed, turning back to him, smiling widely, \"I guess I cant.\" You went back to him, full with the intent to finish what you started.[Chapter 5] \"What about this place? It has a cabin right on the beach, which is private, so we can do late night swimming. I can just lay on the beach all day and read.\" You scrolled up and down the webpage advertising for a cute little beach cottage, one bed, one bath (with a jacuzzi). It wouldn't matter that your vampire boyfriend couldn't be at the beach during the day if you could be with him in the water at night. \"Aren't you worried about sharks?\" Adam asked as he stood in front of his fridge sipping out of a small glass. \"Not really, besides I'll have you there to protect me.\" You smiled, and started filling out the reservation form, but out of the corner of your eye you could see Adam fidgeting, \"Whats wrong?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Oh come on, I know that look.\" \"It is stupid.\" \"Just tell me.\" \"It's about the beach…\" \"Okay….\" He took a deep breath, \"I can't swim.\" You stared at him, not sure if he was joking, \"Are you lying?\" \"No.\" \"You are five hundred years old, and not once did you find the time to learn how to swim?\" Adam glared at you, \"I didn't think you'd be the one to make fun of me.\" He turned and tossed his glass in the sink. \"I am not making fun of you, I'm just surprised.\" \"No one knew how to swim in those days, and if you did it was a sign of the devil.\" \"Oh, and being a vampire wasn't?\" That earned you another glare, \"I just never saw the need.\" \"Well, I'll tell you what, come to the beach with me and I'll teach you how.\" \"You can't be serious.\" \"Dead. Serious.\" One week later, feeling a little sore from the sun at the beach that day you led Adam to the water. \"Don't look so worried, it's not like you can drown.\" You gave a loud laugh at your joke. \"Very funny.\" Adam grumbled the whole way out into the water, and when he was about chest deep, you let go of his hand. \"Okay, now just copy what I do.\" You started to doggy-paddle and take a few strokes in the water, and it wasn't long before Adam was swimming circles around you. \"I thought you said you couldn't swim?\" You were out of breath trying to keep up with him. \"I'm a quick study, especially with a good teacher.\" He swam up to you and you wrapped your legs around his waist, laying on your back in the water, and let him twirl you around in the water, your hair blooming around you. \"Is it as bad as you thought?\" \"The water? No, I mean it could be better, though.\" He said lightly. \"Oh?\" \"Mhm.\" His hands traveled from your waist down your thighs and traveled lightly to the delicate skin of your inner thighs. You laughed, \"You are right, it could be better.\" This was going to be an amazing vacation.

She was unsure to start with. Nervous of making a blunder, like she had at Ascot, although that seemed to have gained her an admirer as much as anything else. As time went on and she made no errors she felt her confidence grow. She sounded like a Lady and she looked like a Lady, so they all thought she was. When the Queen of Transylvanian had made her entrance and saw fit to grace her with her attention, Eliza had felt so light headed with happiness she could have floated away. Her eyes sought her teacher's and he stood admiring her openly, with a glow of pride. She felt her cheeks flush just a little and dropped her gaze, smiling to herself. Do you see me yet, Henry Higgins? She thought to herself. Is that the regard of a man for a woman or a creator for his piece of work? She felt a cold slice of doubt but resolved to put it to one side. If this were to be her last night in High Society, before she was kicked back out into the street, she would enjoy it. \"Excuse me, Miss?\" She turned at the interruption and recognised the man with a little start. \"Her Majesty would like a word with you.\" She nodded numbly and followed. Higgins' words about her head being cut off if she were caught sang through her blood but she hid the terror. Her eye caught her Professor's as they led her away and he seemed bewildered as well. The walk to the dais seemed long and she bowed at the end as she ought. \"My son would like to dance with you.\" Her eyes flew to the young man behind his Mother. He was giving her a warm smile, albeit slightly embarrassed. A Prince. A Prince wanted to dance with her. Her. The squashed cabbage leaf of Covent Garden! He took her arm gracefully, leading her out onto the floor, and she felt like she was simultaneously floating and wound tight as a spring. \"Please don't be nervous of me,\" the Prince murmured as others around them began to dance as well and some of the attention was diverted. Eliza was surprised at being addressed but smiled. \"I am nervous of getting the dance steps wrong,\" she replied shyly, a little in awe. \"I am sorry for the…,\" he stumbled over the word, \"duty of having my Mother ask you to dance for me. Were I in my own country I would have asked. The customs are strange here.\" His English was very good, although the accent was clearly in evidence. She wondered what Higgins would think of it. His honesty helped her to relax a little. \"That's better,\" he smiled, and she felt giddy for a moment before pulling herself back. \"I am dancing with a Prince, you know,\" she told him with a slightly teasing edge, \"I am going to be nervous.\" She felt his grip tighten a fraction and then release. \"Miss Doolittle, you are the most beautiful and charming English woman I have ever come across.\" She blushed, trying to keep some of her stoic demeanour and failing. \"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"You are too kind.\" \"None of that,\" he told her firmly, looking down into her eyes. \"If my life were my own I would court you, Miss Doolittle.\" She felt her head tingle with shock. \"Pardon?\" \"You seem unaware of your beauty, your charm. You're a delight. Were it my choice! As it is I should like to get to know you better, even without courting being an option.\" \"Oh, no, you can't .\" It came out quite forcefully, full of horror, and the look of insult on the Prince's face was immense. \"Is that so?\" He was frosty. Eliza averted her eyes, kept them downcast, the truth spilling out accidentally. \"I am a complete imposter, your Highness. I am not worthy of your regard.\" To her relief he laughed, he thought she was joking. She imagined him coming to court her in Convent Garden, in her old clothes, with a basket on her arm. \" Aow! Look. Eliza's got herself a Prince she 'as. Proper fancy man.\" The thought made her smile at the absurdity, even as the sadness settled in the pit of her stomach at the truth of it. \"An imposter are you?\" he chuckled. \"I see. Well, I shan't have you thrown out.\" His eyes caught something over her head and he became a little more serious. \"What of the Gentleman that brought you here? Are you worthy of his regard?\" Eliza wished she could see what he could see over her shoulder. \"Oh no,\" she shook her head. \"The difference between him and yourself, your Highness, is that he knows I'm not.\" The Prince dropped his gaze back to her and she got the sudden impression that were they alone he would kiss her. She didn't know how she felt about that. \"He is a fool then.\" He paused before adding, \"However, his eyes have followed you this entire dance so maybe he is not so sure.\" The dance finished, and he released her. \"Miss Doolittle, thank you for the pleasure of your company.\" \"The honour was mine,\" she replied with a smile and a bow. \"Just remember what I have said,\" he spoke quietly and pressed a kiss to her hand. \"Whether you think you are worthy or not.\" As he walked back to his Mother she found herself swamped by people asking her questions. It wasn't long after that Professor Higgins asked her to dance. She had enjoyed dancing with the Prince but when she danced with the Professor it felt like she belonged there. She allowed herself to imagine, allowed herself to believe, that the Prince was right. She allowed herself to enjoy it. In the back of her mind the whisper remained, ready for when they got home.

I have tried my best with portraying the accent but it may not have quite worked. Anyway, enjoy! A reminder ' All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?' Eliza Doolittle was on the edge of tears; the sort she didn't think she'd ever cried before. She sat in the armchair in front of the fire, buried under blankets, her hands cupping a scalding mug of a chocolate drink. She hadn't known that chocolate could come in liquid form. The fire crackled charmingly, warming her face to a pinkish glow. A wood fire, no less. Not a coal in sight. It was giving off a pleasing smell instead of dirty black smoke. The snow drifted past the window, pure and silent. Beautiful and wonderful. Thick woollen socks in her feet cocooned them so they felt toasted to perfection. Her heart felt so full she could not contain it. She did not deserve this, not her, the dirty guttersnipe, and yet she had been overwhelmingly blessed. She felt a tear spill over her too full eyes and trickle down her cheek, hot and happy. A release of joy. \"What the devil is the matter with you now, silly girl?\" Henry Higgins exploded in exasperation at her from the other side of the fire. Eliza gave a small start but refrained from wiping away the tear. It was a good tear. \"Nufin' at all,\" she replied steadily, quietly, trying to control her accent and failing. \"Well, there must be something the matter. Women don't go weeping all over the place over nothing. What is it? The chocolate not chocolaty enough?\" Pickering watched the interchange quietly from his own chair a little further away, an inkling in his own mind. \"I'm not weeping all over the place,\" Eliza snapped in ire. \"I'm just…\" Her eyes fell away to the fire. \"Well?\" Higgins enquired impatiently, a derisive tone lacing the word. Eliza cupped her drink more tightly and shut her eyes. He would mock her and deride her, but the words spilled out anyway in a prayer of thanks. \"I have a warm face,\" she murmured, \"warm hands,\" her voice cracked a little, \"and warm feet.\" She opened her eyes and they shone delicately as she regarded her teacher. \"It is more than I deserve. More than…I've ever had.\" Pickering regarded the look on Higgin's face. It was the same one he'd worn when Eliza had thrown her basket at him the first day they'd met. \"A reminder,\" Pickering repeated quietly, without quite meaning to and received a sharp look from Higgins in response but no words. The Professor for once had none to give. Eliza wasn't listening in any case. Her eyes had found the fire again as her summary whispered from her lips in a single exhaled breath. \"It's loverly.\" ","Summary":" A/N I am setting this very close to the start of Eliza moving in, although I've taken a liberty wit"},{"Movie":"My Fair Lady","Title":"Propriety","Author":"El loopy","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12771828","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N Not quite sure whether this works in the canon timeline but I am setting it very near to the beginning of Eliza's time at Wimpole Street. I have tried my best with the accent. Enjoy. Propriety Eliza woke up. It was a sudden start of a wake up. She hadn't quite lost the habit born from years of hard living. Sleep was never deep or easy and the slightest sound out of the ordinary would rouse her in an instant. On this occasion it was an air of excitement that had descended over the house. Maybe she had heard two servants walk past her door talking with quick, breathless voices. Maybe she had heard the Colonel's excited yell of \"By George!\" (although she was not to know of this until later). Eliza only knew that the house felt different. She slipped out of bed with a shiver and quickly pulled on her dressing gown. The window seemed a good place to start and as she tugged the curtains apart she came face-to-face with the cause of the uproar. \"Aow!\" exploded from her mouth unbidden and with a frown. Snow was falling. Nasty, wet, cold, dirty snow. Falling for quite some time too by the look, and it had settled. Was this what all the excitement was about? 'enry 'iggins was going to have some very sharp, well-aimed barbs prepared for his household being upheaved over a little snow. Eliza gave a small smile at the thought. Eliza's prediction was correct. She was down at breakfast, listening to the incessant, excitable chatter of the servants as they crowded the breakfast room, when in stepped the Professor. \"What is this infernal racket?\" Everyone fell instantly silent. \"Why the Devil are you in here?\" No one felt brave enough to say. Eliza watched the proceedings faintly amused, before speaking up herself from her seat at the table. \"I believe they're admirin' the snow.\" His scorching gaze turned on her. \"This is best winder in the house fer doing so,\" she continued and then added, just to enrage him further, \"I tol' 'em I didn't mind.\" \"Oh, you did, did you?\" Eliza looked at him challengingly, a small smile on her lips. He recognised the bait and refused to bite. \"Out! Damn you all. Everyone out!\" The maids scattered in every direction, like the snow outside. As the last one disappeared out the door Professor Higgins followed and bellowed into the corridor after them, \"The next person I hear mention the word snow shall be unceremoniously dropped in it. Am I understood?\" The silence was all that was left, with Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle regarding each other across the breakfast table. \"Why must you throw my house into an uproar?\" Eliza took a sip of tea, her table manners much improved. \"Like to see that look on yer face,\" she replied coolly. \"You little wretch,\" he proclaimed but with little venom. \"At least you don't seem to be losing your head over this snow business. Why the silliest creatures become invariably more so when the sky produces white is beyond me.\" At that moment the colonel appeared at the door to the breakfast room, a beaming smile on his face. \"Snow, Higgins! It's snowing!\" \"Well observed Pickering.\" \"Why, isn't it glorious?\" The Colonel strode to the very window the maids had recently vacated and stared out. \"Isn't it beautiful?\" Eliza had to hide her smile at the look on Henry's face. \"Oh, Pickering. Not you,\" his voice was heavy with disappointment and the Colonel looked at him in surprise. \"Not me what?\" \"I'm 'fraid Colonel Pickerin',\" Eliza interjected, \"that the Professor don't approve of such silly behaviour as losin' ones 'ead over 'white from ter sky.' Put the wind up the servants 'e did.\" Henry glared at Eliza and she merely blinked calmly back. \"Oh tosh, old man!\" Pickering smiled. \"Give the servants a holiday – let them enjoy it.\" \"I would ask you not to make such ludicrous suggestions in my presence again,\" Higgins replied in disgusted disbelief, \"and certainly don't let the staff hear you.\" Pickering shrugged, still smiling. \"No snow in India, Higgins. Haven't seen it in years.\" His eyes lit on Eliza. \"You must at least give Miss Doolittle the morning off, so we can go enjoy it.\" Eliza's good humour vanished. \"What?\" \"Don't say 'what' say 'pardon',\" Higgins chastised before adding derisively, \"I imagine you would like that wouldn't you, you insect, to go waste the morning in the snow…\" \"No.\" Her voice interrupted him. Stern. Solid. Final. \"No, what?\" he snapped. \"No, I would not like to go out in the snow.\" The room was silent for a good few seconds before the Colonel exclaimed, \"Why ever not Miss Doolittle?\" at the same time that Higgins remarked, \"Occasionally she does surprise me with a whit of sense.\" \"Dirty 'orrid stuff is snow.\" Eliza answered the Colonel's question. Soot stained black, churned up in the gutters, slush under carriage wheels. Icy, cold, slippery mud. So pure white and beautiful in the sky before being trodden under foot. Sullied and trampled. Like all of them round where she'd come from. It was a depressing reminder. \"Wet'n'cold,\" she continued. \"Soaks through yer boots and socks in but a moment, then you have ter walk in ice all day with nowhere ter dry. Not like we 'ad any fires.\" Higgins nodded. \"See. Sensible girl. Let's get to lessons.\" \"Now, now, Higgins. Wait a moment.\" Pickering sat next to Eliza at the table. His heart went out to the poor girl who did not know that snow could be enjoyed as an adult – even one as old as him. \"Miss Doolittle, if I can promise you a warm bath and dry socks when you return indoors, will you join me outside in the snow?\" She cut him a suspicious look. \"Colonel…\" she began. \"Please?\" he interrupted gently. \"I shall look a very foolish old man out there alone.\" \"Indeed, you would,\" Higgins remarked derisively, unwittingly helping his friend's cause. Eliza glared at her teacher before turning back to the Colonel. \"If that's what you'd like I can be obligin'\" \"Capital!\" Pickering exclaimed and hurried from the room hollering, \"Mrs Pearce, our coats if you please…\" Eliza stood by the back door of the house, utterly dumbfounded. These toffs even had better snow. It lay in an expansive sheet over the small back garden, pure and white, only marred by tiny sets of bird prints. It wasn't soot stained or black. She reached out a finger and touched the tiny pile on the railings. It fell apart like powder. \"Best sort of snow this,\" Pickering remarked and lent her his arm. \"Aoh! We mus'n't spoil it,\" Eliza protested but Pickering smiled. \"Walking in it is part of the fun, Miss Doolittle.\" He led her out into the garden. He was right, it was fun. The crunch under her feet gave her a shiver of delight. \"Miss Doolittle,\" the Colonel interrupted her quiet enjoyment, \"have you ever built a snowman?\" The laughter coaxed Henry Higgins out of his study and to the back door. There on the lawn was a snowman of moderate height, adorned with one of Pickering's hats…and was that his pipe? \"Where did you get that from?\" he snapped, trying to ignore the chill air and his lack of a coat. \"Oh, come now Higgins, it's for the cause.\" \"Not from me it isn't. Now tell Eliza to fetch my damn pipe and come inside for her lessons. There has been enough of this silliness for one…\" The snowball hit him square on the chest, spraying wet, icy powder into his face. He stalled in shock before his eyes met his attackers. Eliza stood in a braced position, cheeks flushed pink from the cold, eyes on fire. He had ignored her presence to his peril. A new snowball was loaded into her hands. \"Now, 'ere's a funny thing,\" she said with a bite. \"Ain't forgotten this.\" Henry was annoyed…and yet strangely exhilarated by the sight of her standing there, challenging him. \"You wretch! You ungrateful wretch. Put that weapon down this instant…\" He just had time to dodge the snowball and it shattered on the wall behind him. \"Pickering!\" he bellowed but the older man was laughing too hard to respond. \"Right, it is to be war then.\" He felt the third snowball hit his shoulder as he gathered the snow on the railing and threw it at his adversary. He missed, and she shrieked with laughter. \"This is payback 'enry 'iggins, you'll see.\" Snowballs flew between them but before many minutes Henry's supply by the door was gone and Eliza still had the whole garden at her disposal. \"I demand that you desist with this tomfoolery at once,\" he bellowed but merely got a victorious laugh in reply. \"Surrender then.\" He bristled. That wasn't going to happen, and he'd be damned if he would retreat. There seemed to be only one course of action open to him. With long strides he stepped out into the garden, ignoring the cold and icy water soaking into his slippers. Eliza yelped in shock as he approached her, the momentary paralysis being her undoing. With an unceremonious gesture the Professor swept her off the floor, into his arms and, with one hearty shriek from herself, deposited her in the nearest, deepest snowdrift. \"I say Sir!\" Pickering protested. \"That ain't roight,\" Eliza said breathlessly from the snow, her voice feeble with her accusation. \"Ain't proper.\" Henry grinned down at her. \"Of the two of us you are the most covered in snow. I win.\" \"I'm a good girl, I am,\" she stared up at him, hair a tangled mess, strands plastered to her flushed face. \"Good girls don't throw snowballs like that,\" he responded with a quiet, teasing tone. There was a change then, in the air, in her face. He felt the spark of it, the flare, and suddenly this was a whole lot less innocent. \"Higgins!\" Pickering gave his timely interruption. \"You cannot just go tossing young women in the snow.\" \"And why ever not?\" the Professor rallied, taking the excuse to step away from a hazardous situation. \"You saw. She attacked me.\" \"Are you all right my dear?\" the Colonel asked, helping Eliza to her feet. \"Yes, yes,\" she answered too quickly, unable to stop the teeth chatter. \"Quick my dear, let's get you inside before you take ill.\" Pickering bustled her into the house, and handed her over to Mrs Pearce, followed closely by Higgin's who was starting to shiver himself now the adrenaline had died. What had he been thinking throwing her in the snow like that? \"Professor?\" The voice stilled him in the hallway and he glanced up to see Eliza on the stairs, wrapped in a towel over her clothes. She grinned at him. \"I'll win next time. You wait an' see,\" and she allowed herself to be swept away. Higgin's couldn't quite keep the smile off his own face as he went to change. Propriety could go hang.

He almost collided with Rose, one of his maids. 'Damn. Be careful, you silly girl.' He snapped at her and continued his way to the anteroom. Pickering was waiting for him there. He seemed considerably nervous and impatient. 'What did it take you for so long, Higgins? You told your mother that we were going to arrive at seven o'clock and now 'he looked at his watch' It is quarter to seven. How will we get there in fifteen minutes? 'Blast it, Pickering. Mother has already got used to it. I do never arrive in time, it doesn't matter where I go.' 'It's not proper, old chap. We, British people are famous for our manners and precision. You have already disproved the first one… and now I must question your precison too.' The colonel chuckled. 'Seriously, what did it take you for so long? Even Miss Doolittle could get dressed faster. Higgins' face slightly flushed. Truth is truth, most men didn't need an hour to get ready in order to have dinner at their mothers' home. But that evening was different… he didn't want to admit anyone including himself that he wanted to look neat because of his former pupil, Eliza Doolittle. He hadn't seen her very much recently. Eliza had been engaged with that poor devil, Freddy Eynsford-Hill for two weeks. Higgins had always denied that Freddy had any character, and declared that if he tried to do any useful work some competent person would have the trouble of undoing it: a procedure involving a net loss to the community, and great unhappiness to Freddy himself. He had been infatuated with Eliza since their first encounter at Ascot. As Higgins experienced it, Eliza hadn't cared too much about that idiotic boy until the Embassy Ball. But after the Embassy Ball Eliza got angry and bolted, due to an unpleasant but common misunderstanding between men and women. Moreover she accepted his proposal. Higgins was sure that their marriage wouldn't take for too long – he thought that Freddy would run away with a social climbing heiress. But the reason why they had to break off their engagement was totally unexpected and ridiculous. That reason was Freddy's mother, Mrs Eynsford-Hill. She was completely against the idea of greeting a former flower girl as her daughter-in-law. She didn't want her son to work in flower shop. It didn't matter that Eliza's father was a wealthy and popular citizen of London. What a sad dog. He was a grown-up, handsome man from a well-placed family. He could get anyone he yearned for – with the exception of Eliza – and he kept hovering about his mother like some kind of silly dog. 'If he had really loved Eliza, he would have risked disowning. 'Higgins said to himself. He exulted when he heard that Eliza wouldn't marry Freddy – deep in his soul, of course. He was aware of the fact that he had to solace her. He did his best to make her feel better… after he had told his favourite supercilious monologue about the foolishness of youth. The reducing of the number of their meeting was not because of their conflicts, but Eliza's job. She was surprised by Pickering who bought her a flower shop and a small flat above it. Eliza wasn't disposed to accept it at first, but the colonel was adamant and didn't accept rejection. However Eliza didn't know how to keep a flower shop. She wasn't talented in business or in arithmetic, so it brought only little income. But Eliza was working night and day to gain enough money to keep her shop and her flat – she didn't let the colonel support her again. By the way, her relationship with Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering didn't change very much. When she came back to Higgins, she told him that she was still planning to marry Freddy and had no intention to go back to Wimpole Street but she was quite willing to meet them on friendly terms and to let bygones be bygones. Higgins half laughed and half cried. He was pleased that he didn't lose Eliza's affection and respect, but he was sad that Eliza was still the fiancée of that poor devil – Higgins would had died, if anybody had realized it. Now Eliza possessed a flat, but had no time for her friends and acquaintances – including her former teacher. That was the first time in that month when Eliza had enough time and energy to spend an evening with her friends. Eliza, Pickering, Higgins, and his mother were consuming their dinner calmly in a cosy atmosphere. 'I'm glad that you are here, my dear.' said Mrs Higgins. 'I would like to thank you for that lovely evening, madam. The dinner is delicious. Unfortunately I have no time for cooking something after work.' 'It's one of the drawbacks of living alone, Eliza' Higgins tried to peck with her. 'You have to take care of yourself. If you lived with my mother or me, you would…' 'Henry' Mrs Higgins lifted up her voice. 'You know exactly that Eliza can't move to you… people would start gossiping.' 'She could move to you.' answered back Henry who didn't dare to say it aloud, but he feared for her very much. There were so many dangers for a young lady… particularly other fellows. If she had been in the near of his mother, she could had kept an eye on her latent admirers. 'How is business, Miss Doolittle?' Pickering desperately tried to broach another subject. 'I wish I could say that everything was alright, but I don't want to lie.' Forced gaiety appeared on her face. 'I can't save as much money as I wish to, although I can finance my expenses.' 'That's great news, isn't it?' The colonel smiled and caressed Eliza's hand. 'It is true that my situation isn't wholly ineligible. I have constant customers. All of them are true gentlemen.' A fork was dropped by Higgins accidentally, and it fell onto the clean tablecloth. The professor's mouth remained opened. 'Henry 'Mrs Higgins was to put Henry in his place… again.' What have you done? It is a beautiful tablecloth and you have slubbered it… you ought to be more careful. Close your mouth.' Henry immediately closed his mouth and picked up his fork. When he checked himself, he turned to Eliza. 'Am I right? Are you visited by men?' 'Yes, Professor Higgins 'Eliza's voice was calm and stonily.' Is it a problem for you? If they didn't buy my flowers, I would perish with hunger.' 'Eliza 'Higgins' manner was his usual superior one. 'I suppose you have never wondered, that those blasted chaps don't come to your shop to admire your flowers, but physical appearance. 'What do you mean by that, professor? 'Eliza narrowed her eyes and her voice was challenging. 'By George, Eliza, look at the mirror – you are an attractive, young, pleasant woman who is often visited by young, good-looking fellows. I suppose, they just need an excuse to see you daily. I suppose, they often compliment on you and pay their address to you. Tell me the truth: sometimes you encourage those fools, don't you?' 'Higgins' Pickering joined the conversation too. He felt that he needed to stop his friend and avoid a scandal. Eliza was so shocked that she could hardly say a word. 'What do you take me for? Do you really think that I would coquet or use my beauty to manipulate somebody, like a…' 'Like an ordinary woman.' mocked Higgins. 'Henry, if you don't behave yourself, I shall send you home.' Mrs Higgins was really close to lose her temper. Why does her son keep destroying her relationships and parties? 'Higgins didn't mean it… did you, Higgins?' asked Pickering sharply. Higgins sighed and started to thrumb, but didn't say a word. Everybody was eating silently, but there was rather an awkward silence. After dinner Higgins asked Pickering to call a taxi for them. Pickering got the message disappeared.. Mrs Higgins found it indecent that his son bossed an elderly gentleman around, but Henry gave her a knowing look too. Mrs Higgins nodded and left Eliza and Henry alone. The professor – like every time when he had to make a conversation about an unpleasant thing – began to walk about and jingle his money and his keys in his trouser pockets. 'Eliza, I might have said something vituperative, but I didn't wish to hurt you.' Of course he wished to. He wanted to make her feel wounded as much as he had been earlier when he had heard that Freddy had proposed to her. ' If I were less stubborn… ' thought Higgins. He couldn't stand when another man tried to make compliments on her or even looked at her that way. 'Professor Higgins, you know exactly that I am a good girl.' Eliza's soft smile reflected that she wasn't angry with him at all. 'I'm grateful you are not angry' Higgins laughed nervously.' To tell the truth, I don't like being cross with you. But Eliza, I do really fear for you… I know, you are a good girl, but there are several bad boys in London.' Eliza fondled his arm. 'It's very kind of you, but I'm able to take care of myself.' Eliza's face radiated happiness and gratitude. She was so lovely in that moment that Higgins wanted to kiss her on her lips. Instead, he looked at her tiny hand and cleaned his throat. 'Eliza, I haven't gained good experiences with women through the years. Most of them are idiots, hypocrites, goody-goodies, and liars. My mother is a great person and she has never let me down. You are very similar to her… and it's the greatest compliment I could say to a lady.' Higgins scratched his head and took a step back. 'When I came here tonight, I had a lurking thought. Actually, I have had it on the brain for a long time. I would like to ask a question now. Look, I have never admired any woman as much as I admire you... with the exception of my mother. I often hear people saying \" she is beautiful inside and outside\" … I used to consider it a blasted triteness … but nowadays I have realized that I was a fool.' Higgins looked at the floor. There were tears in Eliza's eyes. She smiled fondly, but didn't dare to touch him. 'I suppose, I know what you are talking about… and yes.' Higgins looked up and gave his former pupil a yellow looks. 'Do you know what you said yes to?' 'I told you, I understood you very well. I guess what is in your mind and what you wanted to say.' Higgins blinked, but wanted to make it crystal clear. 'I have just offered my hand, Eliza.' Eliza bit her lip and nodded with teary eyes. 'It was as clear as day.' 'And you said yes , didn't you?' 'Yes, I did… Henry.' Henry was dumbfounded when Eliza used his first name, but after all, it was justifiable. It was justifiable and such a damned pleasant thing to hear. He put his hands in his pocket. 'I suppose, we should say goodbye to my mother.' Before they left the lunchroom, Henry opened his mouth once more. 'I shall buy an engagement ring for you tomorrow.'

Chapter 1 This is my idea, what happened after the last scene of My Fair Lady. I hope you will like it and will consider it better, than my previous one ;) \" Where the devil are my slippers?\" asked Professor Henry Higgins, then leaned back in his chair, pulled his hat to his head, as if he was preparing for taking a nap. Eliza immediately saw through it and recognized the confusion and despair blanching over by the air of patronage. She was watching him with that sort of vexed love which is used by mothers when they see their children making mischief. She could almost hear the thoughts his mind. \"By George, I'm caught up with listening to her voice on the phonograph. This squashed cabbage leaf knows exactly how much I'll miss her, if it walks out of my life… now I suppose, you're expecting some kind of silly, twee confession, stolen from one of the books of Jane Austen. I'll see you damned first.\" Time was getting on very slowly. Higgins was ill at ease. He was very warm in his clothes and some drops of sweat have appeared on his forehead. He didn't dare to put off his hat to give them a wipe. He was thinking about what impression he could have for a stranger, leaning back int hat cramped position. He didn't hear a sound or a word which made him think that Eliza didn't move either. \"You blasted guttersnipe!\" he thought .'Open your mouth! Say something or go away or sit down or at least fetch those slippers. I don't care what you're doing, but stop watching me as alertly as a cat watches a mouse hole.\" The silence was broken suddenly by Eliza. \"I met my father in the morning. He said that he was the heir to the American fellow to whom you had written, but he had to marry my stepmother due to the duties of a middle-classed gentleman... The wedding started at 10 o'clock int he morning in the St. George Temple.\"Her voice was calm and fireside. Higgins gained his confidence, put off his hat and turned to Eliza. It was obvious that he has found his usual arrogant, neglectful style, because he looked at her with a sneer. \"Your father used to make his fortune by exhausting yours, and you can do the same.\" Eliza didn't understand it. \"I beg your pardon, Professor?\" \"Now he's become a rich and influential man, he's able to support you.'Eliza frowned her eyebrows.'He's able to provide you a home, buy you a flower shop and anything you silly thing want. Moreover he'll be able to pay the expenses of you wedding. Oh yes, dear, your dear Freddy and his mother are stony broke. Mrs. Eynsford-Hill will be satifield... what a good bargain her son's done.\" Eliza swallowed and clenched her fists. She needed all of her patient and imperturbability. \"He thinks that he has been driven to the wall and that's why he's acting like this. He is completely aware of my independence. He knows that I can do well without him, the Colonel and their money. I have a beau, state, money and his weapons are only his arrogance and pride. Keep cool, Eliza, don't let him have this pleasure. Breathe a sigh and answer… as a lady.\" \"I have no intention to live off my father. He has enough relatives who do it instead of me. I feel sorry for him. Actually, I don't want to depend on him. I don't need another bully who keeps rubbing in his advocacy.\"She looked at Higgins disdainfully. By the way I'm not sure whether I'll marry Freddy.\" As soon as she finished her sentence, Higgins started from his chair forthwith. His pulse rised and felt that bloody butterflies in his stomach. His sight was desperately searching for apropos which could explain this sudden movement. \"That bloody chair… who could anybody sit in it ? It's bloody bad for your back…\"He mumbled while he was rubbing his back.\"Why did you change your mind, Eliza? You were so sure that you will marry that foolish boy about an hour ago. What was you sentence ? Freddy loves me: that makes him king enough for me…\" A smile hovered over her lips. \"That's true. He said he loved me and had asked for my hand in a marriage, but I haven't given him a reply. I'm not willing to be his wife until I'm able to support him.\"Higgins snorted bitingly.\"Have I said something wrong, Sir?\" \"Does a husband need his wife's support?\" Blood rushed into Eliza 's face. Higgins felt, that this time, he's drawn the long bow and cleared his throat. \"So, do you want to say that... that you will refuse his proposal?\" \"I have never said that. I just mentioned the facts: He wanted to propose to me, but I didn't say either „yes\" or „no\" .\" Eliza looked in his eyes and discovered a strange sparkle in them. \"Do you think you are in love with him? Do you think that he could be the ideal husband for you?\" In his tone there was a weird mixture of hope and fear. He regretted these sentences as soon as they slipped out of his mouth. He felt himself miserable and ridicoulus… again. How could he ask so impudent questions? \" Do you think that he could be the ideal husband for you? What a brazen question, Professor!\"she chuckled.\"I swear, I will let you know the decision, as soon as I make it.\" He put his hands in his pocket and started to walk to and frow very slowly and dignifiedly in the room. \"I suppose, you will stay at Mother's house until you make decision.\" \"Mrs. Higgins was very kind and offered me one of her guest rooms, since it would be improper to live here with you. After all, I'm not your pupil anymore, and the colonel will movie away soon…\" \"… and people will start gossiping because you and me will live together without any apropos.'Eliza blushed due to this thought and was very grateful that Higgins couldn't see her face.\" Higgins was standing behind Eliza, staring at her hair, as if it was the most interesting thing in the world. \"However there would be a resolution for this problem. You could stay here. You would have money, independence, a home and could see the back of your father…\" Her heart began to beat. Since she entered this door, she has hoped that her Professor will propose to her sooner or later, but she didn't think that this question would surprise and upset her so much. \"… I'll adopt you as my daughter and settle money on you if you like. You would have the reason to stay here. Your wedding could be as bloody slushy as you want… provided you didn't change your mind.\"he added. That was the point, when Eliza wanted to cry. She wanted to grab Higgins and shake him until he confessed his feelings for her. Her face turned red. She couldn't decide whether she was egocentric , or Higgins was simply a hopeless case. Tears appeared in her eyes. Higgins got the wind up, that he had said something wrong and when he realized the meaning of his words he started to swear in his mind. He called himself names for his idiotic notion. He knew that he wounded Eliza… again. \"Forget my previous idea. I didn't say anything.\"He looked down and stared the floor.\"I didn't say anything.\"He put his right hand onto her shoulders consolingly. Eliza composed her thoughts and sighed. Higgins put on his hat and walked to the door, then turned in the last minute. \"I have to go away. I've got a few foolish things to do. We might speak about it later, if you like. You can stay here until you want. Call Mrs. Pearce, if you would like to drink tea or consume crumpets.\" A cheeky smile came out on his face and he started chuckling. \"Pickering must be hungry too. He has spent the half day with looking for you. You've frightened that poor devil successfully, you silly girl.\"Eliza looked at him with her big, sad eyes, which showed shame and regret, and it made that grin on his face vanish. He came to her very slowly. He was indecently close to her. He could feel her warm breathing on his cheek. \"Eliza…\" \"Professor Higgins?\" \"I'm glad that you're here\"he said gently, then – it was a big surprise for both of them - leaned toward and kissed her on her forehead. They were staring at each other for a long moment. Although they were good friends, this kind of kiss was still too intim for them. Higgins stormed out of the room. Eliza was looking at the door with a dreamy and sad look on her face. She sat down in the Professor's chair but didn't say a word. She loved Professor Henry Higgins and she knew that he felt the same. She was there because she was unable to be angry with him. She forgave him but she would never beg or crawl on her knees. Yes, he had to take first step. ","Summary":" How Many Steps Are Needed For Happiness?

A/N: This fic is a mixture of the My Fair Lady musical, Pygmalion (the play), Pygmalion (the 1938 film) and my own imagination. Feel free to imagine whatever actor you think fits best each role. I simply felt dissatisfied with the way My Fair Lady ended and so I've decided to write my own ending. After reading G. B. Shaw's Pygmalion and its epilogue where Shaw explains why Eliza and Higgins could never possibly be together, I found that I agreed with his reasons completely. And yet, I think that there's chance for the couple from the musical, as Higgins was not quite so self-absorbed and cared for Eliza a little. I apologize to Freddy's fans, but I don't think that he would be a good companion for Eliza, no matter what Shaw said. Anyway, read and review, and PLEASE point out any mistakes, you'll find in this text. I wrote it some time ago, so I'm afraid it's not very good. The Devil's Slippers \"But I can't turn your soul on,\" he said softly. The worry lines around his mouth seemed more pronounced now and Eliza noticed that his eyes gained a gentle expression. She felt her heart twist painfully in her chest and were she less determined not to show any weakness, she would have hugged her arms around her shoulders for comfort. Instead Eliza clenched her fingers in fists and saw her knuckles whiten under the strain. She prayed to God to give her strength for, seeing how earnest he looked, she would have almost believed him. But she knew better now. She knew not to fall for one of his tricks again, no matter how earnest he looked. \"Oh, you ARE a devil!\" she gasped out finally. \"You can twist the heart in a girl as easy as some could twist her arms around to hurt her!\" He looked mildly surprised and pleased with himself, but Eliza went on nonetheless. \"What am I to come back for?\" she asked exasperatedly. At that he jumped up, his face suddenly animated. \"For the fun of it!\" Higgins cried out and waved his arms in the air. \"That's why I took you on.\" She stood in front of Higgins, looking straight into his face. Now, Eliza could see, he was absolutely serious about his offer. Was he listening to himself? The night before he claimed to be glad that the charade was over, that he was getting bored with the whole affair, and now he wanted her to go back for the 'fun of it'? Oh, Eliza could see how that would go. \"And you may throw me out tomorrow, if I don't do everything you want me to?\" she asked, incredulous at his image of their life. \"Yes; and you may walk out tomorrow, if I don't do everything you want me to,\" he stated with air of generosity. And there he was again with his proclamations of equality. Eliza was getting sick of his hypocritical attitude. He knew just as well as she did, that she had no other friend in the world besides Wimpole Street. \"And live with my father?\" she asked and felt her temper almost getting the better of her. Higgins simply grinned at her. \"Yes, or sell flowers. Or would you rather marry Pickering?\" he replied easily, with a teasing glint in his eyes at the last suggestion. Eliza felt her blood boil. \"Not bloody likely!\" she shrieked and glared at him fiercely. The good Colonel was old enough to be her grandfather and she loved him as such. \"Language, Eliza,\" Higgins corrected her gently with an infuriatingly condescending expression on his face. Oh, she could smash his face with the can! \"I'll talk as I like! You're not my teacher now!\" she exclaimed, her temper flaring and for the safety of Mrs Higgins's water-can she walked a few steps away from him. \"I can talk and marry as I please! I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way,\" Eliza continued and feeling the need to prove her point, she added: \"Freddy Hill writes to my twice and three times a day, sheets and sheets!\" And suddenly she watched as the condescending and self-complacent sun on Higgins's face set and thunderous clouds arrived in its place. \"Damn his impudence!\" Higgins shouted and banged his fist on the coffee table, making the tea cups rattle. \"He has right to if he likes, poor lad,\" stated Eliza with a small smile on her now serene face. \"You have no right to encourage him!\" Higgins fumed and made jabbing gestures at her with his fore-finger. Eliza held her head high defiantly. \"Every girl has a right to be loved,\" she exclaimed with feeling. \"What? By fools like him?\" Higgins laughed derisively with an unpleasant look on his face, and Eliza felt her temper flare again. \"Freddy's not a fool!\" she cried out. \"And if he's weak and poor and wants me, may be he can make me happier than my betters who bully me and don't want me!\" Higgins snorted and shook his head in a knowing manner. \"In short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as Freddy? Is that it?\" he said with a look in his eyes that challenged her to try and deny it. And Eliza was determined to do just that. \"No, I don't,\" she replied, feeling calm again. \"I know I'm a common ignorant girl, and you a book-learned gentleman, but I'm not dirt under your feet.\" She took a while to compose herself further and was glad that Higgins decided to be silent for once. \"What I done,\" Eliza stopped and corrected herself, not wanting to be interrupted by him. \"What I did was not for the dresses and the taxis. I did it because we were pleasant together and I come - came - to care for you. Not forgetting the difference between us, but more - friendly like...\" Eliza saw him gazing at her with wonder in his eyes and hoped that perhaps for once he listened to her and understood what she was trying to say. \"Well, of course,\" he said with a real smile. \"That's how I feel.\" Eliza took in a surprised breath and in that moment, that she allowed herself to believe he actually understood, he suddenly frowned and shook his head. \"And how Pickering feels,\" he added and flung his arms in the air again. \"And Eliza, you're a fool!\" \"That's not a proper answer to give me!\" Eliza said, feeling near tears. Of exasperation, of course. \"It's all you'll get until you stop being a common idiot,\" Higgins spat out, waving his arms about. \"If you're going to be a lady, you'll have to give up feeling neglected if the men you know don't spend half their time snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes.\" As he was lecturing, he again assumed the air of a teacher in a classroom and Eliza almost found herself slipping into the role of a pupil - almost. \"You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?\" Higgins continued. \"Very well: be off with you to the sort of people you like!\" Eliza could only watch in absolute amazement as yet again he managed to twist her words around. His way and ease with words would probably never cease to amaze her. But as she had said to Freddy the night before, she was quite sick of words. Higgins's rant, however, wasn't over yet. \"Marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money, and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with. If you can't appreciate what you've got, you'd better get what you can appreciate!\" And with that he stopped speaking and assumed a rather majestic pose. And perhaps for the first time, Eliza thought what a ridiculous man Henry Higgins was. \"Oh, I can't talk to you. You turn everything against me: I'm always in the wrong!\" She said and feeling unwilling to stay in the same room as him, she started to walk towards Mrs Higgins's conservatory. Suddenly, an idea stopped her, it was a brilliant thought and had a great potential for getting even more rise out of that magnanimous peacock. \"But don't be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down,\" she announced strongly. \"I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as he's able to support me!\" Higgins took a few steps towards her and for a moment she thought he wouldn't get out a word for all his mocking snorting. \"Freddy?\" He finally managed to say. \"That poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errant boy, even if he had the guts to try for it?\" Eliza bristled at that. She had no illusions about Freddy's abilities, but that sweet boy didn't deserve to be mocked for his timid nature. Especially, as she now felt that the naïve, weak and lovey-dovey Freddy Eynsford-Hill was worth the ten of coldly sophisticated Henry Higgins'. \"Woman, don't you understand? I made you a consort for a king!\" exclaimed Higgins and Eliza felt that this was the way a sculptor would look, if he saw his favourite piece being placed in a public park, rather than the palace garden he had hoped for. But she was no figurine made of muddy clay or even cold pristine marble, and it infuriated her to hear him speak of her as such. He didn't make her! She was her own person, a free human being with independent will and feelings. \"Freddy loves me, that makes him king enough for me!\" she shouted and decided to get to the bottom of her plan. She wanted to wound him as much as he was wounding her. \"And he wasn't brought up to work as I was. I' ll go and be a teacher!\" He looked incredulous. \"What will you teach, in heaven's name?\" asked Higgins disbelievingly. \"What you taught me! I'll teach phonetics,\" Eliza announced. \"Ha! Ha! Ha!\" was Higgins's reply. Eliza thought it sounded as if a hunch-backed man was falling down the stairs. His infuriating superiority to all the world made her want to smack him. But perhaps losing his composure would serve just as well, if not better. \"I'll offer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungarian!\" She cried out and victoriously watched as he sprung up and stalked towards her. \"What?\" he roared. \"That impostor! that humbug! that toadying ignoramus!\" Eliza watched him gleefully, he was almost spitting in his rage. \"Teach him my methods! my discoveries!\" Higgins shouted. \"You take one step in his direction and I'll wring your neck! Do you hear?\" The great Professor Henry Higgins was standing right in front of her with his hands outstretched to wrap around her neck and a glint of almost murderous rage in his eyes, and Eliza found that she was not afraid. All she could feel was an immense wave of triumph come over her with seeing that aloof man so incensed. \"Wring away!\" she cried out. \"What do I care? I knew you'd strike me someday.\" Oh, she could almost dance and sing with glee at seeing him slump into the wicker-chair. \"That's done you, Henry Higgins, it has!\" she said, smiling smugly. \"Now I don't care a bit for your bullying and your big talk!\" She could almost clap her hands in excitement. \"Oh, when I think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and called names, when all the time I had only to lift up my finger to be as good as you! I could just kick myself! I was such a fool to think of you as if you were the earth and the sky! You, my dear friend, fancy yourself better than all the rest of us because you talk oh-so-well, but you are not the beginning and the end.\" Eliza felt an immense wave of pleasure at Higgins's scandalized expression. His own loss of temper and her triumph left him speechless. At last he gasped out: \"You impudent hussy! There's not an idea in that head of yours or a word in your mouth that I haven't put there!\" Eliza giggled at his outraged look, she felt almost drunk on her victory. \"I wouldn't be so sure of that, oh great teacher of mine!\" she cried out and made an exaggerated bow. \"There ARE things in this world you cannot take credit for, you know.\" \"You brazen hussy...\" he, indignantly, made to interrupt her, but she wouldn't let him. \"Somehow the Earth can spin without your twirling it! Surprisingly enough, you needn't hold up the sky and push the clouds, they roll by all by themselves. They can even rule the land without you, imagine that!\" Eliza had to pause to stop herself from laughing at his shell-shocked expression. \"Oh, there still will be rain on that plain down in Spain! Even Keats will survive without you, and so shall I! I can do without you!\" Eliza wanted to add many more things and infuriate him even further, but Henry Higgins interrupted her with a loud cry of his own. \"Eliza, you are magnificent! Five minutes ago, you were like a millstone round my neck,\" Higgins said, walking towards her with sparkling eyes. He looked just like he had that night when she finally got those ridiculous 'plains in Spain' right. And for a moment Eliza wanted him to grab her and lead her across the floor again. \"Now you're a tower of strength, a consort battleship!\" he exclaimed with a proud smile. \"I like you this way.\" Eliza maintained a cool exterior, but her mind was in disarray. If he was angry at her, struck her and ordered her never to show her face in Wimpole Street again, she could have simply walked away with the knowledge of her final triumph over the man. But he, yet again, managed to somehow turn it all around. The empowering feeling of victory suddenly gave away and Eliza felt a wave of great despair come over her. He seemed proud of her for mocking him. He called her magnificent, and yet he wanted her to fetch and carry for him. He didn't want her, and yet he was furious at the thought of her marrying Freddy. He liked her strong and independent, and yet he was trying to cajole her into coming back to Wimpole Street with him. He was impossible and unreasonable. He treated her like a shiny doll that woke to life and first drew breath when he hammered the As and Hs into her. And yet... Eliza's heart clenched painfully. If only he could love her... Not as a pretty thing he helped to mould, but as a woman, with the same fire he showed in his rage. She wanted no infatuated proclamations of love. If only he could care for her... Eliza felt as if a knife had been driven into her already aching heart and twisted around. She realized that would never be. Henry Higgins was incapable of such feeling for anything else than his science and maybe Milton. He simply wasn't that sort of a man, and she couldn't live in Wimpole Street with any less from him. She couldn't live with a man who wanted her to slave for him and be his 'consort battleship' at the same time. She couldn't be both a slave and a 'tower of strength'. And moreover, Eliza Doolittle never had, nor ever would consent to being anyone's slave! \"Goodbye, Professor Higgins,\" said Eliza with stony determination. \"You shall not be seeing me again.\" And with those words she swept out of the lounge and went up the stairs into the room the good Mrs Higgins had prepared for her upon her arrival. As she was about to close the door behind herself and Henry Higgins, she heard him bellow for his mother and then with a soft and surprisingly vulnerable voice announce: \"She's gone.\" And Eliza let the door close with a click and threw herself into a chair at the vanity table. She stared unseeingly at her picture in the mirror and then clenched her eyes shut. She tried to force all thoughts from her mind. All the doubts about her assumptions of Henry Higgins's feelings, all the fears of the future. She tried to go back to the time when she was only a poor flower girl. How she in her childish ignorance thought that being a lady meant having no worries. While Eliza was beyond the stage of wailing: 'what is to become of me?', that didn't mean these questions bothered her any less. \"Marry Freddy. Ha!\" she mimicked Higgins's voice as she looked up. She turned the thought around in her head and in the end she had to admit that for once the Professor was right. She couldn't marry Freddy. For one, she didn't love him and she was quite sure that the silly boy didn't love her either. What did he know about her? Nothing, except for the fact that her aunt and father had strong affinity for gin and that she could swear worse than a sailor. Eliza stroked the delicate petals of a white rose, that stood in a thin elegant vase next to the mirror, and she leaned forward to breath in its sweet fragrance. She knew she couldn't be happy with a man-child she'd have to support, even if he wrote serenades and sang them under her window. Sooner or later, and she suspected it would be sooner rather than later, another pretty girl would come and turn the head of Freddy Eynsford-Hill, and she'd prefer not to be his wife when that would happen. Eliza got up from the vanity table with a decisive nod of her head. When she had decided to go and ask Henry Higgins for lessons, she had done it with a dream of better occupation in her mind. And with a slow smile, Eliza realized that that dream was now a possibility. Once more, she would have to work on her speech and manners. This time, her goal wouldn't be to be able to pass of as a foreign princess, but as a young girl of good character willing to earn her living. She had learned how to be a duchess, surely she could learn how a shop assistants behaved! She would become a lady in a flower shop, or maybe a ladies maid. Eliza felt as if a great weight was suddenly lifted off her shoulders and she walked towards the wardrobe in the corner. Mrs Higgin's maids had already taken all of her fine dresses out of her suitcase and hanged them. She stroked the soft fabrics and then with a small sigh she closed the wardrobe's door. She probably wouldn't have much use for the dresses any more. Ladies in flower shops didn't go around dressed so finely, she'd have to buy some more sensible clothes once she'd sold some of these. And suddenly, Eliza felt herself no longer dreading the future, but rather she felt the future race towards her and remind her of the many things that needed to be done before she could rest, secure of her situation. There were many shops to visit, people to study, letters of references to be got and dresses to be bought and Eliza felt that she really shouldn't impose on Mrs Higgins's hospitality any longer. Feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of things she had yet to do, Eliza sat down on her bed tiredly. And for the first time that day, she realized how tired she was. By God, why, she hadn't slept a wink after all the dancing at the Embassy Ball! And for now, she certainly felt that she could not 'dance all night and still beg for more'. In fact, all Eliza felt like doing after all the emotional turmoil was getting a good sleep. Maybe just for a little while... And so Eliza Doolittle fell asleep and didn't wake up even when Mrs Higgins came into the room, or even when the night fell and the next morning came. \"Mary, if she still doesn't wake up, we'll have to send for a doctor,\" Eliza heard the worried voice of her hostess announce. She felt her eyelids flutter open and then close again rapidly at the onslaught of the bright light streaming from the window. \"Oh, she is waking up, ma'am!\" said another voice, sounding relieved. \"Good,\" came a short reply and next, Eliza felt a hand shaking her shoulder gently. \"Wake up, my child,\" urged Mrs Higgins and Eliza felt obliged to open her eyes despite her unwillingness. \"Are you quite well, Eliza?\" asked Mrs Higgins with a worried frown. \"Oh, yes, I'm well,\" Eliza assured her quickly and made to get up, only to be stopped with both Mrs Higgins's and the maid's hands. Mrs Higgins looked at her intently, as if searching for something. \"Well, the colour is back in your cheeks,\" she announced finally and let her go. \"But you looked as pale as death when you were asleep these past two days!\" \"I've slept for two days?\" Eliza cried out in disbelief and straightened up on the bed. \"Yes, you did, my dear. It's about dinner time, now,\" Mrs Higgins informed her and got up from the bed resolutely. \"But I suppose you needed the rest after having to deal with my brute of a son.\" \"Oh,\" was all Eliza could say in reply as the memory, that had left her to sleep in peace, suddenly returned. She forced back the painful twinge in her chest and opened her mouth to speak. \"Mrs Higgins, I was wondering if I may ask...\" But she was interrupted. \"Of course, you may, my child,\" answered Mrs Higgins. \"But do so after getting dressed and having something to eat.\" With a kind smile on her face she walked to the door and left, saying: \"Mary will help you with your toilette.\" Eliza smiled at the maid awkwardly. While she had lived with the Professor, it had seemed natural to let herself be pampered and dressed. Now, however, she felt it wouldn't be right. \"I... Thank you, Mary,\" she got out finally. \"I'd like to dress by myself.\" And so, with a small curtsy, Mary left her alone to dress and do her hair. It felt nice to be able to do those things by herself again and it made her feel as if she was at last really standing on her own feet again. After dressing herself and eating her supper, Eliza arrived into Mrs Higgins's conservatory. The old lady was sitting in her wicker-chair with a book and glasses on her nose. In that moment for the first time she resembled her book-learned son. \"Oh, it's no good thinking about him!\" Eliza reprimanded herself in a mutter and Mrs Higgins looked up from her book. \"There you are, dear,\" she exclaimed and put away the thick tome. \"I was just reading my favourite.\" She added and waved her hand towards the book. \"There's nothing quite like the classical literature, don't you think? Very few authors have managed to surpass the great Ovid and his Metamorphoses.\" Eliza felt incredibly dumb, as she had no idea what Mrs Higgins was talking about and could only nod and agree with a quiet: \"Quite.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, my dear,\" Mrs Higgins apologized almost immediately. \"I was lost in thoughts for a moment. I believe there was something you wanted to ask.\" Eliza smiled gratefully at the older woman and after an empathetic gesture from Mrs Higgins she seated herself in a wicker-chair next to her hostess. \"I've decided to seek employment in a florist shop,\" she announced after a while and saw Mrs Higgins's eyes widen slightly. \"I do not think I have sufficient training to become someone's ladies maid and I've always loved flowers.\" \"My dear...\" Mrs Higgins started to say, but stopped short as she realized there wasn't much to say to that. \"I only fear that no shop-keeper will be willing to employ me without some letter of reference,\" Eliza continued. She felt slightly embarrassed at having to ask this of her hostess, but she knew of no other person, who could help her with this. \"I'd like to ask if maybe you could provide such a letter.\" \"Oh, of course I could, my child!\" exclaimed Mrs Higgins, obviously overwhelmed by this sudden information. \"I only thought that you would marry...\" Here she trailed off again with a sad shake of her head. \"I cannot marry Freddy Eynsford-Hill, madam,\" said Eliza in answer to the older lady's unfinished statement. \"And I don't feel that I need to marry anyone yet. I'm young, no old spinster and I can work.\" Mrs Higgins looked pensive for a moment and Eliza at first thought that she hadn't heard her. After a while, however, Mrs Higgins spoke again. \"I suppose you are right, my dear,\" she said. \"I will give you my references, of course, and you can stay here with me as long as you like.\" \"That's too kind, Mrs Higgins!\" Eliza cried out in surprise at the offer. \"Oh, nonsense! It's no trouble to me, my child,\" Mrs Higgins waved her gratitude away. \"And I shall like having you with me. It gets lonely with the only company coming for my 'at home' days.\" Eliza was about to thank the lady again, but Mrs Higgins wasn't finished yet. \"However, I believe that should you have any chance of a good employment, you need at least one more letter confirming your character.\" \"But I don't know...\" Eliza began, but again she was interrupted by her hostess. \"Don't you, my dear?\" asked Mrs Higgins with raised eyebrows. \"I believe the good Mrs Pearce would be quite happy to oblige you.\" \"Oh, Mrs Pearce?\" Eliza exclaimed. \"But I couldn't possibly go back there!\" Eliza felt a wave of panic rise inside her. She knew that Mrs Higgins was right. Two letters gave her better chance than only one, but how could she possibly walk to his door and see his housekeeper without meeting him? And oh, how frightful and humiliating it would be to see him sneer at her or to hear him laugh at her with contempt! \"I couldn't, Mrs Higgins! I couldn't!\" she cried out in panic. \"Oh, calm yourself, child,\" Mrs Higgins ordered gently and Eliza, distressed and feeling extremely foolish, did as was asked of her. \"Contrary to what you have witnessed, my son doesn't spend all his time holed up in that study of his,\" her hostess continued. \"This evening, for example, we are both to go to a birthday celebration of my other son's daughter. She is John's first born and Henry for some reason thinks that she is his namesake. Her name is Erica, though, so I'm not sure what led him to believe that John named his daughter after him. Nevertheless, he seems to tolerate Erica better than he does any other five-year-old and he knows I would skin him alive if he didn't come.\" And with that, all Eliza's worries seemed to have disappeared. He wouldn't be at home and she could go to see Mrs Pearce without any worry! Besides, it would be nice to say goodbye to the house. She had grown to think of it as of her home and despite all of its masculine decorations, she felt good there. She smiled brightly at the old lady. \"You've said it's almost evening before. What time does the celebration begin?\" she asked eagerly. \"I'll be leaving in about half hour,\" answered Mrs Higgins. \"I was just about to go prepare and have Mary call a taxi. You could go with me, Eliza, we'll have to drive through Wimpole Street.\" Eliza nodded quickly and, suddenly feeling restless, she got up and reached for the water can. Mrs Higgins watched her for a while with a strange expression on her face before she got up and left the room to prepare for her granddaughter's birthday dinner. Eliza couldn't stand still. She felt restless and eager and worried and anxious at the same time. And she wasn't sure if she was more excited or afraid of walking through his house again. Or of it was perhaps the prospect of her new future that had her in this state. She tried to force herself to sit calmly, she even tried reading a passage from that book Mrs Higgins praised so much. But it didn't help the queasiness in her stomach a bit and she was too distracted to take in the words on the page. Finally, as she was almost biting her finger-nails in anxiousness, Mrs Higgins reappeared in the lounge and together they departed. However, seeing the beautifully carved front door didn't calm her nerves in the slightest, as she had thought it might. Instead, it created another wave of panic that nearly sent her running after the leaving taxi of the kind Mrs Higgins. Not even the fact that it was already almost dark and he was doubtlessly on his way to his brother, the clergyman, seemed to help. She walked up the front steps and knocked on the door softly, half-hoping nobody would hear her and she would have an excuse to walk away. However, the door opened almost instantly and Eliza was greeted by the sight of a very surprised Thomas, the butler. \"Miss Doolittle,\" Thomas said in a shocked voice, but he maintained a neutral expression and quickly offered in explanation: \"We were expecting Colonel Pickering to return from his evening walk.\" \"I've come to talk to Mrs Pearce,\" Eliza explained quickly, not wanting him to think she came to visit his master. He smiled at her a little and Eliza wasn't entirely sure if he was smiling because he was glad to see her or because he didn't believe her. \"Certainly, miss,\" said Thomas and led her farther into the hallway. \"I'll call her for you.\" And he left her standing there alone and quickly walked up the staircase to fetch the housekeeper. It was strange to see the same staircase she had walked down in a beautiful gown and jewels again as an aspiring shop assistant. It was queer to suddenly feel like a stranger in a place she had considered her home for whole six months. God! Was it only six months? It felt like years, like decades. At least, Eliza felt years and decades older than the girl in that frightful hat with three ostrich feathers who screamed at the sight of a steaming bath tub. It saddened Eliza to know that after this night, she'd never return to this place again. She looked around, trying to take in all the familiar sights. She tried to commit the whole house into her memory; its dark panelling, the low glow of the electric lamps, the smooth surface of the elegant doors. The house even had its set of specific sounds she never wanted to forget; the soft clicks of the maids' heels on the floor above her, the off-tune humming of Edward, the manservant, even the cracking sound the gramophone in the Professor's study made when it was being switched on... Eliza listened with a half-dreamy, half-sad smile to the sounds of the house before her expression turned into a one of horror. The gramophone was on! Colonel Pickering was out! The servants would have never switched that blasted thing on... That could only mean one thing: Henry Higgins didn't go to his niece's birthday dinner, he was at home! Eliza stood in the hallway, paralysed. Her brain was screaming at her to run as if the hounds of hell were at her heels, but her legs felt as if they were made of lead, or of iron for the matter. Because there was undoubtedly a magnet in the study and Eliza found herself stepping towards the open door. She was trembling as she reached the door to the study and almost against her will looked inside. There was no doubt about it. Henry Higgins was at home and now was the time to flee, unless she wished to be exposed to his ridicule. She knew him quite well and was sure of his gleeful and arrogant cries of 'I told you so'. She knew she couldn't bear to spend one minute in the mocking presence of this man, she seemed to love against her better judgement. And yet, something in the atmosphere of the room stopped her from turning around and walking away. And Eliza realized that Henry Higgins was sitting slumped in his easy-chair and that he was in his bathrobe. With growing wonder Eliza noticed that his feet were bare and his hair, that was usually so carefully arranged, in an incredible state of mess on his head. In surprise, she took one step into the room and quickly stopped as the record fell silent. She didn't dare to breath. Suddenly, a low groan came from the slumped figure. Eliza had to stop herself from gasping out loud. Was he ill? But her worries were dispelled as he opened his mouth again. \"Serenely independent, indeed!\" came a hoarse whisper and Henry Higgins dropped his head into his hands as the gramophone played another recording. Eliza felt her heart leap in her chest as she recognized her own Cockney accent coming from the horn. \"Ah, we are proud! He ain't above giving lessons, I heard him say so!\" He shook his head in his hands. \"By George, I was a fool!\" he whispered and listened intently to his own answer on the record. Eliza's heart threatened to burst out with emotion and her brain seemed to have given out altogether under the strain of the new information and what it meant. She had forgotten all about Mrs Pearce and her letter, she had forgotten all about Henry Higgins's niece, she had forgotten everything and she could not comprehend what to make of him listening to her voice, just as she had advised him he should. Did he miss her? Did he want her? Did he, dare she think it, love her? And suddenly, Eliza felt herself compelled by some invisible force to step towards the gramophone and turn in off. And then she heard herself finish the recording. \"I washed my face and hands before I come, I did.\" She saw Henry Higgins stiffen in his chair. She heard him gasp out, when she dared to draw a deeper breath. \"Eliza!\" he whispered and into his voice seemed to be poured all the emotions in the world. Eliza stood in the doorway, her chest heaving with her deep breaths, and she waited for his next move. Henry Higgins seemed at first too stunned to react, but then, as if reaching the end of some inner debate, he straightened his posture and leaned into his easy-chair, closing his eyes. \"Where the devil are my slippers?\" And at the brisk question, Eliza felt her heart stop and she instantly regretted her decision to come and to turn that blasted gramophone off. Because, at this question, all the wonder and feeling had disappeared from his voice and Eliza felt disappointment like a vice clench her heart. And then she saw his shoulders shake a little, as if he was laughing. Was he mocking her? Was he teasing her? He was! In spite of herself, Eliza started to chuckle at his sense of humour. And as she stood there laughing, her gaze slid over a pair of slippers behind the easy-chair. On sudden impulse, she stooped to pick them up and then she let them one by one fall on Henry Higgins's head. \"Here are you slippers. And there!\" she got out between giggles at his nonplussed expression. She knew she couldn't let him win this round and get the better of her. Eliza wouldn't be looking for slippers any more and even if he was joking, she wouldn't let him think he could get away with it. \"No more looking for slippers for me, Henry Higgins. I won't do that any more, don't you think I will!\" she heard herself say as she gazed into his surprised green eyes. And Henry Higgins jumped up from his chair and in a few steps stood in front of her. He appeared to be drinking in the sight of her. And then... and then he quickly pulled her into his arms and covered her mouth with his. Few miles away, in a house that was perhaps less grand than the one on Wimpole Street, Mrs Higgins smiled in satisfaction at her older son's absence from the dinner party. Of course, she gave excuses for him, mentioning a sudden headache or something or other and no one pretended to be surprised or angry. Oh, they all knew perfectly well that Henry would forget Erica's birthday. He always did. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Except for the plot, I don't own a thing.

Prologue \"I washed m'face an' 'ands before I come, I did.\" Thus were spoken the words that loosened Professor Henry Higgins' chokehold on bachelorhood. He was not completely aware of the fact the first time it was uttered, Eliza's voice bristling with prideful indignation. The second time though… He had known that he was not alone when he heard the gentle click of the grammar phone as it was turned off. His initial, fleeting reaction was righteous anger. How dare this person turn off her voice? The hours and hours of recordings were the only thing he had left of her, other than the jewelry from the Embassy Ball which had to be returned, and the ring from Brighton that did not. That ring had been discovered on the mantle by Mrs. Pearce earlier that morning. Henry, caught up in the flurry of emotions that Eliza's disappearance had caused, abruptly snatched the ring from his faithful housekeeper's hand, and slipped it into his trouser pocket without so much as a word. The prospect of Eliza being gone had first started to sink in the moment he spotted Mrs. Pearce with the ring, and the urge to take everything and anything he could identify as hers and lock it up in a safe, selfish place for himself had reared its ugly head. That feeling was nothing to the pure, vitriolic antipathy he felt towards intruder who dared to turn her off. \"I washed m'face an' 'ands before I come, I did.\" The second time in his life that those words were spoken to him, the tone was gentle and teasing nearly tinged with laughter on the edge of it, but not quite. Antipathy turned to a dizzying feeling of pure, undiluted joy. \"Eliza…\" His façade of infuriating indifference broke for but a moment. He spoke her name as though it were manna, God, a prayer. \"Where the devil are my slippers?' He inquired, throwing on the old cloak of indifference, only this time, he matched her teasing tone as he sunk back into his old armchair, letting his hat slip over his eyes. He nearly jumped from his seat when she lifted the hat away from his eyes and peered down at him. \"We certainly have a lot to discuss, don't we Professor?\" And they did. A full month later, they were married. It was a quiet, unfussy affair at the courthouse. Pickering, the elder Mrs. Higgins, and Mrs. Pearce were in attendance, as well as (shockingly), Eliza's father and very young stepmother. The two latter showed up quiet intoxicated (not at all shocking), and Eliza silently thanked providence that she had lost the battle to be married in a church. Her father and stepmother reeking of gin and noisy with somewhat colorful commentary before God and God's employees would have been more than Eliza could have borne; although she came very close to dying of shame when her father loudly booed the chaste peck on the cheek Henry had given her at the end of the ceremony. \"I won't be gettin' any gran'children any time soon, by the looks o' things.\" Eliza's stepmother had the temerity to snort, and then suggest that perhaps Eliza would have a brother or sister before she had a son or daughter. Needless to say, neither were invited to dine at 27A later that evening. After Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce and Eleanor Higgins retired for the evening, Henry and Eliza found themselves facing a task that Eliza had not given much thought to. The prospect of said task had consumed Henry ever since Eliza had agreed to become his wife after their very long discussion. He was not exactly a novice in these matters. His father had taken him to a richly appointed brothel in Paris during his tour of Europe many, many years ago, and since then there had been a few dalliances, one of which had cemented his resolve to remain an asexual bachelor until the day he died. It hadn't ended in heartbreak so much as irritation and a temporary cash flow problem. Damnable opera dancers. The point was, virgins had never been his expertise. Eliza and Henry sat on the edge of his bed in their nightclothes. Eliza, looking prim, pale, and covered in soft lace down to her ankles and up to her neck and wrists. Her hands were shaking slightly, and she was maintaining a safe distance between them. Henry silently cursed himself for not giving her at least a proper kiss leading up to this moment to prepare her. The arrangements for the marriage had been hasty, perfunctory, and altogether unromantic. \"Eliza… has anyone – errr…\" \"Has anyone approached poor motherless Eliza and tried to explain lovemaking?\" She queried, not looking up from the trembling hands in her lap. \"Precisely.\" \"Oh yes. This morning my stepmother, Eulalie – who is at least three years younger than me – started to go into some very alarming facts; however, your mother happened upon us and interrupted what I can only describe as a very… colorful explanation of facts, and interceded with her own gentler and slightly scientific explanation.\" Henry's face flushed with the level of embarrassment once can only achieve from finding out that one's parent was dispersing advice on bedroom matters. \"Oh.\" \"But not before Eulalie slipped me this.\" Eliza stood up and walked over to the nightstand, opened the drawer and retrieved a slim, cheaply bound book. Without looking at it, she handed it to Henry, who paged through it for about a quarter of a second before dropping it to the ground in shock. \"Oh.\" \"Have you ever seen the like?\" Eliza inquired, her voice mortified and shrill. Henry had, in fact, seen the like. The night before the nuptials, Pickering had taken Henry out for a few drinks. Several hours later, red-faced, jolly, and giggling at the mischief of the situation, Pickering had slipped him a copy of the exact book Eliza had shown him. He had also come across several versions of it, mostly when he was attending University. \"That is India for you, old chap!\" Pickering had declared, clapping his friend on the back. …But Henry was not about to remove Pickering from Eliza's pedestal of esteem by shattering his genial, sober old gentlemen façade… nor would he jangle his new bride's nerves by insinuating that he was even a tenth more worldly than she. Not in this instance, at least. \"Never.\" \"And another thing; we agreed that continuing our association would only be proper if we were married, did we not?\" Henry furrowed his brow. \"What has that got to do with anything?\" Eliza sat down on the bed once more, maintaining an even greater distance than before. She placed a slim hand on one post and avoided eye contact with Henry. \"We would not have to do… we would not have to do that if we did not want to. I assumed you entering into matrimony with me was to uphold propriety, particularly for your mother's sake, since she is so involved in society. You would not have to make love with me if you do not wish… I don't require it.\" Henry stood up in one quick, violent motion. \"Madam!\" Eliza jolted at the anger in his tone, her eyes widening and her mouth opening to reply with a protest she could not fully form. In short, she was baffled. \"Are you insinuating that I gave up on a very comfortable life as a bachelor for reasons of 'keeping up appearances'?\" He was very near shouting. Eliza got to her feet, quicker than a shot. \"What else am I to believe? You haven't even kissed me properly!\" She began to pace, her temper quickly matching, than surpassing his own. \"I came back that day telling you I could not sever our acquaintance by marrying Freddie, that I would not marry Freddie, that I would miss you too terribly to be separated by your pride! I was pouring my stupid squashed cabbage leaf heart to you and you said 'Well, we ought to marry. Tongues will wag if we do not' .\" \"And they would! I was thinking on your precious reputation you silly thing.\" Eliza was now standing mere inches away from him, glaring up at his befuddled face. \"Exactly! If you have no romantic inclinations towards me, than let's not do this.\" He was upon her in an instant, one hand pressing against the small of her back in order to guide her against him, the other hand cupping the nape of her neck. His lips descended upon her in a kiss that was anything but dutiful. When they pulled away, her hair was mussed, her lips swollen, and her breathing heavy. \"I will never be the overly affectionate fool that your Freddie was, but I did not marry you in order to keep up appearances. If I wanted to stay a bachelor I would have stayed a bachelor and maintained decency by hiring you on as a member of my household staff-\" \"As your maid ?\" \"-as my secretary. Do not get me wrong, Eliza; I may not give you the flowery language and open affection you desire in this marriage, but I will and do desire you as a husband does his wife.\" \"Like the couples in the drawings?\" Eliza inquired teasingly, nodding at the book on the ground. \"I am an old man. Desiring you like the couples in that book could very well cripple me.\" Eliza opened her mouth to make a witty retort, but Henry stopped her with a kiss. \"Silence, woman. Allow me to completely disabuse you of the notion that this marriage of ours is a product of convenience and the need for propriety.\" She allowed him, to their mutual satisfaction Two Months Later Henry was exhausted. The return trip from The Sorbonne had been a wretched one. Even a short journey on sea from Dover to Calais was, in Henry's estimation, wretched, overpriced and nerve-wracking. What was more, he missed his wife. He had been away from her for a good month for this painfully dull symposium. They had returned from their honeymoon in Brussels, fully intending on using the symposium as an excuse to continue their adventures abroad, but Eliza had become quite ill at the prospect of more sea travel by time they returned, and he ultimately (reluctantly) left her at home. Although it pained him to admit it - and he would never admit it out loud- he realized that another long separation would be agony for him. He quite missed her presence and her voice; even though the latter did sometimes fall back into that dreadful cockney accent, and he missed her touch. This was a shocking admission for someone who had prided himself as being a bit of an asexual scholar. Mentally shaking these feelings of longing, longing that had no place in his mind now that he was home, he opened the door and entered 27A Wimpole Street. He was encountered dour silence from all inhabitants, and his wife was not there to greet him.

Rating: A tasteful(ish) \"T\" Disclaimer: Well, they are certainly not my characters and I have no plans of making money off of them. Author's Note: Happy New Year! Henry must have paced Minnewater Park for a full two hours before finally retreating to the Hotel Academie where his wife awaited. Eliza had demurred when he requested a stroll, citing exhaustion as her reasoning. The journey to Bruges had been a long one, and Henry supposed that he was grateful for the few hours of peace; after all, she was now to be always at his side, and solitude was certain to become a rarity in his life. Henry had resisted against the notion of a honeymoon trip until his mother reasoned with him. Eliza had not seen much beyond her London trappings, and a little holiday would be a very nice gesture indeed. He outright rejected the suggestion that they go to Paris. Romantic mecca or no, he found the city a total bore and crawling with insufferable bohemians. Venice made him shudder. He was not found of the Italian language, and he certainly did not want his wife to be wooed by some swarthy lothario. The Highlands were too rustic, and if there was one thing that made his skin crawl more than Italian, it was backwoods brogue and deep-fried everything. Bruges, while being guilty of having French speaking people, was by all accounts charming. So, the decision was made, and the Higgins were off to Bruges. Clara took it upon herself to take Eliza's son Jack off to Paris to ease the sting of mother and child's first real separation. Eliza made Clara swear that they would stick to the usual tourist sites, and not venture into Montmartre under any circumstances. Henry's mother and Colonel Pickering opted to stay in London and enjoy their first taste of solitude in years. Henry felt an overwhelming sense of dread as he walked down the hallway towards the suite he shared with Eliza. He paused in front of a gilded mirror and found that his pallor was chalky with the hint of a crimson blush burning at his neck and threatening to crawl upwards to engulf his face. His heart was beating a furious pattern against his chest, and for a moment he thought he was about to suffer a stroke. It would certainly excuse me from any expected duties this evening, he thought. His duty. Good Lord... Eliza was waiting for him. Waiting for... Waiting for him to make love to her. His head swam at the notion as he stood motionless in front of the door to their room. It was not as if he thought the idea unpleasant. His wife was beautiful, young, fascinating. As he lifted his trembling hand to the doorknob he found himself imagining what she looked like at the moment. She had been tired, so her hair was certainly unbound and spread across the pillows. Rich chocolate against silken cream. Was she in her nightgown? Perhaps, the moon was now high in the night sky. He had overheard Eliza talking to Clara before the journey. The silly little chit had apparently purchased something obscene for Eliza to wear in the evening, and his wife had been mortified. \"If you do not take it with you, I will be ever so clever and ransack your travelling trunk before you leave and replace all of your clothes with this nightgown and even more scandalous things,\" The younger girl threatened. Eliza swore a bloody oath in her cockney dialect, and Henry had fled when he heard footsteps approaching from behind. He did not know what exactly Clara had given to Eliza, but he was not such a dried up old man that his imagination could not conjure several pleasing images. He wanted to make love to his wife. The idea was not repulsive, despite what one of his more crude minded contemporaries had accused him of. He loved her, and wanted to express his love in a physical way, as it was hard for him to verbalize such things. The crux of the matter was that he had not engaged in the act of lovemaking in a very long time. In fact, Eliza's son was physical proof that Eliza's experiences had been more recent than his own. Henry supposed that it was the universe's way of showing him what an unusual marital situation he was in by having Eliza turn all convention on it's head. Henry's last experience with a woman still made him burn with shame. It was shortly after his mother had informed him of Eliza's elopement. Somehow, he managed to find himself in Paris after the news. He suspected that the amount of spirits he consumed had somehow magically transported him to his least favorite city on earth. He was arguing loudly with some snot-nosed student about Turgenev in a ramshackle cafe when the absinthe he accidentally accepted took his bizarre journey one step further and whisked him away to some well-furnished brothel. Henry felt like he was watching himself from some place outside of his body, helpless to stop himself from giving the Madame a very specific outline of what he expected in one of her girls. Hair; Dark brown. Eyes; Dark brown. Complexion; Alabaster. Figure; Light and pleasing. Mouche was the girl's name. Her jaw was a bit too strong and her nose far too roman in size and shape for delicacy. Her figure was more gaunt than light and pleasing, and her white complexion was achieved through powder that he could taste when his lips brushed her neck in an experimental caress. Her hair was rich, beautiful and that exact shade of brown that had unwittingly haunted him for months. She couldn't have been much older than nineteen, but he paid for her, and subsequently lost himself within the pleasures of his purchase. Bedding Mouche did absolutely nothing to soothe the sting of Eliza's abandonment. There were several instances where his stomach felt dangerously queasy, owing to the fact that the girl's perfume was absolutely cloying and wretched, and the amount of spirits he had been consuming was copious. Henry fled the brothel soon after, and sought refuge in a hotel until he could safely return home. He swore to never return to Paris. \"Henry, you have been standing at the door for ages; Have you lost the key?\" Eliza's sweet, imploring voice snapped him from his reverie. His hand was closed around the doorknob, clutching it so tightly that his knuckles had gone white. He pushed the door open in response and stepped inside. \"Husband.\" Somehow he found his voice. \"Wife.\" Her hair was unbound, as he imagined. Henry thanked the gods that Clara had not convinced Eliza to succumb to the dictates of fashion and chop off her glorious curls and waves. She stood in front of the large, opulent bed, wrapped in the duvet cover, feet bare, and face blazing red. She was as nervous as he was. \"Have you caught a chill, my insect?\" He inquired with a teasing grin. \"No, but it would be quite easy in this nightgown,\" she replied. Boldly, she dropped her feather-down armor to the floor and his brain momentarily short-circuited. Her ivory legs were exposed to mid-calf in the scanty peach teddy. It was a heady confection of silk with lace flowers embroidered at the hem and plunging neckline, held up by tiny shoulder straps. She shivered under his intense scrutiny, crossing her deliciously bared arms. \"I sh-shall write to Clara at once, and give her my most heartfelt th-thanks,\" Henry stammered, trying with all of his might to keep the mood light. \"How did you know Clara gave this to me?\" Eliza asked, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. Ah, caught. \"Mother and Pickering would have a fit of apoplexy if they ever knew such a garment existed,\" he explained quickly. Eliza gave him a half-smile, unconvinced, but unwilling to pry any further. \"I am glad it meets your approval.\" They stood in silence, neither making a move to cross the five feet of distance that separated them. \"Now I am beginning to feel a chill,\" Eliza finally spoke. When Henry did not respond, she bent over and picked up the duvet cover, intent on covering herself once more. \"I must look very silly to-\" She was cut off as Henry closed the distance, yanked the cover from her hands, threw it to the floor and poured nearly a decade of unresolved longing into a dizzyingly passionate kiss. His hands cupped her face to deepen the kiss, and she wrapped her arms tightly about his waist, pulling his body flush against her own. She moaned into his mouth when she felt the hard evidence of his approval pressing against her belly. Somehow they found themselves on the bed, their caresses increasing in boldness, Eliza's once admired peach teddy thrown into a careless heap on the floor. All thoughts of Henry's misadventure was erased from his head as he learned the difference between a drunken, ill-advised rut and making love. The difference between soothing the needs of the body, and getting exactly what one's soul needed to survive. Somewhere in the dizzying, euphoric time that passed between them, he uttered three words that brought about Eliza's complete and utter surrender, followed shortly by his own. They parted breathlessly. \"Good God, woman.\" Eliza switched positions from her back to her side, facing Henry with her face propped against her hand, she was smiling radiantly. \"No bloody oaths on our wedding night, Husband,\" she scolded, teasingly. Henry chuckled. \"I won't have you browbeat me about my habits, even if you are my wife.\" Eliza cozied up at Henry's side in response, and he buried his head in her dark hair. He was utterly content for the moment, the sort of contentment that came with getting exactly what one wanted.

She blinked rapidly in an effort to stay awake, but alas, the lethargy remained. She had just finished going over her list of titles, and blimey, were there a lot! I must've read this a million times ! It didn't help much that the list was scrawled in the Professor's barely legible handwriting, nor the fact that it was well past three in the morning. She sighed, reasoning to herself that her attempts to memorise any more at this point were undeniably futile. She stood up from her bed, her eyes half open as her feet felt the floor for her slippers. Ah, there you are. She slipped on the slippers and stretched her long arms in front of her, yawning once more and making an unusual sound, similar to that of a baby dinosaur's, as she did so. Shaking off the grogginess she felt, she walked out of the room. Yes, that's right, a good snack is what's called for. I wonder where the Professor keeps his chocolates , she thought to herself. \"I could've danced all night, hmmmm... la la la la...\" she hummed as she walked to the kitchen, squinting her eyes as they got accustomed to the light. Wait... light? The kitchen lights were already on. She heard the closing of a drawer, followed by the shuffling of feet. Somebody else was up. At three o'clock. In the bloody morning. Her eyes widened, hoping it wasn't any of the male help or - God forbid - the Professor himself. She looked down at her nightgown. Well, it wasn't exactly inappropriate per se, it went down below her knees. She brushed off the thought and took a deep breath. Walking very slowly now, she carefully poked her head through the kitchen entry. Speak of the devil, it IS Professor Higgins. There he was, sitting at the table, staring into space. It was so unlike him to be doing… well, nothing . A pang of sympathy hit Eliza, it must've been something to do with him looking so lost, like a little boy. Or a puppy. Or something. How odd, feeling sympathetic for Professor Higgins. I mean, it's Professor Higgins, come on! Usually, he would be the one up and running, getting things done and ordering people about, that sort of thing. Eliza pondered over that thought for a moment, and tried to think of a time when he just sat down and relaxed. Let's see, there was that one time... he was in his study and he... no, he wasn't... or that other time in the library, he was... well... Eliza sighed. Never. Well, she wasn't going to attempt to find out whatever the matter was; he hardly ever talks about his feelings. Not even to his closest friends. What more to a squashed cabbage leaf. \"Professor?\" she breathed in a small voice, still feeling groggy. She watched as his head shot up, his back still facing her. He immediately recognised that voice, oh, that wonderful voice he had heard so much of in the past few months, his ears were just about ready to bleed . \"Eliza!\" he said, half startled and half angry that she had snuck up on him while he was in the midst of being very un-Henry-like. \"What the devil are you doing up at this ghastly hour? I thought I told you to get a good night's rest!\" He turned to face her. There she stood, tall and thin, her large eyes half open as she gazed at him sleepily, a lazy smile plastered on her face. There was something about her posture that told him that she didn't give a damn at all about whatever it was he was saying. Her hair was disheveled, long and brown, falling just below her shoulders and her fringe sat above her eyebrows. There was something so very amusing about her appearance, Henry couldn't help but chuckle. She could still look adorable at three in the morning! But he would never, ever admit that he found her delightful. \"Well, I was just about to have a little snack,\" she said cheerfully. She walked over to the table and pulled up a chair next to him. \"I was studying the list you gave me this morning,\" she beamed and sat down, feeling more at ease with her teacher. Actually, he could be very charming when he wasn't being all mean and miserable. Like that night when they danced together. Her mind drifted for a moment as she recalled the thought. Oh, she could do that all over again. Her cheeks turned pink remembering the thoughts she had about him as she lay in bed that night, smiling giddily. Perhaps she could request some lessons in dance to prepare her for the ball... \"... keep that up, we shall have you ready for the ball in no time at all!\" Henry gave her a firm pat on the back, proud of his favourite (though he would never admit it) student. Eliza snapped out of her reverie and looked at him, nodding and smiling. How long had he been talking? \"Well, Eliza,\" he said, getting up from his chair and pacing the kitchen, apparently looking for something. \"Since you've been such a good, hardworking girl today, shall we have some...\" Eliza's eyes lit up as she grinned at the Professor. \"Chocolates...?\" she whispered, walking over to where he was standing. He pulled out a box, and grinned back. \"Correct,\" he replied, handing the box to Eliza. She beamed and looked down at the box. She noticed the label on the top left hand corner. Belgian chocolates?! Her mouth dropped opened in delight. Only the best chocolates in the world! She looked back up at Henry, her eyes full of wonder, Since when did you become so nice? \"Professor, you are such a DEAR!\" she squealed as she lunged at him, flinging her arms around his neck. \"Thank you, thank you, thank YOU!\" Henry almost fell backward in surprise, they've never been very touchy feely before this so he wasn't quite sure of how to respond. Goodness me, this girl really loves her chocolates... \"Eliza!\" He boomed, starting to feel that she had been hugging him longer than she should have. Definitely longer than what was deemed appropriate. \"Release me this instant!\" \"Oh!\" she exclaimed. She let him go and backed away sheepishly, straightening her nightgown. Eliza immediately regretted her giddy behaviour as she looked at his annoyed expression. Awkwardly, she brushed off strands of her hair that had gotten onto his shirt. It looked like someone had gone back to being mean and miserable. Oh, joy. \"Thank you very much for the chocolates, Professor.\" She said politely and returned to her seat. \"Ah, yes. Um, you're very welcome,\" he said walking over to the table. He was beginning to feel rather uncomfortable, what with being alone with a woman in the wee hours of the morning. Oh, if anybody saw, they would think… He shuddered thinking about the all the possible misconceptions that could and would arise if anybody were to walk in on them. \"Actually, Eliza, you enjoy those chocolates. I really am devilishly sleepy and I best be on my way –\" he said, starting to leave. Eliza's eyes widened, looking hurt. She turned to face him. \"Oh, do have some as well, Professor,\" she breathed, a tinge of sadness in her voice. Henry looked away. \"I'm afraid that won't be necessary, but carry on, don't let me stop you –\" \"Oh no, please ,\" she insisted, patting the seat of the chair he had been sitting on, the other hand tugging at his. Her big brown eyes looked up at him hopefully. Henry sighed irritably as he looked down at her. Ugh, he hated this face she always made whenever she wanted something, it made it so damned difficult for him to say no. Well, he couldn't say no now, could he? Damn her adorability! He grumbled and sat back down, pulling a long face and crossing his arms, much like a sulky little boy. Eliza only smirked at how he was behaving. She smiled and got up to prepare some tea. Henry however, was less than relaxed, impatiently drumming his fingers on the tabletop. \"Oh, for heaven's sake, Eliza, do hurry,\" he grumbled. \"I want to return to my damned bed and so should you, or else we both might end up oversleeping!\" He looked over at her. She, however, wasn't paying much attention to what he was saying, humming and cheerful. How could anybody be so bloody happy at three in the morning? he thought, shaking his head. Once done, Eliza set out two cups on the table and poured the warm tea into both before sitting down in her own chair. \"There we are,\" she murmured. Henry smiled politely at her. He took his cup and sipped some tea. She took her cup and sipped some tea. He took a chocolate. She took a chocolate. Henry cleared his throat. \"Very nice chocolates,\" he mumbled. \"Oh, indeed,\" she answered. A few more moments of awkward silence passed. Eliza exhaled and put her cup down. \"Professor, I would just like to express how terribly sorry I am about what happened the other day,\" she said, afraid to look at him. Henry, puzzled by this sudden change in topic, looked at her quizzically. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"What day?\" Eliza looked down. Oh, sometimes he could be so daft, he couldn't have possibly forgotten already? For a book-learned gentleman who's memorised all sorts of sonnets and poems, his memory could have done so much better. She sighed, closing her eyes, feeling the guilt envelope her. When she spoke, her voice was small. \"About what happened at…\" She looked around, checking to see if anybody was near, then leaned in closer. \"At the races,\" she whispered in his ear. The Professor couldn't believe his ears. Oh, how could he forget that infamous incident. Eliza quickly tried to explain herself, afraid that the Professor might get angry. \"It's just that that Dover was moving awfully slow! Why, I could've done better!\" To Eliza's relief however, Henry looked at her worried expression and couldn't help but laugh, amused at her behavior. Eliza's expression changed from worried to surprised. Henry only laughed louder, seeing how shocked she looked. Why wasn't he yelling at her? Or giving her one of his lectures? Slowly, a small smile began to form on Eliza's face, relieved that he did neither. \"Oi!\" She hit him on the arm, a slight Cockney twang in her accent. \"He honestly was!\" She grabbed her teaspoon and pointed it at Henry. \"Look me in the eye and tell me he wasn't!\" she threatened, a silly grin on her face. Henry only smirked. \"He was, Eliza.\" He took the teaspoon from her hand. \"He was.\" Eliza looked into his eyes and smiled. \"You're not angry?\" she asked, her voice soft. \"Angry?\" Henry looked at her incredulously. \"No! It was really rather funny, actually.\" He sipped a bit of his tea before continuing. \"In fact, it sounds like something I would've done. Bravo!\" he beamed, chuckling. \"Now, don't you worry your pretty little head over things like that. They all pass eventually.\" Henry regretted saying 'pretty' in that sentence and hoped that she hadn't noticed but, oh yes, she did. Eliza's eyes narrowed as she looked at him, smiling shyly. \"You actually care about me, don't you, Professor?\" she teased, her fingers making circles in the table. She shuffled her chair closer, bumping her knees against his. Henry straightened his back and looked away. He shuffled his own chair further away from her, looking grumpily at a small spot on the wall. He hated it whenever she got into one of these insufferable moods. He hated it because he found it very difficult to stay angry with her whenever she was being adorable. \"Now, really, Eliza, if you're trying to butter me up, it's not working,\" he mumbled, avoiding her eyes. She gazed at him dreamily and rested her head in her hand, supported by her elbow on the table. \"Yes, of course.\" Her other hand that had been dangling across the back of the chair, stretched as she turned to place both elbows on the table. Unfortunately, for both Eliza and Henry, she ended up whacking the Professor's head instead. \"Ow!\" he yelped, rubbing the spot on his temple. \"Confounded woman! How dare you -\" \"Professor, I'm terribly sorry!\" She exclaimed, her expression aghast. \"You bloody well should be! Bloody attacking me for no reason, why, I –\" \"Ow, bloody 'ell, Professor, shhh !\" she interrupted in annoyance, she leaned towards him, putting a finger to her lips. Her Cockney accent had become more evident, both Henry and herself noticed. That only ever happened when she was swearing or frustrated (hence, the infamous incident at Ascot). Henry noticed that too and stopped talking. Eliza sighed and shook her head. She turned back to face Henry. \"Let's not wake the whole house!\" she said in a raised whisper. Gently, she took his head in her hands. \"Oh, poor dear…\" she whispered, her eyes full of worry as she looked at his head. She honestly didn't know her own strength and Henry had no idea either. Trying to be as delicate as possible, she tenderly stroked the spot where she had hit him. \"Better?\" she asked. \"No.\" he replied grumpily. As if bloody caressing it was going to make it any better. Her expression softened and she breathed in. She leaned forward and kissed his temple softly, her hands holding his head. She broke the kiss, exhaled and leaned her forehead against his for a moment before pulling away. \"Better?\" she breathed, her voice softer this time. Henry cleared his throat and looked down, feeling the heat rise up to his cheeks and hoping desperately his face wasn't as red as it felt. \"Much.\" Their faces were inches away from each other now. Her breathing slowed. She still had that hopelessly dreamy look, her posture relaxed. He didn't know what it was but he didn't like this look on her. It was the exact same look she had on that night, the night she could finally say 'The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain'. Mrs Pierce had, in actual fact, banged on his door later, after putting Eliza to bed. She had asked him to talk to Eliza, complaining that \"the poor girl\" had been \"absolutely giddy\" since their lesson, and that she hadn't gone to sleep yet. Henry, being Henry, waved her off and asked Mrs Pierce to talk to Eliza herself but Mrs Pierce insisted it was him that went to see her. \"Believe me, Sir, I've seen this look on young women before.\" Whatever did she mean by that? \"Oh, tosh, Mrs Pierce. Tell her goodnight from me then, if that makes things any better.\" She nodded and left. Not long after, Mrs Pierce once again went up to his room and knocked. \"Sir, I've seen the girl and told her you said goodnight.\" Henry opened the door. \"And? Any improvement?\" Mrs Pierce looked at him for a moment. \"She squealed and hugged her pillow when I told her. The poor girl fell onto her bed, grinning like a little schoolgirl. She fell asleep smiling.\" Mrs Pierce gave the Professor a smirk. \"Goodnight, sir,\" she nodded in his direction. And with that she left. Whatever was the matter with all the women in the house all of a sudden? Why were they being so cryptic? Henry brushed away the thought and returned his attention to the girl sitting in front of him. \"Eliza,\" he said, tentatively. \"Yes?\" she breathed. She looked as though she had just broken out of a daydream. \"Your - your cheeks are colouring,\" he stammered. He didn't know what else to say. \"Are they?\" she whispered, feeling her cheek with one hand. She felt the heat creep up her face as her head slowly cocked to one side. She bit her lower lip, trying to supress a smile. All of a sudden, she didn't feel so angry with the Professor. No, in fact, she felt... odd. But it was a nice kind of odd. The kind of odd that just... took time. She continued gazing at him. It was pleasant , whatever it was. Eliza didn't think she had ever felt like that before, ever. However, the longer she stared at him, the odder she felt. So much so, that another unnameable feeling began growing in the pit of her stomach. This feeling was different. Her breathing hitched. She suddenly began to feel very hungry, and she wasn't in the mood for chocolate anymore. There was a strange look in her eyes and her lips curled into a coy smile. Uh oh. Henry did not like that look. He did not like it at all. \"Oh, um, yes, Eliza,\" said (a very flustered) Henry, getting up from his seat. \"Well, the strangest of things do happen at three in morning, it's perfectly understanda – Wha..?\" Before he knew it, Eliza had pulled him by the collar and pinned him against the wall. \"Eliza!\" Henry roared, shocked at her indecent behavior. What happened to being a good girl? She narrowed her eyes and smirked. \"What on earth do you think you're…!\" Without a word, she pressed her lips onto his mouth. He attempted to resist at first but, by George, was she determined! Her hands cupped his face and she kissed him like her life depended on it. He prayed all the noise she was making wasn't too loud, he didn't want anymore unexpected visitors to the kitchen that night. \"Henry!\" she whimpered against his lips, her brown hair getting tangled between them. Henry broke the kiss. \"Excuse me!\" he bellowed, his hands pushing her away from him. He was outraged. \"That's Professor Henry Higgins to you, little - hmmph!\" She flung both arms around his neck, pulling him closer to her. He had never seen her so passionate and so, well… wild. After a few moments, she broke the kiss and sighed, satisfied. Her breathing was heavy. She seemed short of breath and hell, Henry was too. She closed her eyes and nuzzled her head into the professor's neck, arms wrapped around him. What the devil… She backed away, straightening her nightgown and fixing her hair. The ribbon on her nightgown had come undone, her brown hair, which was usually always so neat and tidy, had become unruly and messy. On top of that, she had a lovely glow about her. Henry had never seen her like that, and he didn't know why but for some reason it took every ounce of self-control he had to stop him from pouncing on her right then and there. She bit her lip and smiled at him slyly, knowing full well the effect she was having on him. Her hand pulled at his collar, once again bringing his face close to hers. Their noses touched and she looked into his eyes. \"Goodnight, Professor,\" she purred, her voice low. And with that, after having one last look at him, she walked out of the kitchen. Henry stood rooted to the ground, looking confused. \"The strangest of things do happen at three in the morning…\" he mumbled to himself as he turned out the light and walked back to his room.

After watching My Fair Lady enough times, I found my long-dormant shipper heart awakening in regards to Freddy and Eliza. So, I picked up a modified version of the 30-day OTP challenge and started this—what will eventually be a series of 30 vignettes, one for every day of the challenge. These will, as a result of how the prompts are set up, be out of order, with the exception of a few mini-arcs I have planned. Also, since I am terribly out of practice with writing romance, these vignettes and ficlits will cover a variety of genres. Lastly, this is, indeed, movie-verse, but I am drawing a couple elements from Shaw's epilogue. Challenge 1: Holding Hands . It had been nearly a year since the Embassy Ball, and in that year, so much had changed. Indeed, as she headed back to a small, but welcoming, flower-and-grocery shop from having delivered an order to a grateful customer, Eliza Eynsford-Hill, nee Doolittle, had to admit that she could never have imagined her life taking the turns that it had taken. She'd have expected that she would've still been selling flowers on the street, alone, instead of in a proper shop, alongside her husband. Of course, she would have hardly expected to have been married—and to Freddy Eynsford-Hill, of all people! Professor Higgins, of course, had dismissed Eliza as foolish for choosing him (though he had attended the wedding—albeit most begrudgingly), but paid him no mind. However, the reality that their little shop was struggling, that the two of them had to take up residence in the back rooms of the shop (which proved to be most aggravating at times, for they were attached to the train station; though they had learned to ignore the constant hustle and bustle, it was very hard to ignore the Express whenever it barreled past them), and that they just barely had enough money to make ends meet did hang over their heads like a thundercloud. But Freddy repeatedly insisted that however gloomy that cloud was, it would never be able to ruin the love that they shared. And she returned his sentiments. And he did his best to treat her like a queen; he was the first one awake in the mornings and the last to retire at nights in order to make things as easy as possible for her. Sometimes, he would even forego sleep altogether; he had been doing so for the last couple of nights, trying to calculate the accounts himself. But no matter what he was doing, he would always set aside at least fifteen minutes at the end of the day to massage Eliza's feet. Eliza would try to return the favors in whatever ways she could. With the both of them also attending evening classes, she would work her hardest to handle whatever orders came in through the day on her own to allow Freddy the chance to study during the slower hours in between serving customers who arrived in person; Eliza usually did her own studying in the morning and at night. It was a most hectic schedule, but one that always seemed to work—and there was always the weekend to look forward to, as those was the two days in seven that they had entirely to themselves. But today was not the weekend, alas; it was Thursday, and that meant having to prepare for their classes. She finally arrived back at their shop, suppressing a sigh as she entered. A small bell attached to the door rang cheerfully, announcing that the door had been opened. \"It's only me,\" she called. She was both surprised and concerned when she didn't receive a reply, and, at first glance, there didn't seem to be anyone else in the shop. \"Freddy?\" Still no answer. Her first thought was that Freddy had stepped out to get something, but there was usually a note on the door when that happened—and there wasn't one now. \"Freddy?\" she called again, her voice, in her concern, starting to betray her East End roots. This time, she was rewarded with a quiet sound from behind the counter. She quickly rushed back there, her heart in her throat. \"Freddy!? Freddy, what happened?! Why are you—? Oh…\" He was fine, thank goodness, but three nights without any sleep had finally caught up with him. He had, apparently, been working on the accounts and trying to study at the same time, if the scattered books were any indication. Out of sheer exhaustion, he had closed his eyes, intending to only do so for a minute or two, but had instead fallen into a deeper slumber—and had fallen out of his chair in the process. \"Oh, Freddy…\" She gave a slight shake of her head as she knelt on the floor beside him, gently moving his upper body so that his head rested on her knee; she suppressed a smile as she realized how she had sang about wanting such a thing that very night after they had literally bumped into each other. It was all still clear in her mind—the rainy night, the spilled violets, his hasty apology before running off into the rain… Of course, it had also been the night she had met Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering only minutes after meeting Freddy, as well—the night that had started everything, leading to where she and Freddy were today… The smile she had been holding back did, finally, push through her lips as she took her husband's hand in hers. Freddy finally stirred at this, though he kept his eyes shut. \"…Eliza…?\" \"Yes, it's me. Go back to sleep.\" \"No… No, I can't; I have work to do…\" He flinched, trying to lift his tired limbs. \"What's the time?\" \"Never you mind,\" she insisted. \"You've already driven yourself to exhaustion; I'm not about to let this go any further.\" Freddy would have protested had he not been so exhausted; as it was, he grasped Eliza's hand in order to reciprocate her previous gesture of holding his. \"…Sorry,\" he mumbled. \"Whatever for?\" Eliza asked, surprised. \"For falling asleep after three nights of doing the accounts? By all rights, I should've put a stop to it before it got this far.\" \"Don't you blame yourself; I won't hear of it,\" Freddy insisted, opening his eyes to look up at her. \"You are wonderful.\" Eliza just smiled again. \"I do mean it,\" Freddy insisted, softly. \"I know,\" she whispered back. She had previously had her doubts about the praises that Freddy had showered on her—the entire reason why she had ranted to him about being tired of hearing words that night after the Embassy Ball. But it wasn't long until she began to see the sincerity in his words—that he did consider her to be the world. Still smiling, she gave his hand a squeeze. \"Go back to sleep,\" she instructed him. \"You need it. I'll wake you when we have to leave.\" \"But the shop—\" She placed her free hand over his eyes. \"The shop will be fine. Everything will be fine,\" Eliza promised. Freddy sighed, quietly, and Eliza knew why. \"Everything will be fine\" had been their mantra for the past several months; it was the one thing (aside from Colonel Pickering's generous help) getting them through the harsh realities of what they had to contend with: the days when there were no customers and money was due to their creditors the next… the days when they were both frustrated from the amount of studying they had to do in addition to their work… the disdain they constantly received from their families for the choices they had made… the heartbreaking moments when they discussed that they both wanted children, but knew all too well that they had to wait until they could afford to provide for them… And whenever one of those moments drove one of them half-mad, it was the other who would provide comfort with open arms and a reassuring whisper. Someday, things would have to get better. They never once questioned their decision to get married, though; that was the one thing they did not regret. On the days when they were despairing, each was able to find solace with the other. It was on these occasions that Eliza would often feel very badly for Freddy; she, at least, was used to having very little. Freddy, for his part, lamented that he could not give Eliza all that she deserved. He would spend countless hours discussing the kind of life he wanted for her—one where they would not have to worry about making ends meet and where they could have the family they wanted… Promises that he wasn't sure he could keep, but would certainly try to do so… Castles in the air in a realm of dreams where he was the king, and Eliza was his queen… For her, always for her; there was never any selfishness on his part. Eliza pulled herself back to the present, removing her free hand from Freddy's face to see that he had fallen back asleep, despite himself. \"I know that we don't have all that we want,\" she said to his sleeping form as she continued to hold his hand. \"And maybe someday, we will get it. But, for now, we have all that we need.\" Gently, she raised his hand and held it against her cheek. \"Thank you, Freddy,\" she said. \"I love you.\" She watched over him as he slept, not moving until it was time to wake him. Softly, she hummed a familiar tune to herself as she kept her vigil, finding that she was now able to answer the question she had asked herself so many months ago. Yes—it was loverly indeed.

This is a My Fair Lady one-shot that I've had ready for over two months, but haven't let myself post until I updated my Pride and Prejudice story called Without the First Couple! I hope you like it! Henry Higgins was awakened from a rather pleasant dream by a rather unpleasant sound. It was a very common noise to be heard at 27A Wimpole Street, but that did not make Henry like it any more than he would have had it been a noise heard once in a lifetime. It was the sound of a child crying. Henry's child, actually. He was still not accustomed to having a child, as Henry Higgins had been a confirmed bachelor until the age of 37. Henry would have been content to remain that way for the rest of his life, were it not for Eliza. The young woman he had turned from scum off of the street into a lady happened to be Mrs. Henry Higgins. It had been rather humiliating for Henry to realize that somewhere throughout their arguments and speech lessons he had fallen in love with her. They had gotten married five months after the Embassy Ball, and a year later Henry finally felt that he was used to married life. The very next day, Eliza had told him that she was with child. But thoughts of how much his life had changed since he met Eliza would have to wait, as one and a half year old James Higgins was awake and crying. Henry turned over on his side and looked at his wife. It appeared that Eliza had not heard her son awaken, and was sleeping peacefully, a fact that made Henry quite envious of his wife. \"Eliza. Eliza, wake up, the child is crying.\" Henry gently shook her shoulder. Eliza stirred, but did not wake up. \"Eliza. Eliza. ELIZA. Elizzzaaaaaa- Oh, you are awake.\" Henry's whining was put to a halt by his wife turning over in their bed and hitting him with a pillow. She yawned and asked sleepily, \"What do you need, Henry?\" \"James is crying, and I cannot sleep!\" Eliza rolled her eyes and yawned again. \"Then go comfort him so he will stop crying.\" Henry gaped at her. \"Why the devil would I do that? Eliza, you are his mother, can't you make him stop?\" His wife muttered, \"Yes, but I am much too tired to do so.\" Eliza then fell asleep. Grumbling something about how letting a woman in his life led to an immense lack of sleep, Henry got out of bed and walked through the door to the adjoining room that held James' nursery. The room was blue and brown, and appeared in every way to be the stereotypical nursery, apart from the shelf of books by Keats, Milton, Shakespeare, and other classic authors. Henry had insisted upon the selection, claiming that he did not want his son to become a \"completely uneducated dolt like Freddy Eynsford-Hill\". As his gaze settled on his son's bed in the corner, Henry's eyes softened. Although he was certainly not used to being a father, he did indeed like it. What was not to like about little James Hugh Higgins? He was the spitting image of his father, except for his eyes, which were the same hazel-green as his mother. The boy was adored by everyone, and spoiled mercilessly by his grandmother Higgins. His godfather and namesake, Colonel Hugh Pickering, frequently declared that he was \"the most handsome youngster ever to be seen\". Henry found himself agreeing with that statement more fervently than he was comfortable with. He bent over the crib to look at little James. The toddler immediately stopped crying at the sight of his father's face. When James was born, Higgins had been delighted to spot the obvious similarity between himself and his son, but as he grew, Henry found himself more excited by how James appeared to idolize his father. In the rare cases where Eliza could not seem to calm James down, she would simply hand him to Henry and the boy would stop crying. It was something that Henry constantly teased Eliza about, and had, on several occasions, resulted in his slippers being thrown at his head. Not that he particularly minded, as he usually made Eliza repay him with a kiss. \"There now, James, you don't want to make your beloved father go deaf, do you?\" Unlike most people, Henry Higgins did not use a different, softer tone of voice for young children. For the very few children Henry had to deal with in his lifetime, it was because he did not want to appear foolish, cooing to a young child. But with James, it was simply that he wanted his son to experience the majesty of the English language in a proper accent. Eliza found this extremely ridiculous and amusing at the same time. He sat down with James in the rocking chair and began to rock his son to sleep. \"Now James, repeat after me; the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.\" James giggled and said, \"No Dada, me no like sprain.\" Henry had been attempting to teach his 18 month old son to speak proper English by using the same phrases and techniques he had with Eliza when he was her teacher. Needless to say, it wasn't working. Eliza had tried to explain to Henry that children weren't meant to learn proper English grammar before age five, but Henry insisted that James was a fast learner and would be the \"only intelligent child in London\" by the time he was done with him at age two. That was one bet that Colonel Pickering did not want to make with Henry. \"No James,\" Henry reprimanded, \"You say 'I do not like', not 'me no like'. And I do not understand why you insist on calling it 'sprain'. It is a fun phrase to say, not a pain in your ankle!\" James just giggled again. \"But dada,\" James said sweetly, \"Sprain is pain!\" He then broke into a laughing fit. Henry smiled fondly at his son. When James had first started speaking, he had tried to teach him to say \"father\". Eventually, Henry grew accustomed to hearing James say \"dada\" every day, and found it rather endearing. \"Now James, I am afraid that you must get back to bed. Normally your mother would have put you back to sleep, but when I tried to wake her up, she hit me on the head with a pillow! Can you believe that?\" Henry ruffled James' hair affectionately, making his son laugh again. Despite his claims that the toddler needed to go to sleep, Henry spent the next two hours talking to his son. Only at three in the morning did Henry realize that at one point, James had fallen asleep. Laughing at how carried away he had gotten, Henry carefully put James back in his bed, realizing how tired he was himself. He made his way back into the master bedroom and got into bed beside his wife. Once sleep had almost taken him, he felt the warm lips of his wife kiss him on the cheek and say, \"You are an excellent father, Henry.\" Henry just smiled and pulled Eliza closer to him.

Don't be ridiculous, this is entirely-\" \"I AM GOING TO BED!\" The two that were bickering on the sofa looked up in surprise at Colonel Pickering's declaration, as they had not heard any of his previous announcements. Hugh Pickering was known to be a patient, even-tempered man. Unfortunately, even patient, evenly-tempered men have their breaking points. Three weeks away from the Embassy Ball, the Colonel was being kept up at ridiculously late hours by his friend Henry Higgins, who was striving to teach Eliza everything about etiquette and upper-class mannerisms that she would need to know for the ball. She was doing remarkably well, made all the more confident by her now impeccable accent, but Higgins was relentless in his teachings. This is how Colonel Pickering found himself in Higgins' study at 2:30AM for the third time that week. He was tired, irritable, and had had enough of Henry and Eliza's constant bickering. \"Oh, goodnight then, Pickering,\" Higgins replied with a wave of his hand from the sofa. Eliza snuck a glance at him, before she quickly rose and said, \"I believe that I will follow the Colonel's example and go to bed…\" Before she could actually get anywhere, Higgins grabbed her elbow and pulled her to sit back down next to him on the sofa. \"No Eliza, you are not going to bed until you get this right!\" She glared at him, and as they began arguing again, the Colonel shook his head in disbelief and left the study, closing the door behind him. At 3:00AM, Higgins and Eliza had moved past their argument and how to address an Earl, and were focusing on ways to greet normal members of the wealthy class. However, not even Henry could hide his yawns for long, and Eliza was so tired she was hardly trying anymore. \"Professor, can we please be done now?\" she begged sleepily. He rubbed his eyes and shook his head no. \"Eliza, we only have three blasted weeks until the blasted Embassy, and you are not going to your blasted bed yet!\" \"But even you are tired! You've yawned at least twenty times in the past ten minutes.\" Eliza protested. She was quite right, Higgins knew, but he needed to hold onto his pride, even at this dreadful hour. \"Tired as I may be, you are going to learn this by dawn, even if we have to stay up until then!\" Eliza was desperate for any sort of rest, at this point. \"Can we not just take a break for two minutes? Close our eyes, rest up, and then start again? Please, Professor Higgins?\" Her teacher sighed, knowing that he had already lost. He grumbled in annoyance, \"I never could stand whiny young women.\" But seeing her even more annoyed glare, Professor Higgins rolled his eyes and said, \"If I was not tired as well, you would be staying up until five in the morning working on this! Seeing as I am tired, I will give us TWO MINUTES to rest our bloody eyes. But if you fall asleep, you little guttersnipe, I will personally throw you BACK in the gutter and LAUGH IN YOUR FACE when you wake up!\" But Eliza was too happy that she could close her eyes to care about his idle threat. He was Henry Higgins, after all, and he enjoyed being intimidating. Eliza knew him well enough to recognize that although he quite frequently made declarations of the sort, he was too good a man to actually act upon any of his words. She leaned her head back on the sofa and closed her eyes, feeling even more tired now that she was finally allowed to relax. Henry stretched both of his arms along the back of the sofa in his favorite position, and also leaned back his head. Almost immediately, Higgins began to feel extremely drowsy. It was a very relaxing silence, after all, and he had been so tired for the past month of cramming for the ball, and it was 3:00 in the morning, and… Henry Higgins vaguely noticed Eliza's head landing on his shoulder, but it did not matter, as half a second later, he was asleep. The very first thing that Higgins thought when he woke up was; since when has my bed been so comfortable? It took five seconds until he realized that he was not in his bed, but on the sofa in his study. In confusion, he glanced at the clock and saw that it was 5:55 in the morning. Almost immediately, the man realized that he was not alone. Eliza Doolittle, his pupil, his houseguest, his friend , was curled up into his side. Her head was gently sitting on his shoulder, with his cheek resting on top of her hair. One of her hands was on his chest, and in return, his arm was drawn across her shoulders and back, ending with his hand on her waist, holding her close to him. Henry doubted that there was a more pleasant way to awaken. His face flushed bright red at the thought, and he slowly lifted his head from its more than comfortable resting place on top of hers. Thinking quickly, Higgins thought of two things he could do in the situation. The first option, of course, was to jump off the sofa, get a safe distance away, and mock her about it later. This was certainly the most in-character way for him to deal with it, and he would have done just that had it been any other woman. Oh, yes, Higgins thought spitefully, had it been any other bloody woman that I woke up bloody cuddling with. Any other bloody woman. Eliza, what the devil have you done to me? Option number one, however, had one rather large problem: it wasn't just any other bloody woman sleeping beside him on the sofa. It was Eliza. This was why there was an option number two for Henry. Henry's second option, however, was much more pleasant than the first one. It was also more risky, and that was why he was hesitant to try it. For option number two was to stay there, not awaken her, enjoy the rare contact as it lasted, and deal with the consequences later. While his conscience and personality told him to go with option one, his- well, his what? His heart? His soul? His shoulder that was currently being used as her pillow? Whatever it was, it told him to go with option two. Higgins probably would have remained conflicted until the sun rose, but that was not what fate had in store for him that day. She moved. Eliza snuggled herself even closer into his side, and wrapped her arm more soundly around his opposite shoulder. She turned her head up ever so slightly, so that her face was buried in his neck. Henry did not breathe. He didn't dare move a muscle, trying to calm his rapidly beating heart. Suddenly, Eliza mumbled something. Henry didn't hear a syllable of what she said, but he felt her lips move. Her lips that were on his neck. This was something that he was trying very hard and failing very miserably to forget. She was moving closer to him again, although by this point he couldn't see how it was possible for them to be any closer than they already were, and Henry only realized too late that Eliza was waking up. Her head lifted from the crook of his neck as she yawned, and Eliza's arm that had been draped across his chest reached up to stretch. After stretching, she set her head down back on his shoulder and put her arm across him again, and Henry turned his head down to look at her. He was hardly in control of his movements; it was as if he was in a trance. Eliza's eyes opened. Her face was less than two inches away from his, and Henry was captured by the chocolate brown of his eyes. Eliza had an odd look on her face, one that, he supposed, resembled his quite a bit. Her expression was clearly overwhelmed, yet very relaxed and content. Neither realized it, but two entire minutes passed in that stance, gazing into the other's eyes. Henry and Eliza were both still very tired, and in the strange state of mind that one tends to wake up in. Eventually, however, the professor broke the silence by saying hoarsely, \"Good morning, Eliza.\" \"Good morning,\" she whispered back. The moment had not yet ended, and he was rather sure that whatever he did while it lasted would not bear any consequences for him. Still in his dream-like trance, Henry slowly moved his free hand to caress the side of her face. Eliza continued to look at him, not objecting, not moving. Part of his mind, the part that despised any sort of feeling, was screaming WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU DOING? DON'T KISS HER, DON'T YOU BLOODY KISS HER! Well, that along with many other curses. Higgins was about to listen to this part of his mind, before he happened to glance down at her lips, and suddenly the only thought he could focus on was; Good Lord, I want to kiss her. He was leaning in now, ready to close the extremely narrow gap between them, and her eyes were closing, and so were his, and he could almost feel her lips on his, and- The clock struck six o'clock, and the trance was broken. They were both frozen in place, lips less than a centimeter apart, and in the same embrace they had woken up in. Henry slowly pulled away, and they detangled themselves from each other slowly, without making eye contact. After that was done, they sat next to each other awkwardly, with a foot's distance in between them. Higgins ran a hand through his hair in distress, proceeding to mess it up in a manner that Eliza would have found rather endearing had she been courageous enough to spare him a glance. \"That did not actually happen. Agreed?\" Higgins finally uttered, with a shaky voice from the realization of what had almost transpired. Eliza nodded stiffly, her face an extremely tomato-like red, and said in the same manner, \"I think I will be going to bed now.\" With a nod from him, she swiftly rose from the sofa and left the room, closing the door very softly behind her. Henry was alone. He let out a shaky breath, and ran a hand through his hand once more. Henry closed his eyes, willing himself to commit to memory what just happened, then trying to figure out why. It was clear that he harbored strong feelings for Eliza, and she evidently returned enough of them to let go of her \"good girl\" image and kiss him. Although he dearly wished that he could have kissed her properly, for they had hardly even started before they had to finish. Higgins shook his head in dismay, knowing that it was all too late, and he would never be granted the opportunity again. He would just be forced to pretend as if nothing had happened. For if he did not, she would surely know how he felt about her, which was very distressing for the professor, as he didn't even know yet how he felt about her. They were certainly more than just friends, but couldn't possibly be in… He didn't even want to finish that sentence. Five minutes later, as Henry Higgins drudgingly made his way up the stairs to his bed chambers, he thought bitterly; let a woman in your life… A/N: I hope you liked it!

The thought ran through Higgins' mind over and over again as he roamed the streets of London, looking for his \"masterpiece\", Eliza Doolittle. Where the devil could she be? I can do without her. She's nothing but a flower girl; a piece of dirt. With resentment, Higgins remembered the last encounter that he had with her, in his mother's house. How dare she tell him to call her Miss Doolittle! He was going to call her what he wished, and that was that. Higgins, you're being a perfect little idiot. She'll come back when she has nowhere else to go. The thumping of his heart and the dreadful feeling that was threatening to overcome him contradicted that thought. What if she didn't come back? What if Eliza went and married that ignoramus Freddy? Then Higgins would have to see her at the silly little tea parties that his mother always hosted. Perhaps he would have to treat her like an intellectual equal - that undeserving nitwit - and listen to his mother talk about being civil to her. Civil! As if he didn't treat her nicely. As if he didn't already give her more than she deserved. Even Pickering told him that he ought to be reasonable. Higgins was always reasonable. And if Pickering, a man of good sense, had the nearsightedness to say that, he could only imagine what his mother would say. As Higgins thought about tea parties, it occurred to him that it was at one such gathering that Eliza had made her first public appearance since the beginning of the experiment. \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.\" That damn line. It occurred to Higgins that it was the first time that she had seen that fool Freddy. How could he not have noticed the way that idiot was positively drooling over her? Afterwards, there were all the maddening times when he had come to the house, asking to see her when she was busy - and each time, Higgins had instructed Mrs. Pearce to throw him out. No, no, no! Eliza couldn't marry him! That guttersnipe, that flower girl, his masterpiece , whatever she was, couldn't marry that drooling idiot. Higgins could go over all the logical reasons that he had put together against that relationship until the end of time, but there was one reason - not logical by any means whatsoever - that he kept trying to deny. When he had told Eliza that he would miss her, he meant it. Higgins would more than miss her, and he loathed to admit it, but he was strangely drawn to her. Yes, it went against all the things that he had told himself. He was a confirmed bachelor, and a man who had said so many times that young girls were stupid. Eliza was no exception. But when Higgins had gone to the jeweller's that day, to rent the things for the embassy ball, he had bought something as well. A beautiful little ring. He knew Eliza's size too, and there was a rather sly grin on the jeweller's face as Higgins finally settled on a reasonable price after a good deal of haggling. He had intended to keep it away in a corner, and he had started regretting the act of absolute foolishness as soon as he got home. Why the devil did I have to buy it? The thought ingrained itself in Higgins' mind as he hid the ring in one of his drawers. And there it had sat, thankfully evading detection by Mrs. Pearce and Pickering. Until that morning, of course, when he learned that Eliza had bolted. When the door had closed behind the older lady, he hurried to dress and retrieve the ring, hiding it away in a coat pocket. Oh, if she hadn't run off from Higgins so quickly! He gave up all logical reasoning as he kept walking at a brisk pace, hands planted deeply in his pockets. If she was lost forever, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself. He would regret it deeply if Eliza married Freddy, but he would never admit that he felt that way. Higgins' reasonable side told him that he ought to give up the search for her - she could be anywhere at all in London - but his other side feared that she might be becoming Mrs. Eynsford-Hill at that moment. No, she will return. She will return, because she has nowhere else to go. Higgins told himself as firmly as he could, making his way back to his home, 27A Wimpole Street. Brief snatches of the conversation that they had returned to his memory. \"I can do without you.\" Eliza declared, looking out of the window. Higgins was silent for a moment, contemplating what to say, as he sat up in his chair. For a second, his ego melted and he made a face as he sighed. \"You'll never ask, I suppose... if I could do without you ?\" He asked. Eliza turned around, wondering if she ought to give in, and admit what she felt. But the memories of Higgins being rude and giving her hell soon won over. \"You'll have to do without me.\" She replied. \"I can do without anybody!\" Higgins snapped, getting up from the chair and walking towards the fireplace. \"I have my own soul, my own spark of defiant fire.\" He hesitated for a second, thinking again. \"But, uh, I shall miss you, Eliza. I have grown accustomed to your voice and your appearance.\" He added. \"I confess that humbly and gratefully.\" Higgins walked towards her, hands in his pockets again. \"I even like them, rather.\" \"Well, you have them both on your gramophone and your book of photographs. If you're lonely, you can turn the machine on. It's got no feelings to hurt.\" Eliza said. \"I can't turn your soul on.\" Higgins' tone was plainly sincere. No, he really couldn't. When he threw the doors open to his living room, the first thing that greeted him was his gramophone, playing some classical music. Oh, damn it. Higgins thought to himself as he walked over to it, remembering what Eliza had said about it. With a sudden surge of anger and frustration, he smashed the record. As Higgins walked over to a chair, to try and think of what he would do next, he accidentally flicked a switch, turning on one of the old recordings, made on the day Eliza had come marching into his house, a Cockney flower girl and nothing more. \"I ain't dirty! I washed my hands and face before I come, I did!\" Perhaps Higgins would have to make do with these recordings. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps Henry Higgins was wrong. \"I shall make a duchess out of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.\" That was his voice, confident and cocky as usual. If Higgins had only known what this experiment would make him feel like. He could boast all he wanted to, but was it at the price of his feelings? No, he couldn't take it any more. He couldn't. Higgins reached over and switched the gramophone off, feeling that heartache all over again. He hated that feeling and he despised himself even more for allowing himself to feel that way. Oh, what have I done? Higgins lamented inwardly. \"I washed my face and hands before I came.\" It was unmistakeable, that voice, the way the phoenetics were pronounced. Without a doubt, it was Eliza. He whipped around in his chair, an almost childlike excitement on his face as Higgins realized that all perhaps wasn't lost. \"I did.\" There she was, standing at the door, a smile on her face. He had never seen her look more beautiful or radiant than at that moment. With the picture of her in his mind, Higgins turned his chair back around, his heart racing again, but in the good way this time. \"Where the devil are my slippers, Eliza?\" And as he spoke, his heart did a jump for joy and his fingers reached for a very special possession in his coat pocket.

Somewhere Between the Blessed Isles and the Brooklyn Bridge by Eppie Black New York, 1902- Amsterdam Vallon I had a dream that told me my life was about to change, even though Indidn't know it right at first. At the very first I didn't even realize thatnI was dreaming or even that I was asleep. One chill fall night after I had locked up the Harp and Drum I was layingnon our bed staring up at the ceiling trying to relax myself into sleep.nJenny was curled up beside me, already asleep. It was so quiet in thenbuilding that I could hear a pencil scratching against paper in the nextnroom; My youngest son, Sean, diligently hunched over his engineeringnmanuals. Suddenly a louder scrape of wood against floor made me turn my head towardnthe middle of the room. An old chair had been turned away from Jenny'sndressing table and now faced the bed. In the chair sat Bill Cutting as solid as a living man and just as pitifulnand tortured a human soul as he had looked the first night that I had seennhim this way, the night I saved his life. Just like that night forty yearsnago he was wrapped in an American Flag, the one he always said had coverednhis father's coffin on the way to the cemetary, the one that I knew wasnright that second hanging on the left-hand side of the bar mirrorndownstairs in the Harp and Drum. Then he spoke, though it wasn't to me, and despite what he said it was thensudden familiarity of his voice as much as his words that chilled me to thenvery bone. \"He's gonna have to cross the river soon.\" He said with a deep sadness. If his voice chilled me the one I heard next paralyzed me from deep withinnand brought the tears in my eyes down to my cheeks. I heard the warmth, thenfull-fledged County Kerry accent of my father's voice as a second specternmaterialized behind Bill Cutting. \"There's no reason to be sad about it. He's lived a full and honourablenlife.\" \"But how's he gonna die, Priest?\" said the former ruler of the Five Pointsnlooking back over his shoulder. \"Have a heart-attack throwing somenworthless drunken mug out of the bar? Drop dead of a stroke over hisnaccount book? That ain't a death for a warrior!\" Bill's temper was getting up, I could see that he was twitching with it,njust like he had when he was alive. My father had fully materialized now.nStanding there in his long black coat he towered over Bill, still sittingnin the chair. \"No Bill.\" my father said reaching down just then to smooth The Butcher'snever-wretched hair, touching his erstwhile mortal enemy with a calmingngentleness. \"Amsterdam won't die like that. He'll find his own honorablendeath. Even if he has to go looking for it, just as you did.\" Bill looked up at my father and said, \"I hope Amsterdam does a better jobnof it than I did. I didn't mean to get fusiladed by the United StatesnNavy, you know. Thank God the kid struck the killing blow. I mean, that wasnembarassing.\" I could almost swear that as the two specters faded, I could see my father,nPriest Vallon, smiling indulgently at Bill Cutting. I thought that after that I lay awake, thinking about Bill and Father andnmy life and them talking about me dying. My father had given me life. He made me believe that there was a God, justnbecause he was himself so much like what I thought God was. He made menbelieve in love just because he seemed to embody it in himself. When I wasna child, he was my world. Then, years after Da was gone, Bill Cutting took what Priest Vallon hadnmade and what the Reformatory had kept alive and, in his demented andnobsessed way, forged me into a man.

I have a little influence, anlittle respect, an almost honest business and a wife who is my partner andnsoulmate. We've raised seven children together and now have nineteenngrandchildren, whom I would tell you all about with the slightest ofnpromptings. It has been a full and honourable life, just like my fathernsaid. I wonder that, if I have to go, a quiet death might not be best after all.nI don't want to know that I'm dying, because, I don't want to die. Then I wake up and find that I must have been asleep and dreaming becausennow I am awake. It is suddenly morning. Jenny is no longer by my side. Thenhousehold and the city are already both on the day-shift now. I get dressed and head for the kitchen. There's a lot of commotion andnyouthful voices issuing from that corner of the apartment. I stand in thendoorway a moment and watch the scene. Sean is just finishing putting his surveyor's tools into his bag, packingnthem with meticulous care. Our eldest grand-daughter Mary Pat is slicingnbread. The other four grandchildren who live with us (that is Katie, MarynPat's sister, whose mother we lost to the streets and Billy, Patrick andnJanie whose mother is in service uptown) are busy getting ready for school. Jenny is bustling around, serving breakfast and inspecting school uniforms.nComing close to me she gives me an old familiar look and says, exageratingnher accent, \"It's good of ya to honour us with your presence this morning,nAmsterdam.\" I laugh, because when she talks like that she sounds like she's stillnbarely twenty and because, even in her housedress and apron, she looks likenshe ought to be some grand-dame presiding over a high-tea uptown instead ofnbeing my wife feeding the grandchildren bread and cold potatoes down herenin our little apartment above the Harp and Drum. Then I'm swept into the fray myself, tying Billy's and Patrick's ties fornthem. But part of my mind lingers elsewhere. \"It's a man's job to teach a boy how to dress like a man.\" Jenny saysnsetting me to work. I try to teach them the knot, but in my head I'mnremembering the scrape of my father's razor against his face. Then Patrick brings me back to the present: \"Grand-da.\" he says in his high-pitched boy's voice, \"our Sean's going downnthe big hole today.\" \"The one the uptown people are going to run the trains through.\" Billy addsnwith an eight-year-olds solemnity. I glance up at Sean. He's standing there in a corner now backed up againstnthe hoosier cabinet, eating his breakfast, a cheese sandwich in one handnand a mug of coffee in the other. \"I'm surveying the IRT excavation today. Well, just helping with it,nreally.\" he says between bites. Sean is twenty-two years old. With his blonde hair, green eyes and fairnskin he certainly looks like the blood of my blood. He's not though. Likenall of our children he was once one of the city's unwanted, orphaned andnabandoned. My first memories of him are of a sickly, collicky baby who wenweren't sure would live a month. Now he's the brightest, hardest workingnlad in New York City and very proud of his hard won training. Standingnthere wearing the long canvas duster coat he uses to protect his clothesnfrom construction debris with his bag of notes and instruments slung acrossnhis shoulder he almost looks ready for battle. \"You're going down that big hole?\" I ask him. There's something that seemsnto catch in my throat at that moment. I've got this terrible feeling all ofna sudden that my Sean is being sent down that hole as an expendable Irishncanary. It must be the past being so close to the surface this morning. \"Yeah, I am.\" he answers me proudly. \"God be with you, Son.\" I murmur in reply. He smiles at me as if I were a thousand years out of date. \"Sure, Da.\" he says. Then Jenny catches wind of my mood and she's saying to me: \"Where are you this morning, Amsterdam? You look like your half way innanother world.\" I have decided what I want to do with this day so I say to her, \"If you andnthe girls can take care of the early customers, I've got a mind to take thentrain to the cemetary, visit our dead and light candles in the mortuarynchapel.\" I want to take Sean with me, but I know that won't be possible so I suggestnthat I take Patrick and Billy. \"The nuns can do without them for one day.\" I said, \"so they can go and payntheir respects to the ones whose names they're wearing.\" The two boys want to go, of course; they want to ride the train and lightncandles. Jenny would be absolutely livid if she weren't so worried aboutnme. She tells the boys -in no uncertain terms- that they have to go to school.nBut placates them by saying, \"Your Grand-da can take you on the train onnSaturday. You can go someplace nice.\" Then everyone is ready and the kids are on their way out the door. Seanntakes the hands of the two littlest ones, Patrick and Janie, as Jennynreminds him to not let them out of his sight until they meet up with Kwi,nwho'll be walking her own brood to the same school. Sean is about to makenhis usual complaint about risking missing his train, but he catches my eyendecides not to. Then they are gone. Mary Pat leaves the room for another hour's sleep.nWe're alone in the kitchen, me and Jenny. Jenny pours coffee for us bothnthen sits across from me, looking at me hard, searching like. \"Are you still going out there?\" she asks. \"If you and Kwi and Mary Pat can handle the Harp and Drum.\" \"You know we can.\" I nod. She's making me feel like going out there is a shameful thing and Indon't like it. This shows on my face. \"Don't be that way, Love, you know the boys have to go to school.\" shensays. \"It's not that.\" I say. \"Don't you think they deserve candles, Jenny?\" This she thinks about for a little while. She isn't upset about opening thenHarp and Drum by herself or about me suggesting my grandsons miss school.nShe is actually thinking about my question. When she is done considering it the corners of her mouth turn up slightlynin a small and rather serious smile. \"Priest Vallon doesn't need your prayers and Bill wouldn't appreciatenthem.\" she says and laughs. I share the laugh, but I'm about to tell her that I think that Bill wouldnappreciate our prayers more than she thinks. Suddenly but gently she covers one of my hands with hers. \"Those were such violent times and such violent men.\" she says \"It's almostnimpossible to remember that that was New York. It feels like a thousandnyears ago in some far away place. All they wanted was for their tribes tonsurvive. As though they were Red Indians or Visigoths and Huns, ornsomething. Then we were coming up, you and me and our eldest children, andnall we ever wanted was to never be dirty or hungry or shot at ever evernagain. The children now, they can see a life beyond all that. The bestnthing that telling them about those days could do is give them nightmares.nLet the past be.\" I nod and caress her hands with my free one, butnI'm not convinced. I think suddenly of Sean, climbing down into that bignhole our \"City Fathers\" have seen fit to blast into New York. It reminds mensomehow of St. Michael the Archangel fighting the dragon on my father'snmedallion. I feel the weight of that religious medal on my chest and wondernif it's time to pass it on. Will he even understand it? ---The End[Chapter 2] Meanwhile - Just Down the Street Inwood - a promising Manhattan neighborhood of \"model\" tenements for thenworking class and neat row houses for the middle class scattered with smallnshops and businesses; Up the main thoroughfare hurries a man of middlenyears and greater than average weight. Then he pauses, takes his floridnwatch out of the pocket of his equally garish vest and stares at itndistractedly. He wonders if it is too early to \"honor\" the unofficialnmayor of Inwood with a visit. Suddenly he closed his watch, tucked it backninto his vest pocket and resumed his former pace. The name of this overgrown errand boy was Benjamin Franklin Murphy.nEverybody in the neighborhood knew him, but nobody knew exactly what hendid. Except that they knew he was someone you could go to when you were inntrouble, when you needed the system greased- when you needed Tammany Hallnon your side. They knew that in turn you would always hear from him comenelection day. Murphy had already been down to the Wigwam once already and was now back innInwood even before the sun had a chance to warm off the chill of thenSeptember morning. If it was important enough to get him moving at allnungodly hours of the morning then it important enough to get AmsterdamnVallon out of bed, Murphy finally decided. Especially since waking thatnmost venerable sleeping tiger was precisely what the Boss had in mind. This was going to be an exceedingly tricky, Murphy thought, Amsterdam wasnnot a Tammany man. Yet Tammany wanted him, needed him, had to have him.nThe Boss had made that very clear. Benjamin Franklin Murphy sighed, he managed to keep clear of most ofnTammany's dirty business. Tammany was no gentleman's club, it was, howevernit was the only party that cared about them \"down here\". So, Murphy wasnloyal to Tammany and Tammany was loyal to Murphy, as long as he deliverednhis quarter each election day. It was a fine line that Murphy walkednbetween loyalty to the Wigwam and loyalty to his neighborhood, yet it wasnprecisely his ability to walk that line that made him useful to both. Now as he walked, he thought about Amsterdam Vallon, who had in a sensenbecome his quarry that morning. He had always had a thought that theirndestinies were linked somehow. This morning that thought worried him. Benjamin Franklin Murphy I was just a lad of fifteen on that long hot summer night of July 13, 1862.n My folks didn't light a candle in the window. Instead, we boarded up ournshop. Skilled tradesmen with their own workshops, even ones as low on thensocial scale as a tanner with a hole in the wall off Paradise Square,nfeared the prospect of a riot as much as they feared the draft. We spentnthe next day hiding in the dank, dark, cellar of our shop while the citynoutside determined to commit self-murder. The day after the riot, mynbrothers and I escaped into the streets to see if the world had changed. In Paradise Square people milled around in small desolate clusters. Thenbuildings were not damaged were tightly boarded. Wagons took away thenbodies of the dead. Intermittently showers of fat warm raindrops fell tonput out the last of the smoldering fires and wash blood into the gutters. We fell in with a group of boys our own age, most younger than me, andnexchanged stories. We were young enough to be excited by the idea that ourncity had been the site of battle, especially since we had cut our teeth onnnewspaper reports of the War. I remember one of us, I don't remember who,ninventing a wild tale to explain it - it had Confederates and Lincoln'snarmy running around like mad with British Redcoats thrown in for goodnmeasure and all of it somehow triumphant for New York in general and for usnin particular. I lost my temper with - the way older kids do when theynrealize how little a younger compatriot understands the basic fabric ofnreality . In other words, I yelled at him for just being a kid. \"If it's a battle, this is, then I think we lost it, boyo!\" I remembernshouting. \"That's where you're wrong, Benjy,\" one of the others said, \"I heard thenBill The Butcher's dead and the knife that's buried in his chest isnbelonging to Priest Vallon's own son.\" Now here was a story of epic proportions that I could give a littlencredence to. William Cutting's thugs were a terror to every artisan andnshopkeeper in the Points; that was God's honest truth. Priest Vallon wasnbit more on the mythical side - in some tales he was more like an avengingnangel than a man, taller than life, wielding a sword and an iron cross usednas a shield. But even my Mam, who didn't want aught to do the gangstersndescribed Priest Vallon as a true Irish patriot and a defender of thenChurch who was deviously murdered by Cutting. If Priest Vallon's own sonnhad killed the Butcher then the Points had a new ruler. The thought of annoble Irish boy-king ruling the Points - there was an idea capable ofngiving me a frisson of excitement and new possibilities. It was the next day that someone pointed out to me a man of about six yearsnmy senior of no more than average height who glared at the world with anwary squint. \"That's Amsterdam Vallon. He killed the Butcher.\" My compatriot whisperednin my ear. On that day, Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall had temporarily relocated its soupndispensing operations from the docks to the streets. Looking to make anlittle money, I charmed my way into the company of the Tammany men. Showingnmyself to be a bright boy, I was picking up a few nickels fetching andncarrying for them. That's exactly what I was doing when I noticed thenpresumed new ruler of the Five Points. He was part of a group of people,nincluding two great huge Plug Uglies and two men dressed in the Dead Rabbitncolors, who were occupying the street corner opposite where the Tammany mennwere distributing food. He sat there amongst them incongruously perched onna chair, watching every move the Tammany men made. My eyes kept wanderingnback to him, a little disappointed, a little fearful, very much fascinated. A little later I was sent out on an errand that required me to pass them. Inset my eyes in front of me careful not to look at the gangsters as Inpassed. Then, \"Hey boyo, I've got an errand for you\" : He called me over to him. He held out two quarter-dollars, quite a prize. I looked at him. From thencloser vantage point I saw that he was wounded in one leg; that's why henwas sitting. His eyes were slightly over-bright. He looked exhausted andndetermined. \"You're not sure you want to take my money?\" he asked, matter-of-factly. I shook my head. \"Don't worry about it.\" He said, \"It's not like their money's any lessntainted.\" He pointed at Tweed's lackeys. I nodded solemnly. \"I'll run you errand, sir, but first I have to do whatnthey've already bid me.\" \"You do that. Then you come back.\" I nodded again. About a quarter of an hour later I was back on the street corner taking thencoins into my hand. Then he entrusted me with a half dollar more and toldnme what to do. \"You take this half-dollar piece over there to the biggest boss that thenWigwam's got over there Make sure he knows who it's coming from. Do younknow my name?\" He sounded genuinely curious. \"Vallon.\" I replied. \"Right, like I said make sure he knows. Then grab a pail of that soup and ancouple of loaves of bread and take it around to the old Satan's Circus.\" \"The Butcher's!\" I involuntarily cut him off with my awed exclamation. \"Not no more.\" He said. \"The Butcher's dead. We are kind of occupying itnlike, until things calm down and we can see what can be done with it. Now,nnext you go 'round back and knock on the door. Ask for Miss Everdeane. Youngive that food to her. We got people holed up there. You understand?\" \"Yes sir.\" I took the money to Pat Tilden, the man who seemed in charge and told himnwhat had happened. \"If Vallon ever speaks to you again.No, if you ever even see him again,nBoy; you let us know.\" Tilden said and pressed the money I had just givennhim back into my hand. So, I set off with the bread and soup, reflecting on the pleasant fact thatnI had already made an entire dollar off the venture. No wonder I'm stillnrunning the same errand to this day.n.................................... Benjamin Franklin Murphy rang the off hours bell at the Harp and Drum andnsoon the shutters of an upstairs window were opened. The flame-haired mollnwho had answered the back door of Satan's Circus forty-years ago was thensame woman as the grey-haired wife staring down at him. \"What is it you want, Murphy?\" she said. She sounded annoyed, but as usual Murphy wasn't sure if the annoyance wasnreal, or if she was playing with him. \"I need to speak with your husband, Mrs. Vallon. It's important this time.\"nHe called up. Jenny Vallon shook her head as if to suggest that his statement wasnimplausible. When Murphy opened his mouth to explain, she quickly cut himnoff. \"Shut your gob. I can't listen to you both at the same.\" Then she turnednaway and said, \"It's 'Mr. Tammany Hall' Murphy, that's who.\" Then there was a slight pause in the proceedings, during which Murphy feltnhis mood sink lower and his anxiety level rise. He greatly suspected thatnAmsterdam would be in the mood to talk the blarney and he needed to talknserious. Jenny ended the break in the conversation. \"No,\" she said loudly to theninterior of the apartment, in a tone that suggested that a monumentalnpatience with the ways of men was being worn away, \"If you want that said,nget over here and say it your-ownself.\" Then sure enough, she turned from the window and out of Murphy's view andnAmsterdam Vallon took her place at the window. \"Murphy,\" he called down. \"What are you doing sticking your pig-nose in mynbusiness at this time of day? Can't them that pull your chain at the oldnWigwam at least wait 'til I open my shop before you hand them a report ofnwhat color socks I'm wearing today?\" Yeah, he was definitely in the mood for a bit of verbal sparring. BenjaminnFranklin Murphy wished he could sincerely oblige but stood there instead,nheavy of purpose nervously fingering the large gold-plated links of hisnwatch chain. \"Please, Amsterdam, it's a serious matter I've come to discuss with younthis morning: come down here so we can talk business.\" He said. And as he stood there he knew that those familiar blue eyes were scanningnhim as they narrowed to slits. Not that he could see this, not really atnthis distance. But he knew it all the same - whether this knowledge wasnbased in familiarity or whether he could actually feel that discerning gazenwas not something Benjamin Murphy would like to think too much on. \"Oh, so it's official high-mucketty-muck business your Lords and Mastersnhave sent you on. Is it, you pretentious lace-curtain buying bastard?\"nVallon replied. Murphy was pleased to hear a slight change in his old acquaintance's tonenof voice and felt a corresponding weight shift from his shoulders. The witnwas still engaged, but so too was that sharp steel trap of Vallon's mind.nMurphy knew now that he would not have to force himself to tell the wholenstory: Vallon would gladly drag it out of him. He was so relieved that hentook his usual cu in their ritualistic sparring. \"You bet it's official business I'm on and what I'm saying is that I'llntell you about it if you'll talk to me like a civilized man instead ofnyelling out an upstairs window like the bog bred tenement rat that ya are.\"[Chapter 3] Between the Blessed Isles and the Brooklyn Bridge Chapter 3nWar in the BowerynBy Eppie Black and Dogbrain Notes: All previous disclaimers apply. Dedicated to Shannon \"Porkchop\"nCowden. The sight of Benjamin Franklin Murphy fidgeting outside my window hadnserved to lift my spirits for a short while but it was all too easy to seenthat my favorite Tammany lackey had a whole lot more on his mind thannconvincing me to back up the Wigwam's latest slate of candidates andnwhatever political panacea they happened to be pushing.

Anyroad, I unlocked the door for him and we sat together innthe empty bar, him shaking like a leaf and me beginning to think back to myndream of the night before. I could feel trouble headed my way. Murphy refused my offer of coffee and then a further offer of a cigar. ButnI was in need of both and so procured them. He lit a cigarette of his ownnand then sat there looking at me like he was wanting something fromnme.authority, I guess. Something I didn't want to wield no longer but, wellnI took the bait and the lead in the conversation. \"What's troubling you, Benjy?\" I asked. Then Ben Murphy launched into a story of open gang warfare on the streetsnof our city the likes of which I had not heard since me and the Butcher'snfinal dust-up was interrupted by the Draft Riots of 1862. ........The Events of the Previous Evening............ \"All right, gentlemen, lay down your bets for the next round. Lay 'emndown.\" Called Colleen Kinney, a gaudily beribboned female stuss dealer. Asnshe continued her patter she sized up the customers at her table. The first, a shabby, hunched, hungry-eyed old man, quickly placed a sparendace, two pitiful pennies on top of the ace of spades that was painted ontonColleen's table then equally quickly dropped a copper lug onto the blacknqueen. \"A widow to win and a lady-wife to loose.\" Pattered Colleen, who wanted tonfeel sorry for the little man despite her knowledge that it was addictsnlike him who put the butter on her bread. \"How about you, Sir? Lay your brads down.\" She added to the next customer.nNow here was the type she liked to see at her table - a right swank youngnthug got up in his best clothes and spreading a swell of cash around,napparently in order to impress the gay bene blowen on his arm. They werenkicking up the high life and having a grand time of it. \"Well, Pops here might find the lady a loser. But I feel lucky tonight.whennit come to the dames.\" Said the young tough as he laid a half-dollar on thenqueen of spades next to the old man's lug. \"Oh youse!\" laughed his moll, playfully slapping his arm. Her dangly pastenand glass earrings flashed in the dim light of the stuss dive as she shooknher head giggling. Then her man put his lug on top of the five of Spades.n\"That's the Lady to win and the Burroughs to lose.\" Said Colleen, callingnthe bet. Then she turned to her third customer. This guy she really didn't like - henwas far too cool. For the past hour she had been trying to figure out hisnangle. Was he a gambler who believed he had worked out a system? Was he andetective about to raid the place? Or were they about to get knockednover.again? Then the cool customer dispelled any questions regarding hisnorigins by reaching into his vest pocket, pulling out a red handkerchiefndecorated with white borders and proceeding to ostentatiously mop his brownwith it. At Annie Picken's table nearby two customers performed exactly thensame actions. As did one at Wa-Lin's in the corner. And the young man whonhad been cautiously sipping the heavily baptized beer at the dingy bar. Andnyet another man standing by the door. Porkchop Cowden, the proprietor of this particular gambling dive, which wasnnestled beneath the Allen Street arch of the Second Avenue elevatednrailway, stormed into his own backroom and grabbed the lapels of the dappernyoung man who had been watching the stusshouse through a peephole. \"Did you see that!\" he seethed. \"Them 5 Pointers flaunting their colors innmy crib! You going to do anything, Ritchie? Do I have Eastmann's protectionnor don't I?\" \"Calm down 'Chop, calm down.\" Said Ritchie Fitzpatrick, not without a hintnof threat since he was after all the first lieutenant of the most powerfulngang in the Bowery. \"You got my backing, so you got Eastmann's backing,nokay.\" Fitzpatrick then forcefully removed Cowden's long thin fingers from hisnlapels. \"If you behave yourself that is. Me and my crew will take care ofnyour vermin problem and send those Dead Rabbit wannabes back south of MikenSalter's place where they belong.\" Cowden, still agitated, reached for his pistol from his shoulder holsternand spinning its barrels started murmuring, \"Knocked my place over threentimes, I'm goin' to pop a cap in some 5 Pointer tonight, man. I don't knownif these third rate yegs ya' brought with ya, can do the job. I gotnfirepower. I got this baby and my big one 'neath the bar.\" His words werenfeverish and his eyes were rolling in his head. Ritchie Fitzpatrick looked at him and was somewhat disgusted, \"No need fornthat. We just send them back to Paul Kelly with a shinty on their glimmersnand a pain in their breadbaskets. That'll be enough to learn them that thenBowery belongs to the Eastmanns. Now get out there Cowden and mind yourntill.\" Another tense hour passed before Colleen called for the last bets of thenevening. One of the 5 Pointers stood up. \"All right, Cowden, give us ournregulars.\" said Louis Liogge moving towards the counter. \"I don't owe you nothing!\" shrieked Cowden, \"This place belongs to thenEastmanns.\" Liogge slung a beer bottle toward Cowden and it slammed into the wallnbehind him with a loud and satisfying crash. Ritchie Fitzpatrick and hisncrew emerged from the back room, brass knuckles and slung-shots swinging. It looked like the 5 Pointers might get the drumming that Fitzpatrick andnCowden had decided that they deserved but Liogge's was a doughty crew andnCowden's agitation only grew as he watched the 5 Pointer's handle thenEastmanns all too easily and continue to wreck his dive. Even ShannonnCassidy, an agile but inexperienced teenage 5 Pointer managed to get anlucky blow in and evade his Eastmann opponent. As said Eastmann collapsednto the floor in pain clutching his manhood; Cassidy sprinted over him, gavenhim an extra kick in the side for good measure and grabbed the cashbox. Cowden popped up from behind the bar and with a hysterical shriek shotnCassidy square in the chest. The stuss girls and cowering female customersnscreamed. Every man in the joint who was carrying a firearm drew. The youngngangster fell dead weight to the floor. The cashbox crashed spilling itsncontents. Liogge fired at Cowden but he ducked back beneath the bar. Thenbar mirror shattered. Simultaneously yet another of Paul Kelly's soldiersnfired at Cassidy's original opponent. Still dazed from Cassidy's blow tonthe groin, he went down, wounded in the stomach. Cowden crept around to the end of the bar where he fired off his shotgun'snsecond round at Liogge who had taken refuge behind an overturned stussntable. Stung by splinters of the shattered table, Liogge realized thatnthere was no percentage in fighting a shotgun with pistols in the crowdednconfines of the stusshouse and, also that Cowden would now have to reload.n\"5 Pointers out!\" he yelled and gave good example. As Eastmann's men picked themselves off the floor - they saw that one ofntheir own was also down oblivious to irony and with a cry of \"Murderin'nthieves!\" they too spilled out into the streets. For a moment the two crewsnstood on opposite sides of the street glaring at each other. Just thennCowden popped out of the stusshouse door and fired off two wild roundsnhitting nothing (for which the Eastmanns, themselves, had even more causento be grateful than the 5 Pointer). As the 5 Pointers took cover, Liogge stood still, full of dark thoughtsnabout the Eastmanns in general and Cowden in particular. Suddenly full ofnrage that Cowden still lived while Shannon Cassidy, his protégé, lay deadnin the stusshouse Piogge raised his pistol and took a carefully aimed shot.nPorkchop Cowden did not have long to meditate on the difference between ancrazy fool with a shotgun and a crack shooter with a fine pistol: He dovenfor cover but too late and a third body landed on the floor, this time,nhalf-inside and half outside the stusshouse. Within seconds both crews were under cover, but still exchanging fire.nWithin minutes, the first reinforcements from both gangs began to arrive.n.................................... \"Within an hour there were over a hundred gangsters trading potshots atneach other from behind cover beneath the second avenue el.\" ContinuednMurphy. \"and then the Gophers showed up.\" \"The Gophers showed up?\" asked Vallon laughing. \"Yeah, I guess it looked like too much fun to miss.\" \"It sounds like the biggest dust-up in years.\" Said Vallon shaking hisnhead, \"but that many boyos out in the street and only three deaths. Thatnain't a serious war, Benjy, what's all the fuss?\" \"They drove the police back twice before they gave way, Amsterdam. Thencoppers had to organize reinforcements from all the surrounding precintsnand come in with a massed force.\" Amsterdam couldn't help but wince at that phrase. He'd seen a massed forcenall right. Memories of the effects of a fusillade of bullets on his fellownfive pointers came into his mind. The memories of the draft riot could benhid sure enough, but hit the right trigger and out they came. Murphy quickly understood the look on his friend's face. \"It wasn't likenthat. There weren't even many hurt when the coppers came in.\" Amsterdam Vallon smoothed his hair back and leaned back into his chair.,n\"Sure and do you think I'm the only one who remembers? I don't want to seenanother war in the streets of this city.\" \"Neither does Tammany Hall. That's why the boss wants you to referee anparley between Eastmann and Kelly.\" Said Murphy.

He's tired of trying to be with Lauren when all he thinks about is FDR. He's also tired of FDR mucking up all his dates with Lauren when he has been trying to break things off with her. FDR flooding his flat was the last straw. So, he packed a duffle and drove Lauren home. He also broke things off with her while they were in his Jeep. He knew it was a dick move, but at least Lauren understood after he told her about his feelings for his best mate. She kissed him on the cheek and told him to go for it. So, he is. Tuck lets himself into FDR's flat and glares at the bikini clad woman swimming on the ceiling before tossing his duffle onto the counter and stripping his way into the loo. He uses FDR's very expensive shampoo, conditioner, and soap and takes an extra-long hot shower until the water runs cold. FDR deserves it because he fucking flooded Tuck's flat, which is going to cost a pretty penny to clean. He dries off and wraps a towel around his waist, ignoring the fact that he smells like FDR and how much he likes it. He picks up his wet clothes and rings them out in the tub before laying them out to dry because FDR sends his clothes out to clean, which means no washer and dryer. When he leaves the bathroom, he ignores the gun FDR pulls on him out of fright and picks up his duffle as he walks down the steps to the living room. \"Jesus, Tuck!\" FDR says as he puts his gun on the kitchen counter after flicking on the safety. \"You scared the shit out of me.\" \"Good. You deserve it, mate.\" Tuck sets his bag on the sofa and turns to FDR, whom is avoiding eye contact while he pours himself a drink. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" FDR says with an air of nonchalance. Tuck snorts and takes out a pair of sweats from his bag before pulling them on and losing his towel. \"You flooded my bloody flat!\" FDR finally looks up at him and Tuck really wishes the man's eyes weren't so bloody beautiful. \"Those candles were a fire hazard.\" FDR states and Tuck growls. \"The only reason they were out was because my landlady was having the electricity repaired!\" Tuck pinches the crook of his nose and takes a deep breath. \"And now I have to pay to get my flat cleaned out as well.\" \"So… you didn't set candles out for Lauren?\" Tuck looks back up at FDR and sees confusion on the beautiful man's face and he just wants to reach out and smooth the crinkle out from between FDR's eyebrows. \"No. I didn't. And I wouldn't have had to have taken her to my place at all if you wouldn't have mucked up the past three dates with her when I was trying to end things. I thought my flat would be fine, but apparently I was wrong. So I had to be the guy that brakes up with a girl in his car as he drops her off.\" Tuck shakes his head as he chucks on a shirt and heads towards the kitchen, desperately in need of a beer. \"Waitwaitwait.\" FDR rushes out as he grabs Tucks elbow. \"You broke up with Lauren? You've been trying to break up with her?\" Tuck frowns, \"Yes. You knew that. Why else would you sabotage my dates just when I was about to break things off with her?\" FDR drops his elbow and avoids eye contact again as he walks back to the sofa. Tuck follows and watches as FDR flops down on the cushions and runs his hands over his face. \"That's what you were doing right? You were trying to keep me from dumping her, so I would give things a chance. Right?\" \"No.\" FDR murmurs. \"What?\" Tuck is confused so he stares down at FDR with his arms crossed as FDR keeps his gaze focused on the coffee table in-between them. \"I was trying-\", FDR sighs and scratches his jaw as he leans his head back to stare at the ceiling. \"I was trying to keep you from sleeping with her.\" \"Why the hell would you do that?\" Tuck chuckles. He hears FDR growl before the man stands up and starts to pace; back and forth, like a lion in an enclosure at the zoo. Tuck raises a brow when FDR finally looks up at him and the pacing ceases. \"I didn't want you to sleep with her-\" \"Yeah, you said that-\" \"-because I want you sleeping with me.\" FDR finishes. Tuck promptly bites down on his tongue. It hurts, but he really wasn't expecting those words to come out of his best mate's mouth. FDR rushes on before Tuck can say anything. \"I'm not just talking about sex. Yes, I want that, but I want everything else too.\" He starts to pace again. \"I want to actually sleep next to you and wake up to your face every morning. I want to make you pancakes for breakfast and drive to work together and go with you when you get to pick up Joe from school. I want to take you to Nana's every Sunday for dinner when we're not working. And I want date nights and nights where we just stay in and watch movies on the couch with my head in your lap so you can play with my hair. I want to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries in bed with our phones turned off and no need for plans. I want to go with you when you visit your dad's grave in Manchester because I want to be there for you, all the time. And I want to take you with me when I go visit my parent's tree at Nana's farm, where I spread their ashes, because I've never taken anyone there and I want to do that with you. I want everything. The good, the bad. Everything.\" FDR stops pacing once more and looks up at Tuck. Tuck knows that he's crying a bit but he can't help it. FDR visibly swallows as he looks at him and Tuck sniffs. \"I just, want you.\" FDR says softly and Tuck can't take it anymore. He surges forward, walking over the coffee table without thinking and literally pounces on his best mate, causing them to tumble back into the sofa. He's straddling FDR's lap and devouring the man's perfect mouth with vigor. FDR moans and grips his thighs causing Tuck to shiver and fist FDR's hair. The kiss is all tongues and teeth, it's heady and a bit frantic, but it's perfect because it's FDR and Tuck. Tuck sucks in a breath when he breaks the kiss, his chest heaving in and out as his heart starts to calm down. FDR seems to be trying to catch his breath too when he looks up at Tuck, those beautiful blue eyes bright and piercing. They cause Tuck to swallow and his hands to shake as they cradle FDR's face. FDR reaches up to wipe Tuck's cheeks and he closes his eyes at the feel of FDR's touch. \"I'm guessing that you want me too.\" FDR smiles and Tuck huffs out of his nose as he looks down at FDR. \"I've always wanted you, you bloody idiot. I'm hopelessly and irretrievably in love with you, Franklin Daniel Robert Foster.\" FDR just stares up at him in disbelief before he chokes out a wet, \"Yeah?\" Tuck nods, running his fingers through FDR's hair and rubbing circles into FDR's cheeks with his thumbs. \"Yeah. Have been for a few years now.\" \"Years?! You mean we could have been doing this, years ago?\" \"Apparently, yeah.\" Tuck laughs. \"I didn't know you felt the same way and I didn't want to muck up our friendship, so I never said anything.\" \"Same here.\" FDR says. \"But we're doing this now, right? Cause I really want this. You and me. Because I am utterly and inescapably in love with you too.\" Tuck bites his lip to keep his face from splitting in two and he settles even closer on FDR's lap so their chests are touching. \"Yes, yeah we're doing this.\" He purrs into FDR's ear before he nips at the lobe, causing FDR to moan and runs his hands along Tuck's thighs before gripping his ass. Tuck grinds down on FDR as he leans back to pull off his shirt and smirks at FDR when the enchantingly beautiful man bites down on his bottom lip, trying to hold in a gasp. He bends forward and nips at FDR's mouth until it opens willingly with a contented sigh. He just licks into FDR's hot mouth when the door to the flat dings and they both groan in unison. \"It's nearly ten, were you expecting company?\" \"No.\" FDR frowns, then he visibly pales and his hold on Tuck tightens. Understanding comes to him and he looks down at FDR, \"Let me guess, it's probably some stewardess with a layover?\" FDR swallows, \"That's entirely possible, unfortunately.\" The door dings again and Tuck pecks FDR on the mouth before climbing to his feet and heading to the door. \"What are you doing?\" FDR calls. Tuck smirks at him, \"I'm staking my claim, love. You're a taken man, Franklin, be a dear and remember that.\" Tuck turns back to the door and smiles to himself when he hears FDR's soft reply. \"For the rest of my life.\" ","Summary":" Tuck is tired.

If you've seen This Means War, you must ship FDR/Tuck or you are blind. Seriously. \"You've seen it! You've seen it in Bangladesh!\" Picture this: They're kissing each other, and it's fast and it's furious and neither one of them want to stop. It's the kind of spark you would only get with a single person, if you're lucky, and it's one neither has shared with a woman. It's chaste and awkward, but it feels just as exciting as a first kiss would. FDR's always been the more dominant half so he's the one tugging at Tuck's shirt, urging him - begging him - with his harsh fingers to take it off. Tuck responds enthusiastically, sliding out of it so FDR can trace the lines of his tattoos. It's the heat, it's the wine, they tell themselves. They'll both regret it in the morning, everyone always experiments with their best friends, they're both drunk off their asses. Excuses they'll never get to say except to themselves because they know they aren't drunk, and they won't regret it the next day. It's sickening, almost, feeling this overwhelming lust for your best mate, and wanting to mark every inch of his body with your tongue. They should stop, they keep whispering to each other through pants and heavy breaths, but neither one are doing anything to justify their demands. They keep going and going, roaming their hands through trouser fabric, and their lips on necks. Tuck hears the clink of his friend's belt buckle come loose and he knows they aren't going to stop. x Tuck wakes up second. His disheveled head rises above the silky sheets and through his blurred line of vision, he sees FDR pulling on a shirt over his Calvin Klein boxers. FDR notices the other man's gaze on him and looks back with a secret smile. They would always have Bangladesh. ","Summary":" A/N: Paraphrased the quote.

Come back soon. I, uh, miss you. Bye.\" It had been the seventh message that night. But of course, he had reason to call him so many times, he had been gone for three hours, after all. But it was all because of him. It was his fault he was reeled out in the street, drunk off his ass and mumbling ramblings to himself. Damn Tuck. Damn Katie. He had promised he would never go back to her, something he swore one night at FDR's apartment. He had been so happy. But now, he wasn't. Because damn Tuck had to get back together with Katie and it kinda-sorta-maybe really broke his heart. He had drowned his sorrows in a bottle of bourbon, something he never drank unless he was with his best fucking friend. Fucking Tuck. There's always a first time for everything, he supposes, finally shoving himself against a wall and slumping down into a seat, flipping open his phone once more. Three more calls. When was he going to stop? He wasn't, and FDR knew that. He knew they were best friends. And that was what hurt the most. They were best friends and Tuck had the nerve to break a promise he made to him. It made him sick. Or was it something else? No. It was definitely the promise-breaking. So there he was, listening to Tuck's voicemails like a pathetic asshole. He must have looked crazy. He felt crazy. No one turned down FDR unless they were blind and deaf. He could get any girl he wanted. Why didn't get the person he wanted this time? Why didn't he get Tuck? Wait. So there was more to the story. Of course there was more to the story. No one could really believe Tuck and FDR were just best friends, could they? They practically eyefucked each other any time the other entered the same room. It was ridiculous. Why did Tuck go back to Katie? Wasn't he good enough? Wasn't he satisfying enough? Did he just not have a vagina and that was the reason his best friend didn't want to do him in Nana's guest room even though they were literally laying on a bed together, because \"it was too loud out there\"? Was Tuck just a dumbass? Of course. He couldn't see that his best friend was so blatantly in love with him? Did Bangladesh mean nothing to him? Clearly not. \"You need to come back to your apartment, Franklin. I'm not fucking around. I need you now.\" I need you now. They sounded so cheap. Franklin wasn't the common whore. He wouldn't come home. But. Tuck sounded so needy and desperate and FDR knew how worried he was. He had called him ten times, for chrissake. That had to mean something. It was the alcohol talking. Tuck didn't need him. If he really needed him, he would dump Katie's ass and make out with his best friend. But no. Tuck strived for a normal lifestyle. This was 2012. Tuck needed to get over himself. He also needed to stop fucking calling. The ringing was leaving a pounding migraine in his head, and the other man's persistence was doing nothing to help. Ring, ring. Fuck. \"What?\" \"Franklin! Where the hell have you been? You scared me to death, you know that?\" Ugh, not the martyr act. \"Come home right now! Where are you? I'm coming to pick you up.\" \"Fifth on Hiltson,\" he managed drowsily before hanging up. Tuck could get lost for all he cared. Which he didn't. Care, that is. x It was twenty minutes before he saw the flash of blinding lights. Damn Tuck. He found him. \"You're a real piece of work.\" It took a few minutes of struggling before Franklin latched onto him and was thrown into the car. Tuck was such an asshole. He was always the friendly and sensitive guy, with his damn kindness and general like-ability. It was sickening. How were they even friends? He couldn't stand guys like Tuck. Yet, he was best friends with him. x The ride was quiet until FDR couldn't take any of the maddening silence anymore and spoke. \"The reason I-\" Buzz, buzz. \"Hold on one second… Yes, darling? Have you put him to sleep?\" What a fucking shocker. Katie. Fine. Tuck could have his cake and eat it too. ","Summary":" Written completely out of my ass on an iPod Touch. \"So… Uh… Yeah.

We all know what McG did. \"Seriously, no.\" \"It never happened.\" \"He's right. Nonexistent. What—uh—whatever you guys think we—might—\" Franklin paused, slamming his drink on the table. Christ, thought Tuck, he was good—he was unbelievably fantastic in the squeezing the truth out of some Russian mafia but so goddamn useless in protecting his own. He'd have thought he was a better actor. Tuck scratched the back of his ear. \"Nothing, mate. We—\" he motioned between him and his partner (partner at work, silly, whoever gave Trish that idea?). \"—were best friends. And that's about it.\" One of the guys narrowed his eyes. Some daredevil act. They were fully aware of his and Franklin's real jobs now. There were no reasons to go all bitter on them, especially when they were about to bond as one family. The Brit held back an internal sigh. He was at Franklin's bachelor party, after all. Sitting in the hot seat. His best man. What a position. It was that time of night when the room started spinning a little faster, the flickers of those dimmed lights intensified a little more, the beats of the music throbbed the bar's walls a little harder, and alcohol fused in with the invitees' blood a little better for them to start snooping around the groom's back story. Some were Franklin's relatives—those that he knew well showed up and left them alone, most of the time (after that time at Nana's, they…but wait. He shook his head. No. It didn't happen.). The guys from Lauren's side of the family…didn't. And there he was, all suited up, sitting next to his best friend (best. friend. Because what else could he be? He's getting married, legally bonding himself to someone else (some lucky girl you were trying to woo at the same time as him, but that didn't matter), and you're moving in again with your wife. What are these thoughts? What funny feelings in his stomach when he first saw Franklin tonight in his damn fine new suit? (The guy was obsessed. And Tuck couldn't help playing along. Hey, he was just giving his opinion on whether his best friend looked good in new suits. What's wrong with that?) None! None.) in a bar he wouldn't be caught dead in. The new century crashed in on him when Franklin pulled him into the bar's entrance, and, God. He really should have gone out more often. He didn't give himself a chance after having become an eligible bachelor all these years. (What about those nights with Franklin? CHips marathons on the sofa? Guy nights! Those didn't count.) Bollocks. He's just really happy Franklin's settling down. So happy he's recounting the past moments they've had together as partners (at work, damnit). So. Happy. xxxxxxxxxx Complications rushed in when he was about to get a refill on his third drink. Some bastard—fine, cousin —from Lauren's side of the family managed to invoke some sort of a question-the-groom game. Tuck was on his other side of the table and the guys sat opposite of them, facing off, waiting for any secret, dark deed he'd done to spill from his lips. At first he let them have it. And Tuck whistled. He knew it was out of character of him. But he was trying to fit in. To be nice. For Lauren. Aren't they the guys he's going to have to put up with every Thanksgiving and fucking Christmas from now on? If he's serious about marrying her, yes. So he told them the basics. Embarrassing high school stories. First dates. His letter to the editor of a certain magazine asking for his first celebrity crush's phone number. (He heard she's married now. And he's taken. Obviously. Sad world.) Women he slept with. The real reason behind his transparent swimming pool décor. Then the inevitable (that he had been praying would not happen) happened. One brunette guy clicked his fingers. \"Those are interesting,\" he said, \"Interesting, indeed, FDR.\" He leaned in closer, a finger pointed at Tuck (and Franklin knew what was coming next before the guy even opened his mouth). \"But what about the best friend, huh? Anything else?\" Why the fuck would you need to know? went his subconscious. Why did you agree to this game in the first place, stupid? I was trying to be nice, I told you. Now they're closing in. Dangerous territories. Certain things they don't need to know. They would fulfill their duties as groomsmen perfectly without these horrific stories. Trust me. But— Pakistan. You knew what happened there. His eyes focused on Tuck swirling his glass on the table, calmly waiting for him. He felt like it was the first time he had heard the bar's background music. The group crowding around him seemed to be grinning in anticipation. Why are you bringing that up? That wasn't the story I was planning to tell! What? Oops. Oh, sorry. It was that time when— Carry on. Carry on. The bastard was practically leering at him. Too many shots, brother, too many. You'd better go home for the night. \"You were together since high school, you said? (Together! They were making up crap about Tuck and him without even hearing the full story. Wait. So there was a full story to tell? But he gave a curt nod anyway. Nice. Polite. Now he's down to plain civil. Next it'll be formal work tone—yeah, about as friendly as questioning a criminal.) Didn't you two—\" another guy standing in the back tapped Tuck on the shoulder. \"Experiment?\" Yes. Ye—and No. No. We absolutely didn't. Of course not. xxxxx The closet door slammed shut, and Franklin blinked, trying to adjust himself to the surrounding darkness. He slammed a fist against the wall. \"To hell with high school,\" he muttered, \"I'm never coming to these stupid parties again.\" He heard a soft chuckle. From the sounds of clanks against some brooms, Tuck wasn't that far away. \"Funny,\" the Brit said, \"I thought you've been getting all the invites, Mr. Homecoming King?\" He rolled his eyes. Tuck couldn't see that in the dark, but well. It was tenth grade. His eyes were his prized assets. Those baby blues girls go insane for. And he was just trying to nail that brunette girl he's been after for ages, the queen of some band of some sort. Her figure was fine. Her wardrobe could use a little change, but if that was her style, he didn't mind. When he'd heard from a source that she was coming to this party, he decided to make an appearance. \"I do,\" he admitted, \"But this has got to be a mistake.\" He thought he saw a faint outline of a smile. \"I think the guys are joshing around,\" Tuck offered, \"Me being the new student and all.\" Had they been outside, Franklin was pretty sure his finger pointing at himself would have made a little more of an impact. \"I'm supposed to be in here with Danielle.\" \"Oh.\" The good old whistle again. That sound never did seem to leave his ears throughout their friendship. \"You mean that punk girl there?\" \"Do I detect a hint of amusement in your tone?\" \"No,\" (cough) \"Just that you can't pick your partner in a spin-the-bottle-game.\" \"I get it,\" he said, kicking dust on the floor, \"You're laughing at the possibilities of me with her.\" \"Of all the girls, bloody hell,\" a real laugh this time, \"You could have any of them.\" \"And I did,\" he ran a hand through his hair. \"Didn't like 'em.\" (Tuck seemed to be silent for a while after his short declaration. Part exaggeration, to be honest.) \"But you have a crush on a girl like Danielle.\" \"What do you mean, a girl like Danielle?\" \"The other type of girls?\" his accent was annoying him by the minute. \"The ones who aren't interested in you?\" He raised an eyebrow. \"There are those, huh?\" \"Just because you're popular—\" \"—oh, is this about my status?\" \"—some people might have issues with that.\" \"But that just doesn't make sense! Who hates popularity?\" \"Exactly.\" He scoffed. \"No, she doesn't.\" \"Yes, she does.\" \"No, she doesn't.\" \"I'm sorry, I thought I was talking to the President of the Student Body.\" \"You are, and you were saying something I failed to catch. Or grasp. Because it's just so loud in here.\" \"Right. Girls like that don't go for you, mate.\" \"I'm not your mate. We've just met.\" \"Oh, nice to meet you, I'm Tuck Hansen, if you haven't heard.\" There was an awkward pause, before he started the conversation up again. Fuck. How could it only have been two minutes? \"You're shitting me. Who doesn't go for this?\" \"This what?\" \"Me. Helpless baby blue eyes, hello?\" \"Simple. She's one of those independent types. Surviving high school fine without any remote connection to the main island. Of which you are the king.\" \"You're saying she's just not interested.\" \"Yep.\" \"Even if I send her flowers, chocolates, those stuff, or ask her out?\" \"Yep.\" \"Even if I stalk her?\" \"You won't.\" \"Even if I sneak up behind her and do this—\" Before Tuck could make up another smartass reply, he felt the other boy's hands on his shoulders, spinning him from his side. xxxx \"No drunken shenanigans?\" the guy went on. Franklin tapped his leather shoes impatiently. This party was getting dull. Usually he enjoyed being the center of attention, but not this. \"No crazy night outs?\" No stolen kisses. That much he was guilty of. xxxx He wasn't thinking. That was how it happened. It could have been the alcohol or his pent up frustration at the way the night had turned on him. He swore he would never, ever in his life attempted such an act when his lips touched the Brit's. Tuck was a little startled, caught unaware, but then he responded. And the overwhelming taste shut his senses down. Tangled hands. Lips. Tongues. Hardly breathing. He didn't half know what his body was doing, but it was delicious. Tuck was pressed up against him in a random closet, hands splayed all over the place. He was sure the people from outside could have heard the slam of their bodies against the wall. And he didn't much care. There was a knock on the door. They detached clumsily, Franklin wiping his lips with the back of his hand. \"I—\" \"Don't.\" Tuck said. \"You were good.\" \"Wasn't I?\" he couldn't help it. Lights were already streaming in from the opening doors, as they stepped out to the crowd. \"It was. Just. One time, though.\" \"Never happened.\" \"No.\" \"Tell you what.\" \"What?\" \"I'll introduce you to Danielle.\" \"You're kidding.\" A shrug. \"She'll have missed a great kisser.\" He wiggled his eyebrow. \"You didn't have to test it for yourself first.\" \"She's in my English class,\" Tuck replied simply. \"And besides, you started it.\" Yeah. Apparently they were still standing there talking to one another, chit-chats, as Nana would call it, after they had left the closet. Weird, huh? He shot Tuck a look. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" xxxxx A/N: I don't know what just happened! UGH. I'm supposed to be busy, damn. And here I sit, cranking out a story about these two gorgeous men. Huh. Can't wait to get off this week off, though. Been boring. My brain's melting.

Summary: FDR gets a craving for more than cereal, (LOL I seriously didn't even mean for that to sound dirty!) so he makes a big omelette. He's rather coerced into sharing it with Tuck when he shows up unexpectedly. Just a fun little short. Hope you enjoy! I'm not much of a cook. Odds are, when I do find time for a meal at home, it's probably going to be a bowl of cereal. Which is usually fine, because there's not much point in cooking a big meal for one anyway. But you know, some days you just wake up with a serious hankering for the biggest, baddest, cheesiest omelette you can muster. So here I am, in my kitchen, head in the fridge, realizing that I don't actually have any eggs. In fact, pretty much all I'm seeing right now is a half empty six-pack of Heineken, an old crusty looking bottle of ketchup, and some pickle relish. Yummy. So I throw on some pants and head to the grocery store down the street and before you can say \"les oeufs au fromage\" I'm back in my kitchen. Rachel Ray's chattering at me from the flat screen across the apartment – an episode I TiVo-ed months ago for just such an occasion. When all of a sudden I feel a shadow move overhead and come to a stop. I look up from the skillet and nearly drop it when I realize what's up there, staring down at me. \"What the f-\" It's Tuck. Tuck is in my fucking pool and he's making kissy faces through the one-way glass. I finish up the eggs and toss on some oregano (thanks Rach) before plating up my masterpiece. And oh my gaaaaad it smells delicious. It's already halfway gone by the time I get upstairs. I kick the door open to the roof, and approach the edge of the pool with maybe a little more caution than usual. Tuck's already kicking to the surface and I can see the smart-ass grin plastered on his stupid face. His head breaks water and he shakes it back and forth like a happy dog. \"What the hell, man?\" I step back from the spray of pool water, protectively clutching my breakfast. He's grinning like an idiot. \"Well, good morning to you too, mate!\" He notices the plate and suddenly the stupid grin is replaced by a curious pout, \"Oooo, whatchya got there?\" \"Oh, no. Don't even try to fuck with my breakfast, dude. What the hell are you doing in my pool?\" He grabs the side and wrenches himself out of the water in one swift movement, swiveling around to sit on the ledge. \"What, I thought you said your pool was open season? A free for all, I think you called it?\" I jam another mouthful of eggs and cheese in my face before replying, \"Yeah for hot, sexy women. I don't remember inviting YOU.\" \"No, no. I specifically recall you said... and I quote: ' Come one, come all, if you look bitchin', and no one need know that the bottom is my kitchen. ' Your words.\" \"Yeah. I... I did say that, bu-\" \"Well, FDR. Let's be honest.\" He swings his legs out of the pool and steps towards me with that stupid grin back on his stupid face. \"This is about as... bitching as it gets.\" He indicates his equally stupid muscly body which is now dripping all over my shoes. He looks very pleased with himself. \"Yeah. What the fuck ever, man. You want some eggs? I'm stuffed.\" I shove the plate at him and head for the door.

She laughed at her own naivety quietly. He was so calculable. If you had enough time to psych him out, you could always be one step ahead of him. She walked to the fireplace, put her ring on the finger of her left hand. She apparently sunk in her thoughts. Higgins bared his head, and looked at her in astonishment. \"What the devil are you doing, you squashed cabbage leaf?\" \"I'm trying to imagine how my engagement ring will fit on my finger which I shall receive from Freddy.\" She heard a sort of thud. The hat of Higgins fell down onto the floor, but he didn't care about it. Eliza surmised that her statement disobliged the professor very much. \"What the hell? Do you still insist on that infantile, that brainless, that heartless thing? You... you...\" \"... you would deserve better.\" He finished his sentence only in his mind, but Eliza saw through him. However she didn't melt due to the untold confession at all. \"I've already announced it at your mother's house. We are going to organize our wedding very soon...\" \"How will you gain enough money for the wedding? How will Freddy earn his bread, my dear Eliza?\" \"As I said, I shall be the breadwinner by working as a...\" \"DON'T YOU DARE TO MEDDLE WITH MY PET SUBJECT WITHOUT TEN YEARS OF BEING QUALIFIED, YOU INFAMOUS CREATURE! FUHTERMORE, IF YOU DARE TO TAKE ONE STEP IN KARPATHY'S DIRECTION, I'LL DESTROY YOUR REPUTATION.\" Higgins took a deep breath in order to have a normal pulse. \"Don't you think that I wouldn't do it.' he continued in a much primer voice.' If I did my best, I could arrange that none of the reputable chaps would propose to you. Your father, Alfred P. Doolittle will be thrown back into the gutter where he actually belongs to.\" Tears appeared in Eliza's eyes. She wiped off them very quickly. \"Would you really do it with me? Would you really disgrace me?\"She started to gaze hard at her ring and tittered bitterly.\"With friends like you, who need enemies?\" \"Don't be hypocritical. You would do the same, if you didn't have any other chances... did you forget what you had told me an hour ago?\" Eliza was paddling with her ring and looked into her previous teacher's eyes. \"I've never thought it seriously to betray you. I know, I've no right, without your consent, to exploit the knowledge you've given me.\" Eliza drew herself up majestically. \"I might be poor and ignorant, but I'm not invertebrate. I'm a good girl, I am.\" \"Eliza: if you say again that you're a good girl, I shall tell Mrs. Pearce to drag you by the hair from my residence.\" Higgins discovered fury in her eyes. Eliza bit her lip and clenched her fists. \"You can't treat me this way. I'm not dirt under your feet. You're not my father, and you're not my teacher anymore. I'm a human being, just like you.\" Higgins kept silent and cleaned his throat. This gesture was equivalent to an apology in that case. \"By the way, I just wanted to get my ring back. I think, it will give me confidence and strength in the rest of my life, it doesn't matter what difficulties I shall have to face.\" \"Don't be superstitious, Eliza. Only God can give you power for life. It's nothing, but a ring which doesn't possess any kind of supernatural power.\" \"Well, it still means a lot to me... it was a present from you above all. It will always remind me of that wonderful fellowship which I could come to know by you and the Colonel.\" Although Higgins flipped indifferently, his heart swelled exultantly and he was above cloud nine. How could a bloody jewel be such an important thing to anybody? \"Oh, it was nothing... really nothing.\" \"... you saved my life in Brighton, Henry Higgins. I was drowning and you pulled me out of the sea. If you hadn't been there, I...\" She didn't finish her sentence, but began sniffling. Higgins walked over her, and cupped her face with his hands. \"You would have deserved drowning, you little insect. It's really easy to get a cramp in the deep water and you are not a very talented swimmer at all.\" \"I've never returned thanks for it. Thank you.\" Higgins smiled and shook his head in a paternalistic way. \"Only children beg for permission, ask for forgiveness all the time, and return thanks for everything. Adults don't speak about it, but do it. You were a great pupil of mine... I must confess that. You were accommodating and hard-working... there was no need to your words. I knew that you were grateful to me.\" At the next moment they were cuddling. Higgins pressed Eliza to his breast tenderly and placed his jaw on the top of her head. He closed his eyes and inhaled her sweet scent. He felt her soft skin. Concerning his heart, he would have locked her into a small room, not letting other chaps approach her... including Freddy. In spite of she was a fiancée, Eliza was very content in his arms. She didn't feel herself either guilty or adulterous, since they weren't embracing as lovers , but as very close pals ... yes, very close, good chums who have been a bit nostalgic. Friends ... he's nothing to him, but a good fellow ... she is going to marry, for God's sake. She started stroking his back. She wanted to show him, how much she appreciated his friendship, his care... his affections. That heart-to-heart scene was interrupted by Rose, the maid. \"Excuse me, sir\" Higgins immediately opened his eyes and pulled away from Eliza. He looked at Rose with such a rancorous and disgusted look, as if she was a prostitute or a thief. In fact she was a thief… she's stolen some pleasant moments from him. \"What the devil do you want, Rose?\" Poor Rose blinked awfully, then continued. \"It's half past twelve o'clock, sir. The cook wish to how many people will lunch here.\" \"It's lunchtime, isn't it? By George, time passes rapidly.\" He looked at Eliza with a jaunty smile on his face. \"Would you like to lunch with us, Eliza? Pickering is arriving very soon. He had worried about you too, you silly girl. I suppose, the cook's grown accustomed to make lunch for three people. Actually I don't care, if she hasn't. I pay them for doing their duties, not for doing what they want to.\"he added, glancing at Rose. \"Thank you, but I'm afraid, I have to refuse your invitation. Freddy had already invited me for lunch in order to be able to do the preparations of our future wedding.\" His serene, ethereal look suddenly vanished. He felt, that Eliza twisted the heart in him. How she dared to do this? Isn't she aware of the fact that it hurts him deeply? \"If Mrs. Eynsford-Hill meets your father, she'll make you break off your. You can take my word for it. What a shame! Poor woman... she's going to be the mother-in-law of Alfred P. Doolittle's daughter.\" Eliza's face turned red. \"Don't insult my father. I must admit, that he wasn't a good father of me, but he is still my relative after all. I don't let anyone revile him. And anyway, he is very popular among the members of upper class nowadays.\" \"Until he opens his mouth. You can make a monkey wear a suit but that doesn't make it an intellectual.\" \"STOP IT NOW, YOU BRUTE!\"Eliza totally lost her temper. Rose thought that it was the ideal moment to leave the study room. She was sure that she was going to be one who Professor Higgins would vent his gall on, since she saw him arguing with Miss Doolittle. Higgins felt that he had crossed that line now. Although he desperately wanted to hold her hand and caress her cheek, he just put his hand in his pocket instead. \"I'm sorry, Eliza. I've gone too far now. Eliza,\" he continued\" why do you want to be the Freddy's wife at any rate? You shall have many opportunities to marry... you shall have many admirers. Dukes, earls, barons... they shall be as infatuated about you as Freddy.\" Eliza looked around theatrically. \"Where are they? I can't see any of them. Freddy is the only one who is disposed to ask for my hand in a marriage. And I won't care for anybody that doesn't care for me.\" \"Commercial principles, Eliza. Like s'yollin voylets, isn't it? 'He reproduced her Covent Garden pronunciation with professional exactness.\" \"Don't sneer at me. It's mean to sneer at me.\" \"I have never sneered in my life. Sneering doesn't become either the human face or the human soul.\" Eliza snorted ironically. \"… I am expressing my righteous contempt for Commercialism. You shouldn't trade in affection. Do not marry someone you don't love.\" \"And what am I fit for? My father doesn't mind whether I'm dead or alive. I have no real friends, but you and the Colonel. I don't speak Latin which would be necessary for running a flower shop. I'm not fit for anything…\" She flumped into the chair, where Higgins had sat earlier, and turned on the waterworks. She was sobbing desperately and loudly. \"By George, why do you do this all the time?' Higgins rolled his eyes and sat down on his heels in order not to lose the eye-contact with Eliza.' Listen to me, Eliza. You are... BY GEORGE, STOP WEEPING, WOMAN! I CAN'T HEAR MY OWN VOICE BECAUSE OF YOUR SNIVEL.\" Eliza collected herself and looked into his professor's eyes. Her eyes were full of tears. Higgins took his old, gules handkerchief, and gave it to Eliza. \"Just like old times... Blow your nose, if you're a good girl.\"he chuckled. Eliza blew her nose obediently. \"At last! Now listen to me, Eliza! Don't you dare to tell me, that you're fit for nothing. Understood? I don't want to hear such a silly thing. You've evolved such a logical system in my life which Mrs. Pearce was unable to. And you've living here only for six months, and Mrs. Pearce's been working as my housekeeper for at least 15 years. You are essential, you are bloody important... you are the most important person in my... my... household. Without you my life would be a mush, it would be meaningless, pointless. You... you...\" He sighed. By George, why is that so difficult? Why aren't women able to simply find out the thoughts of men without forcing them to say those words aloud? Why couldn't he simply know what Eliza has in her mind? Did she love him too? Would he make a fool of himself by his confession? Or would Eliza break off their engagement and they could live happily ever after? \"Eliza, please... don't marry Freddy. He's a poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy even if he had the guts to try for it!\" \"What shall I do according to you?\" \"You've decided to marry someone, and as I can see, it doesn't matter who will be your husband. Then... if you want to marry at all events... you might be my wife. You're acting very irresponsible and childish, but it would be a quite enjoyable marriage.\" Eliza's jaw dropped. She dried her eyes and started trembling. He wasn't planning to propose to her, was he? It would ruin everything... \"Your wife?\" \"Yes. Think about it! You met that good-for-nothing kid just a six weeks ago, but we've grown accustomed each other's face during the last six months. As you mentioned it, we were quiet pleasant together... actually we ARE pleasant together. Freddy will be fed up with you sooner or later, and will run away with social-climber heiress from... for instance, New York. Those sort of chaps who belong to upper class, but don't have a penny to bless always marry upstarts. Upstarts need relatives from upper class, and poor members of the upper class need money. They complement each other. However I consider myself rebellious from this point of view: I don't care how much money you have, or what your surname is. Everybody can run out of money, and your social rank depends on fortune. Look at your father, my dear! Despite his laziness and the fact that he's a grab-all, I like him very much, because he will be quite at home in any station of life to which his eccentric destiny may call him. And that's why I like you also.\" Higgins shyly grabbed Eliza's hand and started to pat her palm. He didn't look up to her, but stared at her palm. \"You're clever, adroit, and very talented. You've learned how to be a proper lady. As my consort you could meet well-connected people and gain some encyclopedic knowledge. You could start a new life as the member of upper class. Your class background would be passed by. As Freddy's consort you would be down on your uppers.\" Eliza's eyes widened. What's going on next? \"So? Did I persuade you with my arguments?\"Higgins raised his eyebrows. His voice was calm, his smile was cynical, but there was some kind of hopeful spark in his eyes. Eliza stood up and crossed the room. She wanted to be as far from Higgins as possible. \" A man and a woman should not marry without being in love with the other one. You told me that a few minutes ago.\" \"Who told you that I wasn't in love with you?\"That sentence just slipped out of his mouth. Eliza's jaw dropped. She opened her mouth to say something, but she was unable to say a word. In her heart's content she would have screamed, jumped into his arms and kissed every inch of his face. Instead, she turned back to him. Her face was as long as a fiddle. Higgins blinked uncomprehendingly. What's got that wrench. What the hell does she expect from him? \"What's amiss with you? Did I say something wrong. I told you that I loved you. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to write you two or three times a day sheets and sheets? Shall I spend the half of my income on buying and sending you flowers? Shall I serenade every night? However the last one wouldn't be achievable, since I can't sing.\" Higgins chuckled then continued in a more serious way: \"Seriously, Eliza. I shall not be Romeo, I shall not be your leading man. I've offered marriage, and told you I was in love with you. Don't expect more from me.\" \"I'm going to marry Freddy.\"she said crisply. Henry was thunderstruck. He could die of broken heart at that moment. \"Why are you sticking to your guns? Why do you choose that ninny over me? What does he have that I don't?\" \"I would have a happy and balanced marriage with Freddy. He would never possess me, but would be observant of my independence.\" \"Independence? That's middle class blasphemy. We are all dependent on one another, every soul of us on earth. Which romantic novel bore on you so much?\" Higgins walked over Eliza grabbed Eliza's wrist and pulled her into his arms. \"Now you can't fence with the question. Do you love Freddy or not?\"he shouted. He shook her gently which made Eliza terrified and awkward. She shook her head. \"Are you in love with me, Eliza?\" She pressed her lips and nodded with tears in her eyes. \"By George, why don't you want to be my wife?\" Not getting any answer, Higgins kissed her impatiently and hard. Eliza lost her presence of mind and wrapped her arms around his neck. When she realized what she was doing, she wrenched away, white and furious. The professor was in astonishment. He had thought that a kiss would have been effective. \"Don't you dare to tell anyone this.\"she said stonily. She walked to the door. \"I shall never be your wife.\" She was a tower of strength now. Higgins knew that it wasn't defiance or stubbornness: she announced a well-considered decision. He knew that his speech would have been piffle, everything he could do would be fiddling. He was barging along to his study. He lay down onto the sofa, put his hands behind his head and lost in his miserable, hopeless thoughts. \"... what happened to Miss Doolittle, sir? She's just left your house without saying a word. She was as quick as lightning.\" Without looking at Mrs. Pearce, Higgins laughed bitterly and absently. \"She's going to marry Freddy. Ha ha!\" He roared with laughter. \"Freddy! Freddy! Ha ha ha ha ha!\" Hope you like it. Shaw's Pygmalion inspired me very much. I don't want to plagiarize.

The rights belong to Shaw and Warner Bros.[Chapter 2] Sweet dreams are made ov dis Mrs. Higgins was sitting in her drawing room and reading her latest favourite book. Despite the fact, that she was over 60, she didn't consider herself conservative… as for literature. She had read several book, which were found rather shocking than entertaining by many of her friends. She had been exploring the biographies of different artist, poets, painters, and author for a long time. Most of them had been before their time, and only after their death were appreciated by the society. A lot of authors became successful and popular in the 20th century including H. G. Wells, Beatrix Potter, Edith Wharton, and E. M. Forster who was her latest favourite one. Now she was holding Howard's End in her hands. Suddenly she heard the noise of a pair of high heeled shoes and that somebody opened the door. \"I'm sorry, madam. I didn't know that you were here. I hope I haven't disturbed you.\" Mrs. Higgins looked up and smiled at Eliza, but loured when she realized how unrestful her face was. Her face was flushed and there were tears in her eyes. \"Eliza' she said softly.\"What happened to you, my dear? Has my son affronted you?\" Eliza gazed the floor and bit her lip. \"This time he didn't say anything hurtful.\" \"What did he say then? Believe me, none of Henry's words should be taken seriously.\" \"I must take his words seriously this once.\"Eliza sighed. The old lady started to worry now. What had Henry said to that poor girl? She had been living with her son to find out: Barking dog never bites. No, something sudden had happened. Unless... \"Please, sit down and tell me the whole story.\" Eliza seated herself in an armchair near to Mrs. Higgins and looked into her friend's eyes. \"I think, your son has offered his hand. He didn't kneel down or give me a wedding ring, but claimed that he wanted to marry me.\" Mrs. Higgins opened her mouth, but was incapable of saying a word. Her first thought was to start from her chair and press Eliza to her breast. But seeing Eliza's face, she resisted. From Henry's – and her - point of view, it would have been marvellous, if Henry had proposed to Eliza. She was a nice, charming and intelligent young woman. Regrettably Henry never fell in love with anyone under forty-five. Mrs. Higgins really wished to have a grandchild, and was aware of the fact, that a middle-aged woman was hardly able to give birth to a baby. One day, Eliza Doolittle had become a part of their life. She hoped that the girl would have a good influence on his spoiled son, and moreover she had become attached to Eliza too. However, as for Eliza... it would have been a terrible decision. As people are getting older, they are becoming more and more impatient and intolerant. Her son wasn't young at all, and had always been tend to masterfulness and blackmail. Reducing the number of their meetings was the only way for Mrs. Ellen Higgins to be able to tolerate her own son. Furthermore, Eliza wouldn't allow herself to leave her, if their marriage was unhappy. From one point, it would shock all London concerning their standing on the echelon. From other point – as Eliza had mentioned earlier – Mr. Doolittle would never support her daughter, it wouldn't matter how miserable her fate would be. In a nutshell, Eliza would be completely depend on Henry, which Henry would exhaust sooner or later. \"I suppose, you have said no to him.\"She smiled bitterly. Eliza nodded. \"You were right.\" Eliza felt her empathy and grabbed her hand. \"I am really sorry, Mrs Higgins. You might be the greatest mother-in-law in the world, but...\" \"There's no need to continue. I know what is in your head now. You love my Henry, but deep in your soul, you know that you have no future together. Henry is too egocentric, too loner, and too old to change his nature or manners. There may be no problem in the first year, however when the pink haze vanishes, there won't remain anything, but bitterness and harking back upon the past. Look, as Henry Higgins's mother, I would talk your head off with useless banalities, and persuade you to break off your engagement with Mr. Eynsford Hill. Henry would be extremely lucky with you and you would be a perfect daughter-in-law for me. On the other hand, as a woman, I would never approve your marriage. By the same token, I courage you to accept Freddy's hand in a marriage.\" And that is just what Eliza intended to do. \"It is going to be difficult\"she thought.\"It's going to be extremely difficult... bloody difficult. But I must endure it.\" She would have to keep him at arm's length. She would never let themselves stay alone at a common place. And it would be the easier part. Henry Higgins always reached and received what he wanted. He manipulated people around him, convinced them with a meaningless but precise speech, flattered them, sometimes gave presents, but always charmed his \"victims\". And now he wanted Eliza Doolittle. The young woman looked at her ring and sighed. As if it had been yesterday... \"... By George, Eliza, wake up!\"She heard Professor Higgins' voice. \"Miss Doolittle... be brought, please!\"That was Colonel Pickering. She opened her eyes slowly. The first thing she was the blurred picture of Higgins's head. A few seconds later she could see every part of his face perfectly. She suddenly realised, that she was lying on the beach in Brighton and many of the bathers were kneeling next to her... including Colonel Pickering and Professor Higgins. \"Professor?\" Pickering's face radiated unmistakably relief and joy, as soon as Eliza opened her mouth, but Higgins seemed to remain stubbornly indifferent. \"Thank goodness, she's alright.\" \"What happened to me?\" \"You have got a cramp and probably a sunstroke, my dear...\" \"OKAY EVERYBODY, DON'T LOOK AT THAT SILLY THING LIKE STUCK PIGS. GET LOST!\"Higgins turned to the others and shouted at them. As a consequence the people went away with a pained expression. \"No, no... please, don't shout so loudly, my head is smarting.\"Eliza covered her face with her right hand and started to massage her temple with her left hand. The Colonel wagged his finger on Eliza. \"Amateurish swimmers shouldn't be in the water all alone. It's very risky even for advanced swimmers. Cramp and sunstroke can find anybody.\" \"Can you stand up?\"asked Higgins stonily. Eliza nodded and stood up slowly and carefully with the help of the two bachelors. \"Are you all right? Are you giddy?\"asked the professor. She shook her head. \"Are you sure?\" \"I'm perfectly okay.\" \"Right, right.\" Professor Higgins took a deep breath and began bawling at the top of his voice: \"YOU IDIOT! YOU INFAMOUS CREATURE! YOU MISERABLE GUTTERSNIPE! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH YOU'VE PUT THE WIND UP US?! IF I COULDN'T SWIM SO FAST, YOU WOULD HAVE DIED! HOW TYPICAL! A 21-YEAR-OLD KID THINKS THAT SHE IS THE BEGGINING AND THE END! CAN'T YOU BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT GETTING INTO HOT WATER?!\" Eliza couldn't help, but sneered at this pun. \"Higgins, behave yourself. Everybody is gazing at us...\"Pickering tried to calm him down. Higgins's face was so dark now he seemed in a pure rage. \"Who the devil cares?' She has nearly died, just because she's an idiotic, irresponsible insect. After her embarrassment my manners won't do neither good nor harm... By George, Eliza, don't you dare to snivel now. You have caused this problem, you've no right be act like the \"witness\".\"he added indignantly, when he discovered the tears in her eyes. \"Did you... did you save my life?\" \"He swam to you as fast as he could, swam back to the beach with you, enfolded you in his arms, and laid down you here.\"said Pickering with respect in his voice. Higgins was ill at ease. \"Stop, Pickering. Yes, I've saved your blasted life. I've been spending my precious free time and energy on you for 4 months. I couldn't let my efforts be wasted by such a...\"He was interrupted by Eliza who jumped into his arms and kissed him on his face, but pulled back and blushed, when she saw his uncomprehending and shocking expression. \"Well... thank you very much.\" Higgins rolled his eyes. 'Come on, Eliza. I've done it for everybody else. By the way, it's your birthday. Let's say that it was you birthday present.' He said the last sentence with a little smirk. \"Your life is you biggest treasure\"She smiled back at him. The trio bursted out laughing. It was Eliza's 21st birthday. As a present – and as a rest – Colonel Pickering rented a car, travelled to Brighton together and visited the beach. Concerning his heart, Pickering would have rented two suits for themselves – one for Eliza and one for the bachelors, of course – even for a week, but the younger man agreed only in one weekend, due to the Embassy Ball. Moreover, Pickering surprised his young friend with all books of Jane Austen – Higgins snorted sarcastically every time they mentioned the authoress. They had a really good time until the second day. It was the day, when Eliza got a cramp in the water. Taking advantage of their last day-off, the trio had a delicious lunch at the restaurant of the hotel. After lunch, Pickering decided to take a nap – due to his age he didn't bear excitements. However neither Eliza nor the professor was tired, so they went for a walk together. They were strolling on the beach arm in arm. They enjoyed the silence, the fresh sea... each other's company. Higgins suddenly stopped and turned to his formal pupil. \"You know Eliza, you've really put the wind up us. For a moment, we were sure that you...\" Eliza looked down shamefacedly. \"I know, and I'm sorry.\" Higgins grasped her arm reassuringly. \"Never mind. Praise be to god, nothing wrong has happened, and we all have gone off it. But don't forget: in spite of you're an adult, you can't do everything you want.\" Eliza didn't say a word, so he continued. \"Honestly speaking, I feel myself inconveniently, since I haven't bought you anything for your birthday. You've been living in my house for months. I ought to give you something trifle.\" He dipped into his purse and brought out a small ring. It was simple and modest, but lovely. Obviously, it wasn't a wedding ring. Tears sprang to her eyes, although Higgins hated emotional and sentimental situations. \"So? Do you like it? Listen, if you don't, you can give me back. It wasn't very cheap.\" \"That's beautiful. Thank you very much. I've never thought that I would receive something from you too\"She looked at the professor with a happy and grateful smile. Zap! Ebenezer Scrooge, Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, and Fred fell to the ground. The noise roused Henry. He shuddered and opened his eyes. He looked at his watch: It was half past two. Dickens's book lay on the floor and his eyes were red: he had been weeping in his dream. Damn it, he had fallen asleep again! The problem was not that he had fallen asleep, but his ridiculous dream... about her. In his dreams, he had seen her many times in bathing-costume, her hair unbound since she had moved to his mother's home - that happened two weeks ago. Those times he could see her bare arms and her knees. Curiously, every time he dreamt about her, her bathing-costume became shorter and shorter... sometimes she didn't even wear anything, although he was the only one who could see that. In his dream, he cried to Eliza, Pickering, everybody who was in his mind: \" Look away. She has lost her bathing-costume.\" However the others looked at him uncomprehendingly. \" What are you talking about? She is wearing a bathing-costume\". Sometimes he realised that it wasn't the reality and was on the point of waking up. He always was flushed and troubled when he woke up. Sometimes he didn't consider them nightmares. Sometimes he found it quite pleasure to look at the half-naked girl. It was astonishing how his mind was able to complement the reality. However this dream was different: obviously a nightmare. Eliza's hair was still unbound and her bathing-costume didn't cover appropriately her neat, slim figure. She didn't smile now. She was choking in the middle of the sea, asking for help. Henry ran to the water to save her. Suddenly Eliza vanished like a mirage. In the next second he found himself on the beach again. Eliza stood in the sand, blithely, gleefully... with Freddy. \"Why did yew wan' ter save me, 'Enry 'Iggins? There was no need fer that... Freddy just clapped an' I was in safe. Show 'im, luv.\" Freddy clapped and another Eliza appeared: a naked Eliza. The boy repeated it and Eliza reappeared in her ball gown. Next time Henry could see her as a flower girl, then that Eliza who he saw that day. \"Stop it, you poor devil\" Henry shouted. Eliza and Freddy laughed. Henry touched the naked Eliza, but her skin was cold and clammy... like marble, like a statue. A beautiful, but breathless statue. Henry rushed to the flower girl to shake her... but he couldn't move her. It was heavy, hard... and marble. Freddy guffawed. \"You old goat! I'll show you how you should do it.\"He wrapped her arms around the flower girl and kissed her hair. She immediately came to life. Hope you like it :) Sorry for grammar mistakes.[Chapter 3] Just Another Glass Of Wine What did happen with the characters in the last 3 months? For example, Higgins pickled his nose in September. Freddy and Eliza had announced their wedding at that week, in August. Now they had been a fiancé and a fiancée for three months. Concerning Freddy's heart, they would had already married, however he had to accept that they couldn't finance their common future until they didn't gather enough money. The job opportunity arrived very soon: Colonel Pickering visited Eliza who lived at Mrs Higgins's home and told her that he had found the perfect building for Eliza's flower shop and bought it as a wedding gift. The colonel had always had rich or at least better-off friends who had always received some kind of valuable paint, statue, or jewellery from him for their wedding. However he was aware of the fact that for a poor engaged couple a flower shop would be much more useful where they can earn their bread, than a beautiful work of art which didn't bring money. Freddy helped his fiancée at the shop, so she didn't have to hire an assistant, but Pickering insisted on hiring an accountant. Since Eliza couldn't afford a bookkeeper at first, the colonel decided to pay his salary in the first month. Eliza fortunately learned how to keep her shop. The first month was awful and terrible, but as soon as her clientele had formed – most of them were men who were extremely polite and courteous with the lovely Miss Doolittle –, Eliza started to prosper soon. Mrs Eynsford Hill who was the head of a respectable, but poor family, had initially been very keen on the idea of being related to Alfred P. Doolittle. Mr Doolittle, though formerly a dustman, and now fantastically disclassed, had become extremely popular in the upper class and the middle class. As Higgins said, penniless people who came of a good family preferred marrying upstarts. Alfred P. Doolittle had become one of the most beloved citizens of London. Due the expectation of upper class, he married his \"missus\" and after their wedding they avoided places which would destroy their reputation. If they wanted to have a spree with his wife, they visited pubs where nobody would recognize her. He always prepared for his lectures and made a lot of friends. However he had to support all of his relatives on four thousand a year which he found almost as hard to do as Mrs Eynsford Hill to live in Earlscourt on a pitiably small income. At their first common dinner, Mrs. Eynsford Hill indulgently smiled at his terrible pronunciation and improper notions – after all, blood is thicker than water. Doolittle remained the same ill-bred, vulgar \"blackguard\", in spite of his finest clothes, deluxe house, and new friends. However his free-spoken, direct personality could enthral the wealthy, prissy, and bored upper class. Mrs Eynsford Hill raised her head at first when Mr Doolittle said that he absolutely refused to add the last straw to his burden by contributing to Eliza's support. She had to have a very unpleasant conversation with her son next day. She made a stand for never letting him marry a girl whose father was simply a lucky good-for-nothing. Poor Freddy who had got used to avoid every kind of latent conflicts by obeying the other one - in spite of his own opinion -, had to face an enormous dilemma. He was as fond of his mother, as Higgins was fond of his, but now he felt that his love towards Eliza was so strong that it was worth quarrel… or even being disinherited. The boy spent days with finding his mother's weakness, and receiving her blessing. He was incapable of emotional blackmail. Freddy loved her mother too much for this. Freddy wasn't as silly, as he seemed to be, but her mother's pessimistic mentality and tyranny had supplied him during the years and he didn't have the opportunity to study or develop his talents. Finally, the solution was his own sister, Clara. Poor Clara, who appeared to Higgins and his mother as a disagreeable and ridiculous person, and to her own mother as in some inexplicable way a social failure, was growing desperate. She was stubborn and had been looking for her Prince Charming for one year. She wanted a handsome, nice, wealthy man who would be immediately infatuated with her, in spite of her defects. Her one asset, the fact that her mother was what the Epsom greengrocer called a carriage lady had no exchange value, apparently. It had prevented her from getting educated, because the only education she could have afforded was education with the Earlscourt green grocer's daughter. It had led her to seek the society of her mother's class; and that class simply would not have her, because she was much poorer than the greengrocer, and, far from being able to afford a maid, could not afford even a housemaid, and had to scrape along at home with an illiberally treated general servant. Under such circumstances nothing could give her an air of being a genuine product of Largelady Park. And yet its tradition made her regard a marriage with anyone within her reach as an unbearable humiliation. Commercial people and professional people in a small way were odious to her. She ran after painters and novelists; but she did not charm them; and her bold attempts to pick up and practise artistic and literary talk irritated them. She was, in short, an utter failure, an ignorant, incompetent, pretentious, unwelcome, penniless, useless little snob; and though she did not admit these disqualifications (for nobody ever faces unpleasant truths of this kind until the possibility of a way out dawns on them) she felt their effects too keenly to be satisfied with her position. So Freddy went to Mr Doolittle's home who welcomed him disagreeably, being sure that his future son-in-law wanted only money. Freddy explained him that his mother didn't intend to accept their marriage since Eliza didn't have money. He said he had been thinking about the solution for days. Moreover he told him, he hadn't dared to ponce or assert dowry – Freddy added quickly – but he would had appreciated, if he, Eliza, and Clara had allowed to go to his lectures, his dinner parties, his parties, hoping that one of the sophisticated gentlemen would draw to Clara sooner or later. Moreover, he would be very grateful, if Mr Doolittle commended her and made compliments about her at his parties. Mr Doolittle – being afraid of never getting shot of his daughter – acceded it willingly. Since Eliza left 27A Wimpole Street, Higgins's behaviour had changed completely. He had become friendlier, more open-minded, more direct – especially towards ladies. It didn't matter where he was – at home days, horseraces, dinner parties – he always found a pretty girl whom he could flirt with. Sometimes he went for a walk with them, took them home, and kissed their hands. Mrs Higgins just shook her head, bit her lip, not letting herself say something bluntness. Pickering mulled whether he should warn his friend and tell him how improperly he was behaving. Eliza just smiled sadly and bitterly when she saw Henry with another woman. She didn't feel jealousy, since it was obvious not only for her, but for Mrs Higgins and Pickering too that Higgins was only trying to make Eliza jealous. Despite his manners and nature, Higgins could be very kind and charming too, if he wanted… especially when he wanted manipulate somebody. The accustomed grumpy, old loner had vanished and a bit cynical, but basically jovial and charming middle-aged bachelor had appeared who enjoyed the company of different women. The most embarrassing affair happened at a garden party in September. Eliza attended that event with Freddy, Mrs Eynsford-Hill – Clara stayed at home, due to an illness, but Eliza was sure that she was crying because she thought she would lead apes in hell -, Professor Higgins, Mrs Higgins, her father with her stepmother, and Colonel Pickering. The other guests were totally strangers to her, with the exception of Lord and Lady Boxington whom she had already met at Ascott. Later she and Freddy bumped into the professor's brother, Father Herman Higgins. \" Eliza, Freddy, I'm so pleased to meet you\" He shook their hands shyly with a nervous, bewildered smile. \" Good afternoon, Father. How are you today?\" The clergyman was wringing his hand. He didn't get used to talk to women as a private person. \" I'm fine, Eliza. And… and… you?\" In spite of his age, cassock, and pepper-and-salt hair, Eliza would had considered him attractive, if his attitude hadn't been humpbacked and he hadn't been so chicken-hearted and sheepish. She had already attended his masses and he was a very talented speech-maker. She couldn't understand how he could be so doltish in real life. She started to conjecture the answer when Professor Higgins joined him with a glass of wine. \" Herman!\" Professor Higgins patted his brother's shoulders. He had obviously drunk some alcohol, but he hadn't been in liquor yet. He nodded to the young couple with an affronted and disdainful face. His heart's content, Henry would had jilted Eliza and Freddy, but he had always enjoyed making a sport of Herman, so he decided to forbear with them.\" That old monkish has been giving me a miss, I know exactly. How are you, you poor devil? Haven't you found fragile cats?\" Higgins chuckled and hiccupped at the same time. \" Hee… Henry… don't you think that you have drunk a bit too much alcohol?\" stammered Father Herman and took his brother's hand off his own shoulders. Henry snorted arrogantly \" Me?! Don't be ridiculous. I haven't felt myself so great during my lifetime… Did you know that this chap was a great prankster? He has been behaving like a saint since his childhood. He used to take errant and injured animals home to cure them. How sweet! And his favourite book was Bible. Other children used to gibe at him. \" Really?\" asked Eliza with a polite and strained smile. \" It's awfully funny\" said Freddy. \" I think you should go home. Mother won't be pleased…\" muttered Father Herman while he was staring at his shoes. \" I don't give it damn! I don't care what mother would think!\" shouted Henry.\" By the way, she isn't here now…\" \" Father Herman…\" Freddy wanted to deflect the subject and wanted to ask a serious question\" As you know, Eliza and I wish to marry as soon as possible…\" \" You mean, as soon as you can gain enough money, Mr Hill\" laughed Higgins and took a gulp.\" Please tell me, how much money have you already saved?\" Freddy bowed his head and Eliza's face turned red. \" I beg your pardon, Henry\" Herman was shocked. Freddy cleaned his throat. \" So… I want to… I wish to tell you…\" \" By George, Mr Hill! If you want to marry Galathea, the perfect woman, you will have to possess enough courage to say it aloud what's in your mind\" Henry put the glass to his lips joyfully. Eliza was so nervous that she bit her lip and grasped Freddy's arm. Unfortunately, he misunderstood this gesture and reckoned it as encouragement. \" Father Herman, we would highly appreciate, if you conducted our wedding…\" Henry was so surprised that he spewed his drink. The wine splashed on the clothes of the others. \" What?!\" stormed Henry then turned to his brother\" DON'T YOU DARE TO SAY HIM \"YES\", YOU IDIOT!\" Henry achieved that now everybody was looking at them. \" Oh, Freddy, you shouldn't have done this\" said Eliza to herself. \" What is going on?\" Mrs Higgins flew to them, followed by Colonel Pickering and Freddy's mother.\" Henry, what have you done?\" Her eyes widened as she noticed the wine stain on their clothes. \" Henry! What do you think about yourself? How… how many glasses of alcohol have you drunk? You know exactly that wine upsets you.\" Due to his mother's words, Henry flew into himself. \" I know.\" he grumbled. \" My dear, when will you grow up?\" Mrs Higgins shook her head and turned to the others with a radiant smile\" You don't need to worry, my friends. It was just a little accident. You know my Henry… he has never could behave himself.\" She turned to the colonel\" Colonel Pickering, could you call a taxi for my sons and Eliza, please? And could you tell the taxi driver to take them to 12B Livingstone Street? \" I think, I should accompany them\" said Pickering\" Eliza, Henry, and Father Herman… in my opinion, they shouldn't be left together.\" Mrs Higgins nodded coincidently. \" Could you call a taxi for my son too?\" added Mrs Eynsford Hill and turned to her son.\" You shall go home too.\" \" But mother… I… I would like to go with Eliza\" His eyes were hopefully, but his mother was rigid. \" Not on your life!\" Her voice was assertive.\" You shall go home and change your clothes. Pretty piece of business! Destroying your clothes… do you have any idea how much it cost?! \" Of course, mother. I paid for it…\" muttered Freddy. \" Don't you talk back to me\" She was close to shout\" Please, Colonel Pickering, call TWO taxes. The old gentleman quitted as quickly as possible and Freddy's eyes fell shamefacedly. Higgins was lying on his mother's sofa with an ice-bag on his head. If the headache wouldn't had been enough, when he entered his mother's house, he strained his back and stubbed his toe on the doorstep. Eliza was in her room and Herman went bathing – according to Henry, his neat-freak was his most annoying attribute. \"Well done, Higgins\" Hugh Pickering was sitting in an armchair in the near of Higgins.\" That garden party went totally wrong. Higgins – in order to hide his uneasy conscience – tasted his tongue. \"By George, Hugh. I wasn't drunk so much.\" \"You were ALMOST drunk\" Pickering frowned and sighed deeply. \"Look, I don't intend to meddle in your conflict with Miss Doolittle. I don't wish to know what is between you and her. Believe it or not, I have also been young and in love once.\" Higgins suddenly lifted his head, but Pickering paid no regard to it. \"I don't know and don't want to know what has happened – or hasn't happened – between you, and that is not for me to judge… unless you ask me to give you a piece advice, but I doubt it.\" Hugh stood up and looked at his watch. \"I think, I'll go back to the garden party and tell your mother that the things are fine. But Higgins… may I leave you alone with Eliza and your brother?\" Higgins nodded peevishly. \"Don't forget.\" Pickering wagged his finger at Higgins.\" Eliza and her fiancé are going to marry as soon as they gained enough money.\" \"I know, Pick.\" mumbled Henry, not looking at his friend. Pickering sighed again, but his pitying look vanished when he saw the pretty, elegant Eliza coming to the drawing-room. She was so beautiful, so gorgeous that both Higgins and Pickering forgot their bitterness. Pickering ran to Eliza and kissed her cheek. Higgins wanted to stand up to, but his backache was too strong. \"Are you leaving, Colonel?\" asked Eliza softly. \"Yes, Miss Doolittle. I need to tell Mrs Higgins that everything is alright. I hope you don't mind that I leave you alone with the professor and the clergyman.\" Eliza opened her mouth and blinked edgily. \"No. Of course not.\" It was obvious, she was lying. Colonel Pickering compassionately gasped her arm, said goodbye to his friends and went to the front door. When she was left alone with her former teacher, Eliza was terribly ill at ease and wanted nothing more, than going back to the guest-room. However she was incapable of leaving the professor alone… after all, business before pleasure. She sat down to the armchair where Pickering had been sitting earlier. \"Why did you do that, Professor?\" \"What do you mean, Eliza?\" \"Freddy didn't do anything, but asked your brother to do an innocent favour. Anyway, you're very tyrannical with him. He is a very decent man. I can't understand why you don't like him. \"Herman?\" laughed Higgins\" Herman is a yellow-belly who is unable to say a word to a woman. In heaven's name, he is going on forty-eight and he is as doltish as a little boy. \"Professor Higgins, if you were less rude to him, his self-confidence would rise. You ought to be kinder to him, Professor Higgins.\" \"Professor Higgins, Professor Higgns… why the hell do you keep calling me this way?\" yelled Higgins and tried to sit up, not caring about his back-ache \"By George Eliza, my friends call me Higgins or Henry. And we are friends, aren't we?\" His face radiated pained expression, due to the shooting pains. \"Be careful, Professor! Lie back, please.\" Eliza's voice was solicitous. \"I want to hear my first name from your mouth\" He was unbearably stubborn. \"It's very childish…\" \"By George, it's not so difficult. You are doing well with \"H\". Say it aloud. H, E, N, R, Y.\" articulated Higgins. \"But…\" \"Come on…\" \"That's…\" \"SAY IT!\" Higgins shouted at the top of his voice. He made a sudden movement, but it made his back-ache much stronger. \"Be careful and lie back, Henry…\" Eliza stood up, went to the sofa, held his back with her right hand, and grasped his shoulder with her left hand, so Henry was able to lean back. Eliza soon felt his closeness awkward. She took a step back, but Henry grabbed her wrist. \"Stay here, please\" Eliza snatched her wrist from Henry's hand and decided to sit back. However she was so abashed that she lumped down to the floor instead of sitting down in the chair. \"Are you alright?\" asked Henry, while he was trying to hide his grin. \"I'm fine, thank you.\" Father Herman ran to the drawing-room abruptly. He was wearing clean, but old-fashioned clothes. He used to wear them before his anointing. \"What was that, Henry? It was so loud that I could hear it in my bedroom.\" \"Eliza fell. That's all.\" answered Henry curtly and grudgingly. Feeling the awkward silence, the clergyman started to wring his hand. \"Oh, I see.\" \"I think I'll go. I have to go to my flower shop.\" said Eliza and was about to leave the room. \"Why the devil are you leaving? It's Saturday.\" asked Henry uncomprehendingly. \"Saturday is the best day for working, Henry.\" She shook Herman's hand, nodded to Henry and quitted. \"What happened to you, Henry?\" asked Herman. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"Since when has she called you Henry?\" \"I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, UNDERSTOOD?!\" He yelled at his brother. Herman shrugged his shoulders gauchely. \"Well… you know.\"[Chapter 4] Clergyman From The Machine \" Deus ex machina from Latin deus, meaning \"a god\", ex, meaning \"from\", and machina, meaning \"a device, a scaffolding, an artifice\", is a calque, \"god from the machine\".The term has evolved into a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object. Depending on how it is done, it can be intended to move the story forward when the writer has \"painted himself into a corner\" and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a happy ending, or as a comedic device.\" Herman realizes that his younger brother is in love with Eliza and does his best to help him. Due to the expectations of upper class, Mrs Higgins, Henry, Eliza, Alfred and Mabel Doolittle, and Colonel Pickering went to Father Herman's church almost every Sunday. That time Mrs Higgins was extremely proud of her elder son who did his job not only dutifully, but wholeheartedly. It was more for him, than a simply job. It was his profession. He was the most talented speech-maker. People asked him for advice with pleasure and trusted him very much. Although he didn't always give them useful pieces of advice, he did his best to help desperate people. He wasn't rancorous at all, there wasn't any detestation in his heart towards anybody. He did even tolerated people who belonged to other religions. He was incorruptible, a \"straight arrow\" who lived his life as a true believer, a true clergyman. His morality was exemplary. It's a pity that he was incapable of communication in real life. He was mostly anxious, poor-spirited, boring. Despite theology and bestowal, he wasn't interested in topics of the world. He could speak about those two subjects night and day and didn't let the others open their mouth. But you couldn't have a conversation with him about daily things, politics and art. He had a very close relationship with his mother, but there wasn't any woman in the world, whom he could be really fond of – not absolutely in a romantic way. Although he was really helpful towards women, he had no wish for their company. It wounded Ellen very much that her sons had never got on well. They were so similar to each other. Both of them kept themselves to themselves, were lonely, workaholic, and middle-aged. Herman was obsessed with religion such as Henry with phonetics. Both of them loved their mother – Mrs Higgins could declare it without conceit. Both of them trusted few people and didn't have many friends. The only difference was in their nature. Herman was shy, unselfish, empathetic, and opportunist. Henry was (more) childish, selfish, and self-assertive. However this difference was fatal. Herman had always tried to be his brother's counsellor, his friend, but he had been rejected. It broke Ellen's heart, but she knew she couldn't solve that conflict between them. Sometimes she asked Henry to be friendlier with Herman, but it fell on deaf ears. The old lady sighed with resignation and glanced at Henry. He was listening to Herman carefully. His face was annoyed, his lips pressed together, his fists clenched. Henry couldn't behave himself in church. He made remarks out loud all the time on the pronunciation of the clergymen. Herman was the only clergyman who took delight in his presence, despite the fact that he always made the atmosphere uptight. Herman now felt Henry's eyes on him, but didn't know the reason. He was mulling over it during the mass. \" I haven't mispronounced anything. Why is he watching me as alertly as a cat watches a mouse hole? By the way, he always draws attention to my mistakes. Why is he so quiet now?\" During the mass he took every opportunity to look at Eliza's face. She was sitting between her fiancé and Mrs Eynsford Hill who was next to Clara. Henry and their mother were sitting in front of them. Eliza used to have a lovely, pretty face, but nowadays she looked tired and drawn-out. Nobody paid attention to her sadness. Mr and Mrs Doolittle were about not to fall asleep, the Eynsford Hill family was fascinated by him, and his mother was listening with half an ear, because she kept a keep a close eye on Henry who was fidgety. Herman had never had the courage to invite Eliza to his parsonage where they could speak undisturbedly and confidentially. He wanted to know what made her feel miserable. But today he decided to talk to her and asked her what her problem was after the mass. After the mass he shook hands with all of the believers. He heard several of \"Congratulations, Father Herman.\", \" It was a beautiful speech, Father.\", and \"Have a nice day, Father Herman.\". Finally Eliza came to him too. \"Eliza, please stay here. I would like to talk to you.\" he whispered to her. Eliza nodded, went to Freddy, and whispered something to his ear. The young boy looked at the clergyman, nodded, kissed Eliza on her forehead, and headed out with his family. Then Eliza turned to Mrs Higgins. \"Your son wishes to speak with me, madam. If you would excuse me…\" \"What the hell does he want from you?\" barked Henry. \"It's not your business, Henry\" Her glanced at Henry stonily and turned to Eliza with a smile. \"Of course, my dear. I'll go for walk with Henry and Colonel Pickering. The weather is very nice today. Henry screwed his face into wrinkles and shrugged. \"In my opinion, it means \"yes\". So Henry, Mrs Higgins and Pickering went for a walk. Henry couldn't help, but turned around. He needed to know what they were talking about. He wanted to hear that infamous creature's problem too, and do his best to help her. She must had had a conflict with her fiancé… ridiculous. The green-eyed monster was born in his mind. He turned around and saw them cuddling. Well, cuddling was an exaggeration, his brother just put his arm around his formal pupil's shoulder. However Henry didn't like the idea of his brother touching his Eliza. Pickering felt, he had to put his friend in his place when he put Henry's glance. \"By Jove, give that poor girl a break, Higgins. I know that you are curious, but they must have a good reason for a conversation.\" \"You took the words right out of my mouth, Colonel.\" Mrs Higgins smiled. Eliza went to the church with Father Herman whose hand was lying on her shoulder. They sat down next to each other and he took her hands gently. \"You seem to be tired nowadays, Eliza. What happened to you?\" Father Herman's voice was sympathetic. Eliza couldn't help, but started to weep. She was crying grievously and desperately. Herman was ill at ease at first. He was afraid of mishandling that situation. However he gave her a hug and started to stroke her back. Finally, Eliza composed herself, wiped the tears from her eyes and blew her nose, and started to speak. \"Father, my problem is a trifle, but I feel myself unable to solve it. I used to have much more problems a year ago. I used to have to sell flowers in winter, sometimes I had nothing to eat, and I could hardly pay my rent. Now I have nice clothes, live in a beautiful house, can eat as much as I wish, and have several friend… but I have been feeling a huge weight lift on my shoulders for months. I don't know how to meet the requirements of middle-class and upper-class.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Our wedding, for instance. We have been trying to save money for two months, but we don't succeed. And why? We have to have new clothes made every week, to be able to attend my father's lectures and parties. What a squandering! I have never been a spender, and I work as hardly as I can. \"Does Freddy never help you?\" Eliza smiled lovingly. \"Freddy is a lovely thing, but he is untalented in arithmetic and business. His presence does more harm than good. Moreover you brother keeps saying that the notion of Freddy succeeding at anything was a joke. He makes light of him all the time. \" By mentioning Henry, Eliza's face radiated sadness again. \"Well, Henry has always been a hard nut to crack.\" He murmured .\" But he is very fond of you and is solicitous about your faith. I'm sure that you could count on your friends and relatives –including me -, if you were less… well, less proud.\" Eliza glanced at the ring she had received from Higgins, then at her engagement ring. Henry's ring was simple and modest, but valuable and expensive. Freddy's ring was showy and tastelessly big, but one of the cheapest engagement rings. \"Father doesn't want to help me, but he is afraid of losing his friends and popularity. If we won't have a wedding soon, people will shock at us. Furthermore we are expected to invite his friends to our wedding. And we can't afford ourselves to organize such a big ceremony. I feel sorry my father more or less. He has been delivered into the hands of middle class morality. If he loses his friends, he won't be able to keep his popularity. If he loses his popularity, he won't lecture anymore. If he won't lecture anymore, he won't receive his heritage and will be rejected by both middle class and upper class. Since he doesn't have savings or a job, he will have to go to the workhouse. As for Colonel Pickering, I wouldn't dare to ask for his help once more. He paid for my clothes, my flat, and my flower shop. Mrs Higgins let me live in her house and offered me an unconditional friendship. The Anglican church has bigger problems than listening to my wailing. I know that you are ready to help anybody, but I can't accept it. As for Henry… Her eyes were red again, and her voice shook a little. \"I doubt that he would go out for my marriage.\" \"Why? He likes you very much.\" Eliza bit her lip and laughed bitterly. \"Okay. Let's say, he likes me, but he hates and despises Freddy. I wish he didn't like me so much. Father Herman knitted his brows. \"Why do you say that?\" Eliza shook her hand and stroked his arm. \"Forget what I told you. It doesn't matter.\" Eliza stood up and put on her hat. \"There is no need to worry about me, Father. I can get along alone too. I'm only a common girl who has to do such things I can't afford nor understand. I'm going to look for an evening-school to develop my lexical knowledge. I hope we'll be able to spare. Eliza laughed sweetly and joyfully. \"Thank you for that conversation. It helped me a lot.\" \"You're welcome, Eliza. And don't forget that you can always count on God.\" They left the church with relief. Mrs Higgins, Henry, and Colonel Pickering were waiting for them. \"Are you alright, my dear?\" asked Mrs Higgins kindly. \"What took so long?\" asked Henry indignantly. Mrs Higgins spoke up. \"Henry! Couldn't you be kinder?\" Eliza let his question pass over her head, but answered to his mother. \"I'm fine. Thank you, Mrs Higgins. Goodbye Father Herman.\" \"Goodbye Eliza.\" Herman caresses her shoulders. \"Have a nice day.\" \"Shall we go, Miss Doolittle?\" asked Colonel Pickering. \"Wait a minute, Herman.\" said Henry to Herman. Herman felt that something wrong would happen but turned to Henry. \"Yes?\" \"I would like to talk to you about… that thing.\" Henry gave his head a scratch. Herman frowned and didn't understand a word. \"About what?\" \"About that important and interesting thing you've told me once.\" Henry stepped to Herman and nudged him in the ribs and Herman face radiated epiphany. \"I see. The thing we've discussed once.\" \"We should go to your study then. Could you wait for a minute, mother?\" Henry turned to his mother then they went inside. In the study, Henry sat down into Herman's chair and his feet propped up on Herman's desk. \"Henry, that's my… never mind.\" \"So, Herman…\"Henry's voice was sinister and threatening\" What were you talking about?\" Herman sighed and started to wring his hand. \"Eliza won't be pleased…\" \"Who cares about her opinion?!\"barked Henry.\" If she has hardship, she can discuss it with me. I know her more than anyone.\" \"It was a private conversation.\" Herman's voice was soft, but manly. \" It was a private conversation.\" jibed Henry, parodying Herman's pronunciation and rose hastily.\" You have been staring at her during the mass. You were really conspicuous, you were. How you dared to put your bloody arm around her shoulder?!\" \"That's the reason why he was so angry.\" thought Herman and bit his lip.\" Look Henry, I am not in love with Eliza. What a scandal! \" The clergyman and the young fiancée.\" \"Have you no morals? You're a clergyman, in heaven's name. I know, Eliza is beautiful, intelligent, nice… but she is going to marry. She is going to marry Freddy!\" Herman suddenly understood everything. It was like a thunderstruck for him, but it amused him as well. He had never thought that Henry would have a weakness in spite of their mother and phonetics. He shook his head with a big grin on his face. \"You have fallen in love with Eliza!\" Herman couldn't decide between laughing and indignation. His brother's heart had been stolen by a much younger flower girl who was going to marry another man.\" I can't believe it! Henry Higgins, the famous professor of phonetics, is in love! The man, who despised love and marriage, is now broken-hearted. Henry looked at him with his brown, sad eyes, and Herman immediately began to feel ashamed and patted his shoulders. \"Since when have you been in love?\" \"I have no idea. I only realized it when Freddy proposed to her.\" \"Does she love you too?\" Henry frowned and looked down. Suddenly they thought the same. Although Herman was the older one, Henry had always behaved as if he was the older one. He was the dominant, the loudmouth. It was the first time when Henry didn't seem a tyrannical bully, but a sensible, frightened little boy. \"She said that she did.\" \"Why is not she your fiancée?\" Henry gave his head a scratch. \"I don't know. Nobody tells me anything. Pickering doesn't intend to meddle in it, mother always keeps an eye on me when I try to speak with Eliza and Mrs Pearce keeps shaking her head. What did you think? Why am I flirting with those women nowadays? I want to forget Eliza… and hope that it will attract her attention.\" \"Do you want to make her jealous?\" asked Herman disdainfully. \"Well…yes, that's what I want.\" sighed Henry. \"Come on Henry. It is very childish. You are forty-five years old, you should be much more reasonable.\" \"What am I to do, Herman?\" Henry was desperate and at a loss. \"I can't get along with women, but you shouldn't try to make her jealous. It's nefarious and disgusting. Try to speak with her about it… in a polite way. Ask her why she had chosen Freddy. If she changes her mind, you'll be the luckiest man in the world, but if she doesn't… I think, you will have to do without her.\" Henry had never felt respect towards his brother… until now. \"I hope you are right.\" ","Summary":" How To Blow The Man You Love A Raspberry? \" Where the devil are my slippers?\" That sentence stuck"},{"Movie":"Gangs of New York","Title":"Amongst the Gangs","Author":"Sharpsnout","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1439154","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I own Wallace and other stuff that you didn'trnsee in the movie; the characters and the accounts that are from the moviernbelong to the movie people for Gangs of New York.

Mean while as he's going on 'bout all this, I'm thinking let them try andrnput me any place once this bot hits land I'm not staying around, I'll be longrngone by the time they relies I'm gone. Just as he was saying this an Irishrnwoman father had been talking too near the entire trip, stepped up and saidrnthat I wasn't an orfen, I belonged to her. The Captin was as shocked as I. Butrnhe didn't say a word after that. I was greatful to the woman. Becuse I'verndecided that once we reach New York, no matter how long it takes I am going tornsave up enough money and buy meself a tiket home. I heard that these placesrnthey take orfens too don't let them out until they are 18, and that's if theyvernbehaved. If I got meself stuck in one of those I wouldn't be getting home tillrnI'm at lest 30. I really don't know how I'm going to earn money, I've heard thernCaptin talking saying that the Irish will work for less wages then anyone else,rnso all the Irish are taking up all the damn jobs. But that doesnt matter to me,rnI have a skill that the Irish cant get paid fer, no matter how low of pay theyrnwill work fer. Me skill cant be cheated out of long hours fer less money. I'llrnget me tiket and I'll get home, back to Scotland, where me grandparents arernwhere me mum is buried.\" ********************* Wallace closed the journal andrnlooked around. All around him his fellow immigrants went about their business.rnDeath had become a daily occurrence on their ship; so one more quick funeralrnwas nothing new. Though they had offered sympathies, they had just done it outrnof respect for the dead. And Wallace knew that. He didn't even get up off hisrnhammock to get his share of the bread and cold soup being passed out to thernpassengers. He didn't feel like eating, how could he, his father had just diedrnleaving him alone on a boat surrounded by Irish. None of them where speakingrnEnglish, they where all talking in Irish, and Wallace could only make out a fewrnwords. Such as \"Jobs\" and \"wages.\" One Irish woman was complaining about therndampness and that it was giving her babies chills. His father had taught him arnlittle Gaelic on their way too Liverpool. But it was only a little bit, it wasrnenough too ask for the way too the dock and too tell someone to get out of thernway. \"Not eating aint going to bring himrnback boyo.\" An Irish man in his late 30s said to Wallace. As he returned fromrnthe stairs leading up on deck where the crew was handing out food. He wasrnlooking at Wallace sympathetically. \"Leave mernbe!\" Wallace said loudly. \"Look boyo,rnyou're just going to have to get on with your life.\" \"Jus' leavernme be.\" \"Ya have arntemper, that's good, means you're strong willed. Don't see much of that.\" Thernman held up half of his bread. \"Look boyo, I'm offering you part of my food.\" \"I don'trnwant yer sympathies.\"xa0 The man nodded \"Fine I'llrnjust leave it here, I'd eat it quick though. Might not know how long it willrnstay there.\" Wallace watched as the man left, he then looked down at the breadrnand quickly ate a little bit. He took what he hadn't eaten and wrapped it inrnsome paper from his journal and put it in his bag. Suddenly a bell rang up onrndeck and the first mate poked his head down into the belly of the ship he had arncloth covering his face and Wallace knew why, the smell down there was horriblernand he was positive he had seen some rats that could be compared with smallrndogs. He had red marks from the fleas that littered the hammocks and Wallacernhadn't slept longer then an hour at a time for fear of either getting bitten byrnone of the grotesquely large rats or having his belongings swiped. \"We'll bernreaching New York tonight, we'll dock in the morning.\" Was all he said beforernretreating back up too the deck. There was cheering all around and Wallacernsighed, he'd have to be all set to get off as soon as they hit dock. He pickedrnup his fathers bag and quickly sorted through it. He pulled out things that hernwanted too keep, like his fathers timepiece, the money they had left afterrnpurchasing the tickets, his fathers knife, and his mothers locket. Wallace tookrnit and clipped it behind his neck. Everything else Wallace put in his own bagrnand tied it closed. All of his fathers other belongings Wallace put back in thernbag and tied it closed. The other stuff he'd sell. He took his cap out fromrnunder his blanket and jammed it onto his head pulling it so it shadowed hisrneyes. Now he was ready, the minute they landed he was out of there, Wallacerndidn't know exactly where he'd go anywhere where he could still earn a living.rnBesides he'd only stay long enough too earn his money and go home. As the sunrnbegan setting, Wallace could see the outline of land, he wrapped the rope onrnhis bag around his hand and took a deep breath, he was ready. \"New Yerkrnget ready fer a taste of Scottish 'ighlands.\" **************************************** So did you like the first chapter?

I hope to hear from you and enjoy the chapter. **************************************** Wallace wasrnunprepared for the new smells that hit him when he stepped onto the deck. Herncoughed a bit trying to regain his breath. He glanced around getting his firstrnglimpse of New York. It didn'trnlook that different from Liverpool people crowding arndock all blending in together. He looked over the railing and grimaced as hernsaw caskets being unloaded from other boats. \"Oh that'srnan uplifting sight\" he muttered too himself. \"Keeprnmoving boy.\" A sailor said pushing Wallace along. On the dock Wallace joinedrnthe other immigrants streaming down the dock. A large man with a top hatrnstopped Wallace as he was moving, \"How oldrnare you son?\" \"11\"rnWallace answered \"Whenrnvoting time comes, your 18 and vote Tammany\" the man handed Wallace a loaf ofrnbread and a slip of paper with the words vote Tammany on it, patted him on thernback, and pushed him along. \"Crazy Yank;\"rnhe muttered and kept his head down as they walked down the dock. Suddenly arnhand reached out and pulled Wallace out of the line. \"'Eyrnleave me 'lone let go!\" When Wallace was able too get a look at the owner ofrnthe hand, it was a boy, a few years old then himself, dressed all in blue. \"How oldrnare you Paddy?\" Wallace shot a glare at the teen. \"I aint no Paddy!\" he said loudly taking great offence atrnbeing called an Irishmen. \"How oldrnare you?\" the teen repeated with great annoyance in his voice. \"11.\"rnWallace answered, why in 'ell are they askin me age it's not like its goinrntoo change between seconds. He thought \"You sure about that boy?\" \"I think Irnknow me own age!\"xa0 Wallace said loudly \"Everrnconsider fighting for you country?\" \"Fer Scotland?\"rnthe teen grabbed Wallace's collar and held him so their faces where inchesrnapart. \"For thernNorth stupid, you know the Union Army, fighting for Lincoln?\" \"I jus' gotrnto America, Irndon't know bout no fightin,\" Wallace said with arnsmirk. \"I don't know 'bout no North or Union Army, and I certainly don't know anythin 'bout Lincoln.rnSo 'ow can I fight fer somthin that I don't know 'bout it?\" \"Why yournlittle smart bas-\" the teen said raising his fist too punch Wallace. \"What'srngoing on here?!\" a man in the same uniform as the teen said, coming up behindrnthem. \"Nothingrnsir just questioning this Paddy, he's 14 old enough too fight sir.\" Wallacernstared at the teen in shock \"I aint no Paddy and I'm 11 not 14!\" The soldier looked atrnWallace then at the teen then back at Wallace \"That truernboy?\" Wallace nodded furiously \"Aye!\" \"Can yournprove it?\" again Wallace nodded \"Aye\" he repeatedrnand reached under his shirt and pulled out his locket, one side was arnphotograph of Wallace's family, his parents, him, and his grandparents. On thernother side was a drawing of Wallace himself, he pulled out a piece of paperrnfrom behind the drawing. On it was written Wallace's birth date. His mother hadrnalways kept adequate records of everything and had filed his birth record inrnher locket so she would always have them with her. \"See 'ere it is.\" Wallacernsaid holding the paper too the soldier, he looked at it and nodded. \"He'srneleven.\" The soldier said \"according too this at least. Let him go Williamson.\"rnThe teen let his hold on Wallace's collar and walked away. \"Well boy welcomerntoo America,\" \"Thank ye\" Wallace said dryly picking up his bag. \"And boy?\" \"Aye?\" \"If yournever consider fightin for your country boy you'd makerna fine soldier. We can always use brave young men like you, ever consider it,rnwhether it be fightin or carrying the flag, you'd dornwell son.\" Wallace nodded then when the soldier couldn't see him he rolled hisrneyes in annoyance, \"All thesernYanks are bloody tapped.\" He muttered. Some how he managed too get off the dockrnand onto the road. Wallace wasn't exactly sure where he was heading, but he didrnknow something he was going to need some money. He wasn't positive aboutrnAmerican money, but Wallace figured he'd swipe what he could out of someone's purse;rnmaybe a timepiece or two and he'd be all set. Wallace walked past a wellrndressed gentleman, his timepiece's chain hanging out for the world too see; perfect[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I own Wallace, Frank…and other people you don'trnrecognize from the movie…don't own the song New York Girls either which sucksrncause I love that song… This one was a VERY long time no update…sheesh…anywaysrnI've got review thanks to hand out!

See ya at the end Wallace followed Frank down thernstreets keeping a sharp eye for anyone who might try and bump into him. Theyrnstopped in front of a small building with a puppet hanging in front that had arnsign around its neck that read 'Satan's Circus' \"Come on,\"rnFrankie said gesturing for Wallace to follow him inside. Inside Wallace was hitrnwith all new scenery. It was smoky inside and very crowded, the stench of smokernsent Wallace coughing; the smell of alcohol was strong reminding Wallace of thernpubs back home so did the sounds, the sound of people yelling and cheering andrnlaughing…and singing! \"As Irnwalked down to Chattemrn Street a fair maid I did meet she asked me to seernher home she lived in Bleakerrn Street. Tell me way assentirnmy dear Annie\" Wallace looked towards the sound of the singing; he had heardrnthat song before or something like it. A man was singing, walking aroundrnsinging it at the top of his lungs. \"Oh you New Yerkrngirls cant ya dance the polka!\" Frankie saw the lookrnon Wallace's face \"Like thernsong Boyo?\" \"Aye\" hernanswered \"Come onrncant keep the Butcher waitin,\" as they headed into arnback room, they passed a pen where men where hanging around it with a dogrnattacking a whole load of rats. He looked at Frank curious; he had heard aboutrnrat fights but had never seen one. Didn't seem right to Wallace, to him dogsrnserved a better purpose then fighting. They should protect the home Frankrnshrugged and shook his head; \"I don't 'gree with itrnneither Boyo, t'isnt right,rnbut welcome to America Wallace, that's the way things are done here,\"xa0 they entered the back room where a group ofrnmen sat around the small table playing cards. \"Well,rnwell, well, if it aint Frankie,\" the man nearest thernfire place said. \"How ya been boy?\" \"Cantrncomplain Bill, pretty good pickin's out there, brung it ta ya.\"rnBill leaned foreword and examined the pile of goods Frank took out from hisrnpockets and under his hat. \"This isrnvery good very good indeed, you're a good boy Frankie,\" Wallace watched quietlyrnfrom the side looking around at the place, a picture frame on the mantel caughtrnhis eye; he couldn't really read what it said. He was staring at it leaningrnforward a little trying to read the writing on it; he was doing just that whenrnBill noticed him. \"Friend of yours?\" \"Ya right off the boats, hadn't been off the cobblestonern'fore he was diggin in a man's pocket.\" Bill noddedrnand gestured for Wallace to come closer. \"Divin right in huh boy? You've got some gut for an Irish.\"rnWallace knew this probably wasn't the best place for his temper to get the bestrnof him, but he was getting sick of being called an Irish. \"I aint no bleedin Irish,\" he saidrnloudly Bill looked at Frank who looked from Bill to Wallace hurriedly. Wallacernbit his bottom lip and could feel his body start to shake, not from anger butrnfrom fear. Bill stood up and walked over to Wallace who took a step back. \"You do gotrnguts boy, where you from?\" Bill said leaning down staring right at Wallace, whorncouldn't take his eyes off the glass eagle eye Bill had \"I asked you arnquestion.\" \"Scotlandrnsir,\" Wallace said trying his best too keep his voice steady hiding the fearrnthat he felt racing throughout his body. \"'ighlands,\"rnBill nodded and suddenly began laughing all the others seated around him alsornbegan laughing more slowly and cautiously keeping an eye on Bill. Bill turnedrnto Wallace still laughing suddenly he stopped and waved his hand everyone elsernceased laughing as well. \"Never metrna Scottie,\" he said he stood up and moved closer to Wallace, he put his hand onrnthe back of Wallace's head and stared at the boy. Once again Wallace could notrnstop staring at the eagle in the glass eye. He bit his lip and swallowedrnnervously \"are all Scots gutsie as well boy?\" Billrnasked softly leading Wallace into a corner of the room near the fireplace.rnWallace nodded slowly \"Aye, we 'ave to be,\" \"Whysrnthat?\" \"Englandrnsir, they take our 'omes an' lands fer themselves, actin' like jus'rn'cause we're 'part of their island they can own us, been goin'rnon fer centauries. We've been fightin'rn'em fer centuariesrntoo aint 'elped 'tall,rnwe're still not free.\" Again Bill started laughing this time it was more of arnsilent laughter, he patted Wallace's shoulders. \"That's thernway it is here in New Yorkrnboy, the Irish come in here take everything from us true Americans.\" Wallacerncouldn't help but smile; this guy felt the same way he did about outsidersrndestroying people's homes and ways of life. Waitrna moment , Wallace felt his face pale he was an outsider to America,rndid that mean Bill thought he was no better then the Irish. \"I'm so glad tornfind someone who shares my beliefs, you got a name Scottie?\" \"Aye, Wallace,rnWallace McClintock,\" \"WellrnWallace, how would you like to work for me?\" \"I'd be 'onoured sir,\" \"Good boy,rnlet me lay things right out for ya,\" Wallace nodded \"Yes sir,\" \"First off,rnif your gonna be workin'rnalone half your lot goes to me, that helps me take care of yarngive ya a place to sleep and keep yarnsafe from the other gangs and the law. Lessen you want to be spendin' the rest of your childhood at Hellrn Gate.\" Wallace quickly shook his head that was the last place hernwanted to go to. \"All right then, rule number two, never come in here to see mernempty handed, I like ya so you get away with it thisrntime, next time you better damn come with something, understand?\" \"Aye sir,\"rnWallace paused for a moment thinking before deciding that maybe it be best torngive Bill what he did have \"may I say somthin' sir?\"rnBill nodded \"I didn't come in empty 'anded I've gotrnthe timepiece I lifted and there's some money in the man's purse, only I don'trnknow 'ow much I don't know 'mericanrnmoney yet so I couldn't figure it, it's loaded with coins though.\" Bill grinned \"Lemme see the timepiece,\" Wallace reached into his bag andrnlifted out the timepiece and held it up to Bill who took it \"This isrnvery nice very nice indeed.\" \"Do yournwant the money as well?\" \"Since yournwhere honest enough to tell me you had something for me I'll let you keep thernmoney, hang on to it and next time you come in I'll teach you about Americanrnmoney.\" \"Really?\" \"You havernmy word,\" \"Thank yernsir,\" \"Can yournread Wallace?\" \"Aye sir,\" \"Andrnwrite?\" \"Aye, aint so good at the spellin' partrnthough,\" \"You seemrnlike a smart lad, that's good.\" Bill patted Wallace on the head then placed hisrnhand on Wallace's shoulder before turning to Frank, his hands still rested onrnthe boy's shoulder. \"Frankie,\" \"Aye Bill?\" \"Take ourrnyoung friend here, bring him to Miss Charlotte, tell her I sent ya,\" \"Yes Bill,\"rnBill looked down at Wallace again \"You'll bernin good hands with Miss Charlotte, she'll give ya arnplace to sleep and you don't gotta pay her nothin' \"Nothin' sir?\" \"Nothin' I take care of it when I take in half your loot,rnsee how it works?\" \"Aye I dornsir,\" \"Good,rnevery other day you come in here and give me half of what you make. Who knowsrnif you do a good job you might get promoted and assist me,\" He patted Wallace'srnshoulders and nodded at Frankie who gestured for Wallace to follow. Wallacernnodded at Bill and followed Frank out into the streets. \"Ya definitely lucked out in there boyo,rnBill usually don't take to anyone who aint a native thatrnquickly.\" \"Aye, butrnwhat does 'e mean 'bout Natives?\" \"Bill's gotrnhis own gang called the Natives, only born Americans are in it, They own thernfive points, did ya notice the frame on the mantelrnbehind Bill?\" Wallace nodded \"Aye, couldn't read it though, wasrnto far 'way,\" \"That man was Priest Vallon, ten years ago the Irish tried to take the FivernPints away from the natives, right out in front of the Old Brewery was a hugernfight. Natives where a large gang and a group of Irish gangs joined uprntogether, it was led by a gang that's been outlawed since,\" Frank pulledrnWallace closer and lowered his voice to a very soft whisper \"called the DeadrnRabbits,\" \"Dead Rabbits?!\" Wallace exclaimedrnFrank quickly slapped his hand over Wallace's mouth \"Shh, Irntold ya they's wasrnoutlawed, no ones ever supposed to speak it, Bill's the one who outlawed themrnafter the fight. He'll make any man who even speaks 'bout them regret they evenrnheard of them.\" \"Sorry,\" \"Its ok,rnanyways, the fight was going pretty good I guess, it was breakin'rn'bout even with the killin' one pint the Irish whererneven winnin' then it came down to the gang leadersrnPriest Vallon for the Irish and Bill the Butcher forrnthe natives, Bill killed Priest and regained the Pints.\" Wallace didn't knowrnwhat to say, he silently followed Frank down the street. They stopped in frontrnof a crowded decrepit building with the faded words Old Brewery on a sign.rn\"Happened right here Boyo,\" Frank said gesturing tornthe space in front of the building. \"Really?\" \"Aye,\" \"BloodyrnBastards!\" a man's voice shouted causing Wallace to jump, Frank grinned widernlooking towards a huge crowd that had gathered on the other side of the fence. \"A gangrnfight!\" he shouted cheering \"'bout bloody time, hasn't been a good show inrnages, come on Wallace,\" he said grabbing Wallace's arm and dragging him downrnthe street. \"Oy Frankie!\" a boy about Frank's age ran up to them \"Gonna be a glorious fight!\" \"Who isrnit?\" \"Plug Uglies versus Forty Thieves, Ugliesrnlookin' to add to their territory movinrnonto the Thieves!\"xa0 They reached thernfence and Frank and the other boy climbed up into an old tree, then Frankrnreached down and pulled Wallace up. \"Jimmy thisrnis Wallace just off the boat with a shit load of guts,\" Jimmy grinned and stuckrnout his hand to Wallace \"Nice tornmeet ya,\" Wallace nodded and shook Jimmy's hand \"Aye yourntwo,\" One of the Plug Uglies nailed a Thieve with arnboard then the two of them where on the ground wrestling around. \"This isrnours go home ya thieving bastard!\" the man with thernhat replied something in Galeic. Wallace didn't knowrnwhat he had said but whatever it was it had really pissed off the Thieve whornwhipped out a knife and stabbed him. \"OY!\" Jimmyrnshouted standing up \"send him to meet his maker Tre!\"rnthe man called Tre looked up at the boys and grinned \"Hoy JimmyrnFrankie! Come to watch the show?\" \"Yea! Nowrnget on with it you ass!\" Frankie shouted grinning wide; Trernnodded and slit the guy's throat. Wallace felt the color drain from his face;rnhe had never seen so much blood and had never seen someone die like that. Hernsuddenly felt sick; he turned away from Frank and Jim and spat out the taste inrnhis mouth. \"You okrnWallace?\" \"Aye,rnjus'-\" \"Don'trnworry 'bout it you'll get used to it, happens all the time 'round here.\" A shrillrnwhistle broke through the shouts and swearing, a group of men dressed in bluerncarrying clubs ran down towards them. \"Thisrnshow's getting' better and better, oy Frank?\" \"Aye tis,\" \"Who arernthey?\" Wallace dared ask \"The cops,rnthose be the metropolitan this is really shapin' uprnto be a grand fight,\" Frank said patting Wallace on the back. Now the copsrnjoined into the fight, hitting whoever got in their way with the clubs theyrncarried, still tooting on their whistles. Apart of Wallace felt frightenedrnabout all that was going on, but the rest of him was intrigued this WAS prettyrninteresting, Frankie was right it was grand. It wasn't long however before thernfight began to break up, the apparent winners were the Forty Thieves keepingrntheir terriortir and sending the Plug Uglies and the police to fight amonstrnthemselves. \"So is Wallace joinin'rnus then Frank?\" Jimmy asked Frank looked at Wallace then shrugged \"Maybe, not right now though,rnBill's got him goin solo for a while, he's prettyrngood on the streets. Lifted a timepiece and a purse off a man when he hadn'trnbeen off the cobblestone, just stepped off the boat and was goin'rnfor the pickens.\" \"Aye I hears ye,\" Jimmy said, hernlooked at Wallace and stuck out his hand \"iffen yournever wanna join our gang Wallace, just talk to me orrnFrank, we getcha in aye boyo?\"rnWallace nodded and shook Frank's hand. \"Aye, I will,\" and with that Jimrntapped his hat before walking off down the street. \"Come on, lets go see MissrnCharlotte.\" Wallace nodded and followed Frank down the crowded street, unablernto stop from staring at the sights all around him. Well I got Bill in there and I got a gang fight in asrnwell…hope I didn't screw up the fight very much…Anyways like I said…this may bernthe last update for a while…cause I'm totally stuck at what to do next forrnthis…If anyone has any ideas I'd greatly appreciate them! Anyways…flames not welcome but Constructive criticism andrnregular reviews are all ways welcome! Later people (bows) Sharpsnout[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I own Wallace…and all the other names that don't appear in the movie Gangs of New York….Everyone else you do recognize AKA people such as Bill the Butcher, or places such as Paridise Square, they all belong to the director people of Gangs of New York. Some of the information comes from both a book based on the real Gangs of New York and from the movie itself…. Anyways…Holy crap…last time I updated this was back in June I am so sorry everyone…had some roadblocks on this, but now I have a very good idea where to take this so updates will be more frequent I hope… But I do have some review thankees to be handing out….so here they go! Cooper Fizz: (major blush) that is one of the first times a work of mine has been called well edited I'm horrible at that…So thanks a lot that means a lot to me. I get really detailed with stuff…some times I over do it, but I really appreciate you're review and I hope you keep on reading…cause like I said things are going to start getting exciting after this chapter, but I'm not sayin how! Bwhaha….Anyways again thanks for you're review hope to hear from you again. Trooper 3.6: Yeah it was a while wasn't it…I'm sorry…like I said…major writers block…But hopefully that tis all over with! Yay! I hope the gang fight was ok and I hope you like this new chapter, as I said to Cooper, things are really going to start getting exciting after this chapter…I've got big plans on where to take this and its gonna get interesting. So keep reading and I hope to keep hearing from you! Thanks again! TheDogPorthos Now that's a mouthful….Glad you like this, I'm a history fanatic and I love the Civil War, when I first saw Gangs of New York I fell in love with the movie, just because of the realism about it…then I found out there really were Gangs in New York back then so I was overly happy I think I drove my family nuts for a few days spurting out random 1963 New York facts. I'll definitely consider you're ideas, they sound really good and I could defeinetly work them into the story. I hope you keep reading and I hope to keep hearing from you. Thanks again! Later! Ok that was all the Newbies…Thanks to everyone who reads this even if you don't leave a review I just appreciate you taking the time to read this…Well enjoy the newest chapter and I'll see you at the end! Chapter 4 After all he had been experiencing that day, Wallace already had a picture of this Miss Charlotte in his mind; (A/N: I'm sure you all can imagine what he was thinking. Espically after all he's seen that day.) He was shocked to see a grandmother like woman sitting outside a nice building, one of the nicest he had seen since entering the Points. She was crocheting and watching a group of girls and boys play in the street. \"Well I'll be it's my Frankie boy, how's come you aint been visitin' me boy? You too busy to visit ol' Miss Charlotte?\" Frank's face went red and he bowed \"Sorry 'bout that, things been getting' ugly out there, plug ugly,\" he replied with a grin. Miss Charlotte hooted with laughter at Frank's play on words and hit her knee. \"Now whose this little fella?\" she said looking at Wallace \"Bill sent me to bring 'em to ya, this is Wallace, Bill asked if he could stay with ya?\" \"Dontcha got any folks boy?\" Wallace shook his head \"where are they?\" \"Dead,\" he said, Miss Charlotte looked at him sympathetically for a second before standing up and walking over to him. She looked him over, then picked up his arm and held it. \"My, your skin an' bones, an' I thought Frankie here was bad, we'll definitely hafta get some meat on those bones. Don't they feed 'cha on them boats\" She smiled \"but my oh my look at that face, could just make a mother cry, you gonna be workin' for the Butcher?\" Wallace nodded \"that's good he's a good man, I've been takin' care orphans that work for him for years, aint that right Frankie?\" Frank nodded \"You wont find a better lady Wallace,\" \"Oh Frank, go on and git,\" Miss Charlotte said blushing, she put an arm around Wallace's shoulders \"well lets go get you settled,\" \"I'll see ya 'round Wallace, meet me tomorrow in front of the Old Brewery 'bout noon, I'll give ya some tips on picken's in the five pints\" Wallace nodded thanks and followed Miss Charlotte inside. \"Don't got many kids nowadays, most of 'em runnin' with Frankie's gang, they come in every now and then for a warm place to sleep and some hot food, but they mostly take care of themselves.\" She paused and looked at Wallace \"didn't want to join Frankie?\" \"Don't think I'm cut out to bein' in a gang ma'am, I've only run solo, tis all I know,\" she nodded \"well if you didn't have the Butcher lookin' out for you I wouldn't even consider seein' you out there solo, as I'm sure Frankie's already told you, this isn't the old country, things be different here, you wouldn't last out there iffen you didn't have the Butcher behind ya, no matter how good at ya trade eventually you'll get caught\" \"Aye, 'e told me,\" \"Now your accent, never heard an Irish like that, you fresh off the boat aren't you?\" \"Aye, but I aint from Ireland, I'm from Scotland,\" \"Ah Scotland, I thought so, was wonderin' how come Bill sent you to me, Bill doesn't fancy the Irish, I think the only reason he likes Frankie is because Frankie was born here and is only half Irish.\" \"I could tell…that 'e didn't like Irish…not that Frank is one of 'em\" Wallace paused as she led him up a set of rickety stairs \"'e's ok with Scots right?\" \"Wallace, he wouldn't have sent ya to me if he wasn't, I only get those Bill trusts and likes, he don't like you he'll tell you so and leave you to fend for yourself out on the streets.\" She opened a door and ushered him into a small room, a real bed was in the corner with real blankets. \"This is your room, I sleep next-door, I make breakfast when the sun's comin' up and dinner when its settin' ifen you aint gonna make to either one of 'em or just one lemme know 'fore hand so I don't waste food. I lock the front door when they start lighting the lamps, the lamp outside the house is the one I go by, if you aint inside when that light comes on, your out for the night, thats my rule. You don't hafta pay me, the Butcher takes care of all your expenses, but helpin' with chores and bringin' food wont be turned away, if I had more kids I'd insist 'pon it, since I only got you and Sarah you only got to keep your room tidy, that's all I ask.\" \"There's a girl here?\" Miss Charlotte nodded \"Yes, wee little girl named Sarah, 'bout your age she's the Butcher's niece.\" Wallace nodded unsure what else to do. That night for the first time in months, Wallace ate more then his fill, he felt like his stomach was bulging. It was a excellent feeling and if it never ended Wallace would be very happy, he liked this full feeling.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I own nothing…well nothing 'cept the characters that you don't recognize from the Gangs of New York movie. Everything else belongs to the director, writer, and producer of Gangs of New York. Authors Note: All righty then…when I was typing up this chapter I realized something that I totally screwed up on, the dates/years. In the first chapter Wallace's journal entries are dated 1863. Now I was just re-watching the movie and I realized mathematically I screwed up, the movie takes place in 1862 not 1863, and at one point in a chapter Frankie says that the fight between the Irish and the Natives with Bill and Priest happened 10 years before when I have my story taking place. So I'm very sorry that I screwed that up. For future chapters and for future knowledge, the fic takes place at the moment a year before Amsterdam gets out of Hell Gate, so about 1861 eventually it will catch up with the movie time period itself. Again I apologize for the mix up and my idioticness. Also this chapter may be a little more er what's the word I'm lookin' for...uh...mouthy and more full of language then the others. Now on to…(looks at reviews) ok…the one review I received Copper Fizz (Anna): Glad you enjoyed the chapter…I haven't updated this in so long…I just had writers block on it then out of the blue the other day I got inspired to start it up again, and now I have more of an idea of where I'm gonna take this so updates should be more frequent. Living like Wallace…hm…well for one thing I'm a history nutcase yes nutcase would be the best description all my friends know that I would rather visit a place like Williamsburg Virginia, or Plymouth Plantation then an amusement park. So I think I would have liked living back then…now living in the points themselves…that's another story, but I would have done good in the pick pocketing industry I'm pretty good at it…till my very guilty conscience would eventually kick in and I'd feel bad about stealing something from someone and probably given the stuff back. Heh… The Scamerhorns were the people in the movie from the upper part of New York, like 5th avenue or something like that, they were being taken on a tour of the points by the constable. Uh…according to Amsterdam in the movie he says \"The Scamerhorns were one of the oldest families in New York, they didn't run the city, but they were listen to quite closey by those who did.\" Or something like that, I'm not angry for you asking, questions are always welcome I probably should have explained who they were better in the fic, your probably not the only one who didn't know who they were. If you have any other question don't be afraid to ask…I tend to confuse people in my fics so if I do I apologize. Well I hope you enjoy this new chappie, my names Kris by the way. Later! Ok so that was the only review I had. Now with out further ado chapter 5! Even though Wallace was exhausted from the days events, sleep wasn't coming easy to him. He always had trouble sleeping in new places with its new feelings and new noises, but for some reason, sleep was harder to come by here. The noises of the house were the same creaks and groans he had heard at his own home back in Scotland so that didn't make a difference. What did make a difference was the fact that instead of hearing the animals calling to one another outside and his father snoring in the room next-door, he heard shouts and screams coming from outside.[Chapter 6] Disclaimer : Holy smokes, has it been a long time since I updated this fic. Wooooah Last summer, June 1st…I am so sorry, I know I kept promising and promising that I would update and I never did, basically I had so much problems with this chapter and figure out how I would work it. I even watched Gangs of New York multiple times, and a few months ago bought a book about the Gangs of New York. Nothing was helping. But slowly but surly I was able to finally get something written. So if this chapter sucks I am very sorry, I did try, I will try harder to update on a timely fashion and hopefully the next chapter will up faster then this one… The street lamps were just being lit as Wallace raced down the street trying desperately to make it before the lamp in front of the house was lit; he didn't fancy spending the night out here. His pockets were weighed down with the purses he had lifted, he had ventured back onto the cobblestone and in his personal opinion had a really good haul.

Love & War Chapter One Amanda Simmons put her ID back into her bag as she stepped into the bar. The music pounded and made her headache worse, but she couldn't make any more excuses. It had ben two months since she'd had a night with Lauren and Trish. And this time, she was only half an hour later. She scanned the room and found the two women in a back corner booth. She moved as quickly as she could through the throng of people and joined them. \"Well, damn, you do exist,\" Trish said as she joined them. Amanda rolled her eyes and smiled. She stood and hugged Amanda and then Lauren did the same. \"This is cute,\" Lauren said, poking Amanda's leather pencil skirt. \"Amazon. Fifteen bucks,\" Amanda said. \"No shit?\" Lauren replied. \"Fake leather, too,\" she told the two women. \"And it has an elastic waist. \"Awesome!\" both women exclaimed. \"This is all great, but I have to live vicariously through you two because I have Bob, so…\" Trish said. \"I want details. Are you and FDR working on baby number two yet?\" she asked Lauren. \"And you…\" she turned to Amanda. \"Why haven't you set a date yet?\" Amanda gulped down a large wig of her vodka cranberry and left Lauren to answer. \"Well…\" \"Well what, missy? You and that man should be at it like rabbits. If you need a break, I could volunteer myself as tribute,\" Trish said. \"That is really nice of you, Trish,\" Amanda told her. \"Yeah, thanks, but I think we're good,\" Lauren said. The three women spent the next couple of hours chatting and catching up, along with drinking and dancing. Amanda was calling for a ride home to take the three of them home when another of Amanda's vodka cranberries arrived at the table. \"Oh, I've cashed out and we're headed home, but thank you,\" Amanda told the young waitress. \"It's from him,\" she pointed across the room at a dark-haired man. Amanda followed the pointed hand and made eye contact with the guy before rolling her eyes. \"I'm good, thanks,\" she said. \"Do you know him?\" Lauren asked after the waitress shuffled away with the drink. \"Matthew Jones,\" Amanda said, sighing. \"We should get going. The car will be here in two…\" \"Mandy, Mandy, Mandy…\" the voice said. \"Mandy?\" Trish snickered. Amanda tossed her a look and the women was instantly silenced. Amanda turned around and looked up into the face of the man. \"What are you doing here, Matt?\" Amanda asked. \"Well, I just moved here, sweetheart,\" Matt said. \"I can't believe I'd run into you on my first night in town,\" he said. \"You look good. I like this skirt. It makes your ass look…\" he said, patting her rear end. \"Well, this has been great, but…\" \"We can catch up on Monday instead, honey,\" Matt said. \"What?\" \"I moved here to work here, Mandy,\" Matt said. \"I'm in your office under Collins, too.\" \"Why?\" Amanda asked. \"Because…\" \"Because the east coast is so cold, honey. And I missed you,\" she said, putting a hand on her hip. \"I really like this skirt, you know. It's going to look great in a heap on the floor. Do you still wear those stockings that you used to wear for me?\" he asked. Amanda stepped back out of his grasp and turned to Lauren and Trish. \"The car is outside. Have a great night,\" Amanda said over her shoulder as she marched the two women from the bar. In their ride, Trish started questioning Amanda. \"Who was that? I'm going to need a lot of detail.\" \"Matt Jones is an ex-boyfriend, well, ex-fiance,\" Amanda said. \"You were engaged before?\" Lauren asked. \"A long, long, long time ago. I have told Tuck, so it's not some scary secret that he can't know about. But…yeah. I guess Matt doesn't remember everything he'd done, including cheat on me.\" \"Is he with…?\" \"Yes. Unfortunately.\" \"He's hot.\" \"He knows it, too,\" Amanda said. \"Tuck will not be happy.\" \"Maybe he'll be in a different department than you all?\" Lauren suggested. \"I really didn't like the way he was touching you,\" she added. \"You can't just walk up to someone and put your hands all over them.\" Amanda had already checked herself to make sure he hadn't put a bug on her. There were a lot of reasons to not trust Matt Jones and she assumed that this meeting tonight wasn't the chance encounter he'd said it was. \"Matt's never been good on rules…\" \"But he just harassed you,\" Lauren argued. Amanda nodded. \"Yep. Matt Jones is an asshole. Always was one and probably will always be one.\" Amanda was the last of the three to be dropped off that night and Tuck was still awake, despite the late hour. He sat on the couch with a beer watching the soccer match on TV. Joe was at his mother's house that weekend, so they were all alone. \"You are a sight for sore eyes,\" Tuck said from the couch. \"Please, come here,\" he beckoned with this finger for her to join him. Amanda kicked off her high heels and joined Tuck on the couch. She pulled up her skirt and crawled into his lap, straddling him. She leaned down and kissed him passionately. His hands found her hips and he pulled her close while her hands quickly undid the buttons of his dress shirt. \"I know it's only been a few hours,\" Tuck said between kissing her. \"But I missed you and I couldn't stop thinking about you.\" \"Bedroom?\" she said. \"Bedroom,\" he said in a deep voice. He picked her up in one smooth motion and she wrapped her legs around him so she could be carried without breaking contact. She found the pulse point on his neck and sucked on it before grazing it lightly with her teeth. He hissed in pleasure. Tuck moved even faster and soon they were in the bedroom. He slammed the door behind them before he set Amanda on her feet. Her hands quickly unbuckled his belt before unbuttoning and unzipping his pants. They each made short work of their remaining clothing. \"Tell me what you want,\" Tuck whispered. \"You,\" she said breathlessly. … \"You – you are going to be the death of me,\" Tuck said as he drew lazy circles on Amanda's back while he held her against his chest. They'd made love several times and now, both spent, they were enjoying the quiet of the house. \"I would say I'm sorry, but I'm not, so…\" she smiled into his shoulder. \"How was your night with Lauren and Trish?\" \"It was fine,\" Amanda said. \"Drilled me as to why we haven't set a date yet, though.\" \"What did you tell them?\" \"That it's all your fault,\" she grinned, clearly lying. \"I told them that we are just enjoying us right now. And then I was told that I'm not getting any younger and to figure it all out and to do it quickly.\" \"That sounds rather like Trish,\" Tuck replied. Amanda nodded. \"So, would you care to share with the class, i.e., me as to why you came home and ravished me? I don't really mind, as I enjoyed it immensely, but you, well, I know something is wrong. You should probably just tell me what that is.\" Amanda drew a breath. \"I ran into someone tonight that I don't particularly care for. It has made me incredibly…I am just so happy to have you in my life, Tuck,\" she said. \"That's all.\" \"Well, there's nothing wrong with that,\" he said, smiling. \"Who did you run into?\" \"Uh…Matthew Jones,\" she said slowly. \"Oh,\" Tuck said. \"Matthew. Your ex.\" \"And I wanted to let you know how lucky I am,\" Amanda said. \"In my head, that meant ravishing you.\" \"I do like the way your mind works, darling,\" he grinned widely. She sat up and looked down at Tuck. \"There's something else.\" Tuck's smile fell. \"And you will not like it,\" Amanda added. \"What is it?\" \"He's transferred out here and he's going to work under Collins,\" Amanda said. \"If he puts one foot wrong, he'll be in a body cast,\" Tuck said. \"You can't do that, Tuck,\" Amanda said while she stood from the bed. She moved and pulled one of Tuck's sweaters on over her head and it fell over her body to her thighs. \"As much as I'd like it.\" \"It will be fine, you know,\" Tuck told her. \"Come here,\" he said, beckoning for her to come back to bed. \"If I come back to this bed, I might not ever leave it,\" Amanda said. \"That's the plan,\" Tuck said. \"I can't think of a single thing I'd rather do this weekend,\" he told her. … Monday morning came about far too quickly and Tuck and Amanda walked into the Agency building side by side. Tuck was not looking forward to meeting Matthew Jones and he absolutely didn't want him anywhere near Amanda. He planned on talking with Collins as as soon as he could. Amanda nudged him slightly with her elbow and motioned upwards with a head nod. Tuck followed her gaze and looked up. On the next floor, Collins was talking to a man he didn't was talking to a man he didn't recognize, but it had to be the now-infamous Matthew Jones. Amanda shrugged it off and started walking while Tuck remained still. She turned around and linked her arm through Tuck's. \"Come on,\" she said. Matt looked down at them and grinned at Amanda while he ignored Tuck entirely. Amanda hurried Tuck off towards the annex where Tuck and FDR had their desks. \"Aw, mommy walked you all the way in today?\" FDR joked from behind his desk. \"Oh, I think that sounds like jealousy, Franklin,\" Amanda said with a smirk. \"Did Lauren make you take care of your own breakfast today?\" \"And I had to pick out my own clothes,\" FDR fake-pouted. \"Oh, the indecency of it all!\" Tuck laughed. \"Now, I want you boys to play nice today,\" Amanda said. \"You should talk to Collins about moving your desk over by ours,\" FDR said. \"It would be fun for all of us.\" \"I would never get any work done. I'm sure Boss would go for that,\" Amanda said, smiling. \"Lunch today? BBQ truck?\" \"Sounds good. We should go now,\" FDR said. \"It's 8:15 in the morning!\" Amanda replied. \"But I'm hungry,\" FDR pouted again. \"Eat a muffin,\" she told him. \"See you both later,\" she said before bending to give Tuck a quick kiss. She turned to walk away, but FDR spoke. \"What about me?\" he asked. Amanda turned back and looked at him, but Tuck spoke. \" What about you?\" he asked. \"Don't I get one?\" he said. \"No,\" said Tuck while shaking his head. But Amanda was moving around FDR's desk. She grabbed his face in both hands and planted a chaste kiss on his forehead. \"Are you happy now?\" \"Incredibly so,\" FDR laughed. \" So hot.\" \"Is there a queue I need to get in or a list I can put my name on to get one, too? Or is it a walk-in kind of thing?\" a man's voice asked. Amanda knew who it was without looking. \"Nope. All reserved for decent human beings,\" she said. \"And since you definitely don't fall into that category…\" FDR's eyebrows shot up and Tuck came to stand next to her. \"Tuck, FDR, this is Matthew Jones, scum of the earth,\" she said. \"Welcome to the west coast.\" A/N: let me know what you think! Thank you![Chapter 2] Love & War Chapter 2 \"Wow,\" Matt replied. \"Is that any way to introduce your fiancé to your coworkers?\" Matt asked. \" Scum of the Earth? That hurts me deeply, Mandy.\" Amanda rolled her eyes. \"You, Matthew Jones, are an ex . An. Ex. An ex for a reason. You like the cold – it matches your cold heart – so I don't know why you're here.\" He smiled. \"I told you that Friday at the bar, by the way, you can wear that skirt anytime for me…but I came here because I need to work somewhere warmer, Mandy. And I remember how warm you can be.\" FDR was now up and standing next to Amanda on her opposite side and Matt smirked. \"You don't need bodyguards, Mandy,\" Matt said. \"It's really very cute, though.\" \"Amanda and I are engaged, mate,\" Tuck said. Amanda nodded. \"Yes, engaged. I have no interest in you and I'm angry that I ever did,\" she said. \"You can go find your cubicle now. And I would suggest you stay there,\" she told him. Matt was still smiling at her. \"You couldn't possibly mean that,\" he said. \"Oh, I sure as hell do,\" Amanda said. \"I don't know what you're thinking you're doing, that we would reconnect or whatever, but you are sadly mistaken, you asshole. Even if I were single, you wouldn't stand a chance.\" \"We'll see,\" Matt said. \"Go now. And if you try a damn think, I will let my bodyguards at you, after I've had my chance,\" Amanda said. \"Oh, Mandy, this is going to be so much fun,\" Matt said with another smirk. \"Mr. Jones, the lady asked that you leave her be. I suggest you do as she asked,\" Tuck said, taking a protective step in front of Amanda. \"I don't know what your game is, mate, but we won't be playing it.\" Matt Jones had an inch or two on him, but Tuck more than made up for that with muscle. \"Is that a threat…mate?\" Matt asked with an arched eyebrow. \"Absolutely,\" Tuck replied. \"I don't want you talking to her, looking at her, or even thinking about her. Her name shouldn't pass your lips. You put a toe wrong, Matthew, you will not enjoy the results, but I can promise you that I will enjoy them. Now, go be a good boy, sit at your desk, and keep your hands to yourself.\" Matt was grinning like the Cheshire cat. \"Engaged or not, I get what I want, Tuck,\" Matt told him. \"And she always comes back to me. Always.\" \"Not this time, Matt,\" Amanda replied. Matt, in turn, winked before turning on his heel and strolling away, whistling. \"Ugh,\" Amanda groaned. \"I don't think I would have ever pegged that asshole as your type, Amanda.\" \"He's not,\" Amanda said. \"He's a mistake. A big, big mistake that seems to want to come bite me in the ass.\" \"I should have knocked some sense into him,\" Tuck said. \"Are you all right?\" \"That is incredibly chivalrous, Tuck, but I don't need you to start hitting people for me.\" \"Not people . Just him,\" Tuck said. \"It's not going to make you feel better,\" Amanda told him, although she didn't quite believe it. \"Well, I don't agree with that at all, Mand. I think socking the guy would make the both of us feel better,\" FDR said. \"All three of us, even.\" \"Okay, if I promise to let the both of you protect me, will you promise me to do it without getting yourselves suspended?\" she asked. \"Besides, if anyone gets to hit him, it's going to be me. And it'll be with my car,\" she smiled. \"I like the way she thinks, FDR smirked. \"You both need to not hit him. At least, not yet,\" she asked them. \"Do you both promise me?\" she looked at the both of them. Both men hesitated. \"Seriously, I don't want to have to worry about you two,\" she said. \"Please?\" \"Of course, Mand,\" FDR said. \"I don't make those kinds of promises,\" Tuck said defiantly. \"I will do what I need to do to keep you protected, okay?\" \"Well, lady and gentleman, we've reached a stalemate,\" FDR announced. \"I'm not going to have to separate you two, am I?\" FDR asked. Amanda and Tuck were silently glaring at each other. \"I have a departmental meeting I have to get to, but,\" she said before turning to FDR. \"See that Tuck keeps his fists to himself, would you, please?\" she asked of her friend. \"Yes, ma'am,\" FDR saluted and smiled. \"But you know he doesn't listen to me any better than he listens to you.\" \"Oh, somehow I think he'll manage,\" she said with a sideways glance before walking down the opposite hall. Matt Jones kept to himself for the remainder of the week and that kept Amanda from tearing her hair out. She wasn't afraid of him, but she was absolutely annoyed at him. She had broken up with the guy a long time ago and his behavior recently made her glad she had. Amanda walked up to the all-hands meeting with Tuck at the end of the day that Friday. They were talking quietly to each other when FDR joined them. \"Rumor has it that Collins got a fancy promotion and is leaving us,\" FDR told them quietly. \"What?\" Amanda said, shocked. She had hoped having the no-nonsense Collins as their leader would keep Jones' antics to a minimum; Collins didn't tolerate any of that in her office. \"Yeah – I heard this is to announce who the director successor is,\" FDR said to them. \"I hope it's me,\" he smiled. \"Uh-huh. That would be good for morale,\" Tuck replied. Collins appeared at the railing above them and the crowd became quiet as they waited for her to do whatever announcing she planned. \"Thank you for all waiting at the end of the day,\" she began. \"I won't keep you so I will get right to the point: come Monday, you will all have a new director overseeing operations here. I am to report to Langley over the weekend; I was given a promotion and will be working on the east coast from now on,\" Collins said. A round of applause when through the crowd that was assembled and a small smile played on Collins' lips. It was gone as quickly as it came, though, and Collins' was motioning for them to call quiet down. \"Thank you, thank you. I can say that it has been a pleasure working with you all – well, most of you,\" she said as she looked specifically at FDR and Tuck. They both grinned back at her. \"I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce you to your new director, as well. Please also give a warm welcome to your new leader, Matthew Jones.\" Amanda's jaw fell while Matt walked up to stand next to Collins. The room was applauding once more. \"Holy shit,\" Amanda hissed. Matt was wearing a wide smile while he enjoyed the applause he was being given and he winked down at Amanda. She let out a low growl in the back of her throat. \"I look forward to getting to work with all of you,\" Matt said, but he was only looking at Amanda. \"I hate him so much,\" Amanda whispered to Tuck. \"I'll see you at home.\" She stalked away a moment later and Matt was still grinning ear to ear. Saturday afternoon, Amanda returned home and found Joe playing his video games in the living room. Amanda had spent the day out shopping with the girls: Cam, Alex, and Sophie and she was now she was glad she could rest. \"Howdy, Joe!\" Amanda called over the volume of the game. She saw it was soccer and she smiled; Joe inherited his father's love of the sport. He paused the game and dashed to Amanda to give her a quick hug. \"Hey!\" he said. \"You were shopping all day ? Dad told me that's where you were when I got home,\" he told Amanda. Amanda nodded. \"Those girls know how to do it,\" she shrugged. \"How was the week with your mom?\" \"It was good. We went and saw Spider-Man afterschool one day,\" Joe said. \"Oh, cool!\" Amanda replied. \"Spelling test? Aced it, right?\" \"I'm going to be in the school spelling bee!\" \"What?! Oh my gosh! That's amazing, Joe! I knew you'd be awesome!\" Amanda gushed. \"Thank you!\" Joe laughed. \"Dad went to the store. He says we're having a celebration tonight.\" \"I think that's awesome and a fantastic idea. Did he mention anything about dinner?\" \"He told me to tell you he'd handle it,\" Joe said. \"Because he knew you'd ask.\" Amanda laughed. The doorbell rang and Joe moved towards it. \"I'll get it.\" \"Thank you,\" she called as she moved away toward the master bedroom. Amanda returned to the living room and Joe carried a vase of flowers back toward her. \"You got flowers,\" Joe waggled his eyebrows around the vase. \"Who are they from?\" Amanda asked. \"Um, obviously they're from dad,\" Joe said. \"But the card is sealed, Mandy,\" he said before handing over the vase. \"When did he start calling you Mandy?\" he asked walking toward his video games. \"He doesn't,\" Amanda said, setting the flowers down on the table. \"The delivery guy told me to tell you hello,\" Joe called. Amanda was incredibly suspicious now and when she opened the card her stomach dropped. \"Not from Tuck,\" she muttered. She picked up the vase and moved through the kitchen to the back door of their loft. She took the stairs down and found Tuck coming in downstairs when she was walking out with the bouquet. \"Hey,\" he said, giving her a kiss. \"Those are nice. Did you ladies actually buy something more than shoes today?\" \"No. All shoes,\" she replied without any humor in her tone. She tossed the entire vase into one of the garbage cans and turned around to face Tuck. Tuck was looking at her with a confused expression. \"Why did you throw out an entire bouquet of flowers?\" \"Because I don't care for the person that sent them to me,\" she told him. She took one of the bags from Tuck's arm and they walked back into the building. \"Matt sent them.\" \"Oh,\" Tuck said. Amanda could hear the anger in his voice in just the one syllable. They walked up the stairs and Amanda locked the door behind them and followed Tuck into the kitchen. He set his bags down and Amanda handed him the card from her pocket. \"Who do I talk to now, Tuck? He's running the place,\" Amanda said as she helped him unpack the groceries. \"I'd still talk to Collins,\" Tuck said. \"She won't be unreachable. And she has a lot of pull with the Agency higher-ups,\" he said. \"And you'll have to make the call because I'm going to be sent to Siberia.\" Tuck was smiling at her, but Amanda wore a frown. \"That's not funny, Tuck,\" Amanda replied. \"What happens if he starts to pull shit like that?\" Tuck finished and closed the fridge door. \"I'll quit before I let the man send me away from Joe and you,\" he leaned to give her a kiss. \"You don't need to worry about Matthew Jones, Amanda. Not while I'm around.\" \"Are you going to be around all the time?\" Amanda asked. \"Just try and stop me,\" Tuck told her. \"Now, let's celebrate the kid winning his spelling bee!\" he said. His optimism and enthusiasm were contagious and the three of them celebrated Joe's win into the night. They had a classic junk food dinner of frozen goodies and then ended up watching movies until all three of them were passed out on the couch. The following morning, Amanda tiptoed out of the living room to get the coffee started in the kitchen. She was going to read the news on the phone when a text came in. \" It's not nice to throw away gifts like that, Mandy ,\" the text message read. She quickly took a screenshot and deleted the message before blocking the number. Matt was also watching her and their house. This was not good. … Author's note: let me know what you think!

De stilte werd echter snel doorbroken, aangezien er werk aan de winkel was in het oude leegstaande fabriekspand op het Verlaat. Casper keek de groep één voor één aan, op een manier die je koude rillingen kon bezorgen. De rest van de groep keek naar de grond, want Casper recht in zijn ogen kijken, dat was ongehoord griezelig op momenten als deze. 'Ik had willen zeggen: goed dat jullie er allemaal zijn', zei Casper met een minachtende toon in zijn rauwe, kille stem, 'maar zo goed vind ik dat niet. Ik heb met mijn geniale brein een grootse en ingewikkelde operatie gepland, die ik moet laten uitvoeren door idioten als jullie. Op het niveau waar jullie zitten halen we Don Rons Maffia nooit in en komen we te laat!' 'Uh, te laat waarmee', sprak Dumb Dirk, ook wel bekend als DD of simpelweg idioot. 'Wie zei dat het jouw beurt was om te praten?!' viel Casper woedend uit terwijl hij MM met een woedende blik bij zijn kraag greep en na een paar seconden weer losliet. 'Onderbreek me niet, hersenloze! Wat ik jullie nu ga vertellen is revolutionair, het zal onze laatste operatie zijn voordat we in eeuwige rijkdom kunnen zwemmen. De Postbank heeft voor een maand lang een diamant opgeslagen: Ze Zuperdure Edelzteen. Deze Zuid-Afrikaanse diamant is maar liefst 899.999.999,99 euri waard.' 'Wauw dat is 600 miljoen per persoon!', zei DD weer. Casper grijpt zijn .44 van zijn riem en douwt de loop in Dumb Dirks mond. DD knijpt zijn ogen angstig dicht en begint zacht te snikken. Casper haalt de trekker over, waarop een klik volgt. 'Volgende keer is ie geladen, kuthond!', zegt Casper met een grom in zijn stem. 'Dan hervat ik nu mijn verhaal, hopelijk zonder weer onderbroken te worden. Ze Zuperdure Edelzteen ligt in de Postbank, in een kleine ruimte achterin het gebouw. Maar nu komt het slechte nieuws, en dat is voor jou, Michozz. De kluis waarin de diamant ligt is een Pregex-kluis, afkomstig van de Kijkshop' Michozz' gezicht werd meteen lijkbleek. 'Een Pregex-kluis?', zei hij geschrokken. 'Van de Kijkshop? Dat is niet niks, het kan wel een half uurtje duren voordat ik die kluis heb gekraakt.' 'Je zorgt er maar voor dat je hem binnen twintig minuten open hebt, de politie zal er niet langer dan dat over doen, zelfs niet die van Veenendaal. Oké dan zal ik nu iedereen zijn taken geven. Dirk, jij bestuurt de vluchtauto. Denk je dat je dat aankan?' 'Uhhh...' 'Mooi. Eens kijken, dan krijgen we... Iris, mijn geliefde zusje. Jij houdt de mensen onder schot tijdens de overval. Julie doet dat ook, maar zij mag aan het begin ook nog even indruk maken op de medewerkers, op die speciale manier om zichzelf te 'presenteren' waarmee ze indruk op iedereen kan maken, ik weet zeker dat jullie allen weten waar ik het over heb', zei Casper met een grijns in Julies richting, die van het ene op het andere moment weer overging in zijn bekende norse, minachtende blik. 'Zoals ik al zei zal Michozz de kluis kraken en ik ga mee om de wacht te houden en eventuele opstandige medewerkers uit te schakelen. Dit is allemaal heel mooi bedacht, maar we hebben wel nog wapens, een vluchtauto en andere dingen nodig, maar het belangrijkste is: we moeten de Veenendaalse Maffia van Don Ron uitschakelen, en dat zou nog wel eens een probleem kunnen gaan worden.' 'Ja inderdaad, dat zal nog wel moeilijk gaan', zei Iris. 'Misschien dat wat martelwerktuigen ze tot inkeer brengen?' 'Nee, dat maakt ze alleen nog wraakzuchtiger. Wat wij nodig hebben is iets wat ze voor eens en voor altijd zal uitschakelen en ik denk dat ik wel een ideetje heb hoe we dat voor mekaar kunnen krijgen', zei Casper met een sadistisch lachje. 'Maar dat is pas van later zorg, nu moeten we ons helemaal focussen op de operatie, oké?' 'Ja baas!', klonk het in koor. 'Mooi, dan zal ik nu het plan aan jullie voorleggen.'[Chapter 2] Noot van de auteur: In hoofdstuk 1 stond een keer MM, dit moest natuurlijk DD zijn. DD gaat van nu af aan niet meer door het leven als Dumb Dirk, maar als Dumb Dave. Dan volgt nu het verhaal: Hoofdstuk 2: Rivalen[Chapter 3] Hoofdstukn3: Heftige handelaar Eennplantaardige geur, rokerige ruimte en mensen met een lachkick.nMichozz bevond zich in een vertrouwde omgeving in de National. Dezenkoffieshop aan de Prins Bernhardlaan had alles wat je maar konnwensen: vrolijke mensen, wiet en een geheime wapenhandel achterin. 'YonMohammed, alles goed?', zei Michozz tegen de man achter dentoonbank. 'Altijd,njongen. Wat kan ik voor je doen?' 'Iknwou even kijken wat je achter had liggen', zei Michozz serieus. Zonderneen woord te zeggen liep Mohammed naar achteren. Michozz volgde hem,nterwijl hij voelde dat iedereen hem met hun ogen volgde. Ze liepenndoor een gang, met aan het einde de deur naar de wapenkamer, maarnvoor de deur ging Mohammed ineens stilstaan en draaide hij zich om. 'Waarvoornheb je het eigenlijk nodig?', zei Mohammed, terwijl hij zijnnbehaarde, gespierde armen over mekaar sloeg en Michozz vanonder zijnndikke, borstelige wenkbrauwen ernstig aankeek. 'Mijnnbaas was heel duidelijk, dat mag ik niemand vertellen', zei Michozznmet enige aarzeling in zijn stem. 'Ach,nkom op joh!', zei Mohammed die zijn arm om Michozz' schouder heennsloeg en ineens een grijns op zijn gezicht toverde. 'Je kunt hetnMohammed toch wel vertellen? We hebben zelf nog een keer een missienuitgevoerd, of ben je dat alweer vergeten?' 'Nou...' 'Bennje al vergeten dat ik je leven gered heb? Ben je zo'n ondankbarenhond? Je staat bij me in het krijt, je bent me een hoop verschuldigdnen dan ben je nog te beroerd om een betrouwbare vriend te vertellennwaar je je wapens voor gaat gebruiken? Verdomme zeg, wat heb ik me innjou vergist.' 'Maar...' 'Laatnik het zo zeggen. Ik ben je distributeur en ik wil weten voor welkendoeleinden mijn waren gebruikt worden. Geen informatie, geen wapens,nkapish?' Evennwas het stil. Toen begon Michozz toch maar zijn verhaal te vertellen. 'Hetnplan is waterdicht, We gaan Ze Zuperdure Edelzteen uit de Postbanknjatten. We kiezen een gunstig tijdstip: volgende week vrijdag,nongeveer kwart voor 6 's middags als ze bijna gaan sluiten en denjuten allemaal al naar huis aan het gaan zijn. Dan gaan wij naarnbinnen en dan... de rest kun je denk ik zelf wel bedenken' 'Klinktngoed, succes man', zei Mohammed. 'Kom maar mee naar binnen.' Allesnwat je maar aan wapens kon wensen was aanwezig. Michozz koos eennaantal wapens uit en sprak met Mohammed af dat hij ze volgende weekndinsdag om 5 uur 's ochtends bij een garage op de Tuinstraat konnophalen. Michozz belde Casper meteen om hem te vertellen hoe allesnzou gaan, en toen hij ophing had hij de foute indruk dat er nietsnmeer fout kon gaan.[Chapter 4] Hoofdstuk 4: Afwachtend in spanning De dag was aangebroken, vandaag was het zover. In het hoofdkwartier leek iedereen nerveus, behalve Casper. Niets scheen hem er toe te doen, maar schijn bedriegt. In zijn gedachten was Casper bezig met alles precies te plannen voor vanavond, voor zover er nog wat te plannen viel. Casper keek op zijn chronograaf. Er restten nog precies vier uren voordat ze met groots lawaai en bruut geweld de Postbank zouden binnenstormen en de onschuldige, nietsvermoedende klanten en personeelsleden de schrik van hun leven zouden aanjagen. Maar die pechvogels zouden niet de enigen zijn die in doodsangst zouden verkeren, want onder het masker van stoerheid en onverschrokkenheid gutste ook bij onze gangsters het zweet uit alle pori[Chapter 5] Hoofdstuk 5: De overval Alsof hij een stroomschok had gekregen sprong Casper direct op en ramde de achterdeuren van het busje over. Gelijk werd iedereen verblind door het felle zonlicht, maar allen negeerden het. Alle vier de gangleden renden twee aan twee het busje uit en liepen in een rij rechtsom het busje heen, gewapend en uitgerust met alles wat ze nodig hadden. Door het gelukkig al geopende paar schuifdeuren renden ze naar binnen. Ze passeerden de postvakjes, posttassen en kaartjesautomaat. Bij hun binnenkomst draaiden alle hoofden gelijk hun richting uit. Eén vrouw slaakte een gil uit. Het personeel achter de balie keek hen met open ogen aan. Alles ging zo snel, maar Casper wist dat hij nu sneller moest zijn en schreeuwde: 'Dit is een overval. Jullie, medewerkers, alle vier, opstaan en leg je handen in je nek!' De vier medewerkers achter de grote balie deden direct wat ze opgedragen werd. 'Jij ook, slet!', schreeuwde hij agressief, terwijl hij zijn pistool wees naar de vrouw achter de andere balie, die verschrikt opstond. Julie, Iris en Michozz hadden inmiddels met hun pistolen het hele postkantoor onder controle. Iris bewaakte de deur, Julie had de linkerkant, Casper het midden en Michozz de rechterkant. 'Tweede positie innemen', schreeuwde Casper naar Iris, terwijl het eigenlijk ook voor Julie gold. Iris bleef staan waar ze stond alleen richtte haar pistool nu op de linkerkant en het midden van de kamer. Julie ging in de hoek tegenover die van Iris staan en hield de rechterkant en ook het midden onder schot vanachter de balie waar Casper als laatst de vrouw bedreigd had. Nu sprongen Michozz en Casper over de toonbank. Michozz ging al door de deur naar achteren, maar Casper drukte nog even zijn pistool tegen het hoofd van een medewerker en zei: 'Als er ook maar iemand hier de politie waarschuwt, ben jij de eerste die er aangaat.' Na deze boodschap rende Casper ook door de deur, de medewerker trillend en zwetend achterlatend. Achter de deur lag een lange gang die uitkwam op een ruimte met twee witte tafels, waar, aan de overgebleven kruimels te zien, pas nog gegeten was. Hij zocht naar Michozz maar voordat hij deze kon roepen werd Casper zelf al geroepen. 'Casper! Hier!' Het geluid kwam uit een kleine zijgang. Aan het eind van die gang stond een deur open, waarachter hij in de grote, donkere ruimte het geknielde silhouet van Michozz al zag. Hij rende de kamer in en zag dat Michozz al druk bezig was met de Pregex-kluis. 'Het gaat goed, misschien gaat het toch wel in een kwartier lukken', zei hij hijgend. 'Dat hoop ik voor je, want de juten wachten niet voor eeuwig.' Michozz knikte en keek even moeilijk zonder zijn ogen ook maar één moment van de kluis af te nemen. Casper rende even terug naar de anderen en vroeg hoe het daar ging. 'Goed', zei Iris. 'Iedereen is zo stil als een muis.' 'Mooi, dat houden we zo, anders gaan er koppen rollen', zei Casper met een kwaadaardige lach. Casper liep weer door de deur naar achteren. Toen gebeurde het. Wekenlange planning voor niets. Iets als dit had Casper, of welke andere deelnemer van de operatie nog niet eens durven dromen. De stilte en secretie van hun operatie was verbroken. De overval simpelweg verpest. In de ruimte met de twee witte tafels werd een pistool door het raam geslagen. Vervolgens werd er nog twee keer geslagen om de hele ruit vrij te maken van glas. En daar stapte professor Josse gebukt door het kozijn terwijl Casper zijn rechtervoet krakend hoorde neerkomen op de glassplinters. Toen zijn andere been ook door het kozijn was en hij zich omdraaide herkende hij Casper meteen. Een moment lang was het stil, er was niets anders dan zij. Als in een westernfilm stonden ze tegenover elkaar, beiden een pistool bij hun hand. Toen, na één seconde, die een eeuwigheid had geleken, greep Josse naar het pistool dat hij met de loop in zijn broek had geschoven. Casper had het geluk zijn pistool al in zijn hand te hebben, en terwijl hij dit op Josse richtte sprong hij meteen een stukje naar links voor zover dat kon in de smalle gang. Het geluid van twee pistolen weerklonk tegelijk in de stille gang. Achter Casper barstte de ruit die naar het postkantoor leidde, terwijl Caspers kogel vlak onder Josses linkerschouder, iets naast diens pectorale spier, een explosie van bloed veroorzaakte, dat over hemzelf en de vloer heen spatte, waarna het overging in een klein stroompje dat naar beneden liep en zijn T-shirt doorweekte. Na dit moment dat hooguit een seconde geduurd zou hebben, vertrok Josses gezicht en barstte hij uit in een pijnlijke schreeuw en luidruchtig gevloek. Dit leek Casper zijn kans om de operatie nog te redden. Hij rende op het raam af en sloeg Josse met de zijkant van zijn pistool tegen de vlakte. Casper greep met zijn linkerhand het raamkozijn vast en ging toen naar rechts met zijn pistool in zijn andere hand het raam uithangen. Hij keek naar links en terwijl hij verwachtte Don Rons maffiagang te zien kreeg hij een leeg pad onder ogen. Casper keek verbaasd en toen hij net weer naar achteren wilde gaan, terug het gebouw in, voelde hij de koude loop van een pistool in zijn nek en Don Rons stem: 'Jammer jong, als je de andere kant had opgekeken had je die zielige operatie van je misschien nog kunnen redden. Maar jij moest natuurlijk weer de kant van je belachelijke ideologie opkijken. Sukkel!'[Chapter 6] Hoofdstuk 6: Deninterruptie DenDon barstte in lachen uit en Casper hoorde Jory's blije, irritantengegiechel ook op de achtergrond. 'Laatnje pistool vallen en doe je handen omhoog terwijl je ophoudt metnhangen en terug het gebouw ingaat', zei Don Ron, ineens opnbloedserieuze toon. Caspernliet zijn linkerhand los en stond weer in de kamer. Hij gooide zijnnpistool naar achteren en deed zijn handen in zijn nek. Don Ron hieldnzijn pistool de hele tijd op Caspers hoofd gericht, maar toen hij hetnpistool achter Casper via de muur op de grond hoorde neerkomen,nvertrok zijn gezicht in een woedende blik en sloeg hij Casper met denzijkant van zijn pistool tegen zijn slaap waarna Casper met eennzachte kreun op de grond viel, zijn ogen stijf dichtgeknepen. Ernsijpelde een klein stroompje bloed uit zijn wang, die blijkbaar ookngeraakt was. 'Watndacht je nou?', schreeuwde Don Ron, terwijl er wat van diens spuugnop Caspers gezicht belandde. 'Ik gooi mijn pistool wel even naarnachteren en raap hem zo weer op? Denk je dat ik achterlijk ben?'nEen combinatie tussen een grom en zucht kwam uit de Dons mond. 'Jory,npak dat pistool op en stop hem diep weg, we willen niet dat onzenvriend hier ónze operatie verpest.' Caspernwierp Don Ron een kwade blik toe toen hij de nadruk op het woord onzenlegde. 'Bewaaknhem en hou hem onder schot tot ik zeg dat je mag stoppen, kapish?',nzei Don Ron tegen Jory, terwijl hij naar Josse toe liep. 'Janbaas!', zei Jory met een saluut. Jossenlag op zijn zij in de glasscherven, terwijl hij zachtjes snikte ennmet zijn rechtervuist druk op de schotwond hield. Don Ron pakte hemnzachtjes vast onder zijn armen en hielp hem een beetje overeindntotdat hij tegen de muur aan zat. 'Denknje dat je die kluis kan kraken?', vroeg de Don vriendelijk. 'Iknzal wel moeten hé?', zei Josse kreunend van de pijn. 'Kopnop jong, hierna breng ik je gelijk naar een vriend van me die je vanndeze pijn af zal helpen. Dus des te sneller je klaar bent met dienkluis, des te sneller je van je pijn verlost zal zijn', zei de Donnterwijl hij Josse een klapje tegen diens rechterschouder gaf met zijnnvlakke hand en een glimlach op zijn gezicht toverde. Jossenstak zijn rechterarm uit en Don Ron greep deze beet en hielp hemnovereind. Josse bukte nog even om zijn gevallen pistool op te rapennen slenterde toen achter de Don aan om de kluis te zoeken. Ondertussennwas Mr. Quack ook door het raamkozijn naar binnen gevlogen. Hij keeknom zich heen en leek zich richting de zaal waar Iris en Julie warennte begeven. Innhet kamertje van de kluis aangenomen, zagen Don Ron en Josse een opennPregex-kluis, met wat gereedschap dat er voor lag. De Don maakte eennschrikgeluid en rende gelijk op de kluis af. Hij stak zijn hoofdnerin, haalde het er vervolgens 2 seconden later weer uit ennschreeuwde: 'Michozz!nAmateurkraker, waar ben je? Ik zal die edelsteen zo hard in je oognduwen totdat je minuscule hersenen door je lege, verminkte oogkasnnaar buiten komen zetten. Waar ben je, verdomme?' Jossendeed een stapje terug. De Don had vaak tegen hen geschreeuwd, maar zonerg als dit had Josse hem nog nooit gezien. Hij had ook niet in zijnnergste nachtmerries durven dromen dat hij op een moment als dit bijnDon Ron zou zijn. Ennterwijl de Don daar hevig hijgend stond, met een gelaatsuitdrukkingndie zoveel woede uitsprak dat geen duizend woorden die zouden kunnennbeschrijven, hoorde hij een zacht geluid achter zich. Maar voordatnhij zich kon omdraaien werd er een slagersmes tegen zijn keelnaangelegd. Hij voelde de hete adem van Michozz in zijn nek en hoordendiens gegrinnik achter hem. 'Zozo',nsprak Michozz vrolijk, sadistisch genietend van het moment.n'Amateurkraker hé? Wie had er een Pregex-kluis in 11 minuutn32 open? Wie heeft jouw leven nu in zijn handen? Ik zou maar oplettennwat je zegt, manneke.' 'Watnmij betreft snij je mijn keel zo door. Als deze operatie mislukt ennik in de handen van de politie val heeft mijn leven toch geen enkeleninhoud of waarde meer voor me. Het is echt een alles ofnniets-situatie, en mocht ik met niets blijven zitten, mag het levennme ook wel ontnomen worden. Dus je dreigementen hebben hier geennwaarde, manneke', antwoordde de Don, het laatste woord met purenminachting benadrukkend. 'Stoerenpraat redt je niet van dit mes.' 'Luisternje eigenlijk wel. Ik behoef geen redding, lamlul!' Michozznwas verward. Wat moest hij nou doen. Waarom moesten die gangsters jenook altijd zo verwarren? Dood kon hij zich eraan ergeren. Duidelijkentaal was niet voor niets uitgevonden. 'Casper!',nriep hij uiteindelijk. Hij zou wel weten wat er moest gebeuren. 'Dienkomt je niet helpen. Die ligt op de grond onder bewaking van éénnvan mijn mannen. Je staat er alleen voor, knul.' Ennzo voelde Michozz zich ook: helemaal alleen op deze aardkloot. Maarnhij bleef het mes stevig op zijn plaats houden en dacht na. Ondertussennheerste er in de zaal waar Iris en Julie stonden een overweldigendenstilte. Het enige geluid dat het afgelopen kwartier had geklonken wasnde plotselinge kogel die de ruit van de deur naar achteren hadnvernietigd. Het liefst waren zowel Iris als Julie door die deurngerend om te zien of hun makkers nog wel leefden, maar dat wasnnatuurlijk uitgesloten. Beiden hoopten ze op het beste, maar vreesdennze het ergste. Toennkwam opeens door het ruitloze kozijn van de deur een oude bekende vannJulie aanzetten. Mr. Quack, die zij kende onder de naam Birdy, vloogndoor het kozijn en bleef een paar meter boven de menigte mensen in denlucht hangen en keek om zich heen. Julie keek met wijdopen ogen naarndit beest wat haar met zijn stalkersbestaan al vele griezeligenmomenten had bezorgd. En nu wist ze dat de Don erachter zat. Ze hadnhet moeten weten, alleen zo'n schoft traint zo'n beest op zo'nnmanier dat het mensen onbeschrijfelijke en gruwelijke angsten kannaanjagen. Ennop dat moment wist ze dat ze nu moest handelen. Ze vuurde een schotnop de vogel af, die rakelings miste. Mister Quack stortte zich meteennin duikvlucht op Julie en probeerde haar te pikken, maar Julie buktennet op tijd en draaide zich om en vuurde nog een kogel af. 'Iknkrijg je wel, stom rotbeest! Deze keer ontkom je me niet! Ik zal voorneens en voor altijd met je afrekenen!' Ondertussen,nachterin het postkantoor, was Casper tegen de muur aan gaan zittennterwijl Jory recht voor hem stond, zijn pistool omklemd met beidenhanden. 'Magnik wel een sigaartje opsteken?', vroeg Casper zeurderig. 'Ofnwordt dat ook al als moordwapen beschouwd?' 'Ganje gang', zei Jory. 'Maar als ik iets anders in je handen zie danneen sigaar of aansteker, los ik zonder waarschuwing een schot.' 'Maaknje geen zorgen', zei Casper relaxed terwijl hij in een paarnseconden een sigaar uit de zak van zijn vest toverde en deze binnenneen seconde had aangestoken. Ernviel even een moment van stilte, terwijl Casper steeds meer rooknverspreidde met zijn lange Oud Kampensigaar, de favoriet van hemzelfnen ook zijn zusje. Goede smaak zat blijkbaar in de familie. 'Moetenndie teringdingen nou zo vreselijk meuren?', zei Jory, die eennbeetje begon te hoesten. 'Meuren?nDit ruikt fantastisch. Hier', zei Casper en nam een zo grootnmogelijke hijs en blies deze uit richting Jory's gezicht. Toen dezendamp hier aankwam, barstte Jory uit in een vreselijke blafhoest. 'Klootzak,nik heb astma', zei Jory kwaad, terwijl hij zijn ogen toekneep, éénnhand van zijn pistool afhaalde en onophoudelijk diepe blafhoestennuitbracht. 'Nou,ndan is het vandaag zeker mijn geluksdag', grinnikte Casper, terwijlnhij zich afzette tegen de muur, onder Jory's pistool door dook watnhij tevens uit diens handen sloeg en greep zijn eigen pistool, datnJory met de loop in zijn broek had gestoken. Meteen schoot hij Jorynermee in zijn linkerbeen. Jory zakte met een schreeuw en nog steedsnhoestend op de grond in mekaar. Casper stond vervolgens op en keeknmet een glimlach naar het gruwelijke gebeuren dat hij net hadnaangericht. Zo hulpeloos lag Jory erbij, maar toch gaf Casper hemnvoor de zekerheid nog maar een stoot met zijn pistool tegen Jory'snachterhoofd, hem bewusteloos rammend. Hiernanrende hij meteen naar de kluiskamer waar hij Michozz zag staan, metneen slagersmes voor Don Rons nek. Hij liep de kamer in toen ineens denloop van een pistool dat hem al eerder bedreigd had tegen zijn slaapnwerd gedrukt. Uit zijn ooghoeken zag hij een woedende zwaar hijgendenJosse staan. Daarnstonden ze dan. Twee bedreigers en twee bedreigden, die allebei tenndode opgeschreven leken. Zowel Michozz als Josse bluften niet ennzowel Casper als Don Ron waren niet bang om te sterven. En zowel voornCasper als voor Don Ron leek er geen uitweg meer.[Chapter 7] Zo, dames en heren, dit is hem eindelijk dan: het laatste hoofdstuk, waar sommigen van jullie al lang naar hebben uitgekeken. Ik hoop dat jullie de afgelopen weken van mijn verhaal hebben genoten, ik heb er zeker wel van genoten om het te schrijven. Ik wil jullie allemaal bedanken voor het posten van de vele reviews, zowel de positieve als de negatieve. Ik was erg trots om te horen en zien dat sommige mensen zo erg van mijn amateuristische verhaaltje genoten. Ik verzoek jullie dan ook allemaal nog voor een laatste keer een review te plaatsen, met daarin wat je leuk en niet leuk aan het verhaal en wat ik volgende keer er zeker in moet houden en wat ik moet verbeteren, zo weet ik wat mijn publiek wil. Ik bedank hier geen personen in het bijzonder, hoewel ik toch zeker velen erg dankbaar ben. Degenen waarover ik spreek weten wel wie ze zijn, die hoef ik niet hier nog een keer neer te zetten, ik wil geen anderen jaloers maken. Dan nu, veel plezier met hoofdstuk 7 en ik zie jullie hopelijk weer terug bij mijn tweede verhaal, waar ik op het moment hard aan werk. Met zeer vriendelijke groet, Uw aller vrind Casper ","Summary":" Hoofdstuk 1: Het plan De stilte overheerste, zoals wel vaker in hoofdkwartieren waar illegale prakt"},{"Movie":"My Fair Lady","Title":"What if?","Author":"Oldiesbutgoldies98","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10050985","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Mine Okay, so this is my first fanfic ever, and I'm super excited! I love the story of My Fair Lady, but I was super mad with it's ending. I mean, could Eliza ever forgive him? Would Colonel Pickering come back to help her? Will Higgins ever stop being infuriating (yet good-looking)? And most importantly, will the two of them just admit they love each other?! My take on the ending, just a little one-shot, but if I get reviews can turn into a full story! I'm picturing the fabulous Julie Andrews and the delicious, perfect, talented Rex Harrison as Eliza and Henry. Rated T just in case. Oh, and of course I don't own the rights to My Fair Lady, Pygmalion, or any Greek Myths. :). \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\" Higgins said snidely, shrinking down in his chair. Eliza was hit with the brief temptation of grabbing the slippers and chasing the man down the hall using them as weapons, but she regained her composure long enough to shoot back, \"I'm not your slave anymore professor, get them yourself,\" Higgins was shocked. How dare anyone speak to him that way, let alone that worthless, ungrateful, wretched, beautiful girl. \"Beautiful?\" he muttered, \"Get a hold of yourself old man.\" Higgins stood and turned to face Eliza. There she was, holding slippers in hand, and looking ready to ram them down his throat. He couldn't help but start to laugh. When he finally regained composure, he realized Eliza did NOT find this funny. Instead, she stated coolly, \"I just came to gather my things professor, then I'm leaving.\" That wiped the smirk off of Higgins face. He had already lost her once, he couldn't stand losing her again. But, being Henry Higgins, he used his one and only defense when dealing with his feelings, being as snobby and uncaring as possible. \"Oh, of course. My apologies,\" he said sarcastically. \"By all means, go back to that idiot boy, but I don't say I didn't warn you, foolish girl. He'll leave you destitute and broken, and I won't be there to take your sniveling self back in.\" Eliza just stood there, stunned at his outburst. Henry, realizing he had just shocked her speechless, knew he had gone too far. \"Eliza...I...\" he started, but was quickly cut off by a very angry Eliza. \"If you must know, Mr. Higgins, I am NOT going off to Freddy. I realized that I never really loved him, and as much as I don't want to hurt him, I can't spend the rest of my life with him. I'm leaving, and... and...\" whatever Eliza was about to say was broken up by racking sobs. Henry couldn't believe his eyes. Eliza, strong, brave, tough, stubborn, Eliza, was crying over something he said. What was wrong with her? \"Eliza, what the devil?\" Higgins started. \"Oh don't you start on me Henry Higgins, you are the most INFURIATING... STUBBORN... STUCK UP... EGOTISTICAL man I have EVER... MET!\" Eliza sobbed, pounding each emphasized word into his chest, before finally collapsing in his arms with a sob. Henry, still supporting Eliza, had a decision to make: admit it all and risk rejection, or being his normal stubborn self. He was about to decide on the latter, when he ventured to take a look at her. Even when she was bawling her head off, she was still beautiful. His Eliza... With that, he made his decision. \"Eliza?\" He asked her, arms still tightly around her, \"you said you realized you didn't love him, was it because... Well... You love someone else?\" Eliza look up at him, her eyes full of surprise. Higgins had read her like a book. She also noticed there was something different in his eyes, something she had never seen before. It must have been his eyes that made her answer him with an honest, \"Yes professor, there is someone else.\" Henry felt elated. Of course, he didn't know if it was him yet, but at least it wasn't that horrid Freddy boy. Eliza, on the other hand, was confused. This was a whole new side to Henry Higgins, her love, that had never been expressed to her before. The man of her dreams was holding her in his arms, actually caring for once what she felt. \"Eliza, if you don't mind me asking, who... Exactly... Do you love?\" Higgins asked, his heart on his sleeve, looking more afraid than he ever had in his life. Eliza, originally taken aback by his straightforwardness, finally put two and two together. Happiness couldn't even BEGIN to describe how she felt. She was over the moon, so happy words couldn't even come to her. Reading into the silence, Henry quickly let go of her, feeling depressed. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...\" \"Wait, Henry,\" Eliza pleaded, realizing what he was probably thinking. The fact that she used his first name made him stop, and he solemnly turned back towards her. \"I think I owe you an answer,\" she said, holding her breath for his reaction. Henry registered what she just said. Holding his breath, and hoping beyond hope, he nodded his head for her to continue. Eliza took a deep breath and said, \"I love you Henry Higgins. I love your tantrums, your stubbornness, the way you chew on the end of your pen when your working. I love your laugh and your smile, I love the way you shove your hands deep within your pockets when your happy and carefree (which isn't often), but most of all, I love you for you. I always have and I always will.\" Eliza finished, closing her eyes and wishing we could just disappear. A soft, \"Eliza,\" made her open them once more, and she noticed gruff, stubborn, uncaring Henry Higgins was crying. Without pause, he quickly walked to her and threw his arms around her, and let her melt into his embrace. \"You know I'm not good with sentimental words, but I'll try.\" He said, trying to find what to say. \"Eliza... I... I don't remember when I first started to love you. I just remember being afraid. I was afraid you would never return my feelings. I was afraid you would run off and leave me for some bloke who is closer to your age. I was afraid you didn't think of me as more than just the hated professor. But most of all, I was afraid of my own feelings. See... I haven't felt... Attraction for a girl in a long time, and this was the first time I've ever really loved somebody. So this was all new to me, and I handled it in the only way I knew how, being a crotchety old man who didn't care about anything but himself. But it was all a lie. I ALWAYS cared for you, even though I never showed it. And now, if you'll let me, I will make up for all the times I shunned you, all the bullying and teasing, all of the unthought flu things I've said... Because I love you Eliza Doolittle, and I'm prepared to change myself forever if that means I get to keep you as my own...my love.\" he finished, looking at her stunned face. She shook her head in amazement. \"You always did have a way with words,\" she muttered into his chest. Feeling braver now, he stepped away from her, still holding her hands in his. \"I'm not done yet,\" he said moving over to his desk. He rummaged through the drawer ad pulled out a small box. \"I have one more speech to make,\" he said going back to Eliza. \"You, by coming back today, made me the happiest man alive. But, I can't run the risk of you leaving me again, it would be the death of me. I know that people will talk, I know about the age difference, I know about all the quarrels and arguments and put downs, but I don't care because I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you. So, will you make me the happiest AND luckiest man alive and become Mrs. Eliza Higgins?\" He asked, getting down on one knee and holding out the ring. Eliza was in a stupor, she, for the second time that day, did not have the words to express how happy she felt. Instead she settled on bursting into tears and nodding her head in a fervent yes, while flinging herself into Henry's arms. Henry laughed, and picked her up, spinning her around until they both got dizzy. When he set her down, he pulled her into a long kiss. When they finally broke apart, Eliza smiled and played with his collar. \"Who am I going to have to pay around here to get you to do THAT everyday?\" He asked teasingly. \"Keep it up woman, and I'll lock you up in here and be forced to have my way with you,\" he growled, pulling her in for another kiss. They spent the rest of the day in his study, kissing each other with abandon, making preparations for the wedding, and preparing to take on whatever life throws at them... Together. Well, there you have it. If you want more please rate and review! I also take requests.[Chapter 2] Hey all! I was rereading this the other day, and I decided that maybe adding another chapter or two wouldn't hurt. Thanks to sash queen of the jungle for the idea! \"'Enry 'Iggins! You get in 'ere right now!\" A voice called out loudly. Professor Henry Higgins flinched, knowing that when his new wife resorted to her old cockney accent, something must be the matter. They had been married for only a week, and currently they were on their honeymoon in Italy. Henry grinned as he recalled that moment when he had revealed the honeymoon destination to his then bride to be. It had been a spectacle to say the least! Sighing, he went into the bedroom suite, where a beautiful yet stern Eliza sat holding a piece of paper. \"Yes dear?\" He asked innocently. Eliza waved the piece of paper about. \"And just WHAT is the meaning of... This?\" She crowed. Henry blanched and grabbed the piece of paper quickly. \"That?\" He said coolly. Eliza glared at him. \"Yes you daft bugger...that,\" she answered. For a moment Henry fought the urge to laugh at his irate wife calling him a bugger, but thought better of it. He looked at the offending object with a small amount of guilt. \"You promised me you wouldn't work over the honeymoon,\" Eliza said quietly. Henry allowed himself a fleeting glance at his wife. She wasn't crying, which was definitely a good sign. But she was upset, and angry...very angry. Henry knew he had to choose his words very carefully. Trying to look as guilty and handsome as possible, he fixed Eliza with what only could be described as a \"puppy dog look.\" Shifting from foot to foot, and quickly casting his eyes downward, Henry took a deep breath. \"Eliza... I know I promised. I didn't mean to break that promise, I swear. It's just that... The Italians have such an interesting dialect, and they speak with such an interesting accent, and as a dialectician it would be a crime not to at least write down a few notes. I knew you wouldn't understand, which is why...\" Henry stopped mid sentence, clapping his hand over his mouth and looking up at the sky in disbelief. Eliza turned an interesting shade of red. Then, she began to do what Henry Higgins never expected. She began to laugh. When she noticed the gob smacked look on her husband's face, she laughed even harder. Henry's look of incredulous shock quickly turned into an indignant one when Eliza failed to stop laughing. \"I say woman! Control yourself!\" He commanded, trying to regain his dignity. Eliza let out a few more chortles before catching her breath. \"I am sorry Henry, but you should have seen your face!\" She giggled, wiping away tears of mirth. \"I had planned on being very cross with you, but when I saw your shell shocked expression when you saw the paper, I knew this was going to be good. I have to admit, you were very good at looking repentant, and you started off doing well too, but at the end, oh the end...\" She said, choking back more laughter. \"At the end... Your face... You looked like you had just been shot...oh God!\" She spat out, succumbing to her laughter once again. Henry gave her a look of sheer outrage. \"You mean to tell me I humiliated myself for a simple gag?\" He shouted. Eliza rolled her eyes. \"Stop being so dramatic Henry. And I was a little cross with you. After all, you DID promise not to work on our honeymoon,\" she said. Henry opened his mouth, but words failed him. Finally, he saw slight humor in the situation and began to laugh too. When they both finally caught their breaths, Henry put a tentative arm around his wife's shoulders. \"I truly am sorry Eliza. I won't do it again,\" he added sincerely. Eliza looked into his eyes, seeing that rare and beautiful sparkle she had come to treasure. \"I know,\" she said softly, before pressing a kiss to his forehead. Henry bent down and captured her lips with his. When they pulled apart, he looked straight into her eyes. \"I truly love you Mrs. Eliza Higgins,\" he said gently. Before Eliza had time to respond, Henry was kissing her again. \"You know? You really are stunning when you laugh,\" Henry murmured into her hair. Eliza pushed back gently on his chest, and they laid down on the bed, Eliza hugged tightly to Henry's chest. Reaching up to caress his cheek, she whispered, \"And you are most handsome when you smile.\" Henry shook his head. \"You just say that so I'll smile more often, I know you,\" he teased. Eliza laughed, kissing his chin. \"Come off it you old bugger, stop fishin' for 'em,\" she joked. Henry chuckled softly, before closing his eyes. Yes, they had been on a VERY interesting journey, but he definitely liked the outcome. Well that's chapter 2. Please review![Chapter 3] Hello all, I decided to take a swing at another chapter. Hope you like it! \"I will NOT!\" a little voice yelled out, jolting Henry Higgins from his work. \"Oh yes you will young man!\" A female voice yelled back. Henry sat back in his chair laughing, wondering what kind of trouble his son was causing now. James David Higgins was the spitting image of his father, both in looks and personality. Henry had taken it upon himself to begin educating the boy from the time he was a newborn, reading him Keats and Shakespeare before he was old enough to talk. Now, at age six, Henry had virtually turned his son into his own personal mini-me, something that both amused and horrified his wife to no end. Henry barely had time to blink before the little boy came stumbling into his office and running into his arms. \"Don't let her make me daddy, I don't want to!\" The little boy whined, prompting Henry's amused smirk to grow even wider. \"Now then James, what is it exactly that you're mother wants you to do?\" Henry asked. James took a step back from his father, and Henry kneeled down in order to look him in the eye. The little tyke was wearing a button up shirt (that wasn't buttoned) and a checkered sweater (that was inside out). Henry raised an eyebrow at his son's disheveled appearance, giving him a quizzical look. \"I say lad, you're a downright mess! Now, what is it exactly your mother has you all dressed up for?\" Henry asked his son, who was fixing him with a gaze that could have been seen on a kicked puppy. Before the boy had time to answer, a very irate and red faced Eliza Higgins appeared at the door, fixing the young child with a dagger like glare, one that was generally reserved for her husband. \"James David Higgins... You stop running to your father every time you don't want to do something!\" Eliza exclaimed, turning the glare onto her husband when he started to laugh. \"And you! You don't turn into a puddle of mush every time that boy runs in here with that puppy look on his face! God knows I have enough trouble dealing with one Higgins, two is absolute murder!\" She huffed, crossing her arms and looking quite exasperated. Henry tried to look apologetic and then fixed a stern gaze on his son. \"Now James... What does your mother want you to do?\" He asked. James let an indignant look cross his face before looking at his father with those puppy dog eyes. \"She wants me to sing in the church choir... Daddy, Higgins's don't sing, especially in public!\" James exclaimed, turning back towards his mother with a look of defiance. Henry turned toward Eliza, his eyebrows raised. \"You want OUR son to sing in the church choir?\" He squeaked out, looking almost as indignant as his son. Eliza shot him a look of death. \"Yes... I want him to sing. He has a lovely voice, and bloody 'ell 'Iggins, you oughta take my side you should!\" Eliza shrieked. Henry winced, well aware that when his wife slipped into her cockney accent, he was in deep trouble. \"Not in front of the boy,\" he chastised, motioning towards his son. \"Mommy swore... And she's talking funny again,\" James added, causing his mother to turn a darker shade of red. Henry knew he had to quickly intervene, realizing his wife' s infamous temper was about to rear its' head. Bending down to face his son, Henry put a hand on his shoulder and gave his boy a pleading look. \"Now James, I know you don't want to sing, trust me, I understand. But could you please do this one time, for both your mother AND me? You do have a nice voice, and even though this isn't something us Higgins men do, sometimes we have to make sacrifices,\" Henry finished, hoping the boy would understand his not so subtle message. \"EXCUSE me?\" He heard his wife squawk. Shoulders hunching, Henry bent down, whispering so only James could hear. \"Please son, for me. For the sake of my sanity and health just sing this one time...\" He begged. With serious eyes James nodded, understanding that his father needed his help. \"Alright Daddy, for you,\" James sighed. Henry gave him a satisfied smile ad patted him on the back. \"Good lad, now finish getting dressed,\" Henry commanded, sending his son out towards the door. When the boy got to his mother, he tried one last plea to get out of the task at hand. \"Mommy... If daddy doesn't sing, why do I have to?\" The boy asked, much to Henry's amusement. Rather than let his wife answer the question, Henry jumped in. \"Well son, because I'm an adult, so I don't have to. Also, just because I do not sing, does not mean you can't,\" Henry added. Hearing his wife snort, he shot her a warning glance. James looked between his two parents, obviously confused. Before Henry knew what was happening, his wife turned to her son, a wicked smile on her face.\"Don't let daddy fool you. He actually sings quite a bit...IN PUBLIC!\" She crowed, smirking at her husband's squeak in protest. \"He does?\" James asked, eyes wide. Eliza nodded, noting Henry's growing panic. \"Oh yes, as a matter a fact, the first time I met him was when he was singing,\" she added. \"Eliza...\" Henry pleaded, not liking where this conversation was headed. \"What did he sing mommy?\" Asked James, very interested in this newfound information about his father. Eliza almost told him, but faltered when she saw Henry's pained expression. They had never really told their son the story of how they met and fell in love, and although Eliza was certainly enjoying torturing her husband, she never wanted to tarnish the image of the man that James knew. The old Henry Higgins, the one that had sung that horribly insulting song that day when she was selling flowers... He had been gone for years. \"I don't remember sweetheart,\" she answered, smiling at the man behind her. Henry visibly relaxed, his eyes sending her a silent thank you and a, \"We have things to discuss later\" look. Eliza nodded and turned back to her son. \"He also sang with me and Uncle Pickering back when we first started to get to know each other, and again when he and I had... A little argument,\" she finished, not wanting to explain that whole ordeal to her son. James turned on his father accusatorially. \"Is this true Daddy? You do sing?\" He asked. Henry shifted uncomfortably. \"Well I... I mean... That is to say I... Yes,\" Henry sighed, realizing there was no use in denying it. James's eyes filled with tears. \"Sweetheart, what's wrong?\" Eliza asked, perplexed. \"I don't want to sing! Even though daddy sings, he's ashamed to. He didn't want to admit it to me, and when he did, he was ashamed. If I sing, he'll be ashamed of me too!\" James sobbed, crying into his mother's dress. Horrified, Henry crossed over to his son, taking the boy in his arms. \"No James! I would never be ashamed of you! Not for anything, least of all singing. The reason I don't admit I sing is because...well... Singing is full of emotion, an expression of feelings. I've never really been good at that, I've always been afraid to show how I truly feel. Meeting your mother... It changed all that. James, singing is the most wonderful thing you can do. You have such a big heart, and are ready to share it with everyone. Expressing that love and joy through song is a gift, one that no one should ever be ashamed of. The reason I was so uncomfortable was that... Those times I sang that your mother mentioned, I was singing for the wrong reasons. But now that I have her, and I have you, I can sing for the right reasons again. Do you understand?\" Henry asked softly, a smile splitting his face when his son looked at him, wiping the tears off of his face. \"Yes daddy, I do. So it's okay to sing?\" James asked. Henry nodded, kissing his son on the forehead. \"Of course it is my boy, and I'm sorry that I upset you. Singing is always okay around this house... As long as it isn't early in the morning,\" he added quickly, prompting a laugh from his son. As James disappeared up the stairs to finish getting ready, Henry stood up to find his wife in tears as well. \"What's...\" Was all Henry managed to get out, before his wife grabbed him by his tie and kissed him senseless. \"That was the sweetest thing I have ever heard. God I love you Henry Higgins!\" She gasped out once the broke apart. Henry smiled and wrapped his arms around his wife. \"Eliza...\" He started, worry in his voice, but she placed a finger to his lips. \"I know Henry. You have nothing to apologize for, it happened years ago. That Higgins is gone, if your little speech was any indication,\" she affirmed. Henry kissed her again, marveling at how he landed this amazing woman as his wife. \"I love you,\" he whispered, not wanting her to forget. \"And I you,\" she answered. \"Now, let's go get your son ready,\" she demanded, prompting a silly salute from her husband. \"Yes madam!\" He joked, and promptly offered his arm to his wife. The two made their way up the stairs towards their child, realizing that life could not be better. Well there it is. Thanks for the request, please review![Chapter 4] Hey all! I decided to continue this story yet again. I'm not sure if there's anyone out there still reading it, but if there is then I'm sorry it's taken me so long. Just a couple of quick notes; I was a little torn on what to do about Eliza and Henry's ages. I'm basing my Henry solely on Rex Harrison's brilliant portrayal of course, but my Eliza is a combination of Julie Andrews and Audrey Heburn's versions. Obviously Henry Higgins and Eliza have an age gap, and I also wanted them to have two children (yes...James is going to have a younger sibling). So, if you'll forgive a bit of creative license here, I'm going to have Henry be in his mid to late 40's, even though Rex Harrison was definitely past that by the time the movie rolled around (but hey he still looked pretty dang good, and could have passed for late forties I believe, even though I'm a bit biased), and have Eliza be in her late twenties/very early thirties. You'll be informed of exact ages if I decide on them. Also, in terms of the year, the show itself takes place around 1912, so considering little James is around 9 here I'm going to make the year 1923, with Eliza and Henry having gotten married in 1913. One final thing, I cannot for the life of me truly discern whether Rex Harrison's eyes were brown or blue due to black and white images being colorized and conflicting sources and so on. So based on the My Fair Lady promo shots in color I've examined and countless movie viewings and popular public opinion I'm going with brown. And Eliza will definitely be based on Audrey in appearance because I feel that fits the couple well. So, with all that business out of the way, here's another chapter! Hope you enjoy! \"Eliza...Eliza...Eliiiizzzzaaaa...\" Henry Higgins whispered softly, kissing his wife on the forehead each time he called her name. Eliza Higgins blearily rubbed her eyes and sat up slowly, raising a sleepy eyebrow in confusion. \"Henry? Wha...?\" She murmured, glancing over at the clock hurriedly. Seeing it was 2:30 in the morning, she shot her husband a murderous glare. \"Henry...what on earth do you want?\" She muttered crossly, waiting for him to explain himself. \"I'm sorry for waking you darling...but you may want to come see this,\" he said softly, rising from the bed as holding out his hand to her. Eliza looked at him for a long moment before taking his hand, slipping into her robe and following him down the stairs as quietly as she could. They made their way towards Henry's study, the door slightly askance. Henry raised a finger to his lips and pointed through the crack in the door, motioning for Eliza to take a look. Shooting him a quizzical glance, Eliza walked towards the doorway and pressed her face to the crack. What she saw made her heart melt into a pile of mush. There sat her nine year old son James, holding his two year old sister Rose in his lap, reading Keats's poetry to her as she gazed at the lights on a small Christmas Tree in front of her. James would occasionally stop his reading to take hold of Rose's hand as she reached out for one of the carefully placed ornaments, reminding her gently not to touch them. \"Now Rose, listen carefully...I know you don't understand any of this yet but it's important for you to pay attention to it now, so you can grow up to be as smart as mother and father one day,\" James said gently, smiling when his sister reached up for his glasses with a toothy grin. \"O..Kay, Jimmy,\" Rose giggled, using her pet name for her brother. James laughed and placed the book in front of her, continuing to read softly. \"Oh Henry...\" Eliza breathed, wiping away the tears that had formed in her eyes. She turned to her husband, who had tears in his eyes as well. Wrapping his arms around her waist, Henry kissed the top of her forehead gently before bending down to peer through the crack again. The two watched their children for an hour, before little Rose finally fell asleep. James was beginning to nod off as well, his glasses slipping down his nose. Henry emitted a warm chuckle, slowly opening the door and striding in towards his son. Eliza followed suit, a loving smile spreading across her face as her son turned towards his parents sleepily. \"James my boy...what are you doing up in the middle of the night?\" Henry asked softly, careful not to wake up his daughter. James looked at his parents warily, unsure as to whether or not he was in trouble. \"I'm sorry father, I didn't mean to be up. Rose started crying earlier, and I didn't want her to wake you both up. I went into her room to quiet her but she wouldn't stop, so I brought her down here to read to her, just like you used to do when I was upset,\" James explained, looking up at his parents with bleary eyes. Henry glanced over at his wife quickly, a grin on his face. Both parent's faces radiated pure joy and love towards their two children. Henry couldn't be more proud of his son's intelligence and his daughter's eagerness to learn. Eliza was proud of James's gentleness with his sister and Rose's carefree smile that seemed to make the world a brighter place. Yes, they couldn't be happier with the way their two children were turning out...and it was nice to have this sort of reminder now and then. \"Thank you James, that was very thoughtful of you. I'm sure your sister appreciated it very much as well,\" Eliza chimed in. James beamed at his mother, his tired eyes sparkling with relief that he was not in trouble for being up past his bedtime. He turned to his father, who shot him a wink and a quick smile. James winked back, before stifling a rather large yawn. \"Alright James, I think you've been relieved of babysitting duty for tonight, off to bed now,\" Henry said softly, gently picking up Rose and allowing James to stand up. James nodded and began to walk, taking teetering steps towards the stairs before promptly running into the side of an armchair and collapsing to the floor. Both Henry and Eliza held back laughter as their son turned around sheepishly, glancing between the chair and the floor. \"My tired baby...\" Eliza cooed, picking James up and holding him tightly. He was asleep instantly, his soft snores reverberating throughout the room. Both Henry and Eliza tucked the two children in their arms back into bed before heading back into Henry's study. They were silent for a minute, before Henry walked over to the Keats anthology on the floor and placed it tenderly back on the shelf. \"I know what to get little Rose for Christmas now,\" Henry joked, getting a small smirk from Eliza. \"You mean to tell me, Henry Higgins, that you still haven't purchased a Christmas present for your daughter when the holiday itself is only two days away?\" Eliza asked, getting a teasing grin and a shrug from her husband. \"Well, I know what ELSE I can get Rose for Christmas at any rate,\" he returned, getting a laugh from his wife. Looking at her fondly, Henry walked over to the gramophone and pulled out a recording of one of his favorite classical waltzes, pausing for a moment as the sound of sweet strings filled the air. Closing the study door so the noise didn't wake the children, Henry walked up to Eliza, holding out his hand. \"Dance with me?\" He whispered, wrapping an arm around her waist. Eliza nodded as the two began to waltz, gliding across the floor as if they were floating on air. Eliza closed her eyes and for a minute could imagine Henry in a coat and tails, spinning her around with a proud fire in his eyes at the Embassy Ball, with Eliza in her beautiful gown, the envy of all. Of course, everything had gone straight to hell after that, but in that once instance, Eliza had felt like the most exquisite creature in the world, just because she was in Henry's arms. Going back even further, she could see Henry sweeping her up for a brief tango after she had finally pronounced that bloody \"rain in Spain stayed mainly in the plain\" correctly. That was the moment that she had fallen in love with Henry Higgins, seeing past the cold exterior he put on for the world and into the man with a warm smile and a fire in his eyes. That was the man she married, the one she had two children with, the one she fell asleep with every night and woke up next to each morning, the one she laughed and cried with, that was the man she loved. \"What are you thinking about darling?\" Henry whispered into her ear as he swayed her to the music. Eliza smiled and moved her hand from his shoulder long enough to brush a stray strand of greying hair that had been swept into his face. \"Just how wonderful of a dancer you are my love,\" she said lightly, earning a small blush from her husband and a boyish grin, his light brown eyes glistening with love for her. Eliza's dark brown eyes glistened right back, her expression unabashedly fond as she took in the man holding her in his arms. Yes, he still had an egotistical streak about him. Yes, he was still occasionally stubborn and outspoken and vain. Yes, he could still be a curmudgeon with an ill temper who was prone to shouting rather than engaging in civil conversation. Yes, he still could be the most infuriating man Eliza Doolittle Higgins had ever met and knew how to press her buttons most of all. Eliza knew that all these tendencies had mellowed in their years together, in no small part owed to the two young children that had completely melted his heart. But even if they hadn't, Eliza knew that it wouldn't have really mattered...she would have loved him unconditionally just the same. He was her Professor Henry Higgins, and, despite his many flaws and varying strengths Eliza was truly certain after ten years that the one thing she never had to doubt was his unwavering love for her as well. \"I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night, and still have begged for more...\" Henry sang quietly, a grin on his face as he remained completely oblivious to his wife's inner musings. The familiar tune shook Eliza immediately out of her reverie and she stood utterly still, glancing at her husband in shock. \"Henry Reginald Jerome Higgins how on EARTH do you know that song?\" Eliza exclaimed, releasing her hold on the handsome Professor and taking a step back, her expression a mix of incredulity and embarrassment. \"No need for middle names to be thrown out dearest,\" Henry responded, his tone rather gleeful as he relished a very rare upper hand over his flabbergasted wife. \"Henry...\" Eliza warned, the squeak in her voice preventing her from being truly intimidating. Henry let out a small chuckle, completely unable to help himself, causing Eliza to glare at him. \"Well darling, if you recall my room happened to be not too far away from yours. As you know, noise does tend to carry in this house if doors aren't shut properly and voices are not lowered,\" Henry started, a smirk appearing on his face when he recalled a particular incident shortly after their honeymoon involving him, his new bride, a half opened door, and a thoroughly embarrassed Colonel Pickering. \"Yes...\" Eliza drawled, noticing his smirk and blushing even further, having ventured a guess as to what event her husband's mind had turned to. \"Anyhow...I was preparing myself for bed when I heard a rather loud and boisterous voice singing joyously down the hall. I knew for a fact it wasn't I or dear Pick, and Ms. Pearce would have found such activity completely inappropriate, particularly for that late hour. So naturally I surmised it was you. For someone who had just learned to speak properly you had a rather splendid singing voice by the way,\" Henry prattled on, earned a raised eyebrow from his wife in return. \"Well, I decided to have a listen...not that I had much of a choice mind you. You were singing loud enough for the whole house to hear as clear as a bell. Goodness knows you were already excitable, and the tone and volume of your voice only cemented that fact. I heard every word that night, and it's been stored in the back of my mind ever since,\" Henry finished, his grin impossibly smug as he teased his wife further. Eliza's expression caused him to burst out laughing; she was absolutely floored, and looked more than a little mortified. \"Oh do shut up 'Enry,\" Eliza retorted, her old accent reappearing in her flustered state. This only made Henry laugh harder, making him resort to clapping a hand over his mouth in an attempt to control himself. \"Charming song really,\" Henry attempted, before bursting into laughter once again at his wife's completely red face. He knew he was being a bit cruel, particularly given the extremely tender moment they had been sharing mere minutes before, but he truly couldn't help himself, especially knowing that his wife had plenty of arsenal at her disposal to use at any given time. \"Henry Higgins do you mean to tell me that you've been sitting on this for ten years?\" Eliza spluttered out, her mortification mixing slightly with amusement at her husband's obvious joy with his triumph. \"What can I say my dear? The opportunity just presented itself perfectly tonight,\" Henry responded, still chuckling as his brown eyes shone with mirth. After a moment or two, Eliza's embarrassment gave away to sheer amusement at her ridiculous husband and his antics, causing her to break into a fit of giggles as well. \"You are truly a devil Henry Higgins, embarrassing your poor wife like that after ten years,\" Eliza chuckled, wiping the tears of mirth from her eyes. \"Yes I am a devil, but you knew that when you married me,\" Higgins retorted, a smirk on his face as he winked at his wife. Eliza rolled her eyes, not content to let Henry fully win the battle of wits. \"God only knows what clouded my judgement there,\" Eliza shot back, her tone sarcastic and playful. Henry grinned at her, before his expression softened somewhat. \"Yes, God only knows,\" Henry said softly, a small lump in his throat forming as he thought about the true miracle he had been rewarded that devastating day over eleven years prior, when Eliza had returned to him and given him a chance to start again. Eliza noticed the change in his expression and smiled, stepping a little closer to him and cupping his cheek gently. \"You are a devil... but I love you anyways,\" Eliza teased softly, getting a small snort from her husband, who removed her hand from his cheek to press a kiss to her palm. \"Thank heavens for that,\" he mumbled gratefully. Eliza moved away from him and sat down on the couch, gesturing for Henry to join her. He strode over and sat beside her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and propping his feet up on the ottoman as she snuggled into his chest. \"I'm still rather embarrassed that you heard my little...outburst that evening. I can only imagine what you must have thought,\" Eliza murmured after a moment her eyes closed as she felt the steady rise and fall of Henry's chest. \"Well, to be perfectly honest...I can't say I really thought much of it at the time. I wasn't quite sure what had excited you so. I thought the work had gone to your head a bit. In my self-obsessed foolishness and overall ignorance I never stopped to consider what or who it was you were actually singing about; I merely dismissed it as overexcited ramblings,\" Henry admitted, his tone becoming sheepish and slightly horrified as he recalled his attitude at the time. Eliza heard the disgust in his voice, and she shifted in his embrace to look at him properly. \"I'm actually surprised you remembered any of the words at all. It must have been so terribly unimportant to you at the time,\" Eliza continued lightly. She had meant it in jest, but Henry winced just the same, prompting Eliza to place a soothing hand on his chest. \"Eliza I'm...\" Henry started, but Eliza just placed a finger to his lips. \"Henry, I do wish you'd stop apologizing...after eleven years it's highly unnecessary. You are not perfect, but you are good man, a wonderful father, and the only man I could ever love. I'm not excusing what you did, but you made amends for it and then some a long time ago. You are not the same man Henry Higgins, you know this, I know this, Hugh Pickering knows this, and your mother knows this. I don't need you apologizing for the rest of our lives,\" Eliza said firmly, gazing deeply into Henry's eyes. \"I know my love. It's just... I haven't forgiven that man yet for all he did to you,\" Henry said softly, his voice thick with emotion. Eliza gazed at him for a moment, a rather helpless expression on her face. While most mentions of their rather turbulent beginnings were treated as an old party tale, a trip down memory lane, or a joke, there were still the occasions where Henry seemed haunted by the ghost of his actions, long after Eliza had forgiven him time and time again. There were still moments where Eliza could catch the disbelief and guilt in his eyes, as if he couldn't quite fathom why she had chosen to remain with him, to marry him, to bear his children, and how he came to be deserving of such a fate after all the hurt that he had caused her. Practically from the moment they were married Henry had set about righting those wrongs, but no matter how many times Eliza had told him and shown him that the past was merely the past, he still couldn't ever fully free himself from his own disgust with the man he used to be. While those moments had become rarer over time, Eliza knew that she would still occasionally need to help mend her husband's self-inflicted wounds by reassuring him all was truly forgiven. \"Would you like to know something? Something I never told you about that night?\" Eliza asked softly, reaching up to stroke Henry's soft brown hair, causing Henry to glance over at her quizzically, the guilt slowly ebbing off of his face. \"What might that be?\" Henry asked, a smile on his face as he felt Eliza's fingers carding through his hair. \"I'll give you a hint first; I only know when he began to dance with me, I could have danced, danced, danced all night,\" Eliza sang softly, her voice barely above a whisper. \"You, erm...you were excited to dance with me? You had never danced with a man before? You had never danced?\" Henry guessed, each one earning him a small eye roll from his wife. \"For such an intelligent man you truly are an idiot Henry Higgins,\" Eliza teased, causing her husband to shoot her a somewhat sour look. \"What then?\" Henry prodded, now quite curious. Eliza smiled and intertwined her fingers with his, before resting their joined hands against his chest, directly about his heart. \"That night was the night that I fell completely and utterly in love you,\" Eliza answered, her smile widening as she saw the surprise appear on Henry's face. He stared at her for a moment, his eyebrows raising in shock as her words sunk in. \"But...but I had been an absolute brute to you leading up to that evening, and I daresay I was even worse afterwards,\" Henry muttered, unable to believe that his beloved wife had truly fallen in love with him that early on. \"That was the first night that I saw you truly smile. You, the dear Colonel, and I were prancing about like utter fools. It was the first time I had seen you as a man rather than as the dreaded professor. When you swept me up in your arms to dance with me, the look on your face was burned permanently into my memory. You were so joyous, so proud, so passionate...and I can't even begin to describe the sparkle in your eyes. I looked at that face and realized that was the face of a man I could fall in love with, and fall I did,\" Eliza answered, her tone dreamlike as she recalled that evening. \"Eliza...\" Henry started, but the lump forming in his throat prevented him from saying anything else. Eliza took notice and smiled at him, fiddling absentmindedly with the plain gold band on his finger. \"Of course, at the time I thought it was just the excitement of the moment. I saw it as a temporary infatuation borne out of a mutual sense of accomplishment. But I couldn't seem to shake that look in your eyes out of my head, not even in the moments I was most angry at you. When...when I left you at your mothers, I knew almost instantly that I wouldn't be able to keep my word of never seeing you again. As I walked down the street all I could see was that look in your eyes, that fire, and I knew I would never feel truly...truly whole again if I didn't see that look one more time. It was then I realized that I had fallen in love with you that evening. It was then I knew that I couldn't leave you, not without giving it one more go,\" Eliza said gently, reaching up to wipe a stray tear away from Henry's cheek. \"I...I love you Eliza,\" Henry managed to choke out, finding his emotions too overwhelming to chance saying anything more. \"And I love you Henry Higgins,\" Eliza responded softly, before placing a tender kiss to her husband's lips. Henry pulled her closer to him, his hands finding their way into her long dark hair as the kiss deepened. When they finally broke apart, Eliza rested her head on Henry's chest, her eyes closing with a contented sigh. \"Should we return to our room?\" Henry asked, noticing his wife yawning as she splayed her elegant fingers across the fabric of his evening robe. \"I'd rather not move...if that's alright with you,\" Eliza answered sleepily, her breathing already slowing as she began to drift off to sleep. \"It's more than alright,\" Henry mumbled, chuckling when he heard his wife let out a soft snore in response. Henry pressed a gentle kiss to his wife's forehead before gazing at her sleeping form, his heart bursting with love as he gazed at the woman he called his own. \"I could have danced all night too my dear Eliza. Thank you for choosing to continue to dance with me, now and forever,\" Henry whispered quietly, before closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep. Well there you have it! Hopefully the proper amount of fluff after such a long absence. Also, I felt that having two middle names just suited Henry. Hopefully I'll be posting another chapter soon...or at least sooner than last time. If there's continued interest in this story then I'll introduce some more familiar faces into these chapters sometime soon, along with some shenanigans courtesy of James and Rose (and if we're being honest, Henry too). Hope you enjoyed the chapter![Chapter 5] Hey all! Here's another chapter for you! This chapter will see more familiar faces make an appearance, as promised. It's 1924 in terms of the year now, but takes place shortly after the last chapter which was set around Christmas time. I've also decided, after seeing the recent revival of My Fair Lady on Broadway, that I do actually like the idea of Henry and Eliza being a little closer in age (the revival is absolutely brilliant; Lauren Ambrose is fabulous and Harry Hadden Paton is superb and utterly adorable). So, now with Rex/Harry and Audrey/Julie in mind for these portrayals I've decided Eliza will be 35 and Henry will be 44, so they are about 9 years apart. I know that's a closer age gap, but I honestly feel like it fits with these characters. Also, I've decided on Eleanor as a first name for Mrs. Higgins, and there might be a few Pickering/Mrs. Higgins moments in this chapter as well. Hope you enjoy! \"Confound it all! Where did I put my...? I could have sworn I had it in this...\" Henry Higgins muttered, tearing through the drawers of a dresser in his room, throwing his clothes unceremoniously all over the floor as he did so. \"May I ask why our room looks like it's been shelled?\" Eliza quipped, entering the room with a teasing smile on her face. Henry growled slightly, his greying brown hair falling into his eyes as he continued to dig through the drawer. \"Where the devil are my...\" Henry started, before Eliza quickly interrupted him. \"Slippers?\" Eliza crowed, the joy evident in her voice at the opportunity to tease her husband mercilessly. Her retort graced her with a glare from Henry, who stopped his frantic search abruptly in order to stare his smirking wife down. \"Very amusing. Now, what have you done with my black tie and my new dressing gown? I've searched high and low for them,\" Henry grumbled, pointing at his wife accusatorially. Eliza raised an eyebrow at him before sauntering over towards the bathroom door, grabbing a long piece of black fabric draping over the handle. \"You mean this black tie that's been in this same spot since you wore it last week?\" Eliza asked nonchalantly, causing Henry to gape at her slightly, a sheepish expression starting to form on his face. Eliza placed the in a medium sized luggage trunk filled with Henry's clothing. \"And the dressing gown?\" Henry asked feebly, before noticing a folded garment draped over his wife's arm. \"It was down in the study. You draped it over your chair two nights ago and forgot to bring it back upstairs,\" Eliza said, her tone playfully exasperated as she set the patterned dressing gown in the trunk as well. \"I draped it over the chair? If I seem to recall, two nights ago that dressing gown was ripped off of me and THROWN onto my chair by YOU in your haste to...\" Higgins retorted, unwilling to come out the complete fool in this scenario. \"REGARDLESS...you need to hurry up and finish packing. Your mother will be here any moment, and the house will descend into chaos the second Rose and James see their grandmother,\" Eliza said quickly, cutting Henry off. \"And where my mother is, Pick is bound to follow,\" Higgins mumbled, busying himself with placing his clothes back in the drawer. \"Honestly, they've been courting for nearly five years now. When do you think Hugh will propose?\" Eliza asked, sighing as she thought of the kindly colonel and her mother in law. \"How the devil should I know? Pick is absolutely smitten with her, and my mother won't stop blathering on about him. You'd think they would have tied the knot already, but Pick went on about some nonsensical notion of a true courtship and finding the proper moment to propose and whatnot. He wants it to be some grand romantic affair...the perfect moment\" Higgins said flatly, his mind preoccupied with shoving the remaining clothes in the drawer unfolded. \"As most proposals are intended to be,\" Eliza replied, causing Henry to look up at her with raised eyebrows. \"Do I detect a complaint?\" Henry asked, a look of indignation crossing his face as his wife smirked at him. \"No dear...it's just that I had forgotten you are incapable of romance unless you are under duress,\" Eliza retorted, the smirk growing wider as Henry rose from his crouched position by the dresser and sauntered over to his wife. \"And I suppose this month long vacation to Paris we are about to embark on...just the two of us alone, without children or work or a household full of people, as a second honeymoon of sorts is an example of my incapability in concern to romance?\" Henry teased, his voice low as he stepped closer to his wife. Eliza felt the blush forming on her cheeks as Henry gazed at her; even after ten years he still could reduce her to a shy schoolgirl with his intense brown eyes. However, she quickly recovered and met his gaze, the smirk never faltering on her face. \"Well I suppose you have your moments,\" Eliza sighed, her smirk molding into a grin as Henry wrapped his arms around her waist. \"I suppose two nights ago in the study wasn't considered romantic either? Or two weeks ago when I surprised you with tickets to the ballet? Or my evening ritual of reading to you before we go to bed? Or...\" Higgins continued, pulling Eliza closer to him. \"I still think Hugh has you beat,\" Eliza teased, laughing at the sour face she received in return. Gently, Henry leaned in to kiss her, his hands clasped firmly around her waist as she deepened the kiss. Eliza tangled her fingers through Henry's thick brown hair, letting out a small sigh as she parted her lips to allow Henry more access. The pair finally broke apart, with Henry leaning his forehead against hers as they both caught their breath. \"How about now?\" Henry asked cheekily, his eyes ablaze with love and desire as he gazed at his beautiful wife. Eliza smiled and cupped his cheek, her brown eyes radiating with joy as she placed a hand on his chest. \"Hmm...you seem to be on the right track,\" Eliza responded, prompting Henry to chuckle softly. \"In that case I'd best keep going then,\" Henry quipped, promptly kissing her again. The two of them were so invested in one another that they didn't hear the knock on their half-open bedroom door, or notice Mrs. Higgins standing there watching the couple with a fond smile on her face. \"I see the second honeymoon has started early,\" Mrs. Higgins called out, prompting the pair to spring apart suddenly. \"Mother? What the bloody hell do you...\" Henry started, both embarrassed and irritated at being interrupted. \"Oh Mrs. Higgins! We didn't hear you come in! How good to see you!\" Eliza interrupted, hurrying over to her mother in law and pulling her into an embrace. \"My dear, I've been telling you to call me Eleanor for years now. This Mrs. Higgins business has no place amongst family,\" Eleanor Higgins chided gently, earning a smile from Eliza. Henry strode over to his mother and kissed her cheek, noticing his two children running rapidly into view behind her. \"Mother! Father! Grandmother is here!\" James called out excitedly, causing Eliza to stifle a laugh at her young son. \"Thank you for the advanced notice my boy,\" Henry teased, gesturing to his mother. James shrugged sheepishly, before running into his grandmother's arms for another hug. \"Mama! Mama! It's Gramma!\" Rose burst out happily, toddling over to her mother and wrapping her arms around Eliza's legs. \"Yes Rose. GRANDMA is here,\" Higgins corrected, prompting Eliza to roll her eyes. \"Hello? Is anyone here? Eleanor?\" A deep voice called out from down the stairs, causing Higgins to break into a grin. \"I say we move this party out of our room, don't you dearest?\" Higgins asked Eliza, picking up Rose and spinning her around, causing the two year old to let out a loud shriek of laughter. The family made their way out of the room, heading down the stairs to meet a chipper looking Colonel Pickering, who was holding both his and Mrs. Higgins's luggage. \"Pickering old chap! It's about time you graced me with a visit,\" Henry exclaimed jovially, causing both Mrs. Higgins and Eliza to roll their eyes in unison. Henry set down his daughter and pulled the luggage away from Pickering, setting it on the floor before clapping his friend on the back with a grin. \"I was just here two weeks ago Higgins,\" Pickering responded, causing Eliza to laugh. Even though Colonel Hugh Pickering had been a major part of their lives and Higgins's best friend for over eleven years, he was still occasionally oblivious to Henry's humor and flair for the dramatic, much to the amusement of the two women in their lives. \"Henry dear, can you bear having me take away your friend for one more moment so he can move the luggage into our rooms?\" Mrs. Higgins teased, causing Henry to shoot her a glare as he released his hold on Pickering. \"Uncle Hugh! Uncle Hugh! Are you staying with us as well?\" James asked, the nine year old nearly bursting with excitement. It was no secret that James was immensely fond of the man who served as both his \"uncle\" and his godfather, and the feeling was mutual. To Eliza, it seemed that Henry sometimes found himself a tad bit jealous over the relationship his son and his best friend had, though Eliza often teased that she couldn't tell if he was more jealous of the colonel or James. \"I am my boy! Someone has to help your grandmother keep you rapscallions out of trouble!\" Pickering teased, planting a kiss on top of little Rose's head as she toddled up to him. \"Oh please Hugh, I've already raised one Higgins boy. Besides, these two have more their mothers temperament than their father's, thank heavens,\" Mrs. Higgins teased, earning a squawk of protest from Henry. With a laugh, Pickering walked up the stairs, the luggage in his arms as he made his way into one of the two rooms. \"What time is your train?\" Mrs. Higgins asked, moving into Henry's study to take a seat. Eliza and Henry followed, with James and Rose hanging by the staircase to wait for Pickering's return. \"We should be leaving here in about thirty minutes or so...the train departs in about two hours,\" Henry responded casually, taking a seat next to his wife in the sofa as Mrs. Higgins settled into a chair across from them. \"Have you finished packing?\" Eliza asked him, recalling the earlier scene in their bedroom. Henry nodded, getting a questioning eyebrow from his wife in return. \"How little faith you have in me, my precious guttersnipe,\" Henry joked, prompting Eliza to smack him lightly upside the head in retort. \"Henry really!\" Mrs. Higgins scolded, glancing at the door as if to remind him that his children were only a room away. Henry just shrugged with a grin on his face...it wasn't as if the children hadn't heard the nickname before. Though, both him and Eliza had carefully explained to James in particular that the nickname was an endearment between his mother and father only, and that he was never to call anyone that both inside the home and out. \"Says the man who tore up our entire room attempting to find an article of clothing that was sitting right in front of his face,\" Eliza retorted, never to be outdone in their usual banter. \"Woman! It's in your best interest not to vex me,\" Henry growled, his tone teasing as he glanced at his wife. \"And why not?\" Eliza asked, cocking an eyebrow at her husband. \"I'd rather not say in front of my mother,\" Henry smirked, shooting his wife a wink as she blushed furiously. \"Oh Henry! Behave yourself,\" Eliza scolded, prompting Mrs. Higgins to chuckle at the antics of her son and daughter in law. It still warmed her heart to see the two of them so happy with one another. Eleven years ago, Mrs. Higgins never dreamed that she'd see a day where her son was happily in love, even less so happily married. But here they all were, with Henry still as besotted with Eliza as he had been from the beginning, and two children to fill his heart with even more joy. Mrs. Higgins had been convinced all those years ago that Eliza would be the best thing to ever happen to her son, and she was beyond thrilled to know that she had been correct. Of course, the pair still debated and teased and argued and fought like the dickens, but Eleanor Higgins had never seen a couple more fiercely in love than Henry and Eliza, and she doubted that she ever would. \"So Mother...when are you going to officially steal my best friend away from me and ruin his life of bachelorhood for good?\" Henry asked nonchalantly, earning another slap from his wife. Mrs. Higgins blushed slightly and glanced fondly down at the bracelet Hugh had brought her upon his return from a trip back to India. \"Well, I told him I would agree to marry him years ago without all the fuss. Once you reach our age the drawn out process seems rather silly. But you know Hugh, he's always the romantic,\" Mrs. Higgins sighed, truthfully wishing that her beloved companion would just propose already so she could finally marry the man that she had grown to love. \"I told Henry he should be taking notes,\" Eliza joked, prompting her husband to let out another squawk of protest as the two women laughed at him. \"What have I missed?\" Pickering boomed out, stumbling into the study with Rose in his arms and James wrapped firmly around his leg. The other three adults chuckled at the sight, all three thinking that \"Uncle\" Hugh already made an excellent grandfather figure for both of the children. \"There you are old man! I was beginning to feel outnumbered! These two were bullying me into submission before you came to my rescue,\" Higgins whined, causing Colonel Pickering to glance at Eliza and Mrs. Higgins in confusion. Pickering set down Rose, who promptly ran to her grandmother and plopped down in her lap. \"James, why don't you get your report on India to show Uncle Hugh? And could you please find Mrs. Pearce and have her call for a taxi?\" Eliza asked her son, who gave her a nod. \"I help!\" Rose exclaimed, chasing after her brother. James stopped for a moment to take her sister's hand in order to prevent her from tripping over her new dress, before bolting up the stairs with her in tow to find his report. \"Higgins, that boy looks like more and more like you every time I see him,\" Pickering marveled, causing Higgins to puff up a bit. \"Good looking chap isn't he? Smartest boy in his class too, just like his father!\" Higgins crowed, his pride evident in his eyes. \"At least he didn't inherit his father's unmitigated ego,\" Mrs. Higgins quipped, prompting Henry to ignore her. \"Speaking of classes...I left you James's school schedule on the kitchen counter. Mrs. Pearce has taken care of his uniforms already. If you'd like you can meet him after school to walk home with him, but Harold Paton has already volunteered to walk home with him and Phillip whenever you two aren't feeling up to it,\" Eliza said, speaking to both Pickering and Mrs. Higgins. \"Have you seen Clara recently? I've always told her mother that her daughter married a wonderful gentleman,\" Mrs. Higgins asked. \"I saw her last week. I think she's due with their third child in a month or so. I really should pay her another visit before the baby comes. Harold was so wonderful with getting James home after Rose was born,\" Eliza remarked, noting Henry's slight change in expression as he smirked at the ground. \"He diminished his wife's snobbery as well, she's almost bearable company now. Quite a feat considering the family she's from,\" Henry muttered, really only loud enough for Eliza to hear. He was rewarded with a quick kick in the shin from his wife, who though she would never admit it secretly agreed with him. It was no really secret Henry still despised the Eynsford Hill family, which made initial outings with Clara and Harold rather awkward for Eliza and Harold both. However, Clara had eventually grown on Henry, largely due to Henry's begrudging fondness for Phillip and Harold. \"What was that Henry?\" Mrs. Higgins asked quizzically. \"Besides, James and Phillip are such good friends, it feels like the Patons are practically family! Their daughter Margaret is darling as well, it's hard to believe she's only six years old at times,\" Eliza interjected, distracting Mrs. Higgins. \"I'll admit I can enjoy their company at times...provided Mrs. Paton's idiot brother isn't there,\" Henry grumbled, unable to help himself. \"Honestly Henry, it happened ages ago. Freddy has grown into a fine young man, very well-mannered and successful. Besides, he's only staying with his sister until he receives word on his transfer to work on the board of finance in Scotland,\" Mrs. Higgins sighed, well aware of Henry's grudge against the boy. \"Good riddance,\" Henry mumbled, causing Eliza to glare at him. \"For God's sake Henry...\" Eliza started, but was cut off by Mrs. Pearce entering the room. \"I've called for the taxi, it should be here in about ten minutes or so,\" she announced, giving Mrs. Higgins and the colonel a smile before heading back out the door. \"Is your luggage downstairs?\" Henry asked Eliza, slightly grateful for the interruption. \"Yes...I know for a fact yours is not,\" Eliza responded, prompting a shrug from Higgins. \"Pickering old chap, would you mind helping me with my trunk? I daresay these two will want a moment to chatter without any men around,\" Higgins said jokingly, placing a swift kiss on his wife's cheek before heading up the stairs with Pickering close behind him. \"Make sure to find James and take a look at his report while you are up there Hugh,\" Mrs. Higgins called out, before moving to sit on the couch next to Eliza. \"Sometimes I'm not sure what to do about him,\" Eliza sighed, getting a sympathetic pat on the shoulder from her mother in law. \"My dear, I gave birth to him and I STILL don't know what to do about him. I've often remarked you have the patience of a saint, and even though he's mellowed over the years I still stand by that remark,\" Mrs. Higgins quipped, getting a laugh from Eliza. \"Thank you for coming Eleanor. I know it would have been easier for the children to stay with you, but I know the children are already not fond of the idea of us being gone for a month, and I didn't want to disrupt their routine further, and...\" Eliza continued, stopping as Eleanor rested a hand on her shoulder. \"My dear, I am their grandmother. My house will still be there at the end of the month, and lord knows it isn't far away if I absolutely need something. Hugh and I are here to enjoy the children's company and ensure that their routine remains in place,\" Mrs. Higgins stated firmly, getting a grateful smile from Eliza. \"I know...I suppose I'm just a little nervous. Henry and I have never been gone at the same time for more than a week without the children since James was born. I know it's high time the two of us had a vacation, but I am going to miss them and I just worry, even though I know they will be in very good hands...\" Eliza continued, beginning to ramble. \"Which is why you're such an excellent mother. It's perfectly natural to miss them and to worry about them. The first extended absence is always difficult, but know that they are in their own home and well taken care of. They'll miss you terribly, but Hugh and I will do our best to keep them distracted. Enjoy the time with Henry, the month will fly by faster than you think,\" Mrs. Higgins advised, getting a nod from Eliza. \"You're right of course. I am excited to see Paris. Henry and I originally had planned an excursion there during our honeymoon, but there was already so much to see in Italy, we just never got around to it,\" Eliza sighed, causing Mrs. Higgins to smile. \"If we're being frank, I'm rather sure you didn't see much of Italy on that trip as well,\" Mrs. Higgins said cheekily, causing Eliza's cheeks to immediately flush. \"Well...I...I mean...that is true,\" Eliza stammered, more than a little embarrassed by her mother in law's teasing. Mrs. Higgins just laughed and leaned back into the couch. \"Paris is wonderful my dear, I know that you will enjoy it thoroughly. I know you've been practicing your French as well, so this will be an excellent test for you,\" Mrs. Higgins said gently. \"Well, I had to ensure that I could understand what Henry is saying. After all, someone needs to pacify the French people after Henry insults them,\" Eliza joked, causing Mrs. Higgins to laugh. \"At least Henry can speak the language. When I went to Paris with Hugh, the two of us didn't know enough French to properly ask for directions, leading to us both getting quite lost late in the evening until a kindly police officer was able to assist us,\" Mrs. Higgins chuckled, smiling at the memory. \"I do hope the two of you get married soon. I enjoy seeing the both of you so happy. Even Henry has warmed to the idea, though you did not hear that from me,\" Eliza said sweetly, causing Mrs. Higgins to blush again. \"As do I my dear...as do I,\" Mrs. Higgins answered, smiling as the colonel in question reappeared in the study, leaning down to press a kiss on Mrs. Higgins' cheek. \"James's report is excellent, truly superb actually! I'm happy I was able to help him with the research, I see he put it all to good use,\" Pickering said happily, settling down into an armchair. \"Eliza! The luggage is all downstairs but I can't find my...\" Henry's voice called out, sounding slightly irritated. \"It's hanging from the coat rack,\" Eliza called back, much to the confusion of Pickering and the amusement of Mrs. Higgins. \"But you don't know what I was...\" Henry started again, before Eliza cut him off. \"If you are looking for your hat, it is hanging from the coat rack,\" Eliza answered casually, grinning for a moment at the pause coming from the hallway. \"Ah...you're right. So it is,\" Henry's voice called out a moment later, causing Eliza to lean back with a satisfied smirk. \"He'd lose his own head if you weren't there to remind him it's attached to his body,\" Mrs. Higgins quipped, watching as her son entered the room. \"The taxi has just pulled up. I'll start loading the bags while you gather the children,\" Henry said, getting a nod from his wife. Eliza stood and walked into the hallway, finding James and Rose already standing by the stairs. Mrs. Higgins and Pickering lingered at the study door, allowing Eliza a moment with her children. \"Now, you two behave for your grandmother and Uncle Hugh, you know what your father and I both expect of you,\" Eliza said firmly, mostly directing her attention to James. \"Mama...daddy and you stay here?\" Rose asked, not fully understanding what was happening. Eliza bent down and hugged her daughter close, attempting not to let any tears fall from her eyes. \"Mama and daddy are going on a trip darling, we will be back soon. You are going to stay here with grandma and Uncle Hugh and Mrs. Pearce,\" Eliza explained, her heart clenching as her daughter began to cry. \"No mama, I come too?\" Rose whimpered, clutching to her mothers neck tightly. Eliza was aware of two strong hands pulling Rose away from her, glancing up to see Henry holding his crying daughter. \"Don't cry, my little Rose. You are going to have such fun with your grandmother and Uncle Hugh, you will forget that we are gone. We will call you every night if you'd like, and we will bring you back presents from Paris when we return, how does that sound?\" Henry soothed, wiping his daughter's tears away. Eliza caught Mrs. Higgins's eye, the two of them close to tears themselves at Henry's tenderness with his daughter. Rose slowly nodded, her tears subsiding as her father kissed her cheek. \"James, you take care of your sister please,\" Eliza said to her son, who was looking upset himself but trying desperately to act like a grown up. \"Of course Mother. I'll read to her every night, just as Father does,\" James said earnestly, causing tears to spring to Eliza's eyes. Henry released his daughter and handed her back to Eliza, kneeling down towards his son. \"Do you both have to go for a month?\" James asked in a small voice, finally letting his emotions get the best of him. He was instantly enveloped in his father's arms, with Henry pressing a kiss to his son's forehead. \"It will go by in a blink my boy, I promise you. You've got your grandmother and Uncle Hugh here to keep you company. I know your uncle would love to help you build that airplane you purchased. We have a phone in our room, so you can call us when you'd like. We'll be back before you know it,\" Henry said, his voice cracking as he fought back the lump in his throat. Henry placed one more kiss on his son's head before standing up, giving his daughter one last kiss as well before heading over to Pickering and Mrs. Higgins. \"I'll miss you both my darlings. We'll be back soon,\" Eliza whispered, bending down to pull both of her children into a tight embrace. \"We'll see you soon Mother. Have fun in Paris,\" James sniffled, quickly wiping away a tear as he hugged his mother back tightly. \"My dear, you're going to miss your train,\" Mrs. Higgins called out gently. Eliza reluctantly let go of her children, giving them each one more kiss, before turning to Pickering and Mrs. Higgins. \"Don't let them run you ragged old boy,\" Henry said, patting Pickering on the back. He gave his mother a quick kiss before heading towards the door, pausing to wait for Eliza. \"Enjoy yourself my dear,\" Mrs. Higgins whispered, pulling Eliza into a hug. Pickering embraced her as well, kissing her sweetly on the cheek as she pulled away. \"They'll be well looked after. Think of the stories you'll have for them when you come back,\" Pickering said kindly, causing Eliza to smile. \"Thank you both. We'll call you when we arrive,\" Eliza told them, before hugging her children once more. She finally pulled herself away and took Henry's outstretched arm, taking a seat in the cab as Henry walked around towards the other side. As the cab pulled away, Eliza and Henry both waved to their children, with Eliza unable to help herself from letting a few tears fall. \"Here,\" Henry said softly, passing Eliza his handkerchief. Eliza took it from him and dabbed at her eyes, before glancing at her husband apologetically. \"I'm sorry Henry, it's just that I'll...I'll just...\" Eliza started, but was cut off by Henry's hand reaching out for hers. \"Miss them terribly? As will I my love. Lord knows we've never been away from them this long. But, they've got the best care in the world at their disposal and we will be back before they can truly miss us,\" Henry murmured, squeezing his wife's hand tightly. \"I know. I am truly excited to see Paris...there's going to be so much to do and to see!\" Eliza said happily, resting her head on Henry's shoulder. \"As an added bonus, you get to spend four weeks alone with me,\" Henry whispered, his hand moving to rest on Eliza's thigh. \"I suppose I have to make a few sacrifices in order to finally see Paris,\" Eliza sighed dramatically, giggling as Henry raised an eyebrow at her. \"You'll pay for that,\" Henry murmured, his lips moving dangerously close to Eliza's ear as Eliza blushed. \"I look forward to it,\" Eliza replied coolly, prompting Henry to grin at her madly as the two continued on their journey to the train station. Well there's chapter 5! Told you it would be up faster. Chapter 6 will come soon, it will take place the next day after they arrive in Paris (back in the 20s it would have taken them most of the day to get there, and since they aren't leaving until early evening here I feel like they wouldn't get to Paris until early evening the next day). Also, Harold Paton is a little nod to Harry Hadden Paton, just because I couldn't resist. Hope you enjoyed it! ","Summary":" Mine Okay, so this is my first fanfic ever, and I'm super excited! I love the story of My Fair Lady"},{"Movie":"My Fair Lady","Title":"A New Beginning","Author":"just-a-little-star-wars","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10999932","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A New Beginning Eliza POV Eliza walked through the front door of the old house 27A Wimpole Street, just like she had done a million times before. She now regarded this house as her home, not the run down, one prom apartment where she used to live when she was still a flower-girl, selling as many flowers as she could to make just enough money to live and help support her father's drinking problems. Thinking back she realized that, if Higgins and the Colonel hadn't taken her in and taught her to act like a lady, she would still be in that position. On the not so bright and happy side it was also her transformation into the lady she was now that made her become acquainted with a Mister Freddy Eynsford-Hill, the man she believed to have loved. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX The night after she had run away from the Higgins residence, Freddy confessed his feelings to her, he told her that, as soon as he had the money, he would buy her the biggest diamond ring and make her his wife. She believed him for two years, every day she would ask him if he was ready to go out and get a job, he would reply with his charm and tell her that he was waiting for the right position to come up. Eliza ran a flower shop that the Colonel had helped her to set up, they lived a tough life, they weren't able to afford all the things that Freddy was used to, but it was still a comfortable one, a life that she believed was full of love and happiness; until about two months ago when Freddy had started to become more and more distant from Eliza. He would be out all day and night, supposedly looking for work. She believed him too for a little while, but then he started coming home in different clothes , much nicer, more expensive clothes than they could afford. She finally decided to ask him about his recent behaviour, she was scared that her assumptions were correct. She had an awful feeling that maybe Freddy had been cheating on her, he was still young and very, very good looking, but she wouldn't understand why he would betray her. Eliza was very beautiful herself and treated Freddy like a king, always keeping their small house clean, plenty of food on the table and that she always looked her best when they went out. \"Freddy, I want to ask you something. Can you come in here please?\" she called from the living room. He was currently 'working' in his study. \"Yes dear, coming!\" he called back walking into the living room and sitting down on the couch next to her, putting his hand around her waist like he usually did. He looked so beautiful, how someone like that could cheat on her she couldn't understand, he was perfect in every way, at least she thought so. \"Don't touch me, I'm not in the mood,\" she said through gritted teeth. He slowly withdrew his hand from her waist, confused at her change in behaviour, she wasn't usually like that. She could be feisty but she always did it in a nice, joking way. This was very unlike her. \"What is it my dear?\" He asked softly, almost sounding like he cared. \"Freddy, I have come to believe that you are having an affair. Don't try to deny it. I've noticed how you come home late at night with different clothes than the ones you left in. Just tell me the truth Freddy, stop lying to me,\" Eliza said shouting at the end, she could feel tears of anger and sadness threaten to over-flow from her chocolate brown eyes. \"What are you talking about love, I would never cheat on you,\" Freddy replied, putting a fake smile on his beautiful face. He reached a hand out to touch her cheek, to console his crying sweetheart. That action didn't console Eliza at all, it only infuriated her more. She was sick and tired of this faux chivalry, he was lying to her again and again and she couldn't take it anymore. Eliza grabbed his hand and pushed it away hard from her face, with the other hand she slapped that stupid smile of his. Freddy was taken aback by her action, Eliza had never hit him or anyone before, it was very, very unlike her. Maybe she knew. He gave up; he had to tell her about the affair, it wasn't fair on the woman. \"Don't. You. Lie. To. Me,\" Eliza screamed, she stood up from the couch so that she was fully facing him. \"Okay, Eliza, you got me. Yes I am having an affair, but I still love you Eliza, I love you more than her, she just understands me more than you do, she understands what I need,\" he said in a forgiving tone, Freddy did love Eliza, she just didn't have the money that he had always dreamed of, the money his family used to have when he was still a child. \"And what is it that you need Freddy, because last time I checked I gave you everything,\" she said still angry at the man, he loved the other woman for her money. How dare he?! \"You only like her for her money, and you were okay with going behind my back for what? A nice new vest? A new pair of shoes? I have worked sooo hard for you! Yes, this life might not be as extravagant as what you were used to but it's the best I could give! If you wanted more money you could have gotten a job as well, maybe contributed to this family!\" she stopped herself, covering her mouth with her fist. She wasn't supposed to say that, it would have been easier if he had never known. \"What do you mean family, Eliza,\" now Freddy was suspicious and angry, what could she mean by family, it was always just her and himself, unless... \"Yes Freddy, I'm pregnant, and you will never ever see your child,\" she shouted at the man she used to love. She got her coat and her hat from the rack near the door and left. She simply left. She couldn't stand to be anywhere near that man, after all that she had given him, all the love that they had showed each other, for him to throw her away like that it was inexcusable. She would leave him, her house and her possessions. They meant nothing to her. She was going home, back to 27A Wimpole Street, back to a place where she would be loved and looked after like the lady she was[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't own Pygmalion of the play/movie My Fair Lady. If I did Henry and Eliza would have become a thing. Author's Note: I know it's been months since the first chapter and for that I am extremely sorry. I've been really busy with school and sport and I had a massive case of writers block and was tempted to give this story up and not continue with it at all. Happily I've got a second wind and new ideas and the holidays so I'm hoping to be writing more on this story as well as my others. I'm now on AO3 as well so if you want to check out this story and give it a kudos that would be awesome, my pen name is just_a_little_star_wars very similar to my one on here. Thank you again for reading and sticking with this story. This isn't a very big fandom so we should all stick together right? What was she doing, running away like that? Off to marry Freddy she says, well good luck with that Eliza. We all know that Freddy is nothing but a huge joke. He didn't have any money he only pretended to. The man believed that, if he dressed well enough and acted fancy enough he would be able to fool everyone, and sadly he succeeded. Eliza may or may not know about the real amount of money that Freddy had and she's happy to work the rest of her live to support this man who, in Henry's opinion, didn't deserve it. Eliza worked her whole live just to live, to survive on top of supporting her alcoholic father who no one had heard from in months. She deserved a life, Eliza, did, to still be able to work if she wished, but to use the money for herself, not to live on, and Henry could have done that. He would have treated her like the lady he taught her to act like, the lady she now was, to be able to give her everything she had ever wished for. He had always seen her staying with them, they made a great team, Henry, Eliza, Pickering and even Mrs Pearce, he thought that she was going to continue living on with them, maybe not being married but just as friends. He loved Eliza, don't get him wrong, but she would never love him back. He had loved Eliza for a while, ever since the night of the ball all those months ago. When he first saw her for the beautiful lady that she was becoming instead of the street urchin, sassy flower girl that he took on as a challenge. \"Please, Eliza don't leaven! You hardly know Freddy,\" he begged her for the last time. He held on tightly to her arm, hoping that maybe if she stopped to listen to him, she would stay. He was sitting in the parlour, when he heard someone walking down the stairs. Henry had not been able to sleep that night and had a nagging feeling that something was on Eliza's mind. She had been acting distant from everyone in the house. She would often leave just as soon as breakfast was complete and would be out until late at night. If anyone confronted her about where she was all day, she told them that she was out running errands. *few minutes before* \"Who's there?\", he had called out. \"Oh, Henry, I…I, didn't know you were awake,\" Eliza answered coming around the corner. She had a small suitcase with her that held all her most valuable things, she would be able to buy new clothes again. \"I'm just heading out for a bit of fresh air.\" She continued making her way to the door. \"If your getting air, then why do you have a suitcase with you? You know I don't like being lied to Eliza,\" he said in an even tone, hoping not to convey how concerned he was. She was leaving, however. It was plain as day on her face. Henry got up from his chair and slowly walked towards her. Eliza reached out for the door knob, but turned back to face Henry. \"I'm leaving to live with Freddy. He loves me as I love him and we are to get married,\" she replied in an emotionless tone. Henry grabbed her upper arm in the attempt to turn her to face him. *back to present* \"I know him well enough, Henry. I know he loves me and that he would never do anything to hurt me,\" Eliza said, turning to face the older man. Henry was now openly showing his concern for her, they was something else under the concern, a kind of deep emotion that Eliza could not pin. \"Eliza, please, I need you\" he continued hoping to make her change her mind. \"You need me? Huh, no you don't. I'm just some experiment of yours. You can always find another.\" she glared at him ripping her arm from his grasp, before storming out the door. Little did Henry know that he would not be seeing Eliza for a very long time Author's Note: Pease remember to Rate and Review as your lovely comments really help me want to continue. I was lucky enough to be able to cosplay as Eliza Doolittle at FanExpo Vancouver this year and I had the most amazing time. It was my first time ever doing full on cosplay and everyone was super sweet and nice. On top of that I got to wear a rocking replica of the Ascot Dress that my family friend made for me. I also got to meet Carrie Fisher who plays the amazing Princess Leia in the original trilogy and Jeremy Shada who does the voice of Finn on Adventure Time and get their autograph's and photo's with them, it was just the most amazing time, if any of you guys were there shot me a message because I really want to nerd out with someone. I also just got back from Star Wars Celebration and it was the most amazing thing ever.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: yadda yadda yadda I don't own anything Author's Note: I'm tying to update more I promise. This is such a small fandom and I'm trying to contribute I promise. I would like to thank my amazing beta reader. Without her (I think you are a girl) my story wouldn't look near as good and you guys wouldn't be able to understand it I swear. This chapter may be short or long. It's 2am so I have no idea where this is heading tbh. Anyway on with the story Eliza's POV It started to rain. Great, just what she needed. She did it, she finally did it. She ran away. Most women who ran away from their cheating ex, pregnant with his son, with nowhere to go, no money to speak of, would be hysterical. Crying, screaming at all the injustices that had been put on to her. But not Eliza Doolittle. No, she was happy, a big, toothy grin spread across her face. She felt like laughing and telling everyone in the whole world how happy and free she felt. She hadn't felt like this in months, and it felt amazing. Yeah she had no money, but what had changed there, she had no money growing up and Freddy was never able to provide for her. No. She was the one who did all the work. The only time she ever had any money that she could spend on herself and not have to be used to survive was when she was at Henry's. Henry. Henry Higgins. The professor who lived at 27A Wimpole Street. His name is still enough to make her stop. She was so happy back then. It was him who had made her the way she is. Without him she would still be the girl who sold flowers on the side of the road just to get by. And look at her now. She was a proper lady, she held her self-proper and was able to converse with the upper class. Author's Note: Please remember to rate and review as it gives me encouragement to continue with fanfic writing. Thank you. INTERNET HUGS AND COOKIES FOR ALL.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own anything….or do I? Author's Note: I'm really, really sorry I haven't updated this in a while. School's been getting really hectic and I just haven't had any time to write. This chapter will be a little longer than the last but not very long. I find it easy to write a shorter chapter in one sitting when I have time, eg on long car rides or late at night then writing longer chapters over a few days/weeks. I hope this is okay, I will be writing more over the holidays and updating as much as I can working around school work and sporting commitments. Wow that was a long author's note. Anyway on with the story and thank you so much for reading a commenting and just being awesome. Eliza's POV She didn't know how long she had been walking, all night she supposed. The sounds of people waking up and getting ready for the day were all-around her. Het feet were sore and she was dead dog tired. But she was happy, and in her mind that was the only thing that mattered. She looked up to find herself at the corner where she used to work selling flowers, ahh the memories of long work hours for hardly any pay, living in a shoe box of an apartment and living on only enough food to survive. Yes it was hard, but she was happier back then, before she met Freddy. She loved Freddy, she loved him so much that she might've given up the only people who ever truly cared about her, the kindly professor Henry Higgins and Pickering the old war kernel. She gave up her happiness for love and that's how she ended up where she is now, walking the streets of London, pregnant, with no home and nothing to her name. Great. Things just looked great for Eliza didn't it. \"Is that my daughter I see before me,\" Oh god, Eliza could not deal with her father at the moment. She regarded her emotions before turning around to face the old drunk. She was, wow, that man could clean up. Alfred P. Doolittle looked little like the man that had hardly raised her. His dirty, alcohol stained clothing had be changed to the finest of cloths and silks. It even looked like his hair had been brushed. Wow, money could really change a man. Eliza hadn't been in touch with her father since she moved in with Freddy, and truth be told even though she couldn't stand the man, she had missed him. \"It is, Eliza come over here and hug your old man,\" he shouted from where he was currently reclining on the couch of a café. Eliza toke a few deep breaths, she did not want to break down right now. \"It's a pleasure to see you again father,\" she said as politely as possible leaning over, enveloping her father in a light hug, he didn't even smell like liquor anymore, money really had changed him, for the better it seemed. Eliza sat down on the couch beside her father. What should she say, should she tell him everything, about how she's had to work again, Freddy and the pregnancy. She could feel her father's eyes on her face like a hawk, and then his eyes feel towards her stomach, where a slight bump was already starting to show through her dress. \"What's wrong, Eliza your acting quite, is everything okay between you and Freddy?\" Was he actually concerned? It seemed like it. He placed a comforting hand on her shoulder causing Eliza to flinch, this was so un-like the man who raised her. \"I left Freddy, he wasn't the man I thought her was, all the riches he used to boast about where lies, he never wanted to get a job and then he went off with another woman\" she confined in him. \"That's not all through is it, you're pregnant aren't you?\" He continued, rubbing her shoulder gently. Eliza was starting to feel woozy, light headed. Her body wasn't used to be so tired and hungry again. She gulped down the growing nausea and tried to see around the black dots that were starting to grow in her vision before answering her father's question. \"Yeah, dad I have nowhere to go now, I can't go….\" She wasn't able to finish her sentence before she blacked out, falling forward onto her now extremely concerned father. \"Eliza, Eliza, ELIZA, come on wake up, please\" her father started to say, shaking his daughter gently he placed his ear to her mouth, at least she was breathing, that's a good thing. What was he going to do? He lied her down on the couch before running outside to try to find a doctor, or anyone. That's when he saw him, the professor who had changed his daughter's life so much. There he was, across the road about to hail a cab. He had no idea that Eliza and Henry had limited contact through the time since she moved in with Freddy and simple assumed that the two were still very close friends. \"Wait! Professor, Henry Higgins, its Alfred, please come quickly Eliza has blacked out and I need help!\" He shouted across the road. Author's Note: thanks again for reading. I would like to thank daydreaming87, sash queen of the jungle, myfairladylover, patricia wilson and those amazing anons and guests for their continued support and kindest reviews. I hope you enjoyed this newest chapter. I'm hoping to make later chapters about this length from now on. Please remember to review and I hope you have a fabulous Summer/Winter wherever you are. Bella out![Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I don't own anything…..but I'm getting there. Author's Note: Hey, everyone! How are you guys? I'm currently on a plane on the way to LA, so I have time to sit down and write for once. I hope you like this new chapter. I'm looking for a beta to read over this story as I write new chapters. So if anyone is interested please don't be scared to shot me a message, I could really use the help. Also I don't exactly plan my stories out so I don't even know what's going to happen next, I just kind of go with the flow of things. Because of this I don't always know how long my chapters are going to be as I have to find places to cut them off. And another thing, cause I'm still new to writing my style may change and improve, so just hang on until I find my style. Anyway ON WITH THE SHOW. Henry's POV \"I'll be back shortly Mrs Pearce, I just have to run a few errands in town,\" Henry called as he donned his heavy coat and scarf as he headed out into the cold London air. Henry had planned on running into town to actually get some things for Eliza, he hadn't heard anything from her and was starting to worry about her wellbeing. Henry had never liked Freddy and the thought of him being with her still made him shudder. They had stayed in contact for a while, but then all communication between the two old friends just stopped. Freddy was always very possessive of Eliza and didn't like her going out by herself or being anywhere in public without him. The few times that Henry had seen the two in public together, Freddy hung on to her, tightly, as if he was afraid that if he let Eliza go even for one second she would figure out what a dead weight he is and run away. He used to have dreams where he would wake up and find Eliza knocking at his door asking if she could come back home, she would be crying and sobbing and Henry would take her in and make her better. He had picked up the few items he thought Eliza might have needed and was about to hail a carriage to take him home when he heard someone call his name. Henry turned towards the voice to see Eliza's father running towards him. He was red faced and hysterical. \"Wait! Professor, Henry Higgins, its Alfred, please come quickly Eliza has blacked out and I need help!\" Alfred shouted. Eliza was in trouble. The professor had never heard of Eliza having dizzy spells, she had always been a very healthy, strong and fit woman. Henry started to walk towards the once old drunk asking. \"What do you mean, Alfred?\" Once he reached the spot where Eliza's father was calling out from he saw that Eliza, was indeed passed out, lying on the coach her hands resting on her stomach. She looked so peaceful, as if she were just asleep. He crouched down next to the coach, gently shaking her shoulders, shouting into her ears \"please Eliza, it's me Henry, wake up\". No response. This was not good, not good at all. Here skin was starting to get cold and her breathing was becoming more and more laboured. \"Alfred, I'm going to have to take her back to my house, there's something wrong. She might be slipping into a coma.\" Henry said, looking up with wearing, tired eyes at Eliza's father. Author's Note: I LOVE CLIFFHANGERS. So how was it? Sorry it was short. Please remember to leave a review or comment with your thoughts and any ideas about how I can improve my writing or the story. There might not be another chapter for about two months, because school's going back for us Aussie's, but I'll try my hardest to write whenever I have time. INTERNET HUGS AND COOKIES FOR ALL! Bella out! ","Summary":" A New Beginning Eliza POV Eliza walked through the front door of the old house 27A Wimpole Street, "},{"Movie":"This Means War","Title":"In Too Deep","Author":"Liza Knight","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9300535","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Full summary: There's so many stories of Tuck moving on and falling for a new girl, but there are no stories that follow the alternate ending on the DVD where Lauren chooses Tuck. I've decided to pick up where the alternate ending left off, with FDR not getting the girl. Tuck and Lauren have now been together for almost a year and things couldn't be better for the two. FDR on the other hand isn't doing so well. He hasn't been the same since Lauren chose Tuck over him. He's become distant from his best friend and preoccupies himself with one-night-stands and drinking. Unable to see his best friend going down this dark road, Tuck, with the help of Lauren and Trish start a covert operation to find FDR a girl and Trish thinks she's found the perfect match for their estranged friend. Of course, nothing ever goes as planned. ()()()-()()()()()()()()()()-()()()()() Letting out a long yawn, FDR fought to keep his eyes open as he leaned back in his chair. The comfy leather cushions of the chair weren't helping as he struggled to keep himself awake. Ever since the Heinrich case things have slowed down for him. He had been taking every crack job that involved him just going out into the field. Even if it was just a trailing job, or simply just planting a bug into someone's computer system. That wasn't in his job description as an assassin but he would take it. Anything to get out of the office. Resting his head on the back of his chair he slowly opened his eyes and just stared at the ceiling blankly. The only sound coming from the little two desk cubicle was his best friend Tuck typing away at his computer. FDR winced each time Tuck typed. He would beat the hell out of that keyboard and with the massive headache FDR already had from a night of loud music, too much alcohol then to top it off, a long night of sexual activities with a flight attendant to which, for the life of him he couldn't remember her name, the last thing he wanted to hear was Tuck pounding mercilessly on that keyboard. Normally it didn't bother him, but today Tuck might as well been beating a drum in his ear. FDR couldn't bite back his pain filled groan from escaping from the back of his throat. His arms going limp to the sides of his chair dramatically, his legs stretching out under his desk. This caused Tuck to glance up from his computer screen and halt his typing. \"Long night?\" FDR just groaned again in response causing Tuck to shake his head and place his keyboard from his lap to his desk and slide his chair to the middle of his desk, turning his body to face his best friend. \"What's going on Franklin.\" His voice was serious but soft. \"This is the second day this week you've come into work with a hangover and honestly mate, you look like hell.\" Tuck raised an eyebrow. He was right, FDR looked a mess, his tie was hanging off, and the top few buttons of his shirt were unbuttoned, and it wasn't tucked in like it normally was. Now the Tuck got a good look at him, he swore that was the same outfit FDR had on when he left the office last night. The lack of sleep was apparent on his face, his eyes were bloodshot and he had dark circles under his eyes and his hair wasn't fixed as it is almost everyday. It was a flat in places and spiked up in other places. Sighing softly FDR opened on eye looking at Tuck who was wearing a worried expression. \"Thanks...I think.\" He replied sarcastically. \"I'll even admit last night got a little out of hand but I'm fine, Tuck.\" FDR sat up slowly running his fingers through his hair in a sad attempt to tame it before buttoning up his shirt. \"Forgive me if I don't believe you.\" Tuck rolled his eyes. \"I swear-\" FDR stood up shoving his shirt tail into his pants, \"- I'm perfectly fine. I just got a little crazy last night and haven't been to bed yet.\" He shrugged his hands now going to his tie, adjusting it to make himself appear more professional. Tuck huffed and leaned back in his chair. \"You left here at three forty-five yesterday, its..\" Tuck paused looking at his cell phone. \".. two thirty-eight now. You've been awake for almost twenty-four hours?\" Tuck frowned watching FDR closely. \"You need to get some sleep we all know what happens when you doing get any sleep now don't we?\" He harped as FDR sat back down opening his laptop. \"That was one time, Tuck.\" FDR defended himself, his voice dripping with annoyance. \"Yeah, and I still have that scar on my leg.\" Tuck pointed under the desk to his right leg. Rolling his eyes FDR turned his attention to a wadded up piece of paper on his desk. \"I said I was sorry about that-\" he started but was cut off by Tuck. \"We all know that when you miss sleep and go out into the field you become trigger happy and cant help but shoot at anything that moves.\" He propped his elbows up on the desk pointing his index finger right at FDR who was trying his best to ignore him. \"So tell me, Franklin. Whats going on?\" Tuck's expression softened. FDR rolled the ball of paper between both hands keeping his gaze downward. \"I-\" He paused letting out a deep sigh. \"-I don't really know, okay?\" Silence filled the small space between the two and both sat there, Tuck's eyes on FDR, and FDR's eyes on his desktop. \"I've just been feeling kinda down lately, but I'll be fine.\" FDR nodded trying to sound confident. Neither were sure if he was trying to convince himself of that or Tuck. \"It's probably just me going stir crazy. Being stuck in the office all day then going right home just gets boring.\" Shifting himself in his seat Tuck cleared his throat, \"Well, listen. Lauren and I are having dinner with her friends Trish and Bob in a few hours. You should come too. It'll do ya some good to get out and be around normal people for a change.\" FDR snorted a laugh and cut his eyes back up to Tuck. \"Do Trish and Bob count as 'normal people'?\" He asked causing Tuck to smirk. \"Besides I don't wanna be some kinda of fifth wheel.\" \"You wont be, and besides, they're far more normal then half those girls you tell me about every week.\" Tuck reassured him with a small smile. \"Think of it as a favor to me as well.\" \"A favor?\" FDR raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah-\" Tuck shrugged. \"- you come to dinner so I'll have someone to talk to that's simi-normal. I have no intention of being left alone with both of those people all night. \" FDR cracked a small smile and shrugged as Collins was heard coming down the hall way. Her shoes making loud clanking sounds on the tile floor. \"I'll think about it.\" Collins cut her eyes to both of her agents, clutched in her hand were two yellow folders. \"Got some good news for you two.\" She said, her voice void of any emotion and face lacking expression at the moment. \"A case just opened up, Special Ops dropped it down into our hands and I was wondering if you two wanted in?\" She asked waving the folders in their directions. Both Tuck and FDR sprung to their feet and lunged for the folders like two kids reaching for a prize. \"Yes!\" They both cheered, it was obvious that they needed out of the office for a while. \"Good.\" Collins nodded putting her hands on her hips. \"The target's name is Lukas Rozovsky. He's a Russian software programmer and weapon's designer that worked for the government. He recently retired from the US government and fled back to Russia. It seems as of late some of Rozovsky's weapon's have been put into terrorists hands and we need to know why, also if it is him providing these weapons we need to know how he's smuggling these weapons out of his country.\" FDR and Tuck both flipped through the pages of notes, pictures of both Rozovsky and his weapons. \"Why did Special Ops drop this case?\" Tuck questioned \"They didn't say.\" Collins stopped her eyes drifting off as if she's in deep thought. \"They just said they were waved off of the case and it was handed down to us.\" \"This guy must be ten kinds of nasty if Special Ops didn't want to touch him.\" FDR commented eying a picture of a nasty looking missile. Collins shook her head. \"I don't think that's it but I need to get this done quickly and quietly as possible. Which is why I'm giving it to you too.\" She nodded to both men who looked at her strangely. \"What?\" They asked simultaneously. \"I'm sure after last years freeway excursion and what a mess that was, I'm sure you two have learned ya'lls lesson on how important being discreet is.\" Narrowing her eyes at them making sure they understood there could be no mishaps on this mission. \"As much as it pains me to say this, you two are the best in my department which is why I'm giving this too you. If you two can pull this off, it may even earn y'all a position in either Special Ops or even higher than that.\" She stated simply. \"Rozovsky is hosting a huge gala event at his home in Russia in about two months. That give you two plenty of time to get in good with his people.\" \"So we're gonna be party crashers?\" FDR asked rubbing the back of his neck. \"More or less. There's a party in a week at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Vegas. Our sources say that a lot of Rozovsky's main goons will be attending.\" Collins explained to her two assassins. \"You get in, you talk, you seem interested in Rozovsky's software. Don't mention the weapons.\" Tuck closed the file and slipped it under his arm. \"What kind of weapons are these, exactly?\" Collins raised an eyebrow turning her eyes to Tuck. \"Regular missiles we're told, but our sources say he's on to something bigger.\" She paused. \"Like?\" FDR chimed in. He needed to know what he was in for. \"Nuclear weaponry.\" Collin's stated. \"And if that's true we got to shut him down now before one of those weapons fall into the wrong hands. I'll brief you on more of this later. Just go home, read over this file, memorize it, and get ready.\" She nodded before turning to walk off as FDR leaned against his desk letting out a deep breath looking over at Tuck who was sharing the same overwhelmed expression. \"That was a lot to take in.\" Tuck finally spoke. \"Are you goin' to be able to handle this, mate?\" His voice again showing great concern. FDR furrowed his brow. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"It means I don't fancy getting another shot in the leg.\" Tuck shrugged. \"Tuck, I'm fine, stop worrying, and just drop it. I'm perfectly fine.\" FDR gently hit his desk with his hand to add emphasis on his point. Tuck just nodded not sure if he believed his friend or not. \"Alright. I believe you.\" He nodded walking around to the back of his chair grabbing up his coat and began shutting off his computer. \"I gotta go pick Lauren up from work, but you, you're coming tonight right?\" He asked giving FDR a stern look. FDR rolled his eyes tossing the file down on his desk before pulling his tie loose again. \"Yes, yes...I'll be there.\" He rolled his eyes crossing his arms over his chest. \"You better not back out and make me start trailing you.\" Tuck warned walking back around to the front of his desk. \"Yeah, like you've never done that before.\" FDR mumbled himself but forced a small smile. Tuck just gave a small smile and gave his friend a gently pat on the shoulder. \"I'll text you where we're going to eat when I talk to Lauren.\" FDR simply nodded. \"Yeah, see ya then.\" He called to his friend watching as he left before leaning back on his desk letting his hands drop down behind him to help prop himself up. Truthfully he didn't even want to go tonight and sit there awkwardly with one married couple and another might as well be married couple. \"I need a drink.\" He groaned softly. ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() \"It can't be that bad.\" Lauren frowned as she took the hair brush to her hair, brushing the tangles of work and stress out of her hair. \"I mean, it's FDR. He always seems so...so..\" She paused thinking of a word to describe her friend.. \"... chipper.\" Tuck simply nodded as he buttoned up his black dress shirt, watching his girlfriend from the door. \"I know, but you don't see him at work, love.\" He stated smoothing out the wrinkles on his shirt. \"He comes in late wearing the same clothes from the day before, sometimes I'm convinced he never even goes home after work.\" Lauren's frown only deepened. \"Poor thing. I wish we could do something.\" Tuck bit the inside of his lip. \"I actually invited him to come with us tonight. Ya know, just to get him out and about.\" Tuck watched Lauren gauging her reaction. FDR and Lauren haven't spent that much time together in the past year. Yes they were still friends and could laugh and talk like they use to, but ever since they slept together and she ended up being with Tuck, things were just awkward. \"I think that's great.\" She nodded standing up walking over to Tuck wrapping her arms around his waist. \"He needs to be with his friends if he's going through a rough patch. Being alone is the worst thing he could be doing.\" She nodded resting her head against Tuck's chest as he hugged her tightly. Tuck smiled and mentally breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well he's not alone when he goes home apparently.\" He chuckled as Lauren looked up at him wide eyed. \"He's seeing someone?\" She asked as a shimmer of hope entered her eyes. Tuck frowned and leaned down kissing her forehead. \" 'fraid not.\" He frowned. \"He's seeing multiple people and only for one night.\" Lauren rolled her eyes and grunted softly. \"Of course he is.\" She released Tuck and walked back to the bathroom mirror and began touching up her makeup. \"Sometimes I wish he'd stop acting like a frat boy and settle down already.\" She ranted putting on some eyeliner. Tuck stopped in his tracks as a crazy idea rushed through his mind as he listened to Lauren rant on. \"I mean, he's gonna be thirty-one this year and I don't think he's ever been in a serious relationship with anyone. He needs to find him a girlfriend and..\" She stopped and her eyes went wide before spinning around quickly to face Tuck. \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" She grinned mischievously. Tuck nodded with a grin. \"I believe so. You're saying we should set him up with a girl?\" Lauren nodded excitedly. \"Yes! It'll be perfect, I know so many single girls at my office and I'm sure one of them has to be perfect for FDR!\" She nodded, dropping her makeup on the counter before rushing past Tuck into the bed room to get her phone. \"What are you doing?\" Tuck asked watching her curiously. \"Calling Trish... I mean who better to help set FDR up then her? I mean she's the reason I met you remember?\" Lauren quickly dialed Trish's number as Tuck shook his head with a chuckle and kissed Lauren on top of the head before walking towards the door. \"That's why I put up with her. I'll be downstairs.\" ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() \"No!\" Trish slammed her hand down on the back of driver's seat, causing Tuck to jerk and nearly swerve his truck off the road. He bit his lip and glanced at Lauren out of the corner of his eye letting her know his annoyance with her outspoken friend. \"You can't hook him up with any of those losers you work with. He'll get bored with them in three days.\" Trish ranted to Lauren about her idea on setting FDR up. \"It has to be someone else, someone exciting.\" Lauren turned herself in the passenger seat so that she could better see Trish. \"Hey! My job is plenty exciting. I mean, it's not Tuck's job but it's still fun and it's not boring.\" She defended her job with a frown. Trish rolled her eyes and waved a hand at Lauren. \"Yeah, okay, but if he sleeps with her do you really want to work with someone who's gonna be trying to compare dick stories with you? I mean, if you see her everyday and you run out of things to talk about, that's what'll come up.\" Lauren frowned and looked at Tuck who was keeping his eyes on the road, his knuckles white from gripping the steering wheel. It was true Tuck still hadn't gotten over the fact that Lauren and FDR slept together, especially after Tuck found out about FDR sleeping with Katie years ago. Smiling softly she reached over and placed her hand on his knee, gaining a very small smile from him. \"Well, if not my office then who? Who else do you know?\" Trish thought for a moment. \"What about that girl from the coffee shop? Ya know, the one with the black hair.\" She suggested. \"The cashier? I don't think he's her type.\" Lauren shook her head. \"Why the hell not?\" Trish frowned. \"Because-\" Lauren started with a giggle. \"-her girlfriend might not like it too much.\" Trish's eyes got wide, \"Really? Well that explains while our drinks are always up-sized for free.\" Lauren and Tuck but chuckled as Bob sat there silently. \"Okay, I got some pictures of some girls we know in my phone..\" She pulled her Iphone out of her pocket and began scrolling through pictures. \"No, no, ew no, maybe but...eh no, no, married.. married...\" She rambled scrolling through pictures. Tuck raised an eyebrow at how many pictures of other women Trish had in her phone and slowly looked to Lauren who just shrugged. \"When she finally figured out how to take pictures and use them as contact photos in the phone, she was hellbent on getting a picture of everyone she knew.\" Lauren explained to her confused boyfriend and gently stroked his knee as Trish kept mumbling. \"Oh oh, what about Darby?\" Trish asked handing the phone to Lauren who glanced at the picture. Lauren shrugged. \"Darby's cute but I don't think she's FDR's type. She's kinda needy..\" Lauren handed the phone to Tuck, \"What do you think babe?\" \"What kind of a name is Darby?\" Tuck took the phone from Lauren as she explained Darby was the girls last name then glanced down at the picture. This Darby girl had long brown hair that was straight as a board, slightly tanned skin, deep brown eyes which were covered by thick rimmed glasses, she was dressed in a white buttoned down shirt and black skinny jeans. Tuck studied the picture then shook his head. \"She's too thin. You are practically see her hip bones. Franklin likes a girl with a little more...meat I guess you could say.\" He used his thumb and scrolled over to the right and raised an eyebrow at the next picture. \"Now this girl... she's right up his alley.\" He nodded handing the phone back to Lauren. Lauren smiled looking down at the picture, a beautiful girl with shoulder length red hair that held a bit of a curl to it. Her eyes were emerald green and you could see freckles that were barely visible across her upper cheeks and nose. In the picture she was dressed in a blue button down shirt and black skirt that hugged her curves in all the right places. She was well enough endowed but not too much that she looked fake. \"Oh I forgot about her!\" Lauren exclaimed showing the picture to Trish. \"She's been out of town for two weeks so I haven't seen her at the office or coffee shop.\" \"She works with you?\" Tuck asked glancing between Lauren and the road. \"No, she works with Darby, but we work in the same building, her office in on top floor.\" Lauren shook her head eyeing the picture some more. \"We see each other in passing and we all go to the same sushi bar and to the same coffee house.\" Tuck nodded a bit curious about the being gone for weeks part. \"What does she do for a living?\" Lauren stopped and had to think for a moment. \"She's an art dealer. She goes an buys huge pieces of art in different parts of the world and sells them to rich folks. She's the one who actually helped me get those Gustav Klimt pieces I have.\" \"I think she'd be perfect for him. She travels a lot, he travels a lot... it's like a match made in crazy job heaven.\" Trish grinned snatching her phone back from Lauren. \"What's her name?\" Tuck asked as they pulled up to the restaurant not saying, but before he even mentioned it to FDR he was going to run this girl through a background check and find out all he could about her. He didn't want to see FDR get hurt and start getting worse. \"Her name is Emma Connolly.\" Lauren watched with a knowing smirk as Tuck pulled out his cellphone after they had parked. \"Whatcha doin' there?\" She asked grabbing up her purse as Tuck typed away on his cellphone. \"I'm getting Franklin know we're here.\" Tuck lied knowing he couldn't mention what he was doing in front of Trish and Bob. Trish however knew what Tuck did for a living but Bob didn't and he was amazed Trish was able to keep that secret. Tuck quickly typed up a message to Boyles ~ I need a back ground check and everything you can find on an Emma Connolly, apparently an art dealer.~ He typed then added Lauren's work address then quickly sent the message and shoved his phone into his pocket. \"Guys, I don't think we should tell FDR this tonight, I don't want him to feel like we're ganging up on him.\" Tuck glanced between Trish and Lauren, making sure to make eye contact with Trish, knowing if anyone would blabber it'd be her for sure. \"He'll never agree to this if we all bombard him.\" Lauren nodded, \"I agree. This needs to stay between us right now, and we need to make sure Emma isn't dating anyone or have moved away or anything like that.\" ()()()()() A/N:: This Idea has been in my head for a long time and I decided to do something different since I'm at a stand still and out of ideas with my other stories and normally if I write something else down I get ideas for my other ones. Ratings will go to M in later chapters. Please review. I'm sorry if it sucked I'm just horrible at starting new stories. Thank you. ~Liza[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Rubbing the sleep from his eyes Tuck slowly sat up on his bed, gently tossing the sheets off him, making sure to keep Lauren covered. Turning his eyes to his girlfriend who was still sleeping soundly, her hair sprawled out across her pillow. Tuck smiled seeing her cheeks were still slightly flushed from the previous night. Gently he reached over and brushed a stray hair out of her face and over her shoulder before leaning down, brushing his lips softly over her shoulder before carefully getting off the bed pulling his pants back on. Using his special skills to sneak out of the room without disturbing her. Reaching into his pocket he pulled out his cellphone and glanced down at the screen having a missed text messages from Boyles. Silently he made his way down into the kitchen and sat himself down on one of the many bar stools before typing the passcode into his phone reading the rest of Boyles message. ~Couldn't find much on Connolly, I left all the information I could find on your desk. -Boyles~ Tuck rolled his eyes groaning softly after reading the message. \"Ya think he'd just email it to me.\" Sitting back in his seat he began rethinking his plan. What if FDR didn't go for it? What if she'd just hurt him ever more. However he thought that highly impossible since the road FDR was on right now would eventually lead him right into an early grave, and maybe Tuck would be in there right along beside him, giving the fact they now had this new case they had to deal with. Maybe if FDR could get his mind leveled out before this mission really gets started...maybe this girl could help him. Running a hand through his hair Tuck then let out a low sigh tossing his head back, looking up at the ceiling as a quick thought ran through his head, was he doing this to help ease his guilt? The guilt that maybe he had be suppressing deep down when Lauren picked him over FDR? Both men had really loved her, but she had made a decision of who she really wanted to be with and they were either going to have to live with that decision or both take to walking. Tuck however couldn't even thing of letting her go now. Even after Katie found out of his real job and asked for dinner that one night, he couldn't even think of leaving Lauren. He loved her way to much. \"Hey, everything okay?\" He jumped at the sound of Lauren's soft tone of voice as she came down the steps. Her feet making soft padding sounds on the floor as she walked up beside him, dressed only in his dress shirt, her hair still a mess as it hung every which way, a few strands hanging in her eye. Smiling softly to himself he reached up wrapping his arm around her tiny hips before pulling her gently against his side, her arms going around his neck resting gently on his shoulders. \"I'm fine.\" He nodded as she tilted her head, making it clear she didn't believe him, he knew he couldn't lie to her...anymore. He could fool the whole world but not this girl. \"I'm just thinkin' about FDR, and why he's been in such a rut and I can't help but think that I-\" \"Stop it right there.\" Lauren interrupted him with a soft yet stern voice. \"You had nothing to do with this.\" She stated, reaching up to cup his cheek, running her thumb over his temple. \"This is just FDR, you can't be blamed for his behavior. He's a grown adult and fully capable of making his own decisions, bad or good, none of this is yours...or even our fault.\" Her eyes stared into his, proving the intensity of her point. The last thing she wanted was for Tuck to go into that phase where he blames himself for his friends actions. \"Also, we can't help who we fall in love with. You were better for me. FDR and I weren't on the same page. He's a party guy and I'm not.\" Lauren continued with a stern nod. \"My heart belongs to you, and really always did. It just took me until I was standing on the bridge having to making the decision, to realize that you were the one I couldn't lose, Tuck.\" She rambled with a small smile. Tuck just smiled and leaned over kissing her gently on the lips. \"I love you, you know that right?\" He felt her grin against his lips. \"I love you too baby.\" She smiled gently tugging him up from the bar stool. \"Now come back to bed.\" She smirked before pressing her lips to his a bit harder, clearly giving the sign she had no intention of sleeping when they got back upstairs. \"Yes ma'am.\" He grinned placing his hands under her thigh's before lifting her up into his arms, her legs circling his waist as her lips went to his neck while he carefully maneuvered them back up the steps into the bedroom. Their night was far from over. ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() FDR, having for the first night in many nights, had actually gotten a full nights rest and felt like he had a bit more pep in his step. He was walking down the street towards his favorite coffee shop, softly whistling to himself as the sun beamed down on his face. True he didn't feel a hundred percent yet, but this was a start. He didn't wake up with some random girl on his arm, or in the clothes he wore that past night. As he reached the coffee shop he pulled the door open and slipped inside, the place covered with busy bodies wanting their coffee before their day started. FDR's eyes scanned the room carefully, knowing that Tuck and Lauren also used this coffee house and he was in no more of a mood to see their lovey dovey crap again. Last night was near torture for him. He had to watch the hand holding, light kisses, and horrid sweet talk that they were spouting at each other all night. FDR was happy Tuck was happy, but he still felt hurt. He really loved Lauren and was surprised she didn't end up with him. His emotions were mixed about the whole thing. On one hand he wanted to hate Tuck and Lauren, but on the other, he couldn't be happier for them. Being so lost in his thoughts FDR walked right into a table, his pants catching the corner of a book and pulled it off into the floor, along with many pieces of paper. \"Oh..\" He jumped looking down at the mess he just created. \"I'm sorry!\" He dropped right to his knees and began trying to scoop up the papers. \"No no, it's fine.\" Came a soft voice from next to him. \"I can get them.\" FDR glanced up and his blue orbs met with a pair of emerald green ones. FDR's breathing caught in his throat as he stared back into the eyes. They were the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen. Green, clear, and a black circle outlining the edge of the eyes, making the green seem even brighter. For what felt like forever, FDR just sat there entranced until the other's eyes pulled away from his and back down to the floor. FDR was now looking at a mess of red, bright red hair that was tied back in a pony tail, little strands falling down around the other's ear. \"Let me help you.\" He muttered looking down at the papers. His eyes drifting to the set of petite hands that were grabbing up papers. \"It's fine.\" The woman spoke again, her voice still soft. \"Accidents happen.\" She muttered looking back up at him, FDR's eyes caught her's for a second time. The girl returned his gaze for a few more moments before forcing her eyes away, reaching out and taking the papers from his stilled hands before standing. \"Thank you so much..\" She paused tilting her head, waiting for him to say something else as he sat there on the ground kneeling. As if being slapped, FDR jumped from his thoughts and stood up, causing the girl to take a step back, her books clutched to her chest. \"FDR..\" He said extending his hand, watching as she raised an eyebrow. \"My name, it's FDR.\" The girl offered a small smile also extending her hand taking his, shaking it firmly. \"Oh, I'm Emma.\" She said with a smile, her free hand tossing the books to the table where she had been siting. \"I'm sorry again about your books.\" He muttered glancing around the table, noticing a man sitting there with slightly curly ginger hair. He was dressed in a dark blue suit, a pair of glasses perched on his nose. FDR supposed by girl standards this guy would be \"handsome\" but hell if he knew. He turned his eyes back to Emma. \"I know how annoying it is to have a date interrupted but someone's stupidity.\" FDR grinned, silently taking a jab at Tuck, who wasn't there to feel the burn. Emma quickly shook her head glancing to the other man. \"Oh no, we work together.\" She stated, her fingers moving back between herself and the man still seated. FDR just smiled and slightly cocked his head to the side. \"Really? So what is you two do?\" FDR faked small talk glancing to the man again, who held a look of annoyance. \"We're art dealers.\" The man spoke quickly with a thick British accent causing FDR to raise an eyebrow. The man tapped his pen on the desk top carefully eying FDR then Emma. \"Emma, we really have some work to do.\" He muttered. ~Why are they always British?~ FDR mentally asked himself before turning his eyes back to Emma who was glancing between the two men with a raised eyebrow. The sudden tension was insane and everyone could feel it. \"So, Emma, let me make it up to you-\" FDR started holding his arm out towards the counter. \"-let me at least buy you a cup of coffee.\" FDR offered, flashing her his ever so famous grin. Emma smiled and shook her head. \"Thank you but no, it wasn't that big of a deal so there's no need for that.\" FDR's smile faded as she sat back down at her table, opening up the books. FDR's eyes caught a glimpse of the name listed on the inside of the book. ~Gryffin's Collectables~ taking a mental note FDR nodded his head. \"I see. Well it was a pleasure meeting you Emma and..\" FDR cut his gaze towards the man who just frowned. \"I'm sorry I didn't get your name.\" He flashed a friendly grin. The man forced a smile and stuck out his hand, faking niceness just as FDR did. Clearly to this man Emma was something of importance to him, which now made this sport for FDR. Oh how he loved a good chase. \"It's William.\" FDR nodded shaking the man's hand, almost laughing at the roughness in which this man tried. \"Pleasure meeting you, /William/.\" FDR mocked William's accent playfully before flashing another grin to Emma and walking off. Leaving Emma with a very amused smirk on her face. Getting his coffee, FDR kept stealing glances at Emma, her hair, her eyes, her body, ~Good God that body.~ He thought licking his lips as he paid for his coffee, a vanilla latte with no foam. Now for some reason he got a bit of a /sweet tooth/ and he knew just where he needed to sink his teeth. The coffee was a test to prove how easy she might be. If she jumped on free coffee, he was sure he'd have no trouble having her in his bed by the end of the night. The fact she denied him, well, his coffee, just seemed like he could have a bit of fun pressuring this one. His coffee in his hand FDR made his way to the door, making sure on his way out to say a final goodbye to William and Emma. Once out the door, FDR glanced back at Emma whose eyes were still on him, a small smile tugging to her lips. FDR winked to the girl who quickly looked away, her smile only growing as she went back to her work, and FDR went right back to whistling, a cheeky grin on his face as he walked, if he had been even more excited thrilled he would have been skipping down the street. Luckily he was able to restrain himself from doing so. ()()()()()()()()()()()()() Meanwhile back at the office, Tuck sat at his desk, leaned back comfortably in his seat with his feet propped up on the desk top skimming through Emma's file. He read ever page carefully, making sure not to miss a thing. \"Boyles, was right.\" Tuck muttered to himself. \"There's hardly anything in this file. Tuck frowned reading over the girls history, orphaned at five when she went to live with Julius Griffin who ended up being the permanent foster-father of the girl the following year after she never got adopted out. Emma studied abroad at Cambridge University, the University of Galway, Julliard, and The École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Tuck raised an eyebrow. That alone impressed himself enough. This girl had to be something special to be able to study in all those school and now be head buyer at Gryffin Collectables. Tuck even did his reasearch on the business and everything came back legit. It was run by Julius Griffin, and William Griffin. Tuck snorted a laugh at that, a father a son business, it was no wonder how Emma got the job and was able to study at such high class schools. Tuck kept flipping through the girl's profile, age, twenty-six, soon to turn twenty-seven on Halloween day. \"Nice..\" Tuck muttered as he kept reading down to her personal life. A part of him felt like a creep reading all this, but he wanted to know who he was possibly setting his best friend up with. Rubbing his chin with his left hand, Tuck kept reading. ~No current love interest at the present time. Longest running relationship; four years with William Griffin.~ Tuck wrinkled up his nose, wouldn't the two be like brother and sister at that point? \"TuckTuck!\" FDR called as he walked down the hall, causing Tuck to slam the folder shut in surprise and sit upright in his seat. FDR looked cautiously at his friend before smirking. \"If you're gonna watch p-\" \"Oh shut it!\" Tuck snapped knowing just where FDR's perverted little mind was going with that statement. \"I was just reading.\" He said placing the file in his lap, watching as FDR walked around to the his seat, flopping down with a nice long sigh. \"You seem a bit perky today.\" Tuck smirked leaning his elbows on the desk watching as FDR sat his coffee cup down and opened his laptop. \"Yes I am.\" FDR answered simply typing away on the key board. Tuck couldn't help but watching in amusement. \"Any reson why?\" He asked. FDR just smirked and looked up at his friend. \"I just met a beautiful girl down at the coffee shop.\" He started, his eyes drifting off. \"I mean it, Tuck she was just...wow. Red hair, green eyes that just trapped you. Light freckles...not to mention nice rack.\" He rambled on as Tuck glanced down at the file. \"Oh?\" He muttered picking up the file in his hands. \"It wasn't JoeMugs coffee shop was it?\" Tuck smirked leaning back in his seat. FDR just nodded. \"Yeah..\" Tuck just chuckled watching as FDR went back to typing. \"You didn't by any chance get her name did you?\" \"Yeah,\" FDR looked up at Tuck confused. \"Emma. I didn't get her last name cause she was with some stuck up dude who really didn't let her talk much,\" FDR then started mocking William's voice again, \"We have a lot of work to do Emma.\" he mocked causing Tuck to chuckle. \"Don't talk to the good looking American, Emma. Sit next to me Emma.\" FDR went on, now just making jokes. \"So William is british then?\" Tuck watched FDR carefully, wondering if he'd catch on soon. FDR just nodded, his fingers working away at the keys to his lap top. \"Yeah, where do you people keep coming from..\" FDR paused and his eyes shot back up to Tuck who just grinned. \"How did you know his name?\" Tuck just stood up walking around to FDR's desk. \"Her name is Emma Connolly, and I have her file right here.\" Tuck waved it around out of FDR's reach. FDR's eyes flashed before he slammed the laptop shut holding out his hand. \"Give it to me.\" ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() A/N Sorry it's been a while since I updated, I've just been very very busy. Thanks so much to all seven reviews! You guys are the reason I'm updating now. Please forgive spelling errors, it's 5:30AM and my spell check decided to stop working all the sudden. Also I'm sorry this chapter isn't as good as my first, I just got stuck on this one for some reason, trying to figure out how to get FDR and Emma to meet before Tuck told him. Anways, I hope you liked it, please review and let me know.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Emma Connolly sat at her desk, her green eyes staring off into nowhere as she just rested her elbows on her oak desk top. She unconsciously tapped a pen against the desk top as her mind raced. Emma was distracted today, far too much to even think about her work. Every time she would pick up her books to begin working, all she could see was blue...those damned blue eyes. Emma swore she had never seen such beautiful eyes, and on a man at that. Eyes were her weakness. She believed the eyes were the true window to the soul. If someone happened to be lying to you, you could always see it in their eyes. She depended on that belief in her job, and it had payed off in the past. It saved her from making a huge mistake in her last relationship, she got out of what would have been deceitful marriage before it even started. The truth was in his eyes...he didn't love her, and he didn't want to marry her as much as she didn't want to marry him. The eyes were the first feature she noticed and the blue eyes she saw earlier were sticking in her mind. A small smile tugged to her lips as she thought about that morning. When that man knocked her books in the floor, Emma knew a good looking guy when she saw one, and he was right up there with the best of them. In her job she often saw young, gorgeous, eligible, rich young men but something about that guy stuck with her. It could have been when he spoke to William, the way he made William uneasy and politely taunted him, her dearest friend. Her overly jealous and protective ex fiance, the man who personally makes sure that her life revolves around work and work alone. Emma had very little of a social life, the only social life she had was centered around her best friend and assistant, Amy Darby. Emma would occasionally tag along with Darby when she was invited to go out to eat or to parties hosted by Darby's other friends. That was the extent of Emma's social life. When she wasn't working, she was sitting on her couch watching movies and indulging her guilty pleasure of horror movies and chocolate ice cream. Emma let out a deep sigh as her mind wondered from the beautiful eyed stranger, to William, then to Darby and her lack of socializing. She was far to scatter brained to even think about work. Her green eyes drifted down to her closed books and she smiled slightly, her mind going back to her beautiful stranger, FDR. She for a moment wondered if she'd ever see him again. Chuckling to herself, Emma shook her head. This wasn't like her, she never gave anyone a second thought and now she was sitting her thinking about a stranger she only saw once and only spoke to for a few moments. Shaking her head, Emma tried to push the thoughts of FDR out of her head and pulled her books closer to her, flipping them open, looking at the picture catalog that held images of her next job. She pressed her lips together and rested her chin in her hand as she began looking over the art in the picture. Emma was now about to be in charge of four, three-hundred year old statues she had to get shipped to Russia in a matter of months. She smiled looking over the large statues that easily stood over nine feet tall, and five feet wide. They were statues of several Greek deities, Ares, Athena, Polemos, and Nike. She had been working for months to get these from the museum in Greece for her buyer. \"Emma..\" William called from her door way. Emma didn't look up she just took her pen and began jotting down notes on her notepad, her free hand waved her friend into the room. \"Good, you're looking over the pictures, that's what I came to talk to you about.\" William shut the door to Emma's office behind him and walked towards the desk, sitting in one of the chair in front of her desk. \"Please tell me you have good news.\" Emma spoke softly, glancing up her William with curious eyes. William smiled and reached out, handing Emma a sheet of paper, Emma dropped her pen and reached out snatching it away quickly. \"I just got off the phone with the museum.\" He grinned with pride, obviously pleased with his own work. \"We got 'em.\" Emma's eyes widened as she read over the paper. It was true! The statues she had been working for were now hers! Well they were hers until her buyer forked over the money. \"Oh my god! You got all four of them. This is fantastic Will!\" Emma smiled brightly, reading over the information. \"They've been giving me the run around for two months now, that old lady Panas wouldn't ever give me the time of day when I called.\" William chuckled leaning back in the seat, smiling at her reaction. \"I think you just lacked the 'charm' Mrs Panas was looking for.\" He smirked smugly. Arching an eyebrow, Emma glanced up slowly. \"Charm?\" She asked with a snort. \"You mean that lovely British accent and deep voice that the women go crazy over?\" She smirked looking back down at the information. \"Hey, my lovely British accent got you this account didn't it?\" William chuckled. \"No,\" Emma laughed. \"Your father got me this account.\" She teased shooting him a playful glare which he returned. William's face soon fell serious, \"Speaking of that, he wanted me to come and talk to you.\" \"About what?\" Emma sat everything down, eyebrow raised and hands gently folded over each other. \"About this account, he wants me to make sure that you're gonna be okay-\" \"William, stop right there.\" Emma's eyes narrowed as she cut him off. \"If he things there's gonna be any issues with me handling this matter then he's mistaken. I know what I'm doing and I've been waiting for this account since I came to work here.\" She stated firmly. Letting out a sigh William nodded, \"He's just concerned because of the emotional ties you have with this account.\" \"Tell him don't be. I've severed all those past emotions, to me it's just another job, and after this one who knows, I might retire from this job and go do something else, just like what you two have always wanted for me. Hell after this job I'll have enough money I /can/ go and do that.\" She shrugged. \"I'll be fine and if he is even thinking about taking me off this one I'll leave and go solo, and he knows that.\" Emma's voice didn't falter. This account and job was the job she had been waiting for, and of course that made it personal, but she wasn't about to let it get in the way of her goal. This was her account, and her's alone. William nodded slowly, knowing that trying to talk her into letting someone else handle this would be like pulling teeth so he dropped it. He would be there with her if things got hectic, but he knew, and his father knew that Emma was the most qualified for this job other then William himself. Emma was also a very determined young girl, just like her mother. \"Fine. Then I suggest you call your client. We have only a few months before we get to meet him face to face for the first time.\" William forced a smile as Emma just nodded eagerly and quickly picked up the phone as William continued to sit there, watching her carefully. Emma smiled to herself as she quickly began dialing, the piece of paper William had given her was laid out neatly in front of her. William couldn't help but smile when the phone was answered and he got to hear Emma speak in one of her many different languages. \"Hello, Mr Rozovsky? This is Emma Conolly from Gryffin Collectables, how are you doing today?\" She spoke with a grin, her Russian dialect was flawless. \"Oh I am quite well, thank you for asking. I was just going to let you know we have successively acquired the four statues you have been requesting.\" William smiled as he watched her work, she truly was amazing to him, and he'd be lying if he said he didn't still have feelings for his childhood friend, but that was something that he could never go back and change. \"Of course, Mr Rozovsky, we ended up getting all four of them, Ares, Athena, Polemos, and Nike. The price however has gone up another half million, is that going to be a problem?\" She asked picking up her pen jotting down notes on her notepad. \"Yes sir...yes sir... that sounds perfect. I can have then ready to ship out a two months. Of course I would be there to personally see them delivered and make sure there are no problems.\" She paused and raised an eyebrow. \"Oh..I'm sure we can do that it may cost more but we can possibly make it happen, I understand inspecting them before we ship them all the way to Russia is most important. Yes sir, if you're not concerned with the price then neither are we, I'm sure they would be a fine centerpiece to your party.\" She spoke with a grin, her eyes cutting to William. \"Yes sir, I will see you in one week in Vegas. I look forward to meeting you too Mr Rozovsky.\" Emma jotted everything down before saying goodbye and hanging up. She leaned back in her seat and let out a long breath, smiling brightly at William who tilted his head and raised an eyebrow. \"What?\" \"We meet him in one week. Get them shipped to Vegas.\" She grinned as William's lips slowly turned into a smirk. \"Last one..\" She muttered. \"Last time.\" William nodded. ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() \"Come on Tuck! You have to do it.\" FDR whined as he jumped into the elevator with Tuck, his eyes almost seemed pleading, but they were dancing with mischief. Tuck rolled his eyes pressing buttons rapidly, he had been listening to FDR whine and moan about not knowing more about that Connolly girl all day and it was starting to get on his nerves. \"It's not my party Franklin. If it were up to me, I'd invite her, but I don't know her.\" Tuck shrugged his shoulders. FDR groaned and placed a hand on Tuck's shoulder. \"No, but Lauren and Trish know her, get them to invite her.\" He suggested with a smirk. \"Then I'll just randomly show up and bam!\" Tuck laughed and rolled his eyes once more. \"How is it not going to be suspicious that you just happen to meet this girl one day, show up at a party she's at that night? She'll probably think you're some kind of stalker..\" He paused and looked over at FDR and scoffed, \"..which you are.\" FDR's eyes narrowed and he pulled his hand away, pointing at Tuck, \"Oh, Pot, hello, I'm kettle, it's nice to meet you.\" FDR spoke, sarcasm very apparent in his voice. \"That was one time.\" Tuck frowned crossing his arms. \"One time?\" FDR smirked holding up Emma's folder. \"Looks like more then once buddy.\" Tuck snorted and turned his eyes towards the doors. \"Okay so, we're spies, we stalk people. It's what we do, but you're doing it because you want some hanky-panky.\" Frowning, FDR fell silent, his eyes once again narrowing, \"When are you /ever/ just gonna start calling it sex?\" \"Shut up.\" Tuck chuckled. \"Fine..\" FDR shrugged pulling out his cell phone scrolling through numbers. \"What are you doing?\" Tuck asked as he looked over at his friend, eyebrow arched. FDR didn't look over, he just put the phone to his ear. \"You leave me no other choice, since you wont help me.\" Tuck frowned turning his body to face FDR. \"Who are you calling?\" Shrugging again FDR didn't answer him, he just stared at the door, the phone against his ear and safely out of Tuck's reach. \"Hey Lauren! This is FDR.\" Tuck's eyes went wide as he lunged for the phone. \"What the hell, hang up.\" He warned as FDR backed away, keeping the phone away from Tuck. \"Yes I had a great time last night. Thanks for inviting me out.\" He smirked turning his eyes to Tuck who was pushing FDR further back against the wall. \"Listen, I need a favor to ask. I know you're having that little girls night, where you get all your friends together and...do what ever it is you girls do. I was wondering if you could possibly invite someone one for me.\" Tuck scowled, \"Don't get my girl involved in this crap.\" FDR just held Tuck back as he turned the phone away from Tuck's grasp. \"You know Emma Connolly?\" He smirked over at Tuck, letting him know Lauren was agreeing to help him. \"So you already know...isn't that sweet of you two.\" FDR's smirk only grew. \"Tell Trish I said thank you very much and I'll see you all tonight... Yup...he's right here and he said he loves you...Alright... bye.\" Tuck scowled and elbowed FDR hard in the stomach, smirking as he doubled over and groaned in pain, coughing as he tried to regain his breath as the doors to the elevator opened. Tuck looked at the people on the other side, who had shocked looks on their faces as they watched FDR cough and gasp for air. Unaware that Tuck had hit him. Smirking Tuck walked past them, pulling FDR along with him. \"Sorry, it's asthma.\" Tuck lied as FDR struggled to regain his composure. \"The poor fool forgot his inhaler today.\" He smiled as the doors shut. Once the people were out of sight FDR reached back, slamming his arm into Tuck's knee before standing up, his breathing starting to level out, Tuck groaned and began hobbling on one foot as the pain shot up his knee cap. Tuck glared at FDR who just smirked. \"We're even.\" FDR spoke as he straightened out his jacket, Tuck rubbing his knee. \"For now.\" Tuck nodded forcing himself upright, trying to keep the smirk from forming to his face. \"So I'll see you tonight then?\" He asked as if neither one of them had just exchanged blows. FDR chuckled and nodded, \"See ya tonight.\" Smirking to himself FDR quickly drove himself home, the game had now begun. It felt more like a game for him then anything else. He knew Tuck and Lauren were hoping this would turn into some sort of relationship, but he knew it wouldn't go any further then the bedroom. Which that was all he wanted. He wasn't looking for a girlfriend or anything like that. He was happy enough with a woman's company for one night then that morning, he'd feed her breakfast in bed, tell them how he cant wait to see them again and then that'd be it. He'd never call, he'd never see them again. He knew it made him sound like a pig, which of course he was, but he didn't care. He knew what he wanted and by god, he was going to take it. He was drowning his emotional torment with physical pleasures. Tuck often pictured him with a different woman every night, but in reality there had only been about five who he had sex with. The others were merely just for foreplay and /his/ pleasure. Once home he quickly rushed inside locked the door, carrying himself up the steps into his bedroom, where the unmade bed was waiting. He wasn't sure if he'd get lucky enough tonight, but just in case, he swiftly began cleaning, putting away empty beer bottles, hiding his clothes and any article of clothing that a woman might have left behind. FDR had already made that mistake of having one woman there while the one before her left a bra hanging in his bathroom. Luckily he was able to bullshit his way out of trouble and still ended up with a good night. Chuckling to himself, he shook his head, wondering why this girl was going to be one the the lucky ones he let into his bed. He couldn't help but wonder why he was about to go through so much trouble when he could just go to a bar and pick one? Was it because she didn't allow him to buy her coffee, or was it because of that snooty guy she was with? Or could it possibly be that she stopped him dead in his tracks with a one glance? Doubtful, but still a possibility. It was probably just for fun and the thrill of the chase. FDR knew he was not about to put his heart on his sleeve and get it broken again. He loved that Tuck was happy with Lauren, and that she was happy with Tuck, but it still killed him. FDR loved Lauren, he trusted her and she broke his heart...he was not about to offer his heart up to another woman ever again. FDR felt himself slowly begin to lose his chipper mood, and quickly pulled the thoughts from his head. He turned his mind back to Emma and smiled opening up his closet, he was on a mission and dammit, he wasn't going to fail. ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() Her teeth gently clamped down on her bottom lip, as Emma stood in her bedroom that took up the whole top floor of her loft, staring blankly into her wide closet. Her eyes scanning each article of clothing.\"Emma! Hurry up.\" she cringed at the shrill voice of her friend Darby called up the steps to her. \"You've been taking forever.\" Emma rolled her eyes as she heard Darby stomping up the metal steps towards her bedroom. \"I'm sorry.\" Emma called back with a chuckle as she eyed the clothes in her closet. \"I can't decide what to wear.\" She tilted her head as if looking at the clothes from a different angle might help her decide. Her hands began skimming through dresses and other various clothing. Emma heard Darby's heels clanking against the wooden floor as she approached her friend from behind, her chin coming to rest on Emma's shoulder as she peered into he closet. \"Just pick something Em.\" Darby smiled. \"Easier said then done. I don't go out to clubs so I don't know what I should wear.\" Emma grunted roughly sliding the hangers across the rail as she picked through the clothes. \"I mean, why cant we just go to Lauren's and do what we always do? Drink wine and play boggle.\" She whined pulling away from Darby, walking over and flopping down on her bed with a frustrated grunt. Darby chuckled tucking some of her dark locks behind her ear as she began digging through Emma's clothes. \"Because it'll be fun, and Trish was the one who decided we were going out.\" Darby pulled out a lowcut black cocktail dress and walked over to her friend. \"Not to mention that you need some action missy.\" Darby smirked. \"You and Will have been broken up since like...forever ago and you haven't even gone on the first date. That's just not normal.\" Emma eyed the dress and sat up, wrinkling her nose at the sexy garment. \"It's not like I haven't had offers ya know.\" She huffed jumping up and snatching the dress from Darby before she began stripping. Emma was not a shy girl, and she had known Darby for many years and in their work been forced to share a hotel room together, so she felt no shame in undressing in front of her best friend. Darby raised an eyebrow and placed her hands on her hips. \"Ya know, one guy offering to buy you coffee doesn't count as a date.\" She smirked. \"It wasn't just /one guy/.\" Emma spoke defensively as she stepped into the formfitting dress, carefully pulling it up past her hips. \"I've been asked out a lot of times.\" \"Clients don't count either.\" Emma now fell silent and didn't know how to respond. Of course she hadn't dated since William. Will was her first long term relationship and when it didn't work she was relieved, yet also devastated she couldn't make it work. Sensing the sudden change in her friend's mood, Darby walked over, helping to zip up the dress. \"I'm sorry. I just worry about you, Em.\" She zipped the dress before pulling Emma's hair out of the bun, letting it fall into loose curls down her back. \"It's not healthy for you to give up on all guys because it didn't work out with Will.\" \"I'm not giving up on all guys.\" Emma sighed running a hand through her hair before pulling away, going back to the closet to fetch her shoes. \"I just don't want to get hurt again. I've been hurt too much and..\" She paused letting out a shaky breath. Darby frowned and watched Emma with sadden eyes. \"You've been through more pain and hurt then anyone else I know Em, but I still want you to be happy.\" Emma held onto the wall as she slipped the heels on her feet, \"I am happy Darby.\" She forced a smile. It was true she got lonely at times, but her job kept her busy enough she could block it out. Sighing, Darby nodded her head looking at the time that was displayed on the clock. \"Come on, we gotta go. We're gonna meet at Lauren's and ride with them.\" Emma nodded and followed Darby out, grabbing a necklace and her wallet off the nightstand on the way. Emma followed her friend out to her gray BMW m3 and carefully sat down in the passenger seat, her eyes fixed out the window the whole ride as she just sat there in thought, listening to Darby sing along to the radio as they made the short drive to Lauren's house. Emma pulled her cash and ID from her wallet, carefully stuffing everything she'd need into her bra, her phone and wallet now flying into the glove compartment, knowing she had no other use for it tonight. Emma's mind was once again scattered as she thought of her newest job, and her last job... hopefully. She knew she should be working at home right now, but Darby insisted that she come. Something about Trish threatening her with non stop text and emails if she didn't come. Emma liked Trish, but at times she felt out of place, Darby was the one everyone was friends with. She ate lunch with Lauren when Emma was out of town. Darby would go shopping with Trish and Lauren, Emma was the the occasional tag along. True she knew Lauren from previous business but they weren't as close as they were with just Darby. \"We're here!\" Darby sang as if she were an opera singer which caused Emma to crack up. \"This dress is too tight, don't make me laugh.\" Emma laughed as Darby pulled the car to a stop. Emma's hands ran across the tight dress and chuckled, trying to regain her composure before slipping out of the car, walking with Darby who looped her arm with Emma's. Emma ran the door bell and watched as Darby began fixing her clothes and playing with her hair. \"What are you doing?\" Emma asked arching a brow. Darby smirked, \"Have you seen a picture of Lauren's man?\" She whispered with a wink. \"Oh. My. God.\" She gushed causing Emma to roll her eyes. \"I'm hoping he has a brother.\" She chuckled nudging Emma who smirked. \"Stop it.\" She warned as the locks on the door cold be heard. The door flying open to see a wide smiling Lauren on the other side, she was dressed in a short red dress that stopped right above her knee, red heels and her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. \"Right on time!\" Lauren greeted Darby first, pulling the girl into a tight hug before doing the same with Emma. Emma just smiled and hugged Lauren lightly, not being too good with displays of affection. \"I'm so glad you got to come this time, Emma.\" She smiled, stepping to the side letting the girls in. Emma just stepped inside and stayed close to Darby who once again lopped her arm with Emma. \"Thanks for inviting me. I haven't been out in a while.\" She smiled in her sad attempt to make small talk. Lauren waved her hand and lead the girls into the kitchen where wine glasses were waiting for them all, and a smiling Trish sitting at the bar, her glass already half gone. \"You have a very demanding job, I know you're busy.\" Lauren offered the two a glass of red wine. \"I know what it's like,Tuck is away on business a lot, that's one of the reasons why you two haven't been able to meet him yet.\" She smiled. Darby took the wine and sipped it, her eyes scanning the room. \"When do we get the meet this wonderful man that you keep talking about?\" Emma smirked at Darby's boldness knowing that she only wanted to secretly lust after the man. Emma had seen pictures so she knew he was in fact a very good looking man, but she wasn't as crude as Darby who was shamelessly flirt after she had a few drinks. \"He's here...somewhere.\" Lauren glanced around the room. \"Tuck, baby, we've got company!\" She called loudly. Emma sipped her wine as she heard loud footsteps coming from upstairs slowly growing closer as Tuck came bounding down the steps. \"Ladies ladies,\" He smiled looking at the four girls, Emma sighing at the sound of his accent, she heard accents all day but his was different...it was, as Darby would say, 'damn sexy'. \"I apologize, I was doing some research for work.\" He smiled walking up to Trish giving her a kiss on the cheek before extending his hand to Darby first, who eagerly took it and introduced herself. \"Darby, it is so nice to finally meet you, Lauren's told all about you and how funny you are.\" He shook her hand, his eyes then moving to Emma who just offered a small smile. \"And you are?\" He asked offering her his hand. Smiling, Emma placed her hand into his, giving it a firm shake. \"I'm Emma Connolly.\" She answered. \"It's a pleasure to meet you Emma.\" Tuck smiled, his eyes lingering on her, Emma felt as if he was sizing her up for something, but she just smiled and nodded. Tuck released her hand before walking up to Lauren, wrapping his hands around her hips leaning in to peck her lips. \"And you look ravishing my dear.\" He smiled. \"Thank you baby.\" Lauren cooed leaning herself into Tuck's arms. \"Are you ready to go?\" Lauren then turned her eyes to Darby and Emma, \"I hope you don't mind, but Tuck one of his friends are going to be joining us.\" She offered a small smile. Tuck nodded pulling Lauren's back against his chest, holding her closer, his chin resting on her shoulder. \"Four lovely ladies such as yourselves, think of us as a sort of body guard tonight.\" Tuck chuckled. \"Yea yea bullshit...\" Trish rolled her eyes. \"You just don't want Lauren going to a club alone with me.\" She raised an eyebrow with a smirk. \"You know I'm bad business and she's like the Robin to my Batman.\" Shrugging Tuck nodded, \"Ya got me. I don't trust you.\" He teased back. \"Anyways, Franklin sent me a text when he left his house, he should here any minute now.\" Tuck told Lauren who nodded and finished off her glass of wine. \"Great, I'm gonna go grab my purse from upstairs so we'll be ready when he gets here.\" Lauren smiled prying herself from Tucks grip. \"No need for purses, love.\" Tuck smiled. \"I don't want you girls losing anything so if you want to I'll put all ya'lls ID's and money into my wallet once we get there for safe keeping since I wont be drinking tonight.\" He turned his eyes towards Emma and Darby. \"You don't have too but I don't want your purses being snatched up.\" \"Don't have to ask me twice Designated Driver.\" Darby giggled pulling her wallet out of the tiny purse and began fishing out her credit card and ID. Emma just rolled her eyes at Darby and huffed a laugh. \"You really that paranoid Tuck?\" Trish asked pulling her things out of her purse. Tuck chuckled as he heard the doorbell ring and slowly made his way towards the door. \"I just know what kind of men are out there and I just want y'all safe.\" He turned the corner as Emma walked around the bar towards the artwork on the wall, she wasn't much for small talk because she never could think of anything to say. \"Franklin.\" She heard Tuck greet the person at the door. Darby walked up next to Emma and looked at the painting. \"That Gustav Klimt?\" She asked resting her head on Emma's shoulder. \"Yes ma'am. I helped Lauren get these a long time ago.\" Emma smiled leading her head on Draby's \"F.D.R!\" Trish cheered loudly causing Emma's eyes to go wide as both her and Darby turned their eyes towards the noise. \"Oh my god.\" Emma muttered softly, as she watched the guy from the coffee shop walk up and give Trish and Lauren a hug and kiss on the cheek. \"What..\" Darby whispered looking from FDR then back to Emma. \"You know him?\" She asked nodding her head towards FDR. Emma turned her eyes away from FDR when he started to glance up at her. \"Coffee shop.\" She muttered as quietly as possible. Darby's eyes widened as her mouth fell open in slight shock, more of a shock because that guy was gorgeous and when Emma told her about him, she had failed to mention that. She mouthed a good job and winked as FDR made his way over to them. Draby's eyes were the first to shoot over and she pulled a shit-eating grin to her lips. \"Hello..\" She smiled, extending her hand out to him. \"You must be Franklin. I'm Darby.\" Emma couldn't help but smile, being overly amused as FDR just flashed her a grin and took her hand kissing the back of it. \"Please, call me FDR.\" He winked at Darby causing her to giggle like a child. \"Oh please..\" Emma rolled her eyes chuckling at her friends reaction before taking another sip of her wine as FDR turned his gaze back to her, a smirk playing his lips. \"Small world..\" Was all he said before holding out hand out to Emma. Smirking against her wine glass, she placed her hand in his, watching as he kissed the back of it just like he did Darby's. \"Small world indeed.\" She nodded.

She's been in love with Tuck since their first mission but they only got together after Lauran chose FDR. The Ex never happened here. Chapter One I was nervous as I looked into my mirror. I was wearing a simple green summer dress with gold sandals. My hair was curled nicely and I wore a light dusting of makeup. \"Tuck, I can't do this,\" I muttered feeling my stomach twist and writhe. \"My parents are eager to meet you,\" he told me coming up behind me. I stared at our reflection and for the first time saw what all our friends did. We were a cute a couple. Our bodies fit together and we just seemed to match. Tuck kissed my neck and wrapped his arms around my waist. \"I love you Rayne. Just think about that,\" he told me. I smiled and turned in his arms. I kissed him tenderly feeling a bit more confident. We parked outside of the restaurant and my nerves returned. I took a deep breath and he took my hand. We walked in and found his mother and father. \"Tuck,\" his mom cried hugging him tight. His father shook his hand and smiled at him. \"Mother, father, this is my girlfriend Rayne,\" he introduced. \"Hello,\" I greeted holding out my hand. Both of them looked at me for a long moment. I hesitated as his mother's stare turned critical. \"Hello,\" his mother greeted cautiously. I shook her hand and turned to his father. He didn't shake my hand. I let it drop and threw a fearful look at Tuck. I was a spy, a mixed martial artist, a gymnast and an assassin when it was called for and yet I was scared of the two people I was with now. At the table Tuck pulled out my chair for me as usual and I noticed that his father did the same. \"I see where Tuck learned his impeccable manners,\" I tried. \"Flattery is unneeded,\" he told me. I fell silent and dropped my gaze to the table. Tuck's hand gripped my knee and squeezed reassuringly. \"Are you ready to order?\" the waiter asked. \"Yes,\" Mrs. Jones said, \"I would like lobster meal.\" I glanced over my menu. I didn't usually eat at places like this so I had no idea what to order. \"Darling, why don't we get a meal to share?\" Tuck asked. \"That'd be great,\" I said. I saw Mr. and Mrs. Jones exchange disapproving looks. I took another deep breath. Our meals arrived and Tuck and I shared a plate. \"So, are you in the travel business as well?\" Mr. Jones asked. \"Yes, I'm also a travel agent. It's how Tuck and I met,\" I said the lie slipping easily from my tongue. \"I see. Do you have any plans on settling down?\" he asked. \"Well what do you mean by settling down?\" I asked in return. \"Do you plan on having children, owning a home, quitting your job?\" \"Children yes, home yes but I want to continue to work,\" I told them. Disapproval glimmered in both of their eyes and I wondered what I said wrong. \"You want to continue working? Why do you not want to be a stay at home mother?\" Mrs. Jones asked. \"Well,\" I proceeded with caution, \"I would stay at home for the first few years to take care of my child but I would go back to work when the child was old enough.\" they glanced at each other and I began to panic slightly. \"Well I have to go to the powder room. Come with me?\" Mrs. Jones asked me. I stood hesitantly throwing a frightened look at Tuck. He gave me a reassuring smile but I knew him well enough to see the trouble brewing in his eyes. In the bathroom Mrs. Jones touched up her makeup. I hadn't brought any so I just stood there awkwardly. \"Why do you like my son?\" she asked bluntly. I swallowed wondering how to answer. \"Well Mrs. Jones, first of all, I don't like your son. I love Tuck. He's wonderful. He's smart and sweet and sensitive. He's funny and makes me feel as if I am the most beautiful woman in the world. He pushes me to be a better person and loves me despite all my flaws.\" She looked at me. \"Well I don't know how. You have so many,\" she told me sharply. I bit the inside of my cheek. Her words stung. \"You're not pretty enough. You're obviously not smart enough. You're American. You don't want to be a stay at home mom like any rational woman should be. You wear ridicules clothes and are a bit fat.\" her words hit me hard and I felt tears prick my eyes. However, I wasn't a seasoned professional spy by crying at every person who threw worded darts at me. I controlled my face into an emotionless mask. \"I don't want you dating my son,\" she told me firmly walking out. I gripped the sink, its edges cutting into my palms. I walked back out and saw that Tuck's eyes were angry. His father must have said something. He glanced at me as I sat down. His hand found mine under the table and he squeezed it hard. \"So what are your favorite things to do?\" Mr. Jones asked. I swallowed. \"I enjoy reading the classics and photography. I also like swimming and running,\" I told them truthfully hoping it would be enough to help a little bit. \"Running?\" Mrs. Jones asked looking skeptical. I bit my lip. \"That's an annoying habit. Stop biting your lip,\" she snapped. I stopped and Tuck tensed beside me. I rested my hand on his knee calming him. I didn't want to mess up their relationship. \"What classics do you like?\" Mr. Jones asked. I was convinced that nothing I said would change their minds about me so I just went with my honest answer. \"I can't choose. I love them all,\" I told them. \"Indecisive,\" I heard Mrs. Jones mutter. I sighed. \"Is there anything sophisticated you can do?\" she demanded. Tuck opened his mouth and I squeezed his knee. \"I play five different instruments very well and I can speak multiple languages.\" \"What instruments?\" Mr. Jones asked. \"Piano, cello, violin, flute and guitar.\" \"And languages?\" \"Spanish, French, Italian, Latin, Arabic, German and Russian,\" I told them. I could speak many more but I decided not to inform them of that. \"Well you aren't completely hopeless. At least you have some sophistication,\" Mr. Jones commented. \"What school did you go to?\"Mrs. Jones asked. I hesitated. How to answer? They might check up on me. Of course with my resources I could get a student record into any school I wanted. But I didn't want t lie to them. If I was to make this work they would have to accept me for who I was. \"I didn't really go to a specific school. I traveled,\" I told them. I saw any respect I might have earned from them leave and I quailed. \"I take it back. You are hopeless,\" Mr. Jones said. Tuck jerked from his seat. \"Alright that's enough. Come on Rayne we're leaving. When you can be civil to Rayne then you can call,\" Tuck told them. He took my hand and I grabbed my purse all too eager to leave. \"And you're weak,\" his mother finished. I stopped. I could handle being called many things but I would never bow down to the W word. I turned and fixed Mrs. Jones with a calm stare. \"Mrs. Jones, I can assure you that I am many things but I will never let someone call me weak,\" I started. She interrupted. \"You let my son fight your battles,\" she said smugly. \"And I do not find that shameful. I like the fact that he is willing to protect me but don't think that I can't fight my own battles. There is a simple truth here. I love Tuck. I love him with all my heart and I would die for him in a second. Now, I do not want my presence to cause strife. If you want to see your son please do. I know what it is like to live without parents and I don't want that to happen. If you don't want me to be there, I won't but I will not give him up either. I love him to much,\" I finished and turned to Tuck, \"Please stay, you haven't seen your family in a while. I can catch a cab and I'll see you at home.\" I stepped away, \"It was lovely to meet you,\" I told his parents before heading towards the door. A hand stopped me. \"No Rayne, if they can't approve of you then I won't stay with them,\" he told me. Tears pricked my eyes. He was choosing me over his family. \"Tuck!\" Mrs. Jones cried. \"I'm sorry mother but I love Rayne. If you can find it in you to approve then you can see me again. Until then, goodbye.\" he took my hand intertwining our fingers and pulled me to the door. We jumped in our car and he took off. We were both silent until we reached our home. We stepped out and walked inside. I closed the door and locked it with a soft click. \"I'm sorry,\" he murmured softly. I rested my hand on his shoulder. \"No, I'm sorry. I wish I could be the perfect girl,\" I told him. He turned and his grey blue eyes flamed with anger. \"Don't ever think that,\" he ordered fiercely, \"You are the perfect woman for me and I love everything about you. Don't listen to them.\" He yanked me into his arms and I smiled as he held me tightly. \"I love you,\" I whispered. \"I love you to,\" he whispered back.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two *The Next Day* \"FDR, am I fat?\" I asked walking into our shared space. He looked at me startled. \"No, why?\" he asked. \"Something Tuck's mother said,\" I replied. He arched his eyebrow. \"So I'm guessing last night didn't go as planned.\" I plopped into my seat. \"Not even close. It was a disaster. They hate me FDR. Mrs. Jones called me weak and stupid and ugly and fat and she said that I should be a stay at home mom and if I wasn't I was failure. I couldn't do anything right,\" I told him. \"She said that?\" two voices asked. I looked up and saw Tuck. I jumped from my seat stammering. \"When?\" he asked cutting through my babble. \"When we went to the bathroom,\" I mumbled. \"I can't believe her,\" he growled. I shrugged. \"It's fine. I've been called worse things,\" I told him with a carefree laugh. He saw right through it. \"I hope you don't believe any of those things,\" he said crossing his arms. \"Of course I don't believe it. It just kind of stings a bit,\" I conceded. \"Good,\" he told me. Suddenly Dick ran in. \"We have a situation,\" he told us. We followed him to the boss's office. \"I'm sorry to tell you this but your parents have been kidnapped Tuck,\" she told us. My eyes went wide. Tuck fell into a chair. She turned and pressed play on her remote. The screen behind her desk lit up to reveal masked men holding Mr. and Mrs. Jones at gunpoint. \"We want Tuck, Frank and Rayne at the harbor tomorrow at dawn. If they do not show these two people will die,\" one of the men said. The screen went black and I turned to Tuck. \"We have to save them,\" he said immediately. \"Yes but we need to do it without turning you guys in. Can you get them out before dawn?\" she asked. \"Of course,\" I told her confidently. \"Good, we traced the camera. Here's the address,\" she said handing me a slip of paper. I nodded and we all left. \"Don't worry Tuck. We have a plan,\" I said a bit later. We had formulated a plan on the way over. It was rough but it would work. \"I know,\" he said. We got out and changed into the dark clothing we had brought. \"Let's go,\" I whispered. We separated and I crept towards the boat they were being kept. Once I got into position I waited. After a few minutes I heard a loud bang. I jumped up and ran to the boat. I heard shouts and jumped. My feet left the ground and my hands caught the railing. A second bang went off right as my body thudded into the boat. I took a moment to catch my breath before pulling myself up. I landed on the boat and looked around carefully. It was empty but I didn't let that fool me. They might be surprised that we came so fast but they wouldn't be surprised that we were trying something. I crept through the boat and finally found them. They were tied to chairs with three guys watching them. One was behind the door, I saw him in a reflection, another was in the corner and the last was standing beside Mr. Jones. I took a deep breath and bolted for the door. I slammed it fully open knocking the breath out of the man behind it. My gun was in my hand and a bullet was in both the other two men's heads before they could even move. I turned and shot the last man. I walked over to them hearing more shouts. I quickly untied them and took the tape from their mouths. \"Come with me now,\" I ordered shortly. They didn't protest. I led them towards the door. It had fallen a bit shut and I was almost there when it burst open. It slammed into my head and I fell back. I shook off the pain and focused. It was two more men. One lunged for me and I grabbed him in a wrist lock. With a quick practiced move I snapped his wrist while shooting the other guy. \"Come on,\" I said leading the way. They followed me as I slid though the boat. We made it to the plank and I saw Tuck and FDR keeping the other men distracted. \"Run to that car and get inside,\" I snapped at them. I had to help Tuck and FDR. I turned and movement caught my eye. A sniper was perched on the top level of the boat. My analytical brain caught the path and trajectory and knew he was aiming for Tuck. \"Tuck,\" I screamed bursting into action. I raced to get to him in time. My heart pumped in my chest and everything sounded distant. My too fast heartbeat was all I could hear. It pounded in my ears as I ran as fast as I could. One thought kept echoing in my brain, I can't let him die. I heard a gunshot. I slammed into Tuck. He caught me looking startled. Searing pain suddenly exploded through my back. I gasped and everything went still. I was staring into Tuck's eyes, his gorgeous blue grey eyes that were now wide in horror. His arms were around me and my hands were on his biceps but my grip was weak. I heard distant sounds of fighting and yelling and then there was silence.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three I woke up in a warm bed, a warm hospital bed. I blinked groggily wondering how I had gotten here. A steady beeping was the only sound I could hear. I shifted and pain seared across my back. I gasped feeling automatic tears spring to my eyes. I gritted my teeth and rode the pain out. When it finally faded I took a deep breath. \"You're ok,\" I whispered to myself. \"No I want to see her,\" a shout was heard. I glanced over at the door. \"Sir you can't,\" whatever the doctor had been about to say was cut short by Tuck shoving open my door. Relief spasmed across his face. \"Thank goodness Rayne,\" he breathed coming to my side. He dropped to his knees and took my hands. \"I was shot,\" I stated my voice hoarse. \"Yeah, in the back, saving me,\" he confirmed stroking my cheek. I nodded and looked around. I saw a glass of water on my bedside table. \"Can I have some?\" I asked pointing at it. \"Of course darling,\" he replied handing me the glass. I took it but my grip was shockingly weak. It slipped from my fingers and only Tuck's quick reflexes saved me from getting wet. \"Here,\" he said helping me get a drink. \"Why am I so weak?\" I asked wiping my mouth. \"You lost a lot of blood. You'll be weak for a few days while you recover,\" explained the doctor. He checked a few things and left. A few minutes later the door opened once more and Mrs. Jones walked in. \"Can I speak with her alone please Tuck?\" she asked. Tuck looked wary and glanced at me. I nodded. He kissed my forehead and left after giving his mother a warning look. Mrs. Jones took a seat and was silent for a moment. \"You saved my son,\" she finally spoke quietly. I didn't reply. I didn't know how to. \"All this time, I thought you would never be good enough for him. I was scared that you would be horrible to him. I was proven wrong.\" Hope sparked in my chest. \"You almost died saving him and you risked your life to save mine and my husbands. We are in your debt.\" \"No,\" I protested, \"It's my job.\" \"I know, Tuck explained everything,\" she replied with a smile. I smiled back. \"I just want you to know that we accept you. It's obvious that you love Tuck and it's obvious that he loves you. Welcome to the family Rayne,\" she said with a large smile. My smile grew even wider. She leaned in and hugged me gently. \"Thank you,\" I whispered. \"No, thank you,\" she corrected. ","Summary":" Background on Rayne Rayne has worked with Tuck and FDR for four years.

Hány lépés vezet a boldogsághoz? 1. fejezet: Az első előtti lépés - „Hol a fenében van a papucsom?\" - kérdezte Henry Higgins professzor, majd hátradőlt a székén, kalapját a fejébe húzva, mintha csak ejtőzni készülne. Eliza egyből átlátott rajta, és felismerte a fölényességgel leplezett zavart és kétségbeesést. Olyasféle bosszankodó szeretettel nézett rá, ahogy az anyák szoktak rosszalkodó gyermekeikre. Szinte hallotta, hogyan kattognak a kerekek a férfi agyában: „A kutyafáját, rajtakapott, hogy az ő hangját hallgatom a gramofonon! Ez a széttaposott káposztalevél pontosan tudja, mennyire hiányozna, ha örökre elmenne! Most biztosan valami ostoba, csöpögős Jane Austen-féle szerelmi vallomásra számít… azt lesheti a lukon! \" Így teltek az elkövetkezendő percek. Higgins egyre kellemetlenebbül érezte magát. Egyre inkább melege volt a ruhájában, az izzadságcseppek már megjelentek a homlokán. Nem merte levenni a kalapot a fejéről, hogy letörölje őket. Elképzelte magát, milyen benyomást kelthet egy külső szemlélő számára, hátradőlve, egy már-már erőltetetten laza testtartásban. Nem hallott semmi neszt, sem egy árva szót, ebből arra következtetett, hogy Eliza se mozdult a helyéről. - Te átkozott bestia! – gondolta magában. - Szólalj már meg! Mondj valamit, vagy menjél ki, vagy ülj le, vagy legalább hozd ide azt a két ronda papucsot vagy bánom is én mit csinálsz, csak ne bámulj úgy engem, mint ahogy egy macska szokta az egérlyukban bujkáló egeret! Szinte abban a pillanatban törte meg a csöndet Eliza hangja. - Ma hajnalban találkoztam az apámmal. Azt mondta, hogy az az amerikai úriember, akinek a tanár úr írt, rengeteg pénzt hagyott rá, de ennek fejében el kellett vennie a mostohaanyámat, ahogy egy középosztálybeli emberhez illik… délelőtt 10 órakor, a Szent György templomban volt az esküvő. – tette hozzá lehajtott fejjel. Higgins összeszedve bátorságát, az íróasztalára helyezte kalapját, és megfordult a székben. Úgy tűnt, hogy ismét megtalálta arrogáns, nemtörődöm énjét, mert szája gúnyos mosolyra húzódott. - Annak idején az édesapja járt jól a maga szerencséjével, most fordult a kocka. Eliza értetlenkedve nézett rá. - Hogy érti ezt, professzor? - Most, hogy gazdag, tekintélyes ember lett, már el tudja magát tartani - Higgins felvonta a szemöldökét. - Be tudja fogadni a házába, vehet magának virágüzletet, vagy amit szeme-szája megkíván. Továbbá, ki tudja fizetni az esküvőjük összes költségét, mert bizony a maga drága Freddyje, sem az édesanyja nem dúskálnak pénzben. Mrs. Einsford-Hillnek egy szava sem lehet, micsoda jó vásárt csinált a fia… igazi főnyeremény. Eliza ökölbe szorította a kezét, és nagyot nyelt. Minden türelmére és a hat hónap alatt belevert illemtudására szükség volt. - Úgy érzi, sarokba van szorítva, ezért viselkedik így – mondta magában. - Tudja, hogy nincs szükségem se rá, se az ezredesre, se a pénzükre, ahhoz, hogy boldoguljak. Van udvarlóm, státuszom, és pénzem, az egyetlen fegyvere a gőgje és az arroganciája. Türelem, Eliza, ne add meg neki ezt az örömöt. Sóhajts és válaszolj… mint egy úrinő. Mélyen sóhajtott. - Nem akarok az apám nyakán élősködni, van szegénynek elég rokona, akik megteszik ezt helyettem. Különben sem akarok neki tartozni. Nincs szükségem még egy zsarnokra, aki felhánytorgatja nekem a támogatását- itt megvetően nézett Higginsre - Különben, nem is biztos, hogy férjhez megyek Freddyhez. Amint elhangzott ez az utolsó mondat, Higgins úgy pattant fel a székéről, mintha akit villámcsapás ért. A pulzusa megemelkedett, a gyomra bukfencet vetett. A professzor szeme kétségbeesetten forgott, mintha a megmentésére szolgáló apropó ott lenne a szobában. - Ez az átkozott szék… hogy lehet benne ülni ? Megfájdul tőle az ember háta… - motyogta félhangosan, a hátát dörzsölgetve. - Mitől változott meg a véleménye, Eliza? 1 órával ezelőtt, még olyan biztos volt benne, hogy hozzámegy. Hogy is mondta? „ Freddy szeret… és ez elég, hogy az én királyom legyen!\" Eliza sikeresen elfojtott egy diadalmosolyt. - Való igaz, hogy szeret, és már meg is kérte a kezemet, de még nem adtam neki választ. Addig nem is akartam férjhez menni, amíg nem lettem volna képes őt eltartani… - Higgins itt gúnyosan felhorkant- Valami rosszat mondtam, uram? - Egy férfi, aki a felesége támogatására szorul rá? Eliza ajkai pengevékonyra zsugorodtak, de ismét elengedte a füle mellett a megjegyzést. Higgins érezte, hogy ezúttal túl messzire ment, és megköszörülte a torkát: - Tehát, ezzel azt akarja mondani, hogy… hogy nem fog hozzámenni a fiúhoz? - Én ilyet nem mondtam. Csak a tényeket közöltem: Megkérte a kezemet, de nem mondtam neki, se igent, se nemet. Eliza belenézett a tanár úr szemébe, ami hirtelen különös módon csillogni kezdett. - Úgy érzi, hogy ő lenne az ideális a maga számára? – szalad ki a száján. A hangjában volt valami furcsa keveredése a félelemnek és a reménykedésnek. Amint kimondta ezt a mondatot, azonnal meg is bánta. Hogy kérdezhetett ilyet? - Micsoda neveletlen kérdés, Henry Higgins!- kuncogott Eliza. - De megígérem, tudatni fogom Önnel, amint dűlőre jutottam. Higgins gyorsan levette a tekintetét a lányról, és zsebre tett kézzel járkált fel-alá szobában, lassú, méltóságteljes léptekkel. - Gondolom, akkor az anyámnál fog lakni, amíg el nem dönti, hogy mit válaszol. - Mrs. Higgins volt olyan kedves, hogy felajánlotta az egyik vendégszobáját, mivel nem lenne helyénvaló továbbra is itt élnem magukkal, tekintve hogy már nem vagyok a tanítványa, és az ezredes is hamarosan elköltözik… - …ennek a következménye az lenne, hogy az emberek beszélnének rólunk, amiért kettesben élünk, minden ok nélkül.- tette hozzá Higgins a plafont bá erre a gondolatra elpirult, hálát adva az égnek, hogy a professzor nem őt nézi. Higgins most szinte közvetlenül Eliza háta mögött állt, úgy fürkészve kontyba csavart haját, mintha az lenne a világ legérdekesebb dolga. - Habár lenne egy megoldás arra, hogy itt maradhasson. Lenne függetlensége is, otthona is, és nem szorulna rá az apjára… Eliza szíve kalapálni kezdett. Amióta belépett ezen az ajtón, számított rá, hogy a professzor előbb-utóbb megkéri a kezét, de nem gondolta volna, hogy ennyire meglepi, sőt felzaklatja ennek a gondolata. -… lányommá fogadom, és pénzt iratok magára. Így meglenne az indok, hogy itt maradhasson. Olyan átkozottul puccos esküvője lehet, amilyet csak egy magafajta nőszemély akarhat… amennyiben nem mond le arról a bolondságról, hogy férjhez megy – tette hozzá. Eliza úgy érezte, Higgins tőrt forgatott a szívében. Szinte biztos volt benne, hogy most egy szerelmi vallomás következik. Elvörösödött. Nem tudta eldönteni, hogy ő volt- e ennyire önhitt, vagy Higgins-e ilyen reménytelen eset. Szerette volna megragadni őt, és addig rázni, amíg végre nem lesz hajlandó beszélni az érzéseiről. Megjelent szemében egy-két könnycsepp, és minden igyekezete ellenére csendesen szipogni kezdett. Higgins ösztöne azt súgta, hogy megint valami rosszat mondott, majd miután felfogta szavainak értelmét, magában szitkozódni kezdett. Átkozta magát a hülye szavaiért. Tudta, hogy megbántotta Elizát… megint. - Felejtse el az előbbi mondatomat. Nem mondtam semmit. – gyorsan a földre szegezte a tekintetét- nem mondtam… nem mondtam semmit. – Vigasztalóan Eliza vállára tette a kezét, aki gyorsan összeszedte magát, mintha semmi sem történt volna. Ekkor Higgins leeresztette kezét és az ajtó felé sétált, majd megfordult. - Sajnálom Eliza, de most itt kell hagynom magát, hogy elintézhessek egy-két pitiáner dolgot. Erről később még beszélhetünk, hogyha szeretne. Maradjon, ameddig csak akar. Szóljon Mrs. Pearce-nek , vagy a szakácsnőnek, hogy szolgálják fel a teát, esetleg egy kis süteménnyel… a cselédek számára nyílt titok, hogy maga rajong az epertortáért, és Mrs. Pearce biztosan tud szerezni . Higgins szája csintalan mosolyra húzódott és kuncogva hozzátette: - Pickering valószínűleg meg fog éhezni, mire visszaér. Ő is égre-földre keresi magát, tudja? Nagy riadalmat okozott szegény öreg rókának. – Eliza ránézett, nagy szomorú szemeivel, ami szégyenkezést és megbánást tükrözött, így arcáról lehervadt a mosoly, és lassan közeledett Eliza felé. Szinte már illetlenül közel húzódott hozzá. Érezte a lány meleg leheletét az arcán, és a kellemes rózsa-parfümjének illatát. Te jó ég, hogy nem tudta eddig értékelni ezt a csodálatos virágot… - Eliza? - Professzor úr? - Örülök, hogy itt van – mondta csendesen, inkább magának, mintsem Elizának, azután – ami mindkettejüket meglepte - csókot lehelt a homlokára. Pár hosszú másodpercig egymás szemébe néztek. Habár jó barátok voltak, a kapcsolatuk nem volt elég szoros egy ilyesfajta csókhoz. Higgins lebiggyesztette alsó ajkát, és sietős léptekkel távozott. Eliza, álmodozó, szomorú, tekintettel meredt utána. Megérintette azt a helyet, ahol Higgins megcsókolta. Leült arra a székre, amin a professzor negyed órája ült némán meredve maga elé. SZERETTE Henry Higgins professzor urat, és tökéletesen tisztában volt vele, hogy érzései viszonzásra találtak. Azért jött vissza, mert képtelen volt haragudni rá. Nem azért jött vissza, hogy felhánytorgassa neki a múltat, a sérelmeit, hanem, hogy újrakezdjenek mindent, a legelejétől. Azonban egy percig se gondolja az a mogorva vén kecske, hogy könyörögni fog neki, vagy hogy a lába elé fog borulni! Bizony ám, neki kell megtennie az első lépést. Henry Higgins kilépett a bejárati ajtón, annyira belefeledkezve gondolataiba, hogy elcsúszott a bejárati ajtóhoz vezető lépcsőn. - Franc! Franc! Franc! Franc! - kiáltott fel, majd körülnézett, remélve, hogy senki sem látta ezt az apró botlását. Amikor úgy látta, hogy tiszta a levegő, felállt, leporolta magát, és ismét a gondolataiba merült. Szinte biztosra vette, hogy Eliza vissza fogja utasítani az Eynsford-Hill-fiú ajánlatát, függetlenül attól, hogy mit mondott a dolgozószobában korábban. Namármost, a kettejük közötti vonzalom nyilvánvaló volt mindenki számára, aki látta már őket együtt. Fél órával ezelőtt még biztosra vette, hogy soha többé nem fogja őt látni, és habár most az egyszer még megbocsátott neki, még Eliza türelmének is van határa. Eliza egy vonzó, fiatal hölgy volt, aki – hála neki- hibátlanul beszélte az angolt. Ahogy az anyját ismerte, ragaszkodni fog hozzá, hogy Eliza ostoba, felszínes, sznob társaságokba járjon, ahol ostoba, felszínes, sznob emberekkel találkozik. Még ha az a Freddy-gyerek el is kotródik Eliza közeléből, lesz majd egy másik, aki majd megpróbál a közelébe férkőzni… amit nem szabad engedni. Nem azért tanította, nem azért tartotta el, nem azért beszélgetett vele, nem azért maradt fenn vele hajnali négy óráig, hogy ez a kis teremtmény elpazarolja frissen szerzett tudását a Freddy-féle pojácákra. Undorral gondolt azokra a bamba-képű, üresfejű senkikre, akik a vezetéknevükön kívül semmi értékeset nem tudnak felmutatni... Ő maga, személy szerint már megszakította a kapcsolatot mindenféle bájgúnárral. Tekintve a társadalmi rangját, és a munkájában elért sikereit, ezt senki sem róhatta fel neki. Tökéletesen ismerte a fajtájukat. Ők nem nőkbe voltak szerelmesek, hanem magába a szerelembe. Bálványként imádtak egy szerencsétlen nőt, de amint már elmúlt az újdonság varázsa, kerestek egy másik nőt és így tovább… de még jobban gyűlölte a buta, naiv, fiatal lányokat, akik bedőltek ezeknek az olcsó trükköknek: virágok, szavak, ígéretek, ál-vallomások, csókok, esti szerenádok, értékes kacabajkák, és olcsó kacatok. Az egyetlen lehetséges mód arra, hogy távol tartsa Elizát a Freddy-féléktől az, hogy... hogy ő maga kéri meg a kezét. Ő! A megrögzött, vén agglegény házasságra adja a fejét… természetesen csak Eliza boldogsága érdekében. Annyira még ő sem volt öntelt, hogy letagadja maga előtt a tényt, hogy igenis szüksége van Elizára, és ha boldogulni tudna is nélküle- márpedig tudna- nagyon nehezen, és kínkeservesen működne. Talán- de csak talán- azt a kijelentést is megkockáztatná, hogy az elmúlt hat hónap alatt ő lett a legfontosabb személy az életében. Eddig még fel se fogta, mennyire nyílt titok volt, milyen egyértelmű volt minden közös ismerősük és barátjuk számára, hogy mennyire odavolt Elizáért. Milyen ironikus, hogy pont ő tudta meg utoljára, hogyan érzett iránta igazából. Sosem tartotta magát romantikus alkatnak. Sosem élvezte az antik gondolkodásmódot a szerelemről, Shakespeare romantikus drámáit, Byronnak meg annak a magyar Petőfinek a szerelmes verseit, akármennyire is elismerte zsenijüket. Túl sokat élt már ahhoz, hogy higgyen az ilyen botorságokban… de Eliza végtére is csak nő, aki értékeli az ilyesmit. Szentimentális gesztusok, szép szavak, bókok, ajándékok… végül is biztosan létezik egy egészséges határ a giccs és a közömbösség között. Talán kezdhetné egy csokor virággal… mondjuk rózsa. Hihetetlen, hogy öt perccel ezelőtt simán elment volna mellette, és most legszívesebben minden vázájába rózsát rakatna. Talán el is vihetné színházba… szegénykének alig volt alkalma eljutni oda, pedig nagyon tetszett neki. Talán elkérhetné az édesanyjától a nagyanyja jegygyűrűjét Eliza számára, amivel megkoronázhatná az estét. .. jaj ne, kezd ő is olyan bolondos lenni, mint azok az érzelgős szamarak. - Higgins, öreg cimborám, azt hittem maga is Eliza után indult- Henry legszívesebben ráordított volna a hang tulajdonosára. Hogy merik őt megzavarni, amikor épp a jövőjét tervezgeti? De amikor ismét visszatért a valóságra, látta, hogy cimborája, Pick szól hozzá. Mosolyogva rázott vele kezet. - Pick, de jó, hogy itt van! Képzelje, Eliza visszajött! Pick arca elképesztő örömöt és megkönnyebülést sugárzott. - Visszatért… mmikor… és hogyan? Higgins, én már minden lehetséges helyen kerestem, mégis hol bujkált eddig…? - Erre most nincs idő! Szükségem van a segítségére- szakította félbe a fiatalabbik férfi kedélyesen. Abban a pillanatban jelent meg egy üres taxi. Henry őrült módjára rohanni kezdett. – Taxi! Taxi! Ismét Pickhez fordult. -Jöjjön már, Pick! Útközben megmagyarázom. Az öreg ezredes megvonta a vállát, végül mégis barátja után rohant.[Chapter 2] Higgins és Pickering taxiba ülnek, hogy megtegyék az estéhez szükséges \"előkészületeket\". Ezalatt Eliza magára maradt Higgins nappalijában... amíg Freddy be nem toppant. 2 . fejezet : 3 lépés mínusz 3 lépés az... 0 lépés Minden angol ember tudja, hogy Londonban vagy esik, vagy esni fog. Henry és Pick szerencséjére most épp az utóbbi volt napirenden, amikor fél 4-kor megállt a taxijuk Mrs Higgins háza előtt. Mindkettőjük gyomra korgott az éhségtől. A reggelit Elizának köszönhetően kihagyták, az ebédidő is elmúlt már, azonban ezzel egyikőjük sem foglalkozott. Hugh Pickering ezredes úgy érezte, az elmúlt hat hónap alatt sikerült megszoknia cimborája izgága, szeszélyes, néhanapján gyerekes természetét, de úgy érezte, hogy a mai nap még a szokottnál is szórakozottabb volt. Az első fél órájuk azzal telt, hogy körbeautózták Londont, mert Higgins újabb és újabb úti célokat mondott a taxisofőrnek, de az utolsó pillanatban mindig meggondolta magát, és mondott egy másik helyszínt. Először a Covent Gardenben szálltak ki, hogy rózsákat vegyenek. Azonban nem csak egy csokorral: Henrynek az az őrült bogara támadt, hogy telerakja otthoni vázáit virágokkal, de nem volt türelme megvárni, amíg a cselédek elintézik ezt. Amikor Hugh szépen, türelmesen – ahogy egy dacos kisgyerekkel kell beszélni - elmagyarázta neki, hogy nem lenne ésszerű dolog végigmenni a városon rózsák százaival, okosabb lenne egy virágüzletben venni egy csokorral, és kiküldeni a cselédeket a rendeléssel. Higgins kénytelen-kelletlen felismerte saját ötlete abszurdságát. Ennek viszont az lett a következménye, hogy minden üzletben, ahol csak jártak, fitymáló megjegyzéseket tett a boltokra az eladónők füle hallatára. Az egyik üzletben a rózsákkal nem volt megelégedve, az másikban az árakat sokallotta, a harmadikba már be se mert menni, mert szent meggyőződése volt, hogy az épület össze fog dőlni, amint átlépik a küszöbét. Hugh egy darabig igazat adott neki, majd egyre jobban zavarta Higgins kötözködő hozzáállása, de az már mindennek a teteje volt, amikor a professzor rákiabált a boltos kisasszonyra, amiért az képtelen volt kiejteni a „h\", meg az „é\" hangokat. Ekkor Pick megfenyegette Henryt, hogy ha nem hagynak fel London valamennyi világüzletének felkutatásával - és kritizálásával - a nap további részében egyedül kell boldogulnia. Amint kiléptek a virágüzletből, hirtelen felbukkant egy virágáruslány, aki – legalábbis Higgins szerint - a leggyönyörűbb fehérrózsákat árulta, amik csak léteztek. Ördög tudja, honnan szerezhette, közönséges virágáruslányok ritkán jutnak rózsákhoz. A tanár úr, tőle szokatlan udvariassággal vett tőle egy szép csokorral, sőt még meg is toldotta a kifizetett összeget egy shillinggel. A következő lépésben ékszerboltok után nyomoztak. Henry ugyanis a fejébe vette, hogy az édesanyja semmi esetre sem adná neki a nagyanyja gyűrűjét, és inkább maga választ neki egyet. Viszont egyik gyűrű sem nyerte el tetszését. Nem volt megelégedve a mai divat ékszereivel, mert túlságosan flancosnak és közönségesen hivalkodónak találta őket. Eliza egyszerű, hétköznapi lány volt, és Henry szerint nem volt szüksége hatalmas ékszerekre ahhoz, hogy kitűnjön a tömegből. Meg aztán, elég furcsa hatást keltett az ékszerboltokban, amikor másodmagával megjelent egy ékszerüzlet ajtajában, és bejelentette, hogy eljegyzési gyűrűt kíván vásárolni. Végül mégiscsak az eredeti tervnél maradtak, miszerint Mrs. Higgins édesanyjának gyűrűjét fogják elkérni. Higgins azt is kirívónak és csúnyának találta, de legalább családi örökség volt. Henry még ragaszkodott hozzá, hogy taxizzanak el Drury Lane-be, mert a következő előadásra szeretett volna 2 jegyet vásárolni. Elizával eddig csak háromszor voltak színházban. Jelenleg Shakespeare Macbeth-je volt műsoron, ami az egyik személyes kedvence volt. Pick hiába győzködte, hogy a Drury Lane délután 3 órakor nincs nyitva, a professzor kötötte az ebet a karóhoz. A végén persze ő lepődött meg a legjobban, amikor zárba találta az ajtókat. Toporzékolni tudott, átkozódni, hogy hogy mer ez a színház zárva lenni, amikor Neki - Henry Higgins professzornak - szüksége van 2 jegyre. Ahogy telt az idő, Pick egyre mélyebb és mélyebb lélegzeteket vett, néha behunyta a szemét, elszámolt magában 10-ig, olyan lassan, amilyen lassan csak bírt. Viszont, amikor több majdnem 3 órás, értelmetlen városnézés után üres kézzel jelentek meg Higgins édesanyjánál, közel állt hozzá, hogy teljesen kijöjjön a sodrából. Éppen hogy megállt a taxi, Henry szinte kiugrott az járműből, a bejárati ajtóhoz rohant, és durván dörömbölni kezdett rajta. Teljesen elfeledkezett arról, hogy talán ki kéne fizetni a sofőrt, ami így természetesen az idős férfira maradt. Mrs Ellen Higgins nagyon szerette a fiait, habár már kiskoruktól kezdve ráébredt, hogy minél kevesebbszer látja őket, annál jobban kijön velük. Mind a ketten kiváló koponyák voltak, gyerekként is kifejezetten eszesnek számítottak. Az idősebbik fiút, Hermant már kiskorától kezdve jobban érdekelte a teológia, mint az átlagos kisfiúkat és kislányokat. Amíg más gyerekek Jonathan Swiftért, Verne Gyuláért, Andersenért, és Dickensért rajongtak, az ő kedvenc könyve a Biblia volt. Az iskolában kiemelkedett a latin nyelv iránti kiváló érzékével és szenvedélyével. Ellen kimondhatatlanul meg volt elégedve a fiával, amiért - ellentétben a korabeli gyerekekkel - képes volt olyan hatalmas önfegyelemre a templomban, ugyanakkor volt abban valami természetellenes, hogy fiú létére szinte alig követett el csínytevéseket. Szerette az embereket, szeretett segíteni mindenkin, aki bajban volt. 10 éves koráig sorra hozta haza a megsebesült állatokat, Mr. és Mrs Higgins nem kisebb bosszúságára. Minden jólelkűsége és szónoki tehetsége ellenére zárkózott, magának való, ideges alkatú férfi lett belőle, akivel - bárhogy is igyekeztek - sem az édesapja, sem édesanyja nem tudott kialakítani szorosabb kapcsolatot. 15 éves kora óta tudta, hogy belőle lelkész lesz. Annak ellenére, hogy az egyház engedélyezte papjainak a házasságot, Herman olyan lelkesedéssel, és olyan imádattal végezte a munkáját, hogy Ellen számára egyértelmű volt, hogy idősebbik fia sosem fog megnősülni, sem unokákkal megajándékozni őt. Talán a bátyja gyámoltalansága, és önfeláldozó személyisége, valamint édesapja korai halála okozhatták azt, hogy a kisebbik gyermeke, Henry annyira arrogáns és egocentrikus lett. Henry még alig volt 10 éves, amikor az édesapja elhunyt, a bátyjával való kapcsolatában is inkább ő volt a dominánsabb fél. Nagybátyja nem volt, a nagyszülőkkel nem ápoltak kifejezetten jó viszonyt, így nem volt számára se mentor, se példakép, akire felnézhetett volna, akit követhetett. Apja halálakor – mindössze 10 évesen! - rájött, hogy ha boldogulni akar az életben, nem számíthat senkire se, csak magára… meg esetleg az édesanyjára. Nyilván ezért vetette meg a felsőosztály tagjainak többségét. A Higgins-név is előnyösnek számított Londonban, de ő a mesterségéből és szorgalmából élt meg, és nem érte be egy jó hangzású vezetéknévvel, meg egy szerencsés csillagzat alatt született emberekből álló baráti körrel. Mindig is törtető alkat volt, aki számára a cél mindig szentesítette az eszközt. Ellen titokban úgy vélte, hogy részben emiatt volt képtelen szorosabb kapcsolatokat kialakítani - pláne megnősülni! Henry számára mindig fontosabbak voltak a saját vágyálmai, a hobbija, mint egy másik személy vagy annak érzései. Bizony ám, ha valaki fontos személy jelen van az életünkben, néha félre kell tennünk a saját egónkat, meg a céljainkat, azért, hogy a másiknak örömet szerezzünk… tudomása szerint Henry erre képtelen volt. Gondolataiból ezúttal Rose, a szobalány zökkentette ki. Magas, fekete hajú, 20 év körüli lány volt. Csinos teremtés. - *{Henry úr van lent, Pickering ezredes úrral - jelentette a szolgálólány. Ellen felvonta a szemöldökét. A fia ritkán látogatja meg, arra meg még sosem volt példa, hogy egy nap kétszer is betoppanjon hozzá. - Csak engedje fel őket. Rose beljebb lépett és halkan folytatta. - Henry úr olyan állapotban van... azt gondoltam, kérem, jó lesz, ha szólok. Mikor a szobalány távozott, Mrs Higgins szomorúan elmosolyodott. - Ha azt jelentette volna, hogy Henry úr nincs \"olyan állapotban\", jobban meg volnék lepve. Azt hiszem, a fiam elvesztett valamit… vagy valakit. Henry beviharzott a fogadószobába, kalappal a fején, Pickering szorosan a nyomában loholt. Mint ahogy Sara is mondta, \"olyan állapotban van... \"} - Mama! A gyűrű… a nagymama gyűrűje… kell... most! – mondta lihegve. - Eliza… visszajött… nem megy hozzá Freddyhez… kell neki egy gyűrű… - HENRY! Hagyd abba! – kiáltotta magán kívül Mrs. Higgins. Henry anyja szavára azonnal elhallgatott. Ezt látva Mrs Higgins elégedetten mosolygott. - Rendben. Most gyere ide! Henry értetlenkedve és habozva bár, de odament hozzá - Először is vedd le kalapodat! Nem illik… - Henry duzzogva levette. - Most vegyél egy nagy levegőt! - A férfi engedelmeskedett. - Most pedig fújd ki! - Hatalmas sóhaj hallatszott. - Most megint vegyél egy nagy levegőt! - Henry nagy levegőt vett. - Most pedig fújd ki… Az édesanyja még ötször megismételtette Henryvel ezt a légzésgyakorlatot, majd gyengéden megszólalt: - Rendben van, kedvesem. Most mondd el, hogy mi a baj! - Eliza visszajött a házba, és közölte, hogy valószínűleg nem megy férjhez Freddyhez, így Pickeringgel kerítettünk egy taxit, hogy megtegyünk néhány… nos… előkészületet… - Három órán keresztül jártuk a várost! Egy nyavalyás rózsacsokron kívül semmire sem mentünk, ráadásul meg se merem mondani mennyi pénzt pazaroltunk ma el csak a taxizásra! Hála az égnek, egyikünk sem szenved pénzhiányban, de az értelmetlen költekezés híve sem vagyok. Ne haragudjon, hogy ezt mondom, de Henry ma nem viselkedett sem ésszerűen, sem úriemberhez méltóan. Felháborító volt, ahogy azzal a szegény lánnyal elbánt a virágüzletben! Higgins feje vöröslött. - A kutyafáját, ne engem hibáztasson, csak azért, mert fonetikatanár létemre nem bírom elviselni, ha valaki képtelen szép kiejtéssel beszélni! Főleg, ha egy boltoskiasszonyról van szó, akinek pedig különösen tudnia kellene, hogy hogyan hangzik a hibátlan angol nyelv! Mrs. Higgins már nem értett semmit sem. - Elég legyen! Mindkét agglegény elhallgatott. - Henry, mégis mire kell neked az édesanyám jegygyűrűje? Annak idején világosan közölte velem, hogy csak akkor adhatom át, ha te… - Itt az idős hölgynek elharapta a mondat végét, majd kitörő örömmel Henry nyakába borult és megcsókolta az arcát. - Ó Henry! Ó Henry! Ezt a napot is megértem! Henryt egyre inkább zavarta ez az ölelkezés, és finoman elhúzódott az anyjától. - Igen, Mama tudom, tudom! Egyikünk sem gondolta volna, hogy megéri ezt a napot. De nem kell belőle nagy ügyet csinálni. Elvégre csak azért kérem meg Eliza kezét, mert… Mrs. Higgins szeme kitágult, és nyitott szájjal meredt a fiára. - Henry, ugye nem azt akarod mondani, hogy te meg Eliza csináltatok valami illetlen dolgot? - kérdezte olyan hanggal, mintha előre félne a választól. Henry mélyen megsértve és hitetlenkedve meredt vissza. - Dehogyis, Mama! Hogy feltételezhetsz ilyet? Azt akartam mondani, hogy csak azért akarom elvenni, mert… nos mert nem akarom, hogy a Freddy Eynsford-Hillhez hasonló komolytalan kölykök játszadozzanak az érzéseivel… Mrs. Higginst kezdte szórakoztatni ez a beszélgetés. - Tehát feláldozod az annyira szeretett agglegény-életformádat, csak azért, hogy megmentsd szíved hölgyét a szerelmi csalódásoktól? Sose hittem volna, hogy ilyen önfeláldozó tudsz lenni – gúnyolódott. - Ne csúfolódj velem! Tudod, hogy mennyire nehezemre esett meghozni ezt a döntést? És Eliza nem a szívem hölgye! - tette hozzá dacosan. - Hadd kérdezzem meg, Henry: Szereted te azt a lányt? Henry abban a pillanatban talált valami nagyon érdekes dolgot a padlón, amit bámulhatott, miközben a kezei a kalapjával játszottak. Majd gyorsan felkapta a fejét. - Ha tudni akarod, igen! Lehetséges, elképzelhető, hogy érzek iránta valamit, deee, elsősorban nem emiatt akarom feleségül venni. - Hanem, hogy megóvd az arra méltatlan fiatalemberek csodálatától… tudjuk Henry - bólogatott Mrs Higgins, és alig bírta leplezni a mosolyát, majd megnyomta az íróasztalon lévő csengőt. Rose szinte azonnal meg is jelent, a számára meglehetősen unszimpatikus „Henry úrtól\" tisztes távolságot tartva. - Csengetett asszonyom? - Rose, legyen szíves, és keresse meg édesanyám gyűrűjét! Henry úr el szeretné vinni magával. És kérem, találjon mellé egy szép ékszerdobozt is! Egy tisztességes londoni háztartásban a teaidő negyed ötkor kezdődött, ám Eliza pár perccel előbb már élvezhette a forró, gőzölgő teát, az ízletes süteményekkel. Ahogy Higgins professzor is megmondta, külön Eliza számára félre volt téve pár szelet a város legfinomabb epertortájából. Mrs Pearce volt olyan kedves, és mindent megtett, hogy Eliza vendégként is jól érezze magát a Higgins-háztartásban. Igazán megszerette azt a kislányt, csakúgy, mint minden jóérzésű ember, aki találkozott vele. Még most is úgy bántak vele, mintha ott élt volna. Habár már három órája üldögélt magában, azért el tudta foglalni magát. Az elmúlt hat hónapban megismerkedett a Bronte-nővérek műveivel, amiket szabadidejében nagy buzgalommal olvasott. Jelenleg a lowoodi árva és Mr. Rochester viharos, különleges szerelméről olvasott. Nagyon tetszett neki. Mrs Pearce jelent meg a szalonban. - Miss Doolittle, Mr Eynsford-Hill vár az ajtó előtt, és szeretne önnel beszélni. Megmondhatom neki, hogy fogadja? Hogy fogadja? Eliza nem tudta, mit tegyen. Elvégre, ez már nem az ő otthona volt, így semmi joga nem volt bárkit is vendégül látnia. - A tanár úr biztosan nem venné zokon, hogyha maga itt fogadná az ismerőseit - mosolygott a házvezetőnő. Eliza végül habozva bólintott, ami nem volt túl illedelmes gesztus. Néhány pillanattal később megjelent az ajtóban Freddy, a szokásos rózsacsokorral a kezében, amik ezúttal is sárgák voltak. Eliza - immár úrihölgyhöz illően - felállt a tiszteletére. - Drága Eliza! Nem sokkal ebéd után kerestem a jó Mrs Higginsnél, de ő azt mondta, hogy ön visszajött a professzor úr otthonába. Jöttem volna korábban is, de nem bírtam ellenállni, és vettem magának egy csokor virágot... tudja, akárhányszor rózsát látok, kegyed jut az eszembe. A rózsa a legeslegszebb, és a legeslegillatosabb virág a földön. Freddy a szerelemtől égve adta át Elizának a csokrot, aki egy zavart mosollyal köszönte meg, és a legközelebbi vázába tette. - Kérem, üljön le, Freddy! A fiatalember leült, szorosan Eliza mellé, és két kezével, könnyedén, de határozottan megfogta Elizáét. - Ó Eliza, ma reggel Byron egyik versét olvastam. Annyira csodálatos volt, annyira magamra ismertem benne, hogy ott, helyben megtanultam. Kérem, engedje meg, hogy elszavaljam Önnek! Mielőtt Eliza válaszolhatott volna, Freddy letérdelt, megköszörülte a torkát, és szenvedélyesen belefogott: \"Forrás folyóba ömlik, folyó az óceánba; az egeknek folyton özönlik vegyülő suhogása; magány sehol; isteni jel s rend, hogy minden tünemény keveredjék valamivel - Mért ne veled én? A hegy csókolva tör égbe, habot hab ölel, szorít, átfog; egymást ringatva, becézve hajlonganak a virágok; a földet a nap sugara, a hold a tengereket: minden csókol... - S te soha engemet?** \" Eliza most már kifejezetten zavarban volt. Egyrészt terhesek voltak neki a fiú szinte már túlságosan romantikus udvarlási kísérletei, másrészt minél több időt töltöttek együtt, annál kevésbé volt szíve kiadni az útját… márpedig erre akkor volt a legjobb alkalom. Higgins, arcán különös, széles mosollyal lépett be a ház ajtaján, kezében a fehérrózsákkal, zsebében az ékszerdobozzal. Egyedül jött haza. Pickering - bármennyire is kedvelte Higginst - a mai nap után képtelen lett volna akár 10 percet is eltöltetni barátjával a nap hátralevő részében, ezért egy halaszthatatlan találkozóra hivatkozva odébbállt. - Mrs Pearce ! Mrs Peace gyanakvó arccal fogadta munkaadóját. - Uram? - Doolittle kisasszony még itt tartózkodik? - Igen, uram. Jelenleg a szalonban van Mr. Eynsford-Hill-lel. Higgins önelégült, magabiztos képet vágott. - Pompás, igazán pompás Mrs Pearce! Kérem, készítse elő Eliza valamennyi alkalmi ruháját ma estére! A nők olyan kiszámíthatatlanok, hogyha öltözködésről van szó… - De uram, Miss Doolittle elvitte valamennyit, még reggel. Nem emlékszik? Higgins úgy nézett az idős asszonyra, mintha mély álomból ébredt volna. - Ó, persze tényleg! Röpke csönd után, Higgins ismét elővette fölényes stílusát. - Miért áll még itt, Mrs Pearce? Elmehet… Mrs Pearce sértetten, de méltóságteljesen biccentett. - Uram - mondta és ezzel bevonult a konyhába. Higgins halkan odalopakodott a szalon ajtajához, és az ajtóhoz nyomta a fülét. - Ó Eliza, maga egy igazi angyal. Csak egyszer mondja ki, hogy hajlandó hozzám jönni, és a világ legboldogabb férfijává fog tenni. Drága, drága… - hallatszott Freddy hangja. A tanár úr forgatta a szemét, de tovább hallgatózott. - Nekem bőven elég, hogyha bólint. Most egy női hangot hallott, ami lehervasztotta a mosolyát. - Ó Freddy, maga igazán egy vonzó, kedves, édes ifjú. Nem emlékszem, hogy bárkitől kaptam volna ennyi szeretet, és higgye el, nem tudnék olyan lányt mondani, aki ne tenné össze a kezét egy ilyen emberért, mint ön, de… Hirtelen csönd. Higgins nem bírta tovább, és belesett a kulcslyukon. Freddy és Eliza forrón ölelkeztek az Ő kanapéján. Higginsnél betelt a pohár. Durván kicsapta az ajtót, és a lehető legfennköltebb hangján megszólalt, a szétrebbenő párocska megrökönyödésére. - Gratulálok, Eliza. Ritka manapság az olyan hölgy, aki ilyen szívélyesen fogadná a férfi barátait. Habár nem túl illendő vendégeket fogadni másvalaki házában. Majdnem elhagyta a helyiséget, de előtte még Freddyhez fordult: - Örültem, Mr. Hill – biccentett, szándékosan „Mr. Hillnek\", nem pedig „Mr. Eynsford-Hillnek\" szólítva őt. Ezzel a végszóval faképnél hagyta a meghökkent Freddyt és a szégyentől vöröslő Elizát. A színházjegyek feledésbe merültek. Aznap délután egy fiatal virágáruslány nagy gonddal készített rózsacsokra a szemetesben landolt, és egy idős úriasszony nagy gonddal óvott családi ékszere egy íróasztal egyik keveset használt fiókjának legalján végezte… dobozostul. Remélem tetszett. Itt van egy kis útmutató: *A { és } közötti szöveg George Bernard Shaw: Pygmalion c. színművéből származik, kicsit átszerkesztve ;) ** A vers címe: A szerelem filozófiája. Ez a vers igazából Shelley-é, direkt írtam Byront. Ezzel is csak Freddy komolytalanságára, és ál-műveltségére akartam rámutatni. Ui: KRITIKÁT ! PLEASE ![Chapter 3] Ez a fejezet inkább leíró. Elmagyarázza, hogy ki hogyan élte meg a második fejezet óta eltelt 7 hónapot. Amikor egy helyben ácsorgunk Az elkövetkezendő hónapokban, a Higgins és Liza közötti szikra egyre csak erősödött, azonban ezt a szikrát már nem a vonzalom vagy a szerelem, sokkal inkább a sértettség és a néma düh táplálta. Lassan 7 hónapja történt, hogy Higgins látta Elizát Freddyvel csókolózni a díványon, de azóta sem emlegette az esetet sem az anyja, sem az ezredes előtt. Így az utóbbi kettő számára rejtély maradt, hogy miért mérgesedett el közöttük a viszony. Hugh Pickering – magát tapintatos, illemtudó embernek gondolva - csak késő este érkezett haza, azonban nem egy turbékoló szerelmespárral találta szembe magát, hanem egy felzaklatott házvezetőnővel, meg egy zsémbes agglegénnyel. Amikor megkérdezte Higginstől, hogy hol van Eliza, ő csak annyit felelt, hogy a széttaposott káposztalevélnek nem volt elég a Freddy nyújtotta társadalmi rang, neki pénz is kellett, így az anyja nyakán fog élősködni. Az est további részében kétszer lehordta az egyik szobalányt, mert a szódásüveg üres volt, és mert a vacsora 10 percet késett. A második alkalommal olyan durva szavakkal illette, hogy szegény lány majdnem elsírta magát. A következő napokban még rosszabb lett a helyzet: Higgins többször elaludt, ennek következtében lekéste a találkozóit, lemondta az előadásait, és többször megríkatta a személyzet női tagjait. Nem volt ritka, hogy idegenekkel is gorombán bánt: ha például tanítvány, vagy vendég érkezett hozzá, jobbik esetben rendetlenül felöltözve, morcosan jelent meg, rosszabbik esetben – gyönyörű kiejtéssel, de alpári szavakkal - kijelentette, hogy most nem kíváncsi rájuk, nem akarja őket látni, és „eltakarodhatnak\" olyan helyekre, amiket fizikailag lehetetlen lett volna megközelíteni. Ettől az új, elviselhetetlenül otromba szörnyetegnek a kirohanásaitól - akit továbbra is Henry Higginsnek hívtak – még az édesanyja, az ezredes, és Eliza se menekültek meg. Pickkel – mint egyetlen igaz barátjával, és azzal a valakivel, aki modora ellenére még kedvelte – nem mert újat húzni, és a kora iránti, valamint rangjából adódó tiszteletből sértegetni se merte. Viszont Hugh sem úszta meg teljesen Henry kitöréseit, aki még az ő jelenlétben se fékezte magát: tőrt-zúzott, ha valami nem tetszett neki, minden apró hiba miatt szidalmazta a szolgálókat, kénye-kedve szerint mondta le a találkozókat, és úgy káromkodott, mint még soha. Amikor cimborája csitítóan, békítően szólt hozzá, a tanár úr csak megvonta a vállát, de láthatóan nem volt hajlandó változtatni a modorán. Pick természetesen nem szándékozott élete végéig barátja vendégszeretetével élni, ami a fogadás lejártával nem is lett volna jogos. Eliza szökése óta kereste Londonban a tökéletes házat, megfelelő alkalmazottakkal, aminek a folyamatát Higgins bogarai csak gyorsították. 1 hónapra rá meg is találta a számára ideális ingatlant, ahol egy házvezetőnő, egy komornyik, kettő lakáj, egy szakácsnő, egy mosogatólány, és kettő szobalány biztosította a kellemes otthont egy öreg, megfáradt, nyugalmazott katonának. Az édesanyját eleinte elkerülték Henry személyiségváltozásának következményei. Ezt a „kiváltságot\", részben szülőanyai mivoltának köszönhette, részben annak, hogy arra a pár hétre, amíg befogadta Elizát, Henry szinte teljesen megszakította vele a kapcsolatot. Amikor a lány beköltözött abba a lakásba, amit Pick vett neki, a látogatások száma ismét a normális kerékvágásba zökkent, de a sors mindig úgy hozta, hogy Henry és Liza az első két hónapban mindössze egy-két alkalommal, utána viszont már hetente látták egymást az anyja fogadódélutánjain. Az idős asszony nagyon örült volna annak, hogyha a „két civakodó gyermek\" – ahogy magában nevezte őket – még véletlenül sem jelent volna meg ugyanazon a fogadódélutánon. Egyrészt, mert nem bírta nézni a kettejük néma szenvedését és már a kibékülés gondolata is lehetetlennek látszott, másrészt – amit különösen sajnált – a fia a csipkelődő megjegyzéseivel elriasztotta szinte valamennyi barátját. Kebelbarátnője, Mrs. Eynsford-Hill felé se nézett már, azóta, amióta Henry először tett egyértelmű, becsmérlő megjegyzést Freddyre és a lányára, Clarára. Nemegyszer fordult elő, hogy az idős asszony maga szólította fel távozásra Henryt. Higgins Elizával szemben ritkán emelte fel a hangját… már ha szólt hozzá. Általában, ha egy légtérben tartózkodtak, a professzor úgy tett, mintha egykori diákja ott se lenne. Továbbra is élcelődött azon, hogy Eliza az ő anyjánál lakik, majd, mikor már elköltözött és Pickering pénzén virágboltot nyitott, lakást vásárolt, és az ezredes mindig megmentette a csőd szélén álló „üzletasszonyt\", azon, hogy Eliza az idős úriember pénze nélkül semmire se menne, de úgy fogalmazta meg mondatait, mintha a lány a helyiségben se lett volna, mintha egy kívülálló személyről mondott volna véleményt. {*Kedvenc, de ritkán felhozott témája azonban a maga és a Freddy intelligenciája közti tátongó űr volt. Egyedül akkor vesztette el az önuralmát, amikor Eliza közölte eredeti tervét, miszerint ő is fonetikatanár lesz. Higgins éppoly hévvel tiltakozott ellene, mint első alkalommal. Azt mondta, hogy Liza tízévi stúdium nélkül ne is álmodjon arról, hogy az ő nagyszerű szakmájába avatkozzék.} A lány ekkor elhallgatott, és nem hozta fel többet a témát Higgins pár hónap elteltével azon kapta magát, hogy nagyon is élvezte az Elizával való találkozásokat, még akkor is, ha különben nem szóltak egymáshoz. Hiányzott a parfümjének az illata, ahogy ránézett a nagy, barna szemeivel, még a rossz kiejtését is el tudta volna viselni, feltéve, ha hozzá intézi a szavait. Néha már szándékosan provokálta Elizát, sorra dobta neki a magas labdákat, mohón várva, hogy lecsapja valamelyiket. Igazából már nem is volt mérges a lányra, de a büszkesége, a sértett önérzete nem engedte, hogy még egyszer ő legyen a kezdeményező. Élete legkellemetlenebb, és leghaszontalanabb napjának tartotta azt, amelynek a délelőttjét Eliza megkeresésével, a délutánját pedig Eliza feleségül kérésének megszervezésével töltötte. Ha jobban meggondolta, egész kényelmesnek találta a helyzetet. Az elmúlt egy hónapban hetente látták egymást, mivel mindig úgy ügyeskedett, hogy egyazon fogadódélutánon vegyenek részt. Eliza néha felelt neki, még ha nem is túl illedelmes hangnemben… de legalább szólt hozzá. Egy haragos, szemtelen Eliza, akit heti rendszerességgel látott még mindig elviselhetőbb volt, mint egy illemtudó, csendes Eliza, aki csak az emlékeiben létezett... Eliza lelkében hatalmas paradox helyzet uralkodott. Akárhányszor közös helyiségben tartózkodott Higgins professzorral, mindig sikerült úgy megbántania, hogy szerencsétlen lány alig bírta visszafojtani a könnyeit. Mégis, szinte alig várta, hogy újra láthassa. 7 hónap elteltével is szégyenérzettel, és tüskével a szívében gondolt vissza arra a végzetes délutánra. Freddy váratlanul betoppant Higgins professzor szalonjába. Fehér rózsákat hozott neki ajándékba, és elszavalta neki Shelley egyik szerelmes versét – amit a fiú tévesen Byronnak tulajdonított -. Épp készült neki megmondani, diszkréten, a tőle telhető legnagyobb udvariassággal, hogy igazán megtisztelőnek tartja, hogy éppen őt tünteti ki szerelmével, de el kell utasítania az ajánlatot, amikor Freddy váratlanul, hevesen, a fiatalokra jellemző forró szenvedéllyel megcsókolta. A fiú ajka először az ajkát találta meg, majd a lány nyakára vándorolt. Egyik keze a derekát ölelte át, a másikkal a mellét fogdosta. Liza ruhája lenge volt, és könnyű anyagból készült, így érezhette Freddy kezének tapintását… Jobban belegondolva, talán az ő hibája volt… talán túl előzékeny volt vele szemben. Talán nem volt a legjobb döntés olyan kifejezéseket használnia, mint „vonzó, édes ifjú\", vagy, hogy „nem tudnék olyan lányt mondani, aki ne tenné össze a kezét egy ilyen emberért, mint ön\" egy lánykérés visszautasításánál. Igazság szerint nagyon tetszett neki Freddy. Fiatal volt, jóképű, udvarias, valamint tőle megkapta mindazt a szeretet, törődést, és figyelmet, amit annak idején az apjától, később Higginstől várt volna el. Tudta, hogy ha hozzámenne, Freddy királynőként bánna vele… amíg van elég pénzük. Viszont ismerte az ilyen fiúkat. Minden nap más lánynak udvarolnak. Nem mintha tisztességtelen szándékaik lennének, csak nem ismerik fel a különbséget a vonzalom, és az igaz szerelem között. Az ilyen típusú fiúkból sosem lesz igazi férfi, életük végéig kisgyerekek maradnak, akiknek túlságosan irreális, túlságosan „rózsaszín\" elképzeléseik vannak a szerelemről és a házasságról. Az apja és az anyja példájából tudhatta, hogy sokkal fontosabb, hogy egy férj támaszt nyújtson a feleségének, hogy segítse, támogassa, minthogy körülrajongja… és ilyen ember volt Henry Higgins. Sosem bókolt neki, jó szót is csak akkor kapott, amikor ténylegesen rászolgált, modortalan volt, követelőző, és parancsolgató… de képes volt felnőttként élni, ha a sors arra kényszerítette. Ő is felső osztálybéli volt, de senkitől sem várta el, hogy pusztán ezért felnézzen rá. Higgins tudta, hogy a pénz és a hírnév nem a fán terem… igen, a professzor egész életében keményen dolgozott azért, hogy megbecsüljék. Eliza ezért nagyon tisztelte őt, habár sosem mondta ki hangosan. Női ösztönei megsúgták, hogy Higgins sosem hazudna neki, hanem megmondja, ha valamit jól csinált, illetve, ha valamit elhibázott. Továbbá azt is sejtette, hogy ha Higgins egyszer szerelmet vallana neki, vagy megkérné a kezét, és ő igent mondana, a professzor másnap nem vonná vissza a szavait. „Azt hitte, elsüllyed szégyenében, amikor meglátta Higginst a szalonja ajtajában, miközben őt Freddy csókolgatta. A professzor arcáról se nem harag, se nem düh, inkább lenézés és megvetés sugárzott. Eliza legszívesebben odarohant volna hozzá, térden állva kért volna tőle bocsánatot, és heves magyarázkodásba kezdett volna. Amit egyelőre képes volt felfogni, az annyi volt, hogy Higgins már nincs a szalonban, ő nem állt fel, és nem rohant oda hozzá, hanem még mindig ült, ugyanabban a testtartásban. Freddy szorosan tartotta a kezét, és csak beszélt hozzá. Nem hallotta egyetlen szavát sem, nem értette mit mond. Látva Eliza érdektelenségét, a fiatalember végül megköszörülte a torkát, valami olyasmit motyogott, sajnálja a történteket, és jobbnak látja, hogyha most távozik, majd kisétált az ajtón. Mikor végre egyedül maradt a szobában, megpróbálta rendezni a gondolatait. Ha most bemegy a férfihoz, az valószínűleg őrjöngeni és szitkozódni fog. Okosabb lenne most hazamennie, és majd holnap visszajönne, hogy hideg fejjel folytathassák a beszélgetést, ami még délután abbamaradt… Minden igyekezete és józan gondolkodás ellenére, a lábai – mintha önálló aggyal rendelkeztek volna – maguktól indultak el, és a professzor keresésére indultak. Amikor azonban kilépett a hallba, Mrs. Pearce sietett elé. - Eliza, a tanár úr éppen az emeleten van. Azt üzente magának rendkívül sajnálja, de közbejött néhány sürgős elintéznivaló, amiket nem tud elhalasztani, és hálás lenne, ha most távozna. Liza számára egyértelmű volt, hogy Higgins egyáltalán „nem sajnálja rendkívül\", és nem is „jött közbe néhány sürgős elintéznivaló\", de azért, naivitást színlelve, megkérdezte: - Higgins professzornak lesz egy kis ideje holnap? - Sajnálom, de a professzor úr azt mondta, hogy holnap is rengeteg dolga lesz. - És… és holnapután? - Higgins tanár úr szerint a közeljövőben minden nap el lesz látva teendőkkel. Liza bánatosan mosolyodott maga elé. Annak is jobban örült volna, ha az úr kiabál vele, vagy lehordaná, vagy kékre verné… de hogy meg se hallgatja? Hogy nem engedi magyarázkodni? - Kérem! Muszáj lenne beszélnem vele, csak öt percig. Az öreg házvezetőnő csak megcsóválta a fejét. - Gondolom, Mr. Higgins tud magára szánni 5 percet. De ha az úr mégis kizavarná, ne mondja, hogy én nem figyelmeztettem magát! Ezzel a mondattal odébbállt. Eliza nagyot nyelt, összeszedte maradék bátorságát és méltóságát, és megpróbálta előre megfogalmazni magában a Higginshez intézett szavait. A következő pillanatban egy férfihangot hallott: - Mrs. Pearce, remélem megmondta annak a nőszemélynek, hogy nincsen rá se időm, se energiám, és kotródjon el. A korosodó agglegény épp akkor jött le a lépcsőn, hetykén és vidáman. Amikor Mrs. Pearce helyett Elizát pillantotta meg, egy másodperce megállt a lépcső közepén, majd folytatta útját, de már sokkal lassabban és sokkal inkább habozva, mint magabiztosan. - Úgy látszik, a házvezetőnőm nem szólt magának. - Higgins professzor, ami a szalonban történt… Higgins azonban félbeszakította. - Eliza, mielőtt magyarázkodni kezdene, szeretnék magától bocsánatot kérni. Eliza zavartan pislogott. Hogy Higgins bocsánatot kér tőle? Ilyen még sosem fordult elő. - Amikor először jelentette be, hogy Freddy felesége akar lenni, úgy ellenkeztem, mintha lenne beleszólásom. Én vagyok sem, az apja, sem a gyámapja, sem akármilyen rokona, hogy bíráljam a döntését. Nézze, maga már nem gyerek, ha úgy gondolja, hogy Freddyvel boldogan tudná leélni az életét, legyen. Az egyetlen ember, akinek joga van ellenkezni, az az apja, de ahogy megismertem – bocsásson meg – örülni fog, hogy megszabadul magától. Én – és az ezredes -, mint jó barátai mindössze annyit tehetünk, hogy sok sikert kívánunk az ifjú párnak, és ha van is véleményünk, jobban tesszük, ha megtartjuk magunknak. Liza úgy kapaszkodott bele a lépcsőkorlátba, mintha az adna neki magabiztosságot. - Professzor úr, EGYÁLTALÁN nem áll szándékomban feleségül menni Freddyhez. Ha pár perccel később jött volna, elég időm lett volna kiadni szerencsétlennek az útját. Az egykori virágáruslány belenézett a professzor barna szemébe, és ugyanazt az izgatottságot vélte felfedezni, amit pár órával ezelőtt, a dolgozószobában látott. Talán most jött el a nagy pillanat? Talán most fog végre kibújni burokból, amiben eddig élt? Higgins azonban felvonta a szemöldökét, megtörve a varázst. - Vagy úgy? Manapság ez a szokás? Először megcsókoljuk az áldozatot, utána meg porig alázzuk? Ilyenkor adok hálát az égnek, hogy nem vagyok húsz évvel fiatalabb. - Tudja Eliza, én már nem vagyok fiatalember. Ennél fogva, nem igazán ismerem a mai, divatos udvarlási szokásokat. Remélem, el tudja nekem nézni. El kéne fogadnom, hogy manapság az a módi, hogy a hölgyek azonnal a kiszemelt fickó karjaiba vetik magukat, akár magukban vannak, akár nyilvános helyen, akár másvalaki szalonjában. De azért, arra megkérhetem, hogy az anyám szalonjában ne fogadjon férfilátogatókat ilyen… hogy is fogalmazzam… kitörő lelkesedéssel? Tudja, ő már egy idősebb hölgy, aki akármennyire is rugalmas és intelligens, nehezen bírja elfogadni a mai fiatalok szerelmes megnyilvánulásait. Eliza legszívesebben szétverte volna a fejét. Hát persze! Ez nem egy romantikus regény, sem egy színdarab, itt nincsen katarzis. A „bocsánatkérés\" mindössze egy mézesmadzag volt, amit elhúzott az orra előtt, hogy aztán kedvére szapulhassa egyetlen rossz lépéséért. - Tanár úr, én soha… - Vagy lehet, hogy nem is annyira divat kérdése az egész? Lehetséges, hogy ez a kacér viselkedés a vérében van? Vagy ezt is az iskolában tanulta? Akkor nem is csodálkozom, hogy a munkásosztály nem tanult meg helyesen beszélni, ha az oktatási rendszer erre sokkal nagyobb hangsúlyt fektet. Mi a tantárgy neve? „Hogyan húzzuk le a felsőréteget?\" vagy pedig „Hogyan találjunk egy gazdag idiótát, aki hajlandó velünk frigyre lépni?\". Gondolom az édesapja ebből a tantárgyból kivételesen kitűnőre vizsgázott… Higgins nem tudta befejezni a mondatát, mert egy hatalmas pofon csattant el az arcán. Eliza szemében könny volt, az ajkai pengevékonyak voltak, de nem szólt egy szót se. Stevensnek, a komornyiknak, tökéletes érzéke volt hozzá, hogy mikor jelenjen meg a legváratlanabb, legalkalmatlanabb percekben… ez is egy ilyen volt. - Elnézést Uram, de Pickering ezredes telefonált, és érdeklődött, hogy sikerült-e színházjegyeket szerezni az esti előadásra. A tanár úr és Liza egy emberként fordultak Stevens felé. Tekintetük gyilkoló volt. - Miféle színházjegyek, Stevens? Ne beszéljen hülyeségeket! – Higgins a lányhoz fordult. – Maga készült színházba, Eliza? Eliza nem felelt. - Mi az, gyermek? Elvitte a cica a nyelvét? Nem kíván mondani valamit, mielőtt eltakarodik a házamból? Eliza nagy levegőt vett, és egyenes tartással, büszke léptekkel hagyta el a házat. „ A következő heteket Mrs. Higginsnél töltötte. Annak ellenére, ami közte és Higgins között történt, az édesanyjával remekül kijött. Volt abban az asszonyban valami finomság, valami elegancia, valami úri modor, ami a fiából teljes mértékben hiányzott. Ráadásul volt annyira jól nevelt, hogy sose hozta fel Higginst, vagy a köztük lévő kapcsolatot, pedig Eliza mérget vett volna rá, hogy majd' megöli a kíváncsiság. A professzor egyébként, azokban az időkben messzire elkerülte Mrs. Higgins otthonát. Nem látogatta meg, még csak nem is telefonált. Liza eleinte nem is bánta, tekintve, hogy a seb, amit tőle szerzett még túl friss volt. Viszont Pickering ezredes sem jelent meg náluk egy darabig, amit a lány nagyon sajnált. Apjaként szerette az idős katonát, és csak remélni merte, hogy nem neheztel rá a szökése miatt. *{Annál nagyobb volt az öröme, amikor Pickering egy nap váratlanul betoppant, és kissé pirulva kérdezte meg Elizát, vajon végleg letett-e arról a tervéről, hogy virágüzletet nyisson. Liza azt felelte, hogy gondolt ő erre, de aztán kiverte fejéből, mert nem volt rá elég pénze, az agglegényektől pedig nem mert volna kérni, annyira szégyellte magát, amiért azon a bizonyos napon minden szó nélkül távozott.} Azt persze ügyesen elhallgatta, miért nem áll szóba Higginssel. Nem sokkal azután, hogy az ezredes házat vásárolt magának, ketten együtt kerestek, majd vásároltak egy takaros, de az előző tulajdonos által csődbe jutott virágüzletet, felette egy aprócska, de tűrhető lakással. *{Az üzlet bizony egy ideig csak bukdácsolt, egyszerűen azért, mert Liza nem értett az üzletvezetéshez. Igaz, a lány tudta már az olcsóbb virágok nevét, árát. Szerencséjére ráragadt valami Milton nyelvéből, egy kevéske latintudással körítve, mikor Higginssel együtt a döntő ütközetre készült. Ez a latintudás nem volt valami sok, de épp elég arra, hogy kisilabizálja a virágok szakjegyzékét. Sajnos, ezenkívül semmit sem tudott. Habár meg tudta számolni a pénzt, egy számlát már képtelen lett volna megírni, anélkül, hogy gyalázatos hírbe ne keverje a céget. Latintudománya, hogy \"Balbus épített egy falat\" és \"Gallia három részre oszlott\", távolról sem segítette hozzá a legcsekélyebb kereskedelmi ismeretekhez sem. Még azt is Pickering ezredesnek kellett megmagyaráznia, hogy mi fán terem a csekk-könyv meg a bankszámla. S mindezt nem volt könnyű a leány fejébe verni. Ennek ellenére makacsul szembeszegült ama bölcs javaslattal, hogy - csupa takarékosságból is - legjobb lesz egy hozzáértő könyvelőt fogadni. Hogy lehetne pénzt megtakarítani azzal, ami újabb kiadást jelent - így okoskodott -, hiszen már a meglevő kiadások mellett sem tudnak nyeregben maradni. De az ezredes - miután újra meg újra nyeregbe segítette őt - végül is kedvesen, de határozottan sarkára állt. Lizát már porig alázta, hogy minden hónap végén tőle kell pénzt koldulni, így hát végül is be kellett látnia, hogy a kereskedelmet éppúgy tanulni kell, mint a fonetikát. Hadd ne ecseteljem azokat a siralmas estéket, melyeket Liza kereskedelmi kurzusokon fecsérelt el, együtt tanulva a gyorsírást, gépírást, könyvelést, mindenféle, elemi iskolák padjaiból jött hím- és nőnemű írnokjelöltekkel egy sorban. A különféle kurzusokra való járás a szégyen és kétségbeesés időszaka volt számára. Hiába, sehol sem tanítottak semmit a virágüzletekről. Végül is föladta a küzdelmet, s búcsút mondtak gyorsíró-tanfolyamnak, Kereskedelmi Iskolának, Közgazdasági Akadémiának - mindörökre. De közben az üzlet, titokzatos módon, magamagától menni kezdett. A fiatal leány valahogy már nem idegenkedett attól a gondolattól, hogy alkalmazottakat fogadjon. Egyre inkább úgy érezte, hogy ez az ő sajátos módszere a legjobb, s hogy valami különleges tehetsége van a kereskedelemhez. Az ezredes, aki fenntartott bankszámláján egy bizonyos összeget az üzlet deficitjének fedezésére, egyszer csak azt vette észre, hogy a támogatás felesleges: Eliza boldogul. Igaz, hogy némileg könnyebb helyzetben volt, mint más szaktársai. A hétvégi kirándulások költsége nem az ő gondja volt, s így a vasárnapi ebédek árát is megtakaríthatták. Az ezredes ilyenkor fizette a hotelszámlát és az útiköltséget.} Érdekes módon, amint Eliza kiköltözött Mrs. Higgins házából, abba a lakásnak nevezett lyukba, a Higginssel való találkozások száma fokozatosan nőtt. Az első két hónapban csak egyszer-kétszer botlottak egymásba, idős barátnője fogadódélutánjain. Higgins minden alkalmat megragadott, hogy felemlegesse „sikerét\" a munka mezején. Természetesen egyes szám, harmadik személyben beszélt Lizáról, és úgy tett, mintha a lány siket lenne. Elizának ezt még többé-kevésbé sikerült lenyelni, hiszen a professzornak végül is igaza volt. (Azt is hozzá kell tenni, hogy Mrs. Higgins minden egyes alkalommal feldobta a napját, akárhányszor úgy vélte, a fia viselkedése túlment minden határon, és elküldte a házából. ) *{Egyszer hozta ki a sodrából egykori tanárát, úgy igazán, amikor ismételten bejelentette, hogy fonetikát fog tanítani, és elszegődik Kárpáthy professzorhoz, asszisztensnek. Biztosra vette, hogy Higgins ott, helyben fel fog robbanni, és élvezettel nézte a dühkitörését. Egyébként, nem találta volna jogosnak, hogy Higgins beleegyezése nélkül hasznosítsa a tőle kapott tudást. Az ő szemében ez a tudás éppúgy Higgins tulajdona volt, mint, mondjuk egy zsebóra. Rajongva ragaszkodott két mesteréhez, a virágbolt megnyitása után még őszintébben és melegebben, mint azelőtt.} A történtek ellenére Freddyvel továbbra is jó kapcsolatot ápolt. A fiú gyakran fordult meg az üzletében, hogy virágot vegyen az aktuális hölgy számára. Ilyenkor mindig elbeszélgettek. Ahogy azt várta, a fiú 1 hónapon belül már egy másik lányt tartott „élete nagy szerelmének\". Egyszerre mulatott magában, és egyszerre sajnálta a következő „áldozatot\". Freddy, Clara, és Mrs-Eynsford-Hill eleinte rendszeresen megjelentek a fogadódélutánokon. Eliza kedvelte Clarat bohóságaival és szeszélyeivel együtt,*{viszont a két Higgins szemében afféle nevetséges, kellemetlen perszóna volt - tulajdon anyja szemében pedig valami érthetetlen rejtély, valami társadalmi tévedés volt.} Mrs Higgins volt annyira illedelmes, hogy kedvesen bánjon a lánnyal. Ugyanakkor, a professzor gúnyolódásának állandó céltáblája volt Clara és Freddy gyerekes gondolkodásmódja. Eleinte egyik Eynsford-Hillnek sem esett le, hogy Higgins belőlük csinál viccet, majd harmadik-negyedik alkalommal nyíltan a szemükbe mondta, hogy Freddyt „komolytalan kölyöknek\", Clarat pedig „szemtelen, buta libának\" tartja, Mrs. Eynsford-Hill elájult, Freddy olyan erővel ütötte meg, hogy Higginsnek 2 hétig kellett viselnie a monoklit a szeme alatt - Eliza a mai napig azt tartja élete legjobb napjának -. A professzor jutalma természetesen a kiutasítás lett. Attól a naptól kezdve egyikőjük sem látogatta Mrs Higginst. Akárhogy is történt, Freddyék távozása után a professzor már nem csak havonta, de hetente jött el az édesanyjához. A lány eleinte furcsállotta, hogy mindketten egyazon napon jelentek meg, de később szinte imádkozott azért, hogy Higgins-szel találkozhasson. Annak ellenére, hogy néha a pokolba kívánta a megjegyzéseivel együtt, hogy néha a sírás szélén állt a sértegetései miatt, a lelke mélyén nagyon is boldoggá tették ezek a konfliktusok… A csillaggal jelölt, { és } közötti szövegekrészletek G. B. Shaw Pygamlionjából származnak. Nem akarok „plagizálást\" elkövetni, de azt tudni kell, hogy a My Fair Lady-t a Pygmalion alapján írták meg. Gondoltam, „hűebb\" lesz a történet, ha tartom ezt a jó szokást. ;)[Chapter 4] Higgins teljesen kifordult magából, amit barátai és ismerősei egyre kevésbé viseltek el. Továbbra is Eliza maradt a kedvenc céltáblája. Már csak az a kérdés, hogy szegény lány meddig tűri a szidalmakat. Sok millió lépés hátra, ugyanannyi előre - *{Higgins professzor úr – szólalt meg bátortalanul egyik délután Mrs. Pearce, miután a tanár úr csúnyán összeveszett egyik tanítványával, aki háborogva és szitkozódva távozott az irodából. - Mit akar mondani, Mrs Pearce? – kérdezte Higgins, provokáló hangon. - Arra szeretném kérni a tanár urat, hogy mostantól válogassa meg a szavait a diákjai meg a vendégei előtt. Mr. Sheridan volt a héten a harmadik tanulója, aki felmondott magának. - Mindig meg szoktam válogatni a szavaimat. Mit akar ezzel? – komorodott el Higgins. - Nem, a tanár úr egyáltalán nem szokta megválogatni a szavait, mikor nem talál valamit, vagy ha egy kicsit ideges. Nekünk mindegy, mi már megszoktuk. De idegenek előtt igazán nem volna szabad káromkodni. - Én káromkodom?!- méltatlankodott a férfi, majd kirobbanva folytatta. - Soha a büdös életben! Ki nem állhatom a káromkodást! Mi a nyavalyát akar ezzel mondani? - Csakis ezt, tanár úr- válaszolta egykedvűen Mrs. Pearce.- Nagyon sokat tetszik káromkodni. Éntőlem káromkodhat, cifrázhatja, hogy mi a nyavalyának, hol a nyavalyában, ki a nyavalya... - Jól hallok, Pearce-né?! Ilyen szavak a maga ajkán?! - ... de van egy bizonyos szó - nagyon kérem, hogy ezt ne használja. Ma reggel hallottam egy csavargótól, aki elbotlott egy kőben. Ugyanolyan betűvel kezdődik, mint a kő. Ő nem tehet róla, már az anyatejjel szívta magába ezt a szót, de nem szabad, hogy a házon kívül ilyet a tanár úr szájából halljanak. Higgins könnyedén felelt: - Igazán nem vádolhatom magam, hogy valaha is kimondtam azt a szót. Mrs. Pearce állhatatosan nézett a szemébe, mire Higgins rossz lelkiismeretét fölénnyel takarva hozzátette: - Kivéve talán, ha néha nagyon izgatott voltam. - Csak éppen ma reggel, tanár úr. Háromszor mondta: kávéra, a kuglófra és a késre. - Ó, az csak alliteráció volt, igazán érthető egy költői léleknél – legyintett az agglegény. - Már akárhogy is tetszik hívni, nagyon kérem, hogy mások előtt ne tessék többet kimondani azt a szót, mert így elveszítheti az összes ügyfelét. - Helyes, helyes, van még valami? - Megkérhetem akkor, hogy ne fogadja többet a tanítványait, és a vendégeit slafrokban, vagy legalább ne használja szalvétának a slafrok ujját olyan rendszeresen, mint eddig. És ha lenne olyan kedves és nem enne minden fogást ugyanabból a tányérból, és nem tenné a használt leveseskanalat a tiszta abroszra.. Biztosan tetszik emlékezni, hogy a múltkor is majdnem meg tetszett fulladni attól a halszálkától, ami a gyümölcsízbe keveredett. Stevensnek orvost kellett hívnia. És emiatt kellett lemondanom az időpontját azzal az angol úriemberrel, aki a telefonban nagyon mérgesen reagált. - Lehet, hogy szórakozottságból megtörténik velem az ilyesmi néha, de semmi esetre sem szokásom. Mérgesen hozzátette: - Egyébként a slafrokomnak kiállhatatlan benzinszaga van. - Természetesen, tanár úr, és ha a zsíros ujjait ezután is beletörli a... - Jó, jó ezután majd a hajamba fogom törülni! – kiabálta türelmét vesztve Higgins. - Remélem, nem tetszett megsértődni, tanár úr? A férfi teljes mértékben felháborodott, hogy házvezetőnője őróla valami barátságtalan érzelmet is fel mert tételezni. - Dehogy, dehogy! Teljesen igaza van, Mrs. Pearce. Nagyon fogok vigyázni magamra. Nem lenne szerencsés, ha idegeneknek, vagy a jövőbeni diákjaimnak rossz véleménye lenne rólam. Van még valami?} Mrs Pearce szégyenkezve lehajtotta a fejét, hogy elrejtse a szája sarkában húzódó mosolyt. - Csak ennyi lenne, uram. Ha most megbocsát, el kell küldenem Jennie-t a fűszereshez. - Elmehet, Mrs. Pearce. Higgins leült a dolgozószobája íróasztalához, és a lábát feltette az asztalra. - {Ennek a nőnek a legfantasztikusabb rögeszméi vannak rólam. Világéletemben félénk, szemérmes ember voltam. Sohasem éreztem magam igazi, félelmetes felnőttnek, mint a többi nagyokos. De Mrs. Pearce szentül hiszi, hogy én valami erőszakos, basáskodó, zsarnok vagyok. Fogalmam sincs, honnan veszi…} Összeráncolta a homlokát, és belenézett a noteszába. - Igaz is ma kedd van – gondolta. - A mama mostanában keddenként tartja a fogadónapjait. Ha sietek, és tudok fogni egy taxit, még időben odaérhetek. Mintha Pickering említette volna, hogy ő is megy… vajon Eliza is ott lesz? Remélem, Freddy ma sem teszi be a lábát az anyám otthonába. Még csak az kéne… Felpattant a helyéről, és felszáguldott az emeletre. A „mamája\" külön kérésére tiszta inget vett fel, és nyakkendőt cserélt. Pár perc alatt indulásra készen állt. Mint egy nagy gyerek, lerohant a lépcsőn, kis híján fellökve a felfelé igyekvő Mrs. Pearce-t. - Mr. Higgins, hova indul? Higgins hirtelen megállt, és fenyegetően hangnemre váltott - Mégis mi köze ahhoz, hogy hová megyek?! - Tanár úr, a következő diákja 10 percen belül itt lesz. Higgins megvonta a vállát. - Mondja meg neki, hogy sürgős dolgom akadt… az anyám fogadódélutánjára kell mennem. - Le akarja mondani? De hiszen az… Higgins összeszűkült szemmel, vészjósló képpel indult el az asszony felé: - Az? - Előbb… - Előbb? - Utaltam arra, hogy… - Hogy? Mire, kedves Mrs. Pearce? A házvezetőnő belátta, hogy veszett ügyért harcol. Lemondóan sóhajtott. - Semmire, uram. Szólni fogok neki, amint megérkezik. - Nagyon helyes, nagyon helyes. Higgins az ajtóhoz sietett, és megpróbálta kinyitni, majd feszegetni. Viszont az ajtó makacsul zárva maradt.. Akkor vette észre, hogy nincs a zárban a KULCS. - HOL VAN AZ A… KULCS?! Mrs. Pearce már ott állt mögötte, kezében az apró, vékony, díszes KULCCSAL. - Parancsoljon, ha ezt keresi. Higgins idegesen heherészett, és kikapta a nő kezéből a kulcsot. Berakta a zárba, elfordította, de az ajtó most sem akart kinyílni. A professzor kezdte elveszíteni a türelmét, és teljes erővel tolta, ütötte-verte. Mrs Pearce megköszörülte a torkát. - Tanár úr… talán próbálja meg húzni az ajtót. Higgins maga felé húzta az ajtót, ami ezúttal engedelmeskedett. Szúrósan nézett Mrs. Pearce-re. - Köszönöm, Mrs. Pearce. Kellemes, napsütéses délután volt aznap. Mrs. Ellen Higgins** mégis a szalonjában fogadta barátait és ismerőseit. Az idős hölgynek hatalmas gyakorlata volt az illemben, az előzékenységben, és a bájcsevejben. Akárhányszor újabb vendége érkezett, elnézést kért a többiektől, felállt, és a jó előre begyakorolt, széles mosolyával kezet fogott velük. Idősebbik fia, Herman*** hangja szinte könyörgően bocsánatkérő volt a telefonban, amikor egyházi teendőire hivatkozva lemondta a látogatást. Ellennek sok idejébe telt, amíg biztosította Hermant, hogy tökéletesen megérti a helyzetét, és hogy első a kötelességteljesítés. Amikor lerakta a telefont, csak megcsóválta a fejét. Szánta őt szerencsétlenségéért. Ez alkalommal Pickering ezredes is megtisztelte jelenlétével. Kedvelte őt, mert mindig nagyon tisztelettudóan viselkedett. Annak ellenére, hogy Indiában hatalmas vagyonra tett szert, és számos kitüntetést érdemelt ki, nem volt se arrogáns, se fölényes. Titokban remélte, hogy talán jó hatással lesz Henryre a személyisége… sajnos tévedett. Eliza jelenlétének egyszerre örült, és egyszerre bosszantotta is. Abban az időben, amikor a lány még nála lakott, igencsak közel kerültek egymáshoz. Eliza mesélt neki az apjáról, a mostohaanyjáról, és a megboldogult édesanyjáról. Megtudta, hogy Elizának nagyon nehéz, és szomorú élete volt. Ebből a szempontból tisztelte a fiát, amiért kiemelte „az utca mocskából\", másrészt , Eliza hátterének ismeretében, különösen igazságtalannak érezte Henry bánásmódját a lánnyal kapcsolatban. Értelmes, intelligens személynek tartotta, akit egyszerűen képtelenség volt nem szeretni. Ugyanakkor, annak sosem volt jó vége, ha Henryvel egy szobában tartózkodott. Henry előszeretettel emlegette a lány múltját, vagy a nem létező üzleti érzékét. Szerencsére Eliza nem tette tönkre a hangulatot azzal, hogy valami otrombaságot feleljen neki, de Ellen érezte, hogy csak idő kérdése, hogy a lány mikor fog besokallani. Henry – ahogyan várható volt – késett, és eltúlzott, fennhéjázó viselkedésével, gesztusaival sikeresen magára vonta a társaság figyelmét. Fia megjelenése egyáltalán nem okozott neki megelégedést. - Henry… számítottam rá, hogy jössz. Mrs Higgins a látszat kedvéért felállt, és hagyta, hogy a fia arcon csókolja. Majd kettő, új ismerőséhez fordult: - Mr. Livingstone és Mr. Livingstone, hadd mutassam be önöknek a fiamat, Henryt. James és William Livingstone ikrek voltak. Magas, vállas, izmos, 25 éves fiatal férfiak voltak. Habár arcvonásaik nem egyeztek meg, skót gyökereiknek köszönhetően sűrű, vörös hajuk, és kék szemük volt. A tekintetükben és a mosolyukban volt valami megnyerő, valami ellenállhatatlan, amivel szinte mindenki szimpátiáját azonnal el tudták nyerni… kivéve talán Higgisnét. Szinte egyszerre álltak fel, hogy üdvözöljék a professzort, aki mindössze kurtán biccentett nekik. A két fiatalember érdekes módon egyedül Eliza közelében talált alkalmas ülőhelyet. - Képzelje, Higgins, – kezdte Pickering – Mr. és Mr. Livingstone távoli rokonai Dr. David Livingstone-nak, a híres skót orvosnak, aki felfedezte a Viktória-vízesést. - Tanultam történelmet, Pickering. Tudom, hogy ki volt Dr. Livingstone – morogta Higgins. – Azonban ÉN nem szeretek az őseim tollával ékeskedni. Mrs. Higgins finoman megszorította Henry karját. - Ugyan már, Henry… - Semmi baj, Mrs. Higgins – szólalt meg William. – Mi sem szeretjük hangoztatni, hogy milyen híres emberek tartoznak a családunkhoz. Habár mérhetetlenül büszkék vagyunk rá, amiért ki tudott emelkedni a munkásosztály soraiból, és a Londoni Misszionárius Társaság tagja volt… Henry csettintett a nyelvével, így Mrs. Higgins szorítása már fájdalmasan erős volt. - De nem szeretünk vele kérkedni – tette hozzá James, Elizához fordulva – annak ellenére, hogy a legtöbb hölgyet érdeklődéssel tölti el. Különösen az olyan gyönyörű és kellemes nőket, mint kegyed, Miss Doolittle. Eliza elpirult a bók hatására, amit a tanár úr nem vett jó néven. - Tudja Miss Doolittle, - tódította William – annak ellenére, hogy csak pár perce ismerjük egymást, elmondhatom, hogy mindhármunkban van egy közös vonás: elődeink, szorgalmuknak, szerencséjüknek, és éles eszüknek köszönhetően kiemelkedtek a szegénységből, és jelentős vagyonra, hírnévre, és megbecsülésre tettek szert. Az ön édesapja, Mr. Doolittle sem szégyelli, hogy valaha szemetesként kereste a kenyerét, most meg becsületes, tisztes, középosztálybeli polgárnak számít… - Hahaha! Tudnék én olyan történetet mesélni Alfred Doolittle-ről, amitől az egész bagázs haja égnek állna! – csattant fel Higgins. - Henry, viselkedj, vagy kiküldelek a szalonból! – motyogta félig nyitott szájjal Mrs. Higgins. Az ikerpár elengedte a füle mellett ezt a megjegyzést. - Büszke lehet az édesapjára, Miss Doolittle – mosolygott William. – Nem sok ilyen ember akad a földön, aki ki tud lépni az önnön árnyékából… - Az is vagyok, Mr. Livingstone. - Kérem, - esdekelt a férfi- hívjon Williamnek! - Engem meg Jamesnek – tette hozzá a fivére. – Ilyen rokonlelkek, mint mi, szinte testvéreknek számítunk. Eliza úgy gondolta, illene viszonoznia a gesztust. - Köszönöm James, köszönöm William. Én viszont hálás lennék, ha Elizának szólítanának. - Micsoda megtiszteltetés, Miss Doolittle… illetve Eliza. - Csatlakozom az előttem szólóhoz. Mindhárman nevetni kezdtek. Henry úgy érezte, az ikerpár teljes mértékben elvetette a sulykot. Hogy képzeli ez a két vadidegen, hogy az anyja házába furakodik, és ezzel az átlátszó, elbájoló, előre begyakorolt szöveggel elcsavarják Eliza fejét?! Ráadásul, Elizának nincs joga őket bátorítani! Legszívesebben felrobbant volna a méregtől, de végül az elmúlt évben elsajátított taktikájához fordult. Nyájasan mosolygott Elizára: - Eliza, mindig öröm látni, micsoda érzéke van hozzá, hogy megtalálja a közös hangot a legkülönbözőbb emberekkel. - Hát… köszönöm, professzor úr – hangzott a tétova válasz. Higgins most a két fiatalemberhez intézte szavait: - Uraim, tisztában vannak vele, hogy ez a bájos hölgyemény rendkívül jó kapcsolatot ápol a felső osztály férfitagjaival? Pickering ezredes egy időben különösen nagy figyelmet szentelt neki… - De Higgins! Ez szemenszedett hazugság! – vágott közbe Pickering. - Észrevették, hogy mostanában egyre kevesebbszer esik? Micsoda szerencse, gyűlölöm az esőt. A sok napsütés különben is jót tesz az egészségünknek – próbálkozott Mrs. Higgins. Eliza lehajtotta a fejét és egyik kezével átfogta a másik alkarját. Higgins professzor számos alkalommal megbántotta már mások előtt, de az még sosem fordult elő, hogy a tisztességére tegyen kétértelmű megjegyzéseket nyilvános helyen. - Tanár úr! Tudja jól, hogy én tisztességes lány voltam világéletemben – nézett fel az agglegényre, felháborodottan. Higgins egyre jobban belelovallta magát. - Ezzel mind tisztában vagyunk, Eliza. Maga tisztességes lány. Különösen Freddy Eynsford-Hillel volt előzékeny és tisztességes. Higgins szinte már kiabált. - Tisztességesen elfogadta a szerelmét, előzékenyen hagyta, hogy ölelgesse, majd amikor rájött, hogy szegények, mint a templom egere, eldobta, mint egy divatjamúlt kalapot! Ezt is a „Hogyan találjunk egy gazdag idiótát, aki hajlandó velünk frigyre lépni?\" nevű óráján tanulta, a munkásosztály iskolájában? Higgins természetesen tudta, hogy ezeknek a mondatoknak a fele sem volt igaz, de akkor, ott annyira jó érzés volt ezt hinnie. - FOGJA BE A SZÁJÁT, MAGA VADBAROM! – ordította Eliza. A összes vendég – férfiak és nők egyaránt – egyszerre fordultak Eliza irányába. Higgins levegő után kapkodott, Mrs. Higgins felállt, és a szívéhez kapott, Pickering ezredes a szája elé emelte a kezét. Eliza felpattant a helyéről. Teste remegett a dühtől és az izgalomtól. Keze ökölbe szorult. Orcáján már megjelent egy-két könnycsepp. Tudta, hogy botrányosan fog viselkedni, de nem törődött vele. - Hónapok óta rajtam köszörüli a nyelvét! De ma túllépett minden határon! Ma betelt a pohár! Elegem van magából, maga, maga… soha többé nem akarom látni! Dögöljön meg ott, ahol van! Elmegyek, és soha többet nem jövök vissza! Azzal kiviharzott a szalonból. Szeme vörös volt a sírástól. A szobában pár percig néma, feszült csend uralkodott. Pickering hirtelen felállt, és Higginshez fordult: - Miss Doolittle-nek igaza van, Higgins. Magam sem értem, miért tűrtem meg önt eddig. Állandóan sértegeti szerencsétlen nőt. Talán azért hallgattam eddig, mert úgy véltem, nem tartozik rám, ami maguk között folyik. Nézze, én megpróbálta elviselni magát, mert a barátomnak tartottam… de a lány jól mondta: „Maga egy vadbarom\" – már bocsánat a kifejezésért. A továbbiakban nem kívánom tartani a kapcsolatot önnel… és a barátságára sem tartok igényt. Pickering megigazította a mellényét, és kezet fogott Mrs. Higgins-szel. - Elnézését kérem, asszonyom, a kirohanásomért. Ön nagyszerű hölgy, de mostantól nem veszek részt a fogadódélutánjain, amennyiben Henry is itt lesz. Ha megbocsátanak, megpróbálom utolérni Miss Doolittle-t. Alászolgája. Ekkor elhallgatott, mintha azt fontolgatná, kimondja-e, ami az eszébe jutott. - Szívemből sajnálom, hogy ilyen fia van, mint ő. Az emberek jobbnak látták, hogy távozzanak. A két Livingstone azonnal felállt, és bokros teendőikre hivatkozva elszeleltek. A többiek, hogy ne legyen szemet szúróan feltűnő, nem egyszerre, hanem 5-10 percenként búcsúztak el, de azért így is egyértelmű volt a célzás mindenki számára. Amikor kettesben maradt fiával, Mrs. Higgins eltüntette az erőltetett mosolyt az arcától. Leült, a tenyerébe temette az arcát, és elmerengett. Henry úgy érezte, az idő csak vánszorog. Felállt, és zsebre tett kézzel mászkált, kulcsait hangosan zörgette. Mrs. Higgins végül leeresztette kezét. - {Tudod, hogy mit tennél, hogyha tényleg szeretnél? Henry sóhajtott. - Bocsánatot kérnék Elizától, Picktől, és a barátaidtól. Változtatnék a modoromon, és megkérném Eliza kezét. Mrs Higgins szomorkásan elmosolyodott. - Jelenleg arra gondoltam, hogy vedd ki a kezedet a zsebedből, fejezd be a kulcszörgetést, és ülj le… de ne oda! – emelte fel a hangját, amikor Henry le akart ülni a dohányzóasztalra. Henry forgatta a szemét, majd lehuppant egy, az anyjáéhoz közeli karosszékbe.} - Henry, hogy értetted azt, amikor arra céloztál, hogy Eliza és Freddy Eynsford-Hill úrfi „olyan\" kapcsolatban vannak? Láttál valamit? Vagy hallottál valamit? Henry egy pillanatig habozott. - Hát… láttam őket csókolózni az ÉN kanapémon – dörmögte maga elé. Mrs Higgins láthatóan nem tért magához a megdöbbenéstől. Csak pislogott, és zavartan hebegett. - Látod? Ugye, hogy botrányos? - HENRY! - Most meg mi a baj? - Hogy vetted a bátorságot, hogy megvádold Elizát egy ilyen szörnyű dologgal?! Édes fiam, tisztában vagy azzal, hogy sikerült pletykát szítanod Eliza és Freddy Eynsford-Hill ellen?! Szinte biztosra veszem, hogy holnap fél London egy nem létező viszonyt fog kibeszélni! Sem Eliza, sem Freddy nem vehetnek részt egy jobb társaságban, amíg egy ilyen hír érdekesnek számít! Henry megvakarta a feje búbját, és a karfára szegezte tekintetét. - Erre… nem is gondoltam. - Hát persze, hogy nem gondoltál. A te tudásod kimerül a hibátlan angol beszédben, az akcentusokban, és a dialektusokban. Mindenhez ostoba vagy, ami nem fonetika. Mrs. Higgins megharapta alsó ajkát, és teát töltött magának. - Henry, egészen idáig szerettem volna elkerülni ezt a beszélgetést: Tény, hogy sosem sikerült teljesen felnőnöd. Mégis reméltem, vagy annyira érett, hogy meg tudod oldani az Elizával történt nézeteltérést. Elértétek, hogy gyűlöljek fogadódélutánokat tartani. Amióta Eliza is rendszeres vendégem, állandóan bántod, megjegyzéseket teszel rá, teljesen mindegy, hol vagytok. Tehet szegény arról, hogy nem ment neki egy csapásra az üzletvezetés, vagy a kereskedelem? Soha életében nem csinált még ilyet- Az idős asszony a szájához emelte a csészét, és ivott egy kortyot. - Szerencsére Ő volt annyira értelmes, hogy csak akkor szálljon veled vitába, amikor négyesben voltunk… legalábbis eddig a napig. Aláírom, hogy egyáltalán nem viselkedett illedelmesen, vagy helyesen, de ez a kirohanás teljesen várható és jogos volt a részéről. És még örülhetsz, hogy ennyivel megúsztad. Őszintén szólva, csodálkozom, hogy nem esett meg hamarabb. - Eliza, Eliza… miért mindenki őt sajnálja? – csattant fel Henry, majd felállt a székből. - Szegény Eliza így, szegény Eliza úgy… A professzor széttárta a karját és az égre emelte a tekintetét. - Arra bezzeg senki sem gondol, hogy ÉN hogyan érzem magam. Hogy NEKEM hogyan esett, amikor láttam őt Freddyvel enyelegni. Visszaült a karosszékbe, és tüntetően karba tette a kezét, majd sértődötten az anyjára nézett: - Mama, én soha életemben nem voltam udvarlós típus. Fogalmam sincs, hogyan kell romantikusnak lenni. Majdnem egy délutánom ráment arra, hogy olyan legyek, amilyen nem vagyok. Olyan hülyeségekre fecséreltem az időmet, mint virágok, meg programszervezés, meg jegygyűrűválasztás. Henry a kezével a karfát dörzsölte. - Igyekeztem, és kitettem magamért… de tényleg. Erre mit kapok? Amint hátat fordítok, az a kis béka valaki más karjaiba veti magát. Mrs. Higgins gúnyosan felkacagott. - Jajj, Henry! Miért hiszed azt, a nők száz csokor virágra, érzelgős szerelmi vallomásokra, és bálványozásra vágynak a nap huszonnégy órájában? Tény és való, hogy legyezgeti a hiúságukat... az elején. De a harmadik, vagy negyedik alkalommal már fullasztó és kellemetlen lesz ez a folyamatos ajnározás. Egyik végletbe sem szabad beleesni. Eliza annyival is beérné, ha elismernéd a jó tulajdonságait, tisztelettel bánnál venne, figyelembe vennéd, hogy ő is érző lény, és mellette lennél, ha bajban lenne. Ne akard megváltoztatni, ne akarj belőle hercegnőt faragni, mert nem válik azzá, még ha a szerepét ideig-óráig el is tudja játszani. Ő sem akarja, hogy Shakespeare Rómeójaként szeresd, mert akkor az már nem te lennél. Légy olyan, amilyen vagy… egy kicsit több tisztelettel és megértéssel. Ez azon ritka pillanatok egyike volt, amikor Henry hangjában bizonytalanság és alázat hallatszott. - Akkor, mi legyen a következő lépés? - Hát, először is kérj bocsánatot Elizától. Ma még ne, mert a lány valószínűleg még túlságosan zaklatott. Valószínűleg virágot, vagy vázát hajítana feléd – amit mondjuk meg is érdemelnél. Várj vele pár napot. A következő fogadódélutánomra, holnaputánra meghívom az összes mai vendégemet, Elizát és az ezredest is beleértve, valamint az egész Eynsford-Hill családot. Te szépen megvallod előttük a tévedésedet, majd HIVATALOSAN bocsánatot kérsz Freddytől és Elizától, amiért kétértelmű megjegyzést tettél kettejükről… bizony ám, kedvesem – tette hozzá bólogatva, miután Henry felszisszent. Mrs. Higgins vigasztalóan megsimogatta Henry kezét. - Megígérem neked, ha rám hallgatsz, minden rendbe jön. Habár egész életében felnézett édesanyjára kimért viselkedésért, és logikus észjárásáért, mégis ritkán engedelmeskedett neki. A szíve mélyén érezte, hogy anyja tökéletesen átlátja kettejük ügyét, de képtelen volt napokat várni, amíg újra láthatja Elizát. Legszívesebben azonnal odafutott volna hozzá, hogy megkeresse, hogy elmondja neki, hogy szereti, és hogy nagyon sajnálja a szidalmakat, a fölényeskedést, amit a lány tőle kapott osztályrészül, nem csak azon a délutánon, hanem megismerkedésük első pillanatától kezdve. Egész éjjel nyugtalanul forgolódott az ágyában, mert azon gondolkodott, mit mondhatna neki, mik lennének a legmegfelelőbb szavak egy ilyen alkalomra. Éppen ezért jelent másnap reggel, Eliza virágüzletében, szinte nyitáskor. Eliza éppen a pultnál ült, és szorgalmasan körmölt. Hogy írt-e, vagy számolt, nem lehetett tudni. Amint meghallotta a csengőt, nyomban felegyenesedett, és egy jó előre betanult, széles mosollyal megszólalt: - Üdvözlöm tisztelt uram, miben állhatok szolgálatára? Eliza álla leesett, amikor felismerte a férfiban egykori tanárát. Egész testét átjárta a méreg, és a nemrég szerzett seb hasító fájdalma. Dühösen rácsapott az asztalra. - Maga meg keres itt?! Azonnal tűnjön el az üzletemből! Nem vagyok hajlandó egy légtérben tartózkodni magával! - Eliza, kérem… Nem tudta befejezni a mondatát, mert egy cserepes szegfű repült feléje, és a lába előtt tört össze. Majd egy csokor viola hagyott nyomott a falon, amit egy notesz, és egy toll követett… Higgins védekezően a feje elé emelte a kezét, és kihátrált az üzletből. Úgy gondolta, vár néhány percet, amíg Eliza kitombolja magát. Mikor kiért, becsukta maga mögött az ajtót, és várta a megfelelő alkalmat. Nem bírta megállni, hogy ne nevessen a sors iróniáján. - Mint a régi szép időkben - gondolta. – De most legalább a saját holmiját rongálja. *{ A zárójelben található szöveg átírt részlet a Pygmalionból} ** Mrs Higgins neve a második fejezetben még Ethel volt. Én körül-belül úgy számoltam, hogy Mrs. Higgins 1840-es években született, és akkoriban az Ethel nem volt túl divatos. Viszont az Ellen népszerűnek számított akkoriban a felső osztály tagjai között. *** Higgins testvérét a 2. fejezetben Haroldnak hívtam, de ugyanazért az okért átkereszteltem Herman-ra. William és James karaktere csak kitalációk, nem tudok róla, hogy Livingstone-nak lett volna rokona Londonban.[Chapter 5] Tele lesz ömlengéssel vallomással, daccal, és Petrarcával. Négy lépés kb. kétezer szóban 5 perccel később Higgins megkockáztatott egy második belépőt a boltba. Fogadni mert volna rá, hogy a boltban egy megtört, zokogó tulajdonosnőt fog találni. Ehelyett, amint kinyitotta az ajtót, egy, a feje tetejére állított üzletben találta magát. A padlón vágott és kettétört cserepes virágok maradványai, tollak és jegyzetfüzetek hevertek, a fal piszkos volt a virágföldtől, és az íróasztal felborult a hozzátartozó székkel együtt. Higgins még egy betört ablakot is felfedezett. Ennek a felfordulásnak a közepén ott állt Eliza, merev, előkelő tartással, felszegett fejjel, és kifejezéstelen arccal. - Ne haragudjon, professzor úr. Úgy tűnik, egy kissé elragadtattam magam – szólalt meg színtelen hangon. Az egész szituáció annyira groteszk volt: egy fiatal, csinos, elegáns hölgy egy hozzá méltatlan hisztéria után olyan kimérten és közömbösen viselkedik, mintha csak az időjárásról folyna a diskurzus. Higgins nem bírta megállni, kitört belőle egy, az előbbinél sokkal erőteljesebb és hangosabb röhögés. - Elnézést, elnézést… - kacagott – de ez az egész annyira… vicces. Gyorsan a szája elé kapta az öklét és megpróbálta visszatartani a hahotázást.. Szüksége volt pár másodpercre, hogy lenyugodjon. Amikor ismét megtalálta méltóságteljes hangszínét, ránézett a lányra. Ő nem találta ilyen mulatságosnak az esetet. - Keresek egy seprűt, meg egy lapátot, és megpróbálom feltakarítani ezt a rendetlenséget –mondta, kissé lenézően. A seprű és a lapát a sarokban helyezkedtek el. Eliza megragadta a seprűt, és takarítani kezdett. Higgins nekitámaszkodott a falnak egy pillanatra, majd úgy döntött, hogy betársul. Kidobta az egykori ablak üvegszilánkjait, felemelte a széket, utána az asztalt. - Tudja Eliza, a dobótechnikája sokat romlott az elmúlt évben. Többet kéne gyakorolnia – vigyorgott a férfi, miután felállította az asztalt. Eliza ránézett. - Többször kéne összekapnunk. A professzor felült az asztalra és keresztbe tette a lábait. - Eliza, az elmúlt egy évben mást sem csináltunk, csak veszekedtünk. Eliza letette a seprűt, csípőre tette a kezét, majd összeráncolt homlokkal felelt: - Nem, tanár úr. MI nem szoktunk marakodni. MAGA szokott marakodni velem. MAGA volt az, aki minden alkalmat megragadott arra, hogy belém kössön, teljesen mindegy volt, hogy mit csináltam. Állandóan sértegetett, becsmérelt. Eleinte csak azért hallgattam, mert többé-kevésbé jogosnak éreztem a kritikáit, és mert… mert – a hangja lehalkult és lehajtotta a fejét – úgy éreztem, megbántottam… Higgins lebiggyesztette az ajkát, és a körmeit bámulta. - Megbántani engem? Miből gondolja ezt a képtelenséget? - Hát, amikor Freddyvel ültünk a kanapéján… - Hagyja abba! Nem hozza fel ezt a témát! Higgins leugrott az asztalról és zsebre tette a kezeit. - Igaz, hogy akkor és ott hatalmasat csalódtam magában. Elég nagyfokú tiszteletlenség volt, amit az ÉN nappalimban tettek. Ilyesmi egyszerűen nem helyénvaló. Eliza érezte, hogy most a professzor egyik gyengepontjára tapintott. Úgy döntött, kiélvezi a helyzetet, és egy kicsit adja alá a lovat. - Kedves Higgins professzor úr, csak nem azt akarja mondani, hogy helyteleníti két vonzó, optimista fiatal közötti vad, szenvedélyes románcot? Az idősebb ismerőseim és barátaim – többek között az édesanyja is- folyton arról beszélnek, hogy az ifjúkori, első szerelem a legszentebb, a legártatlanabb, a legédesebb valamennyi érzés közül. Higgins olyan erővel rúgott bele székbe, hogy az ismét eldőlt. Felszisszent a fájdalomra, de –kivételesen - türtőztette magát. - Szerelem?! Badarság! - Ne bántsa a székemet! - Maga az előbb döntötte fel! – feleselt a tanár úr. - Nekem szabad, mert az enyém – vágta rá Eliza, duzzogva. – Állítsa fel! Úgy tűnt, az utolsó mondat nem jutott el Higgins tudatáig, mert az üzlet másik végébe sétált. - Mondja csak, Freddy még mindig jár magához? Szokta látogatni? - Persze, hogy szokott jönni – kuncogott Eliza, majd Higgins döbbent, sötét arckifejezését látva, hozzátette – jelenleg egy Lucy nevű hölgyért rajong. Tőlem szokta venni a virágot. Akárhányszor belép ide, mindig csak róla áradozik. Higgins arca diadalmasan felragyogott. - Ha! Mondtam, hogy az a taknyos nem fog sokáig maga után koslatni. Eliza egyet nem értően megrázta a fejét. - Ellenkezőleg: szerintem elég türelmesen, és kitartóan várakozott. Ha igent mondtam volna… - … de nem mondott igent… - ... de ha mégis megtettem volna, valószínűleg királynőként kezelt volna. Álmodozó tekintettel a távolba meredt. - Állandóan meglepett volna valami aprósággal: virágokkal, csokoládéval… tisztán emlékszem, hogy aznap délután hozott nekem egy csokor fehér rózsát. Higgins a tekintetével meg tudta volna gyilkolni a lányt. Ez már több volt a soknál! Nem elég, hogy Freddy majdnem elvette tőle ezt a nőt, még a babérjait is le akarta aratni?! - Fehér rózsát! Ne legyen nevetséges! Freddy sosem hozott magának fehér rózsát! Fehér rózsát csak jó ízlésű emberek vesznek! Hozzá hasonló, közönséges fráterek sárga rózsát szoktak venni! –háborgott. - Freddynek remek szépérzéke van… - Mondom, hogy nem vett magának fehér rózsát! Erre mérget vehet! Eliza rákönyökölt az asztalra és a két kezével megtámasztotta a fejét. Kérdően nézett a volt mesterére. - Mégis honnan van ez a biztos információja? - Mert ÉN vettem magának a fehér rózsát. Eliza szóhoz sem jutott az elképedéstől. A kezei lehullottak az asztalra. Nagy nehezen ki tudta nyitni a száját: - Ön? - Igen én, buta liba! – tajtékzott. - Tudja, hogy az volt életem legrosszabb napja? Először maga minden szó nélkül eltűnik, és az ezredessel közösen kereshettük magát. Utána volt képe az anyámhoz futni és panaszkodni, akit sikeresen ellenem fordított! Majd elhitette velem, hogy meg akar szakítani velem minden kapcsolatot, egy egyszerű félreértés miatt! Amikor meg megjátszotta a nagylelkű, megbocsátó szentet, fogta magát, és egy másik férfi nyakába ugrott, amint magára hagytam! Eliza kapva kapott a célzáson. - Csak nem azt akarja mondani, Henry Higgins, hogy féltékeny volt? Higgins szeme villámokat szórt. - Hogy féltékeny? HOGY FÉLTÉKENY?! Ott, helyben ki tudtam volna tekerni mindkettejük nyakát! - Tehát féltékeny volt… - vonta le a következtetést Eliza nyugodtan. - Ha tudni akarja, igen! Az voltam! Remélem, most elégedett. - Fogalma sincs, mennyire. Higgins toporzékolni tudott volna a dühtől, de inkább csak dobbantott egyet a bal lábával. Hogy bír, hogy mer ez a nőszemély ilyen kimérten viselkedni, amikor ő kis híján felrobban?! - Tudja, mit akartam tenni aznap?! Körbetaxiztam az egész várost, csak azért virágot vegyek, színházba cipeljem, hogy egy kicsit művelődjön – ami igencsak magára is férne – és még az nagyanyám jegygyűrűjét is elkértem, mert meg akartam kérni a kezét, maga hülye bakfis! Elizának muszáj volt leülnie, különben biztosan elájult volna. A professzor féltékenységéről eddig is meg volt győződve, de ez a hír még őt is meglepte. Már hónapok óta nem is mert arról álmodni, hogy a kapcsolatuk házassággal fog végződni. - Hogy… hogy… a ke-ke-ke… kezemet? – dadogta maga elé meredve. - Igen a kezét, maga kis bolond! Illetve nem is maga bolond, hanem én voltam, amikor ez az ökörség megfordult a fejemben. Úgy készültem, hogy aznap este, a darab után feleségül fogom kérni. De nem volt szükség arra, hogy színházba menjek, volt elég dráma a házamban is, hála maguknak. Van fogalma róla, milyen érzés volt együtt látnom magát azzal a kölyökkel? Eliza keserűen felnevetett. - Mint barátja és jóakarója, őszintén kívánom, hogy ennél nagyobb pofont ne kapjon az élettől! Az én anyám belehalt az öcsém születésébe, aki csak 1 napot ért meg. A kötelező osztályokat éppen hogy csak ki tudtam járni, mert az apám minden délután dolgozni küldött, mondván ő „csak egy lógós ember, aki szereti a lógós szegény emberek életét élni! Ha nem volt nálam elég pénz lakbérre, vagy kocsmázásra, vagy éppen amire kellett, éjszakázhattam az utcán! Volt, hogy napokig nem ettem, nemhogy csokoládét, vagy húst majszolhattam volna. És ha az apám túl sokat ivott, vagy valami nem tetszett neki, egyszerűen kékre vert! Amikor rákérdeztem, hogy miért kaptam, sokszor csak annyit mondott: „Csak.\" vagy „Mi közöd van hozzá?\".Az alkoholizmus apám részéről családi vonásnak számított… a nagyszüleimet, a nagybátyámat, és az egyik unokafivéremet is az ital vitte el… kivéve persze a nagynénémet, aki influenzában halt meg. Az utolsó mondat mindkettőjükben egy egyszerre kínos, és egyszerre kellemes emléket idézett fel. Egy pillanatig cinkosan vigyorogtak egymásra, mint a régi pajtások, akik valami közös csintalanságon törik a fejüket. Azonban Eliza ismét elbúsult, és a tartása kissé púpos lett, amint a székében ücsörgött. Mintha minden rossz élmény és teher, ami eddig a szívét nyomta, most a vállára nehezedett volna át. - Nem szeretek a gyerekkoromról mesélni, már ha volt nekem valaha is. De hallgatok, és lenyelem ezt a pirulát. Egyrészt, mert tudom, hogy ez nem egyedi helyzet, már ami a szegényebb réteget illeti. Másrészt, mert a magam bőrén tapasztaltam, hogy ha mindig a múltba nézek, sosem fogom elérni a céljaimat. Tény, hogy kicsit érzékenyebb vagyok, mint kéne, de mindig igyekeztem összeszedni magamat, és továbblépni… - „ Én, szegény, drága Elizám – gondolta Higgins részvéttel – milyen fiatal még, mégis milyen nehéz keresztet cipel. Ráadásként sokkal bölcsebben látja át az élet dolgait, mint azok a burokban nevelt senkik a felsőházban.\" - … most, hogy meg tudok állni a magam lábán, hála az ezredes úrnak – és valamilyen szinten magának is – már nem függök az apám szeszélyeitől. Képes voltam megbocsátani a hibáit, habár a mai napig nem hajlandó segíteni nekem, és semelyikünknek sem áll szándékában szoros kapcsolatot kialakítani a másikkal. A lány egy pillanatra szomorúan merengetett el a saját sorsában. Keze az asztallapot simogatta, amíg átgondolta kimondásra váró gondolatait. Higgins hangtalanul a háta mögé lopódzott. Legszívesebben felemelte volna, mint egy babát, utána addig, és olyan szorosan ölelte volna, amíg el nem felejti az összes sanyarú emlékét. Legszívesebben magához húzta volna, hogy megcsókolja, és hogy biztosítsa, soha többé nem lesz egyedül az életben, mert rá – Henryre - mindig számíthat. Eliza megfordult ültében és a férfire emelte tekintetét. - Önnek mindig volt mit ennie, tanulhatott, szép házban lakhatott. Az édesanyja imádja, és soha, senki sem kezelte úgy, mint egy kapcarongyot. Tudom, hogy magának is megvan a maga története, de kinek nincsen? Remélem, nem veszi zokon, ha képtelen vagyok sajnálni önt. Henry büszkesége ekkor feladta a harcot. - Ne… - nyögte ki végül. - Mégis mit ne, uram? - Ne üljön itt, és ne legyen ilyen búvalbélelt! Álljon fel, vezesse az üzletét, és csinálja tovább a takarítást… Eliza értetlenkedve nézett rá, a férfi azonban folytatta: - Maga csacsi, most hazudtolta meg önmagát! Az előbb papolt arról, hogy maga sosem néz vissza, maga sosem siránkozik. Az isten szerelmére, maga fiatal, talpraesett, gyönyörű, csodálatos –„csodálatooos?\" – és egyáltalán nem ejtették a feje lágyára. Ha más nem is, de a gyakorlatiassága az apja nevelésének javára írható fel! Ne merje abba a hitbe ringatni magát, hogy egyedül van és, nincsen senkije sem! Ha az apja nem is törődik magával, az anyám befogadta a házába, Pickering mind anyagilag, mind érzelmileg támogatta szinte minden marhaságban, amit a fejébe vett. És itt vagyok én is… Lehajolt kissé, hogy szemmagasságban lehessen a lánnyal. - Azt hiszi, hagynám, hogy a jövőben bárki is ártson Eliza Doolittle-nek, azok után, amiken keresztülmentem vele? Mégis mennyire tart engem kegyetlennek? Mégis mi az ördögöt képzel rólam? – háborgott. Megragadta Eliza vállát, és finoman a talpára segítette. - Figyeljen rám, Eliza! Amíg a közelében vagyok, nem engedem, hogy bárki bántsa vagy becsmérelje magát. Magával senki sem bánhat így… rajtam kívül persze – fűzte hozzá kacsintva. - Maga okos lány, de még nagyon fiatal és tapasztalatlan. Nemrég töltötte be a huszonkettőt… szinte még gyerek. Ebben a korban az emberek hajlamosak mindenféle felelőtlenséget elkövetni. Példának okáért hozzámenni olyan balekokhoz, mint Freddy vagy a Livingstone-ikrek – akik mellesleg csak átutazóban voltak Londonban, hála Istennek. Ha kell, lekötözöm az ágyhoz, de nem fogom hagyni, elszúrja az életét azzal, hogy fejjel menjen neki a falnak, és elkeseredésében egy rossz házasságba meneküljön. Eliza a professzor arcát fürkészte, és kíváncsian várta a további fejleményeket. - Tehát, arra akar kilyukadni… - Arra akarok kilyukadni, hogy maga nem lesz se Freddy felesége, se William Livingstone-é, se James Livingstone-é. Henry egyik keze még mindig Eliza vállán pihent, viszont a másikkal már Eliza állát tartotta, még véletlenül se veszítse el vele a szemkontaktust. - Eliza, kezeskedem róla, hogyha valaha is férjhez fog menni, az csakis én leszek. Velem fogja leélni a hátralévő életét, Eliza Doolittle, és nincs apelláta. Mondja ki, hogy a feleségem akar lenni, és nem fogadok el elutasítást! - Nem! - Mi az, hogy nem?! – hápogott az agglegény. – Az imént mondtam, hogy nem fogadok el nemleges választ! Eliza felhúzta az orrát, és pökhendien felelt: - Szó sem lehet róla, hogy ilyen körülmények között mondjak igent! - Miféle körülmények között, maga perszóna? - Tudtommal, a férfiak le szoktak térdelni szívük választottja előtt, és hosszú szónoklatban kifejtik, hogy mennyire odavannak érte, mennyire fontos személy a számukra, és hogy mennyire boldoggá tenné őket, hogyha a hitvesük lenne. - Pimasz kis fruska. Mi a fenét képzel magáról? - emelte fel a hangját Henry. Eliza arckifejezése ellenmondást nem tűrő volt. - Én várhatok... jelenleg nincsenek vásárlóim. - Ugye most csak tréfál? - Egyáltalán nem, Henry Higgins. Henry forgatta a szemét, majd fél térdre ereszkedett, valami olyasmit motyogva , hogy „ha a kisujjadat nyújtod, az egész karod kell nekik\". Rosszallóan sóhajtott, és belekezdett a mondókájába: - Eliza Doolittle… - Nem lehetne valami jelzővel ellátni a nevemet? Mondjuk drága, vagy kedves, vagy édes, vagy tüneményes? - Drága Eliza Doolittle, megtisztelne azzal, hogy elfogadná a kezemet egy házasságban? Várakozóan nézett a lányra, aki hevesen bólogatott. - Helyes, helyes! Most igazán megdicsérhetné a szépségemet, vagy az eszemet, esetleg a kedvességemet, vagy a nagylelkűségemet. Annyira erőlködött, hogy ne nevesse ki Henryt, hogy a könnye is kicsordult. A férfi az elején hitte, a meghatottságtól sír, de amikor világossá vált számára az incselkedés, ő is könnyedebbre, csipkelődőbbre fogta: - Édes, kedves, szerelmetes Elizám! Saját szavaimmal ki sem tudom fejezni a KEGYED iránt érzett forró, elhatalmasodó szenvedélyt, ami átmelengeti a szívemet, akárhányszor abban a kegyben részesülök, hogy láthatom magát. Henry biztos volt benne, hogy ha így folytatja az ömlengést, még aznap cukorbeteg lesz. - Engedje meg, hogy versben fejezzem ki el nem múló érzéseimet: *\"A szem, melyről oly lángolón daloltam, az arc, a kéz, a kar s a láb csodája, amelytől lettem önmagamnak árnya s külön uton járó a földi bolyban; a göndörkés aranyhaj fényburokban s az angyali mosoly villó sugára, mely édent bűvölt a világ sarába: érzéketlen por, elfér egy marokban. De én még élek, dúltan, elgyötörve, csillagtüzem nélkül, kit úgy imádtam - kormányatört hajón, hullámra lökve. Ne nyíljon hát szerelmes dalra szájam; a régi hang elnémult már örökre, s eztán a gyász zendül lantom szavában.\" Kihívóan és diadalmaskodva nézett fel, majd a karjaiba kapta újdonsült menyasszonyát. Előrehajolt, és ajka lassan közeledett Eliza ajkához, azonban ő lázadozva elfordította a fejét. - Most meg mi a problémája? Petrarca nem elég romantikus magának? - Romantikusnak romantikus, csakhogy nekem barna hajam van, nem aranyszínű… - Hallgasson el, némber, és csókoljon meg! Eliza Henry nyaka köré fonta a karját, és boldogan csókolta meg szerelmét. VÉGE Remélem, nem lett olyan rossz befejezés. Ha valami nem tetszett, kritika formájában megírhatjátok ;) * Petrarca : A szem, melyről oly lángolón daloltam Lesz még egy Epilógus fejezet is :) Csak a tisztázás végett: 1. lépés: Bocsánatot kérni Mrs. Higgins barátaitól 2. lépés: Bocsánatot kérni Pickeringtől 3. lépés: Bocsánatot kérni Elizától 4. lépés: Eljegyezni Elizát[Chapter 6] És boldogan éltek... Epilógus Henry Higgins sosem gondolta volta, hogy a házasélet ennyire tűrhető, sőt kellemes is lehet. Természetesen voltak súrlódások, konfliktusok, nézeteltérések – melyik házasságban nincsenek? - , de hál' Istennek még nem fordult elő olyan komoly összezörrenés, ami arra késztette volna Elizát, hogy összecsomagoljon, és elhagyja a házat. Az Elizával kötött eljegyzése eleinte titokban volt tartva, csupán Mrs. Higgins, Pickering ezredes, és Henry cselédei – akiket a férfi elbocsátással fenyegetett – voltak beavatva a történtekbe. Ez a döntés mindenki szerint logikus volt, hiszen Elizával és Freddyvel kapcsolatos, látens szóbeszédet még le kellett csendesíteni. Freddy másnap ismét látogatást tett Eliza üzletében, aki szinte könyörgött neki, látogassa meg jövendőbeli anyósát, az édesanyjával, és Claraval együtt. Valahol mélyen, csak úgy, mint minden eddigi kiszemelt lány esetében, a fiú még mindig táplált némi vonzalmat Eliza iránt, így az ő kérésének csak kevés ideig tudott ellenállni. Mrs. Higgins el volt ragadtatva, amikor fiától elsőnek tudta meg az jövőben esedékes esküvő ötletét. Amilyen hamar csak tudta, felhívta valamennyi barátját és ismerősét, akiket Henry az utóbbi tíz hónapban megsértett, vagy akikre rosszindulatú megjegyzést tett- egy kezén meg tudta volna számolni azokat, akik nem a fia miatt kerülték a társaságát. Azokhoz, akik a Freddy és Eliza közötti, házasságon kívüli kapcsolat gyanújával éltek – hála Henrynek -, személyesen látogatott el. Megpróbálta meggyőzni őket az ellenkezőjéről, illetve, hogy amennyiben a következő fogadónapján tiszteletüket teszik nála, mindent más szemszögből fognak látni. Tisztában volt vele, hogy az ismerősök fogadónapokon kívüli zargatása csak kivételes esetekben volt indokolt… nos, ez egy tökéletesen indokolt esetnek számított. Hogy hasznossá tegye magát, Henry eltaxizott Pickeringhez, hogy előbb személyesen, majd 2 nap múlva hivatalosan is bocsánatot kérjen tőle a viselkedéséért. Akárcsak mindenki másnak, Pickeringnek is elege volt Henry eltorzulásából, de volt annyira gentleman, hogy adjon még egy legvégső, legutolsó lehetőséget a bizonyításra. Az eljegyzés híre szintén Henry malmára hajtotta a vizet. - \"Rendben van, Higgins – jelentette ki Pickering. - Miss Doolittle-re való tekintettel – de csakis őmiatta – hajlandó vagyok még egyszer, utoljára szemet hunyni a modora felett. De figyelmeztetem – emelte fel a mutatóujját – ha azt tapasztalom, vagy hallom, hogy rosszul bánik Elizával, netalántán boldogtalanná teszi, megalázza… nem állok jót magamért. „ Henry – félretéve sértett méltóságát- békítően veregette meg az ezredes vállát. Annak ellenére, hogy kibékült újdonsült mennyasszonyával, Henrynek két nap múlva muszáj volt megjelennie édesanyja házában, hogy a pletykának még időben elejét tudják venni. El lehet képzelni, mennyire várta, hogy minél előbb találkozhasson a számára oly „rokonszenves\" és „nagy tudású\" polgártársakkal, és ott, előttük bocsánatot kérjen olyan emberektől, akiket szíve mélyéből lenézett és megvetett. Ugyanakkor a gondot ő okozta, így neki is kellett megoldania azt. Henry még sosem volt annyira ideges, mint aznap. A délelőttöt a fürdőszobájában található tükör előtt töltötte, megbizonyosodva arról, hogy az előre begyakorolt beszéde dinamikusan, zökkenőmentesen – nyelvtani és kiejtésbeli hibák nélkül – fog zajlani. Számos alkalommal mondott már beszédeket, tartott már előadásokat a fonetikusok krémje előtt, amik többnyire hibátlanra sikeredtek. Most azonban más volt… ez nem a munkáról szólt. Ezt a magánélete- mi több, a szerelmi élete! – érdekében teszi. Csak remélni merte, hogy nem reked be, nem akad el a szava, nem felejti el a mondandóját, és nem zavarodik bele a szövegébe. Úgy tűnt, imái meghallgattatásra találtak. Ellen Higgins fantasztikusan értett hozzá, hogyan simítson el egy kényes ügyet: hosszú élete során hatalmas hasznát vette belenevelt türelmének, toleranciájának, és remek diplomáciai érzékének. Az aznapi fogadódélutánnak tökéletesnek kellett lennie: külön-külön éreztetni kellett az összes vendégével, hogy a jelenlétük kivételesen fontos a számára, és hogy őszintén örül nekik, viszont egyikőjük sem foghatott gyanút, hogy ebben az esetben többről volt szó, mint egy szokásos fogadódélutánról. Az teáskészletnek, a felszolgált finomságoknak, és a díszítésnek meghittséggel, eleganciával, komfortérzettel kellett szolgálniuk, viszont annyira nem lehetettek díszesek, hogy valami ünnepi, alkalmi hatással bírjanak. El kellett hitetnie mindenkivel, hogy a fiának ez a meggondolatlan, ostoba elszólása csupán a véletlen játéka volt, és nincsen semmi alapja, így a tisztázásának időtartamát leszámítva nem tulajdonít neki különösebb jelentőséget. Amikor a két nappal ezelőtti társaság – beleértve az Eynsford-Hill családot, továbbá a Livingstone-ikreket – kényelembe helyezte magát, Mrs. Higgins felállt, és a megszokott, szívélyes mosolyával előkészítette a terepet Henry számára. - Kedves barátaim, kedves rokonaim! Hadd köszönjem meg, hogy kérésemre ismét a házamba fáradtak. Sajnálatos módon – tanulmányai és tudása ellenére- az én Henry fiam sem tökéletes, így néha ő is fogalmazhat szegényesen, vagy érthet félre néhány célzást. Tegnapelőtt egy olyan célzás csúszott ki a száján, ami egyeseket talán kínos helyzetbe hozhat. Ma azért jött el, hogy ezt tisztázza. Mrs. Higgins leült, majd finoman intett a fejével Henrynek, hogy ő következik. A férfi nagy nehezen felegyenesedett és megköszörülte a torkát. - Szeretnék elnézést kérni az ez évi viselkedésemért. Jól tudom, hogy sokakat megbántottam, köztük olyanokat, akiket barátomnak tartok- itt Pickering felé sandított - , és olyanokat is, akik az édesanyámmal ápolnak közeli viszont –itt Mrs. Eynsford-Hill felé biccentett. A jó múltkor elhangzott a számból egy olyan kétértelmű mondat, ami két fiatal jó hírét teheti tönkre. Szeretném leszögezni, hogy közvetlenül nem voltam tanúja semmi olyannak, ami ezt alátámasztaná… erre szavamat adom. Lehet, hogy a kimerültség, lehet hogy a rossz hangulat kényszerítette ki belőlem ezt a benyomást. Freddy anyjához fordult. - Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, ön édesanyám legjobb barátnője, így szörnyen sajnálom, ha önt, vagy a gyermekeit méltatlan szavakkal illettem. Az idős úri hölgy fagyos biccentéssel fogadta a bocsánatkérést. - Pickering, Mr. Eynsford-Hill, sajnálom, amiért meggyanúsítottam magukat azzal, hogy valaha is tisztességtelen szándékkal közeledtek Miss Doolittle felé. Az egész egy alaptalan félreértés volt. Freddy Elizára emelte tekintetét, aki bátorítóan bólintott. Freddy így már nyugodt szívvel fogott kezet Higgins-szel. - Nem történt semmi, Higgins. Mindenki hibázhat néha – mosolygott Pickering. Végül Elizához intézte szavait. - Miss Doolittle, tökéletesen tisztában vagyok vele, hogy a maga korában mennyit számít valakinek az erkölcsi híre. Így sajnálom, ha esetleg csorbát ejtettem volna rajta. Remélem, képes lesz megbocsátani nekem. Eliza felállt, és megszorította Higgins kezét. A lány finom, meleg kezének tapintásának köszönhetően a férfi számára egy pillanatra a megszűnt a külvilág. Legszívesebben kacagott volna ezen a nevetséges színjátékon, majd mindenkit kiküldve az ölébe kapta volna a lányt, és hosszan megcsókolta volna. Még nem viselte a jegygyűrűjét. Sajnos, még pár hétig várniuk kellett a hivatalos lánykéréssel. Még Eliza apjával sem közölték az eljegyzést. Egyrészt, mert sem Alfred Doolittle, sem a felesége –akármilyen tehetősek is voltak– a pénzükön nem tudtak diszkréciót és jólneveltséget vásárolni, másrészt – Higgins szemében ez volt a fő ok – a férfi valószínűleg hidegen hagyta volna, hogy a lánya férjhezmenetele, ám ezt a sejtését nem volt szíve megosztani a kedvesével. - Természetesen megbocsátok, Higgins professzor úr. Ez a kis hiba nem fogja útját állni a barátságunknak. Eliza szemében apró, alig észrevehető rándulás jelent meg, amiről Henry gondolta, hogy kacsintásnak volt szánva. Amint a vendégek távoztak – Pickering, Henry és Eliza kivételével -, Henry megkönnyebbülten elterpeszkedett a díványon, jó nagyot ásítva. - Henry, tedd a kezedet a szád elé, ha ásítasz – utasította Mrs. Higgins. Henry sértődötten nézett az anyjára. - Mama, ugyan már! Pár hónapon belül megnősülök. Nem utasítgathatsz engem életem végéig, mint egy kisgyereket. Mrs. Higgins egyetértően bólintott. - Látod, drágám, ebben igazad van. Az idős hölgy Elizára nézett. - Eliza, mivel nemsokára a fiam felesége lesz, így egyedül magának lesz joga – és kötelessége – rendre utasítania Henryt – szólt komolyan, de hangjában érezhető volt a tréfálkozó tónus. - De Mama… - Igen, kedvesem? - Még össze sem házasodtunk, te máris szövetségest keresel Elizában? - Csakis a te érdekedben, kisfiam. Eliza leült Henry mellé, és a karjára tette a kezét. - Remek beszéd volt, Henry. Nem is tudtam, hogy ilyenre is képes. Henry kihívóan fordította a lány felé a fejét. - Ugye? Napról-napra bebizonyosodik, milyen sok tudományban jeleskedem. - Higgins tud elbűvölő és megnyerő is lenni, hogyha összeszedi magát - tette hozzá Pickering. - Ne ültessék Henryt olyan magas lóra, mert a végén még nem tud róla leszállni – dorgálta meg őket gyengéden Mrs. Higgins. – Amúgy tényleg kitettél magadért. - Köszönöm, de most már elég lesz belőlem. Beszéljünk valami másról. - De Henry, mindig is szerettél a figyelem középpontjában lenni. Tessék, most itt az alkalom. Csak rólad fog folyni a szó. A megnyerő tulajdonságaidról… - … a hiányosságairól… - mondta Pickering. - ... inkább az utóbbiról – fejezte be a gondolatot Eliza. Henry tiltakozva felállt. - Elegem van magukból. Nem vagyok hajlandó azt hallgatni, ahogy a hibáimat hánytorgatják. A könyvtárban leszek… Shakespeare, Keats, és Milton társaságában. Amint a két hölgy és az idős úriember magukra maradtak, halkan nevetni kezdtek. Pár héten belül megtartották a hivatalos eljegyzést, amit egyszerű, bensőséges, templomi (!) esküvő követett. Nászútra egy eldugott, csendes, de romantikus francia falucskába mentek, ahol életük legszebb hetét töltötték együtt. Mrs. Eliza Higgins nem volt hajlandó szorosabb kapcsolatot ápolni Mr. és Mrs. Doolittle-lel, habár az esküvőn az édesapja kísérte az oltárhoz. Eliza legszívesebben Pickering ezredest kérte volna fel. A férfi azonban értésére adta, hogy nem lenne helyénvaló, ha megfosztaná az édesapját ettől a tisztségtől. Így Pickeringből Higgins tanúja lett, Eliza választása Freddyre esett, koszorúslánynak pedig Clarat kérte fel, akik az anyjukkal együtt szívesen látott vendégeknek számítottak – legalábbis Eliza részéről. Anyagi biztonsága ellenére, Liza nem volt hajlandó lemondani régi álmáról, hogy saját virágüzletet vezessen. Emiatt sokszor került konfliktusba Henryvel, aki elég gyakran adta felesége tudtára, hogy sajnálja tőle azt az időt, amit az üzletében tölt, és helyette inkább vele foglalkozzon. Azonban titokban kimondhatatlanul büszke volt rá, amiért nem akar teljesen a férjétől függeni. Nem akart magának olyan asszonyt, aki egész nap csak fekszik, nem csinál semmit, és várja, hogy a sült galamb a szájába repüljön. Helyette inkább talál egy hobbit, amivel kiteljesedhet, amibe ugyanúgy bele tud merülni, mint ő a fonetikába. De mivel a büszkesége „kimondhatatlan\" volt, ebből ésszerűen következett, hogy sosem mondta ki hangosan, hogyan gondolkodik valójában. Henry akkor vesztette el igazán az önuralmát, amikor Liza bejelentette, hogy Freddyt szeretné alkalmazni könyvelőként. Szegény fiúnak egyre rosszabbul ment a sora, de mivel értett a könyveléshez és a számokhoz, Liza úgy döntött, segít rajta – persze előtte elhitette barátjával, hogy okvetlenül szüksége van az ő üzleti érzékére, és becsületes, tisztességes mivoltára, tekintve, hogy Londonban rendkívül nehéz alkalmas könyvelőt találni. Ahelyett hogy kijött volna a sodrából, Liza csak megvonta a vállát, szájon csókolta Henryt és érzékien a fülébe suttogta: - Jól tudod, hogy úgyis a saját fejem után fogok menni, szerelmem.\" Azzal faképnél hagyta a duzzogó Higginst. Tudta jól, hogy Liza nem táplál a kölyök iránt gyengéd érzelmeket, mégis bántotta a hiúságát, hogy egykori udvarlóját alkalmazza, még akkor is, ha merő jóindulatból teszi. Egyébként feltűnt neki, hogy konfliktusaik ritkán torkolltak veszekedésbe: többnyire csak ő, Henry háborgott. Ilyenkor Liza megölelte, megcsókolta, bókolt neki, felemlegette valamelyik előnyös tulajdonságát, behozta a papucsát, esetleg kapott egy lábmasszást. Mielőtt Henry észbe kapott volna, Liza már ment is a maga útján, és azt tette, amit helyesnek vélt. Ha az ex-agglegény utólag tiltakozott, vagy kikelt magából, legfeljebb kinevette. Nem mintha birtokolni akarta volna a férjét. Csak bölcsen belátta, hogy sokkal boldogabb, sokkal kiegyensúlyozottabb lesz a házassága, ha nem ugrik Henry minden egyes szavára, és papucsdobálás helyett, inkább hordja utána azt. Ezt a trükköt Mrs. Higgins-től tanulta. - „Higgye azt a férje, hogy ő parancsol. Érts vele egyet, hitesd el vele, hogy Isten után ő következik, és amint elveszik a saját egójában, gyorsan tedd meg, amit akarsz\" – mondogatta mindig. Liza nagyon ügyes tanítványnak bizonyult. Mivel még új volt a feleség szerepben, néha elfogta a kísértés, hogy reagáljon a férje szúrós megjegyzéseire, fölényeskedéseire. Ilyenkor Henry élvezettel nézte, hogyan tudott gyenge pontot találni ebben az új Lizában, akit az anyja teremtett, és nagy lelkesedéssel ütötte tovább a vasat. Jót mulatott magában Liza kirohanásain, mert ilyenkor – ha csak néhány alkalommal is - újra fölényben érezhette magát. Ez nem jelentette azt, hogy Henry véleménye vagy tanácsai Lizánál minden esetben süket fülekre találtak. Ha úgy érezte, hogy hitvese vagy az ezredes építő kritikával szolgálnak a számára, mindig figyelmesen meghallgatta őket, majd magában mérlegelte önnön helyzetét. Idővel rájött, hogy a két férfi jóslatai többnyire be szoktak igazolódni. A szurkálódások és az apróbb viták ellenére boldog, kiegyensúlyozott házasságban éltek, ami főleg Lizának volt köszönhető. Pár hónap után felfogta, hogy egy, több, mint húsz éve egyedül élő, középkorú férfit lehetetlen megváltoztatni, így neki kell ügyeskednie, ha el akar érni valamit nála. A női elnyomás nem sorsszerű, és nem természetes, csak a legtöbb feleség nem tudja, hogyan kell bánni „férjurával\". Egy jó házasságban mindkét fél egyenlő, csak nem ugyanazon értelemben. Mindössze egyetlen megtanulandó leckét kellett elsajátítania : A férfi a ház feje, a nő pedig annak nyaka, aki kénye-kedve szerint forgatja.\" Most már tényleg VÉGE! Kritika!

Two days ago, I finished up playing Eliza Doolittle in this amazing show. I am in love with this character, and this is just my imagining of what might have happened after the curtain falls on the play. I have no ownership to this story whatsoever. The beginning of this chapter is based more off of the way my Higgins and I decided to end the show as opposed to the movie. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. And without further or do, enjoy! - E. B. \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\" Eliza felt tears well up in her eyes as she realized he had been crying. A tear trailed down his flustered cheek as he took a step towards her. She ran to him and threw her arms around his neck, and much to her surprise, she felt him cling violently to her waist as they both buried their faces in each other's shoulders. His embrace was so tight that she was certain that he was leaving bruises behind, but she didn't care. She was just happy that he finally held her in his arms. It seemed so surreal after all they had been through – the arguments that lasted until three in the morning, the ring he chucked across the room (that she was more than grateful to have returned to her finger when she picked it up), and the time they held hands just a little bit longer than they should have after they danced around in their own little world. She let out a sigh as he held her even tighter against him if that was at all possible. His tears soaked through her crisp white shirt as her hand involuntarily wandered to his golden hair. He sighed shakily, and they suddenly heard the front door click open. Eliza waited for him to move, but he didn't. For once, she had no problem with doing the same. She saw Colonel Pickering out of the corner of her teary eye. She spotted a blithe but sad smile come across his countenance. He tipped his hat and quietly ventured up the stairs. Moments later, she saw him and Mrs. Pearce spying on them from the landing. Eliza didn't know how long they stayed that way, but when they finally parted, she noticed the room had gotten considerably darker, indicating that the sun was getting lower in the sky. Mrs. Pearce and the Colonel had retreated to the small tea room. Eliza dried her tears with the handkerchief he had given her. Higgins leaned over his desk to collect himself. They didn't say a word. They didn't have to. Eliza supposed life would go on as if she had never left from now on, and that was alright with her, so long as he never gave reason for her to leave ever again. It was even more silent at tea as Eliza, Pickering, and the professor sat around the table. Eliza mostly kept her eyes on her cup while Higgins' eyes seemed to dart up every so often just to make sure she wasn't going anywhere. \"We're very glad that you came back to us, Miss Doolittle,\" Colonel Pickering said in a polite way as to make conversation. \"Thank you, Colonel Pickering,\" she replied softly. \"What do you plan to do now that the experiment is over?\" Eliza's eyes met with the professor's for a brief moment as she placed her cup back on the saucer. \"I am not sure,\" she admitted shakily as Mrs. Pearce brought out another tray of cakes, \"but I can assure you that I will pay you back for the expenses of these clothes. I feel terrible to have worn them at your expense.\" \"No need, my dear,\" he said reaching over to pat her hand. \"I must admit that it was rather a lot of fun buying such pretty clothes for such a pretty young lady. It makes me wish I had a daughter. She would have been spoiled silly. Yes, it was quite enjoyable for two lonely old bachelors. Don't you think, Higgins?\" \"It was a lot of tom-foolery if you ask me,\" he scoffed, \"but the clothes do look nice on you, Eliza.\" She felt the color rise to her cheeks as she took another sip of tea. \"If you wish to still work in a flower shop, I've been talking to a lady who owns one not far from here. She's a very kind, jolly young thing. Of course, she might be old to you, Eliza. Why, she's nearly the same age as Higgins!\" He went on prattling as Higgins choked on his tea only to eventually be interrupted by Mrs. Pearce. \"Forgive my interruption, Colonel, but I think Eliza would make a fine secretary for someone,\" she said with emphasis on the last word. \"Oh, yes… fine idea… Mrs. Pearce,\" Higgins said as he continued to gag a bit on his drink. \"Perhaps Pickering's chap at the home office knows of an opening somewhere.\" Mrs. Pearce heaved a great sigh and rolled her eyes before \"accidentally\" hitting Mr. Higgins in the head with the tray she was about to set down. He grinded his teeth and rubbed the spot as she spoke. \"But Eliza has no experience in that sort of field. She would do very well to work some place more intimate, perhaps in the home of a wealthy gentleman who cannot keep up with his own agenda.\" \"Do you mean like my friend Charles, Mrs. Pearce? Oh, he's a fine fellow, or perhaps you could work for my –\" \"Or perhaps she could work for you, Mr. Higgins,\" she finally said. \"Or perhaps she could work for me!\" he said instinctively before really thinking about what he was saying. He sighed shakily as he saw her shocked face. \"You could if you wanted to,\" he added softly before clearing his throat. She couldn't help but smile. \"You want me to work for you? You weren't lying were you, Henry Higgins? You want me back to pick up your slippers and keep up with your schedules, do you?\" He gulped as he stared at her. \"Well,\" she finally continued, \"I guess if I'm going to be a secretary, that wouldn't be too bad of a job.\" Higgins grinned and jumped out of his seat. \"That's simply fantastic! You can start tomorrow. Since you're inexperienced, I imaging thirty pounds a reasonable salary, providing of course that you remain to reside here?\" She nodded thoughtfully. \"Fantastic! Eliza, I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning! Now, if you will excuse me, I am going to bed!\" \"Mr. Higgins, it's only four o'clock in the afternoon!\" Mrs. Pearce cried towards the staircase. \"What better time to rest than four o'clock in the afternoon?\" Then he was gone. Eliza tried her best to suppress a giggle as he marched out. \"Poor Eliza, I hope you do like getting up early. He'll be wide awake by three in the morning!\" Mrs. Pearce exclaimed. \"I don't mind, Mrs. Pearce,\"\" she replied with a chuckle. \"I don't imagine I should have too difficult of a time staying up until then.\" A warm feeling filled her as a tinge of pain rippled across her torso from the bruises he had left behind when he held on to her so tightly. A small part of her knew that he would probably never hold her like that again, but a very large part secretly hoped that he would. She closed her eyes in order to relish in the memory of her being in his embrace. She supposed that she must have fallen asleep at some point because when she woke up, the professor was sitting at the table with a cup of coffee. \"Did you fall asleep in your chair, Eliza? That was very irresponsible of you.\" \"I'm sorry, Professor,\" she said as she sat up and rubbed her eyes. \"What time is it?\" \"Why, it is two-thirty in the morning! It's practically time for –\" he looked at the clock on the wall and then got up to peer through the curtains. He sighed, and for the first time, Eliza saw sympathy come across the professor's face. \"I suppose it's time for you to go upstairs and get some rest. I'll go fetch Mrs. Pearce and have her help you undress.\" \"No, please,\" she said before yawning and getting out of the chair. \"If you are ready to start the day, then so am I!\" He opened his mouth to tell her what he wanted her to do, but he quickly shut it because deep down in the back of his mind, he knew she needed to go upstairs and rest. To tell the complete truth, he wanted her to rest because when she was tired, she became irritable, and when she became irritable, they would fight because he could not handle her emotions. No, he had learned his lesson. It was best he looked out for her well-being. \"No, Eliza, I am not ready to start the day. I simply could not sleep. I'll go get Mrs. Pearce, and you go up to bed.\" \"No,\" she quickly interjected, \"there's no need to wake her. I can dress myself.\" \"Oh, well, alright then. Goodnight.\" \"Wait. Would you mind accompanying me up the stairs though? It's terribly dark, and I don't see so well,\" she asked shyly. \"Oh, tosh, Eliza, that's so silly. I'm sure you could make it just fine. You have before. Really, Eliza, must you insist on being so delicate?\" She looked hurt as she slowly turned around, so he instinctively stopped her. \"Wait, Eliza, I wouldn't want you to fall. I would never forgive myself if you did. I'll go with you.\" She nodded and allowed him to walk beside her. He held a small gas lamp in his hand as he carefully walked her up the stairs, his hand brushing lightly against the center of her back. They both stopped in front of her door. She smiled at him and turned the knob, but before she entered, he snatched her arm. \"Eliza,\" he said softly, \"I am very glad you came back.\" She smiled. She didn't really know what to say, but she grabbed his hand and gave it a small squeeze before entering her room and lightly shutting the door behind her.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Mr. Keats By 6:00 am, the professor was sitting at his desk trying his best to put it in order. If Eliza was going to sit there it needed to be neat for her. What was he thinking? He grumbled to himself as he shoved another stack of phonetics books in the bottom drawer. Why would he change his habits for a woman? He always said such a thing was preposterous. He'd never felt compelled to change for the sake of a woman before. Eliza fully knew that his desk was always a station of organized chaos anyways. He threw himself in his chair with a grumble and knocked the container of pens over just for good measure. Well, now that he thought about it, his desk was rather unsightly – even for him. \"Oh, damn,\" he moaned before rushing back to organize. Suddenly, a pair of dainty hands picked up a handful of the pens and placed them back in the little bucket. Professor Higgins turned to look at the owner of the pair of tiny paws and found Eliza standing behind him with a small smile. She had on a white shirt trimmed with ruffles of lace and a green and gold plaid skirt. A little gold brooch was fixed on her collar which brought out the gleam in her eyes. She even had her hair down – a sight the professor had not yet witnessed. The brown locks were tied half back in a green ribbon, her hair falling in ringlets behind her back. It was a modest look. She was beautiful, but, \"Eliza, why the devil are you up already?\" was all that he could manage to say. \"Well, I couldn't very well sleep with you banging around downstairs, so I just decided to get up,\" she replied. \"What would you like me to help you with, Professor Higgins.\" \"Well, sit here at my desk,\" he said as he pulled out her chair for her, \"and sort things the way you would like them. If you don't know where everything is, it will waste time and make you inefficient, and we can't have that.\" \"Yes, sir,\" she answered as he turned on his heel to go towards the library. She sighed and opened the top drawer. Pulling out its contents, she timidly peeked at the gold lettering on each of the books. Did he really trust her to go through all of his things? She opened the book on top and read the contents of the page she turned to. The language went way above her head, but she still soaked in every bit of it. She wondered how any human being had the capabilities to write any sort of way. Even more, she wondered how anyone could read it. She closed the book again and placed it in the center drawer underneath the tray of stationary so she could look at it later. The day went on fairly uneventful. Mr. Higgins stepped out to go see his mother about matters that he did not mention. The Colonel wrapped himself up in the newspaper until he eventually fell asleep in his wing chair. Mrs. Pearce and the maids were bustling around as usual when Mr. Higgins was away. It was really the only time they could clean the sitting room because Mr. Higgins was usually in there, and he hated to be bothered. Yes, it may have just been an ordinary day, but Eliza felt different from usual. It felt more like she was in another world. Twenty four hours before, she had been telling Mr. Higgins that she never wanted to see him again. Now, she was transfixed in his house as if she had never left. Eliza had never really thought the professor a kind man, but there had to have been more to his character that what she had originally bargained for. After all, she had seen the man cry. It had changed her entire perception of him. Somewhere beneath that hard shell he was coated in was a kindly and dignified soul. Perhaps she would never see that side of him again, but she had seen it none the less. She would never look at him the same way again. Eliza skimmed over her hidden book until she saw Mrs. Pearce rush to answer the door. Then the little leather-bound thing was slammed shut and shoved back into the bottom of the desk drawer. \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\" she heard him complain from the entry hall. She snatched them off of the foot stool by the desk and set them beside his feet as he threw himself down on the sofa with a great heave which startled Colonel Pickering awake. \"You seem frustrated,\" Eliza quietly observed. \"No, Eliza, I'm just jolly,\" he replied sarcastically. She rolled her eyes. \"What has upset you?\" \"Let us just say that my mother is a sentimental old fool, and I am in that temper that if I were under water, I would scarcely kick to come to the top.\" \"John Keats,\" she muttered. \"What's that you say?\" \"John Keats,\" she repeated. \"You quoted John Keats just then.\" \"Oh, Eliza, don't tell me you've been filling your head with those sentimental love poems.\" \"I remember there was a time when you begged me to read Milton and Keats. Besides, I thought you liked him.\" \"I do, but it's different for me.\" \"Why is that?\" \"It's because I'm a sensible man, not an overly emotional woman.\" \"Well, I'd much rather have love in my heart instead of useless information in my head!\" Mrs. Pearce who was about to hand Mr. Higgins his mail swiftly took a step back and stared at Eliza with shock. When did this girl learn to stand up to him like that? \"There's no such thing as love. Eliza, you're a fool!\" he shouted. \"So I've been told,\" she said back calmly. \"I might be a fool, but at least I'm not blind. You see what you look for, Professor Higgins, and I've seen love before.\" \"In heaven's name, where? When was that? You certainly didn't see it from your father.\" \"Now, Mr. Higgins, that is quite enough! You needn't bring the girl's family into this,\" Mrs. Pearce quickly intervened. \"I've had quite enough of you talking down to the poor child. She didn't do anything to you!\" \"Really, Higgins,\" the Colonel added, \"the only reason you bully her is because she has enough wit to keep up with your arguments.\" \"She only has enough wit because she grew up on the streets where she had no choice but to acquire it,\" Higgins retorted. Eliza heaved a great groan of frustration and turned around to march up the stairs. \"Eliza, where are you going?\" Colonel Pickering quickly shouted. \"Away,\" she said as she briefly turned around to look at them from the landing. \"Eliza, no!\" She turned around again this time to see that voice had belonged to Professor Higgins, and he was standing at the foot of the stairs, his green eyes pleading with her not to go. My, how the tables had turned. She remembered standing at the foot of those stairs once or twice before. She took a shaky breath and stood in confidence with her chin held high. \"You say there's no such thing as love, Professor Higgins, but as I said before, you see what you look for.\" She looked him up and down. \"I see that you are blind to your own reflection for I see love right now.\" With that, she marched up the stairs followed by Mrs. Pearce and Colonel Pickering leaving Higgins alone to process what had just happened.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Only If You Apologize Eliza did not leave, but she locked herself in her room for days. She occasionally granted the Colonel entrance, and they would talk of things that the professor discovered he was not to know about. Mrs. Pearce brought up her meals and was apparently on Eliza's side because she was also giving Mr. Higgins a silent treatment. As for Henry Higgins, he went up and stood outside of her door many times in attempt to get her to come down, but the most convincing thing he ever managed to say was that he would deduct her salary if she \"kept being such a plain idiot.\" Higgins paced the floor as Pickering scanned the next week's newspaper. \"I don't understand, Pickering!\" he shouted with great force as Mrs. Pearce slammed down a tea tray on the side table next to the sofa. \"Why would she lock herself up in that blasted room for so long? Was anything I said to her really at all that bad?\" \"Just give her time, Higgins, she'll be alright.\" \"She'll be irrational is what she'll be. She already is.\" \"Does it occur to you, Higgins, that she does indeed have things in her life that she does not like discussed? Why do you think she said that she didn't have any parents when she came here?\" \"Well, to get my sympathy of course,\" Higgins replied with a scoff. The Colonel rolled his eyes and turned the page in his paper. \"And how would you feel, Higgins, if I asked you about your father?\" \"What utter nonsense, Pickering, I haven't a father at all.\" \"Yes, you do. We all have a father. You just chose not to acknowledge yours.\" \"Rubbish, Pickering, don't speak in riddles. You'll sound just like a woman.\" \"And what is it that you have against women? Let's discuss that shall we?\" \"What is it that you have against women, Pickering? I don't see you marching off to a wedding any time soon.\" \"No one said anything about marriage. You can respect women without marrying them. I never married because I was a man of the army. There's no time for a family when you're deployed in other colonies and countries.\" \"What about when you ended your time in the military?\" \"I decided to study language in India. That's no place to raise a family. Besides, I never met the right woman.\" \"Because they're all simply irrational!\" \"No, Higgins, because I never fell in love.\" \"There's no such thing as love!\" \"Eliza thinks there is.\" \"Blast Eliza!\" \"I think there is too.\" \"Pickering, please, I like you as a chum. I wouldn't say that I –\" \"I meant when you look at Eliza.\" Mr. Higgins stopped his pacing and glared back at Pickering. \"Why the devil would you say that?\" he asked softly, his nerves clearly evident in his tone. \"She's the only person who could walk out of your life right now and leave you empty inside.\" \"Rubbish.\" \"Deny it all you want, but we all know it's true, even you.\" Higgins sighed and pressed his fingers to his temples. He threw himself in his chair. It was quiet for a long time minus the sound of Mrs. Pearce bustling about to throw away discarded letters. By nightfall, Pickering was dozing in his wing chair as Higgins still sat pouting, contemplating. It was dead silent and dark. He wanted to ask Mrs. Pearce to turn on the lights, but her angry glare kept him from it. Somewhere in the midst of the deadly dullness, he heard the soft sound of a pair of heels quietly coming to the landing. He turned his head a little to look and saw Eliza hanging off of the side of the banister looking for Mrs. Pearce. His mind was racing at what to say. He saw her come down to the landing and slowly look around the first floor. When she spotted him, she took off running back up the stairs. Higgins chased after her. When he was just close enough to reach out and grab her, she ran back in her room and slammed the door shut. He knocked on it hard with his fist. \"Damn it, Eliza, open the door! You can't stay in that blasted room forever! You've eventually got to come down and face your problems!\" \"Why don't you face yours?\" she shouted back. \"We're not talking about me. Now, I insist you come out of that room this instant!\" \"Or what?\" \"Or… or...\" he stammered. \"I'm not coming out until you apologize.\" \"Is that all you want? You just want a bloody apology?\" He huffed and rolled his eyes. She put the whole household through days of nonsense for him to say two words. He grunted. \"I'm sorry,\" he said quickly. \"Now, come out.\" \"You didn't mean it,\" she mumbled in a pouty tone that Higgins hated. \"What on earth do you mean? Of course I meant it.\" \"You didn't sound like it.\" He grinded his teeth and leaned his head against the door frame in defeat. \"Fine. I am genuinely and deeply sorry for hurting your feelings. Are you happy now?\" There was a long silence before he finally heard the door click. She opened the door a crack, and he could see one puffy gray colored eye peeking out at him. He stood straight and put his hands behind his back. He cleared his throat and rocked back and forth on his heels. \"I really am sorry,\" he finally concluded softly as his eyes seemed to suddenly become interested in the carpet in the hall. She sighed and opened the door wider. She leaned against the door frame and put her hands behind her back. \"That's more like it.\" She giggled in attempt to show him she was only teasing him with the statement, but he still rolled his eyes. She bit her lip and also studied the gold flowers on the carpet. \"You know I don't mean to anger you,\" she said shakily, \"but it's frustrating when you do not do the same.\" \"Eliza, what are you talking about? I treat you kinder than I treat anyone else in the entire world.\" \"Then I feel sorry for every other person in the entire world.\" He grinded his teeth. \"Why do I even try to speak with you?\" \"Well, you must care for me if you are apparently kinder to me than anyone else in the entire world. Besides, you are a man… who never gives up.\" He looked up at her as she stared at her shuffling feet. \"Was that a compliment, Miss Doolittle?\" \"Perhaps it was,\" she replied. \"Just don't let it go to your head. It's already big enough.\" He started to get angry, but she looked up at him with a smile. Much to his own surprise, he smiled back at her jest, and just like that, she was back.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Pickering jumped as he heard a crash from the next room. \"You told me to rearrange your desk to any way I saw fit!\" he heard Eliza shout. \"I didn't think you'd make such a mess out of it!\" Higgins shouted back. \"Well, it still looks better than the wreck you had it in to begin with!\" Pickering shook his head and pulled his newspaper back up to read. Mrs. Pearce came in through the back door, drying her hands on an apron. \"Are they at it again, Colonel Pickering?\" she asked with a sigh. He grunted and turned the page in his paper. \"What do you think, Mrs. Pearce?\" \"At least they're talking to one another again,\" she said shaking her head. \"Do you think they'll ever get along?\" \"They are getting along in their way,\" Pickering sighed, \"though it's certainly not my way.\" \"Nor is it mine,\" she said gathering her skirts and sitting at the tiny kitchen table across from Pickering. Just then there was another crash. \"And what the bloody hell is this?\" Higgins asked before another bump against the wall. \"I didn't even know I owned this!\" \"You didn't! It's mine! I read it when you're gone! Now, give it back!\" \"Go get it yourself!\" \"Don't you dare!\" There was another thump and then the sound of heels scurrying across the floor. \"That's it! I've had enough of this. Consider me sick for the rest of the day!\" \"Gladly!\" Pickering and Mrs. Pearce breathed a heavy sigh in unison. \"Would you like some tea, Colonel?\" Mrs. Pearce asked calmly. \"I'd love some tea. It might be the only pleasant thing I have all day.\" They both chuckled as the sound of Eliza's boots made their way up the stairs, but then it stopped. There was a cry. Mrs. Pearce and the Colonel looked at each other before dashing out of the kitchen only to find Eliza sitting on the stairs. Her face was writhed with pain. \"Are you alright, Eliza?\" Higgins asked as he rushed to her, crouched down, and began to unlace her boot. \"I think so,\" she grimaced. He softly removed the shoe and examined her foot. \"This blasted ankle is already swollen,\" he muttered. He looked over his shoulder at the pair standing in the doorway. \"Mrs. Pearce, something cold, please.\" \"Yes, sir,\" she said with a curtsy before giving the Colonel a sly smile which he returned. They both turned and made their way back to the kitchen. \"Henry, I'm alright,\" Eliza said with a chuckle as she adjusted herself to sit on the step. \"It's just a twisted ankle.\" \"Eliza, you're hurt, and I… Did you just call me Henry?\" he asked looking up from her foot. She blushed a bright pink. \"Must 'ave slipped out o' me mouth,\" she replied, her nerves causing her to revert back to her old way of speaking. \"Alright, I've got a cool piece of meat here that ought to do the trick!\" Mrs. Pearce said as she bustled out of the kitchen. Higgins took it and pressed it to her ankle, cooling the swollen place through her stocking. \"Blasted thing,\" he muttered, \"you know, Eliza, you really should have stronger ankles.\" She sighed. \"I don't think that was really my choice was it?\" He looked up at her, but as he started to argue, he shut his mouth and gave a small nod. \"Indeed, it was not.\" She gave a small smile acknowledging his efforts. Mrs. Pearce stood behind with a knowing smile and turned to go back to the kitchen. \"Let's get you off of the stairs,\" he muttered. \"Here. I'll help you stand.\" He stood and offered her his hand which she grasped as she tried to pull herself up only to trip on her skirts and fall once more. A pink blush spread across her cheeks as she pulled the garment out from under her heel. Higgins rolled his eyes with a sigh and awkwardly put his arm around her waist as he helped her stand. She leaned on him heavily as he helped her down the steps and sat her down on the sofa. He stood back as she looked up at him. He appeared to be in thought. \"Ah!\" he finally exclaimed as he snapped his finger. He grabbed a cushion off of the wing chair and set it at the other end of the couch. He gently took her injured ankle in his hand and placed it on the cushion as she adjusted the way she sat. He pressed the steak to the wound once more and stood back with his hands folded in front of him. It was silent for a moment as Eliza made herself comfortable. He didn't move, and she was trying desperately to avoid his eyes. \"Thank you,\" she muttered. He nodded, but he continued to stand in front of her. \"Is there anything else, Professor Higgins?\" He cleared his throat and shifted his weight. \"No, I was just wondering if I could get you anything else.\" She smirked. \"The great Henry Higgins is offering to help me?\" He scratched his chin and looked at the back wall not acknowledging her sarcasm. He shifted nervously as she sat back and shook her head. \"No, I am quite alright,\" she said with a chuckle. The tension in Professor Higgins's shoulders immediately subsided. \"Good, good, well, I will be in the kitchen. If you need anything, just shout. I am sure Mrs. Pearce would be more than happy to aid you. I will tell her that your health is of utmost importance to me. I cannot have my secretary down on the job.\" She smiled and nodded. \"Thank you, Professor Higgins.\" He nodded and began to march towards the kitchen door, but he stopped in his tracks and turned back towards her. \"Oh, and Eliza,\" he boomed. She looked up at him with a raised eyebrow, \"Yes, Professor?\" He cleared his throat and stood straight. \"It would… it would be alright if you called me Henry… if you want to.\" She smiled. \"Of course, Henry.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 \"Is there anything I can get you, dear?\" Mrs. Pearce asked sweetly. \"No,\" Eliza said simply as she looked over her book before quickly going back to reading, \"thank you.\" \"That must be a great novel, Eliza. You haven't put it down.\" Mrs. Pearce adjusted the pillow under Eliza's foot as she finished reading the page she was on. She then shut the cover, leaving her thumb in the place where she left off. \"Henry gave it to me. He said that it would pass the time while my ankle healed. I must say that it is quite eventful.\" \"Wait. Who gave you the novel?\" \"Why, Henry of course,\" Eliza replied as she looked over the gold etching on the cover. Mrs. Pearce cleared her throat. \"Hmm, yes, Henry of course. What is your book called?\" \"It is Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte.\" \"Oh, yes, I've read that before. I can't say that I remember much about it.\" \"It's the first book that I've read at all that has a girl as its main character. I must say that I enjoy it, mostly because Jane is so head strong of course.\" Mrs. Pearce chuckled. \"Sounds like another girl I know.\" Eliza smiled at her before opening the book once more and picking up where she left off. \"Mrs. Pearce, where is Higgins?\" Pickering asked as he came down the stairs. \"I have an important matter to discuss with him.\" \"Why, I don't know, Colonel. He didn't tell me where he went. He left about an hour ago though.\" \"Henry went to visit his mother,\" Eliza said without looking up from her book. \"He said that he had important matters to discuss with her, and he also wanted to visit her garden to collect some flowers.\" \"Henry?\" Pickering mouthed to Mrs. Pearce who shrugged unknowingly in return. \"Why, but Professor Higgins hates his mother's garden,\" Mrs. Pearce protested. \"He is allergic to the pollen that the flowers give off. Perhaps you misheard him, dear.\" \"Perhaps,\" Eliza said with a shrug before putting her book down again, \"but I distinctly remember him saying something about flowers. I don't know why he would want them if he didn't like them, but I don't know how I would mistake the word flowers for anything else.\" Eliza shifted herself being careful not to injure herself any farther. \"What is it that you need, Colonel? I know where most of the professor's files are. Perhaps I can help.\" \"No, no that's alright, Eliza,\" he said with a small smile. \"No, what I wish to discuss with him is a matter that must be dealt with in person.\" \"Surely you're not in any trouble, Colonel,\" Mrs. Pearce said with a worried expression across her face. \"No, no, not at all, Mrs. Pearce. Well, I really wanted to tell Professor Higgins first, but I suppose I must tell the both of you as well. No, I am heading home for a period of time.\" \"Heading home?\" Eliza muttered. \"Do you mean to India?\" He nodded. \"Yes, I am afraid so. It will not be long though. I only intend to be there long enough to collect my things. I had forgotten how pleasant it is here in London. I mean, India certainly has its charms or I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did, but coming back here made me realize how much I missed my true home.\" \"So you'll be coming back to stay with us, Colonel?\" Eliza asked with hope in her eyes. \"No,\" he said, \"I am afraid not.\" Eliza looked down at her book in disappointment, but the Colonel smiled. \"However,\" he continued, \"I will not be very far. There is a house down the street that I have made a down payment on.\" Eliza smiled brightly as Mrs. Pearce gushed. \"Oh, Colonel, that's wonderful! We're so happy for you.\" \"Yes, well, I have a ticket to be on my boat tomorrow morning. I did wish to speak to Higgins so that we might dine together tonight, it being my last one here and all. Oh, well, I guess things don't always go according to plan.\" \"Perhaps,\" Eliza said with a sly smile, \"Mrs. Pearce could join you for dinner.\" \"What? Eliza, no!\" she protested. \"Why not? You must be very exhausted looking after this house day after day. When was the last time you left it?\" \"Eliza, you are too much! Besides, even if I did dine with the Colonel, I would have nothing to wear.\" \"Well, Colonel Pickering knows the owner of Whitley's quite well at this point I am sure. I'm sure they could find a gown that suits you.\" The Colonel and Mrs. Pearce stood awkwardly for a moment, their gazes shifting from the floor to each other. \"I would be honored for your company, Mrs. Pearce,\" Pickering said finally, \"but I do not wish to make you go anywhere you do not wish to go.\" \"Well,\" she said as she thought, \"I suppose if I had a gown, I would very much like to dine with you, Colonel.\" He smiled. \"Then it's settled.\" He offered her his arm. \"It's already evening. We will go by and get you that dress, and we can go straight to dinner if that's alright with you.\" She smiled back up at him and took his arm. \"I suppose that would do. Eliza, if you need anything at all, just ring for Mary.\" Eliza grinned at her little success as she heard the front door shut. She picked her book back up, but after a couple of chapters, her mind started to wonder. She had the entire house to herself aside from the servants who were all retired for the evening. Not that she could move about the house anyway. It seemed oddly quiet without Henry's constant bantering or Mrs. Pearce's bustling about. She sighed and reached over her shoulder, doing a bit of acrobatics to turn the lamp on. She looked at the time and noticed that she had been alone for a little over an hour. Henry was right. That book really did pass the time. Eliza stared off into the distance for a while until she eventually dozed off. It wasn't long though that she was awoken by a door slam and a horridly loud sneeze. She bolted upright and looked around the room only to see Professor Higgins sticking a vase of hydrangeas on his desk before sneezing into his coat sleeve again. \"Blasted things,\" he muttered as he ripped off his hat and coat. \"If you're allergic to them, why did you get them?\" Eliza asked making him jump. \"Eliza!\" he said quickly turning around, \"I forgot you were there. Where is Mrs. Pearce?\" \"She went out.\" \"Went out? Why on earth would she do that?\" \"Colonel Pickering wanted to dine with you tonight, but since you weren't here, I suggested that he take Mrs. Pearce for company.\" \"Ah,\" he exclaimed as he hung his own coat and hat on the rack, \"and why did you do that? This has nothing to do with you filling your silly little head with all of those love stories does it?\" \"No, and even if it did, those stories aren't silly.\" \"They are to me.\" \"Then why did you give me one to read?\" she asked in a snarky tone as she held up the book. He rolled his eyes. \"I only gave you that because it's just the sort of thing you enjoy.\" \"So you don't like it?\" \"Not at all.\" \"That's interesting because you have quotes underlined in here,\" she said flipping through the pages, \"including this one where Mr. Rochester declares his love for Jane.\" \"Who said I underlined those?\" \"There's also handwriting out to the side, and I'm your secretary. I would know that handwriting anywhere.\" He sighed. \"If you must know, I underlined that quote to use for a social experiment.\" \"I'll pretend to believe you, Henry, just like I'll pretend to believe that you got those flowers for yourself.\" \"What the devil are you suggesting, you silly invalid?\" \"You know,\" she said with a shrug, \"but I don't wish to fight with you.\" \"You think I would get these horrid things for you?\" he said with a condescending chuckle as he rubbed a flower petal between his thumb and pointer finger. \"I know you would because I'm injured, and you feel badly about it,\" she said still flipping through pages. \"You idiotic little thing, I wouldn't do that in a million years. I just got them to make the place look better in case we have company.\" \"Whatever you say, Henry,\" she sighed. He turned around and marched up the stairs, grumbling all the way. When he was gone, she put the book down and giggled as she heard his door slam shut.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 This chapter is extremely short, and I apologize that this is all you get after such a long wait.

Eliza tossed and turned in her sleep, or, well, the best one can toss and turn in their sleep when they're injured. Her ankle had healed significantly since the day she had wounded it. With the help of Mrs. Pearce, she was able to hobble over to Henry's desk and do her work. She could bear to put a little weight on her foot. The Colonel had left for India two days ago with no specific indication as to when he would be back again. It seemed oddly empty in the house without him. There was no man sitting in the armchair reading the paper, no grunts at Henry's jokes as everyone had their morning coffee, and there were no peculiar phone calls to be answered. Eliza supposed the change is what had made her so restless. Her eyes drifted towards the clock on the wall which she could see due to the light that was streaming down the hall from the library. She supposed one of the maid servants could not sleep either and decided to do a bit of reading which wasn't an uncommon occurrence. Perhaps they could use some company. She stiffly pulled herself out of bed and put her robe on. She limped through the bedroom and down the hall, leaning on the furniture all of the way. It took her much longer to get to the library than it should have, and when she arrived, it appeared that there was no one there. Just as she started to turn around, a voice sounded from the back of the room. \"What the devil are you doing up?\" She turned and limped a little farther into the room. Past the pillar, she could see the professor sitting in the window seat with a book in his hands. She smiled and leaned on the pillar. \"I could ask you the same thing.\" \"I wasn't tired. You need rest. Now, go back to bed!\" She frowned and folded her arms. \"Well, I can't very well get rest if I can't sleep.\" He rolled his eyes before putting his glasses back on and aggressively turning the page of his book. \"What are you reading?\" \"It's nothing you would be interested in, Eliza.\" \"I think you have very little faith in me.\" \"Yes, Eliza, I took you in and betted a small fortune that you could become a lady because I had very little faith in you,\" he grumbled. She hobbled over and sat beside him on the window seat. \"Then you admit that my learning how to be a lady wasn't entirely your doing. I did do part of it.\" \"You couldn't have done it at all without me.\" \"Then you have very little faith in me,\" she said once more with a sigh. There was silence for a while as Henry read and Eliza played with the tassels on her robe. The street lamps down below were flickering as one lonely soul walked down the streets. Eliza pressed her forehead to the window as she watched him stroll, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his suit. \"What are you reading?\" she finally asked as her fingers drew on the bottom of the window where the fog had overtaken the glass. \"Balzac if you must know,\" he replied as he turned another page. \"Won't you read to me, Henry?\" \"This isn't the sort of thing one reads to a lady. I do wish that you would go to bed, Eliza.\" \"Well, I'm not tired, and I'm just a flower girl,\" she said with a small smirk. He glanced at her like he wanted to argue, but he didn't. After a moment of silence, he began to read the text aloud. Eliza didn't really know what he was saying nor did she care. She curled up in the corner of the seat and let the cool glass of the window cool her head. Her eyes fluttered closed as the drone of his voice eventually put her to sleep. After a while, he looked down and noticed that she was lifeless. He gave an irritated sigh and shut the book before placing it on the side table. He was going to walk off and leave her, but something compelled him to look back. Quietly, he slipped off his suit jacket and placed it over her shoulders before turning on his heels and leaving the room, grumbling all the way about his incessant and unnecessary feelings.[Chapter 7] Dear All, I hate it when authors put updates with no content to the story, but I am afraid that it is necessary at the moment. I promise that it will be deleted with the next update of each story. I HAVE NOT QUIT! I have received several messages and reviews asking when I'm going to update, and I promise you that it will be soon. I am going to try to take the time on Friday and at least update one or two of these. For those of you who didn't know, I began college back in August which means living in a new city, adjusting to a new environment, making new friends, etc. Needless to say, my time to write has been lacking. Being a BFA Theatre major takes many, many hours. If it tells you anything as to what adjusting to my new schedule is like, I'm sitting here writing this in the big middle of class. It's like I woke up and realized how many months it had been since my last update. Long story short, I am very, very sorry for the long time update. I will be with you all soon. Don't lose faith in me, and thank you all for your recommendations and sticking with me through this long journey. It is much appreciated. All my love, E. B.

Two days ago, I finished up playing Eliza "},{"Movie":"My Fair Lady","Title":"Torn Between Two","Author":"Classic Movie Fan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11600510","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the characters mentioned in this story except for Charlotte, who I created. Any others that I made up will be mentioned in future disclaimers. All other characters, such as Eliza Doolittle, Freddy Hill, or Henry Higgins do not belong to me. It wasn't often that much happened in Miss Eliza Doolittle's life that was worth mentioning. At least, not after what happened that was openly known to the public. After that, which encompassed her lessons with Professor Henry Higgins, the Embassy Ball, running away, and then returning again, life was pretty commonplace for her. Everything that occurred happened to other people too. She ended up living at 27A Wimpole Street, with Professor Higgins. But, once a month, she got a chance to venture beyond the commonness of everyday life. For on that one day, actually, night was more of the proper word for it, she got to go with Freddy Eynsford-Hill out to wherever he wanted to bring her. On a partly cloudy summer night, something happened that normally did not happen. Something out of the ordinary. Something that the public never knew about, and, until this day, no one ever heard about it. Freddy opened the door to the taxi for Eliza. \"After you Darling,\" he said politely, giving a bow. Eliza smiled at Freddy. \"Thank you,\" she said, nimbly climbing inside. \"You are such a gentleman Freddy.\" Freddy followed her. \"I try to be,\" he responded, looking away to try to hide his blush. Looking at Freddy, Eliza realized that he had grown on her. Something about him made her feel at ease, as if everything was perfect; nothing could go wrong, or at least, so she thought. Freddy too echoed her feelings, although both were too timid to say anything to each other. Freddy finally decided to say something to Eliza. He hadn't told her that he would have to sneak her into this 'family' party that he decided to bring her to. She'd have to pretend to be his cousin. \"Eliza, there's something I have to tell you. I'm going to have to sneak you in because this is a family party and they don't exactly know about you,\" he said sheepishly. Eliza giggled. \"Freddy, you are always getting yourself into trouble!\" she said teasingly. \"But I'm sure that if anyone can sneak me in, you can!\" Freddy beamed back at her. Feeling the taxi come to a complete halt, he opened the door for her and helped her down. \"Come on Eliza Darling, let's go in,\" he said. Eliza nodded and followed obediently behind him. It was a fancy house they were going to, there was no doubt about it. Easily, they slipped inside without detection. As she saw the amount of people inside, she realized that if they just got lost in the crowd, no one would ever realize she was there. \"So this is your big family? You weren't kidding when you told me that you had a big one,\" she said. \"Well, let's just say that some are close friends of the family...\" Freddy said. Trying the change the subject, he added, \"May I have this dance?\" \"My pleasure!\" Eliza instantly said. The two danced around, as the music played. When the song stopped, Freddy looked over to his right to see a familiar face. He hadn't seen this girl in years, although, strangely enough, she seemed so familiar. \"If you'll pardon me Eliza...\" he said politely. Eliza looked back and forth from Freddy to the other girl, who had to be around her age. \"Okay Freddy, go ahead,\" she said, taking a step back. The girl was beautiful, anyone could see that from just a glance. With shoulder-length blonde hair, blue eyes, and a cute smile, Eliza was sure that this newcomer would win over Freddy. The girl looked up at Freddy and smiled. \"Freddy, that has to be you! I haven't seen you in years!\" she cried happily. \"I thought you went somewhere, like, to another country!\" Freddy snickered. \"I've been here all along. And, excuse my humor of this situation, but it seems as if you know me like you were my sister. I'm sorry to say, but I don't quite remember you very well,\" he said bashfully. Giggling, the girl grabbed Freddy's hand. \"It's Charlotte, remember me? And also remember...say, four or five years ago?\" she asked him. Freddy shook his head, not out of temporary memory loss, but in bewilderment. \"Charlotte?! I-I-I thought that-well, never mind. But I do remember. Uh, if you'd give me a moment with Eliza here, uh, I'd appreciate it,\" he stuttered. Charlotte nodded. \"Anything my dear!\" she said happily. Freddy took Eliza to the side. \"Eliza, this may come as a complete surprise to you, but, Charlotte over there, well, she's, well, she was going to be my wife.\" Thank you for reading. There is more to come, as this is only Chapter One! Please keep on reading and post a review if you have the time. I'd love to hear what you think of my first fan-fiction. Thanks again![Chapter 2] Eliza glared at Freddy. \"We are SO talking about this! Follow me, we are going somewhere private,\" she said sternly. She grabbed him by the arm and pulled him all the way into a crowded closet. \"A little too close for comfort, but I can't worry about that now,\" she mumbled. Shifting uncomfortably from one foot to the next, Freddy looked at Eliza. He was speechless, almost afraid of saying one word, in fear of getting yelled at. But it was too late. By now, he had gone too far. Eliza couldn't hold it in any longer. She let it out, every word uttered echoing back. \"Oh, now I get it. I get it! This was your plan all along. Pull me along on a string, attach me to you, get me to love you, and then this is what happens. You drop me like I was, some soft of-of-thing that you can love one second and drop the next! You never cared. You just wanted to add me to your-your-collection!\" she yelled. Freddy took a step back, but ended up bumping into the door. \"Eliza, you don't understand-\" he started to say. Shaking her head, Eliza said, \"No I don't! I never got why you wanted me when you have your choice of so many other girls! Why do you want me?!\" Freddy once again started to explain. \"I do love you Eliza. More than anyone else. I didn't know about her, I forgot about her, don't you see?\" he stuttered. \"Yes, I see. You'll forget about me just like you did her!\" Eliza shot back at him. \"No, I won't. I don't like her. It was more forced on me than anything. I mean, she's nice and all, but I don't want to marry her. You are the only girl I ever liked. I want you! And, can we go somewhere with more space...it's a bit tight in here...\" he asked her. Eliza nodded. \"Let's get out of here. But don't think that I'm happy with you. Because I'm not,\" she said, opening the door to the closet. Once again, she grabbed a hold of Freddy's arm and tugged him along behind her. But they didn't get quite far, as someone stopped them from leaving. \"Who are you?\" the older butler asked Eliza, never seeing her before, and not knowing if she was invited. Eliza smiled her sweetest smile at him. \"I'm his-\" she started, pointing to Freddy, who rudely interrupted her. Freddy cleared his throat and started talking in such a fast voice, nobody could understand him. \"She's my mother's sister's husband's brother's cousin's sister's best friend,\" he explained. Eliza looked up at him like he was crazy-but then again, perhaps he was. \"What he said,\" she said. The butler just shook his head, and motioned them out the door. Eliza sighed as she got into the taxi. \"I was just going to say I was your cousin's best friend, but you didn't have to go and make it even more confusing,\" she explained. Freddy blushed. \"Uh, well, I tried to think of something quickly. I take it it didn't come out right,\" he said sheepishly. The taxi drove them back to Wimpole Street. The was a cold silence the whole time. Right before it even stopped, Eliza put her hand on the door of the taxi, opened it up, and got out herself, storming into the apartment. \"Darling! Don't go just yet! I thought you weren't mad at me anymore!\" Freddy cried. Swiftly he followed her, sneaking into the apartment before she slammed the door. \"Please, don't be cross with me. I didn't mean it, Darling. Honest and truly I didn't!\" Eliza didn't even answer him. She ran up the stairs, fighting back the stinging tears in her eyes. Professor Higgins was secretly listening to Freddy's pleas. \"What did you do this time, Prince Charming?\" he mocked as he walked down the stairs. \"Did you hurt Cinderella's feelings? Anyone could tell that she was crying as she ran away from you.\" Freddy couldn't take teasing anymore from the Professor. Instead of taking out his frustration on Eliza, he took it out on Henry. \"Don't you talk to me like that! Sure, you're older and perhaps 'wiser' than I am, but I only give respect where respect is due! You don't deserve it from me. Go ahead, take Eliza as your wife, see if she'd be happier with you. I don't want anymore of this. I'll go home and live the rest of my life there, helping my mother and finding a good paying job. Maybe, just maybe, I'd find something that would one day make me your equal. Maybe then you'd treat me kindly and with respect,\" he shouted. \"I've tried long enough to be your friend and finally got Eliza's friendship that I've longed for ever since that day at Ascot. But you know what, this other girl-oh, I don't want to even mention her-she comes along and ruins it! The world is full of people, all out to get you and destroy you and your hopes and dreams. I won't have you destroy them also! Try, try, go ahead and try! See if I care! I'm leaving, so goodnight!\" Placing his hat back on his head, he reached for the doorknob and then suddenly stopped. He sighed. \"Why must I love Eliza? It's like a war going on inside me. I'm sorry,\" he said to Professor Higgins, turning to face him. \"Those words just came out. It's not what I meant. My heart is telling me something other than what I spoke. I-I-just-will you do me a favor? Could you just tell Eliza I'm sorry? I'll have things figured out in the morning,\" he explained. Henry stared at Freddy in surprise. He didn't realize that he had all that bottled up inside. He never thought that the younger man would stick up for himself like that. Truthfully, he thought he was just a lovesick boy who didn't think things through. Getting over his shock, he looked down at Freddy. \"I will. Just go home and don't worry,\" he said, opening the door for Freddy. Shaking his head, he walked upstairs to go talk to Eliza.[Chapter 3] Eliza slammed the door to her bedroom, grabbed the key, and locked it. She leaned against the door, tears rolling down her face, clutching the key so hard it made a indentation on her hand. Thankful that she could be left alone in her room, she closed her eyes, hoping things would return to normal. She never wanted to see Freddy again. Ever. She would never say another word to him. For a moment, she was happy to think that Freddy would be miserable, but after thinking about it for more than a minute, she realized that she was be just as unhappy as Freddy probably was. \"Why me?\" Eliza whispered quietly, in between sobs. She started walking slowly over to her bed, but then suddenly turned around, gave the door a hard pull to make sure it wouldn't open, and then turned and jumped onto her bed. She tried to block out all her feelings, but they kept haunting her, like a nightmare that keeps on reoccurring, only this wasn't a nightmare. This was real. Breathing heavily, Eliza sat up as she heard angry words downstairs, those who could only be Freddy's. She smirked, a feeling a little happier that he was upset, but still feeling the stinging pain inside. Why did he have to play that dirty trick on her? Was that his plan all along? She certainly hoped not, but now, she thought, what did it matter? What was done was done. Eliza stepped out of bed and put her head on the door. The shouting had now stopped and a sudden eerie calmness ascended over the house. Curious of what was happening, but still not wanting to venture from the safety of her room, she waited quietly and patiently. Soon, she head the front door open and shut, and not long after, footsteps coming up the stairs, coming closer and closer to her room. A sudden knocking on her door startled her and she jumped. Walking back over to look out her window, she saw the ebbing shadow of Freddy as he rounded the corner of the building. \"Eliza.\" Professor Higgins knocked on the door. \"I need to talk with you-now,\" he said seriously. When she didn't open up, he knocked a second time with more force than before. \"Eliza! Come here now!\" Eliza angrily unlocked and swung open her door. She glared at Professor Higgins as he walked inside. \"What do you want?\" she asked him. Higgins walked over to her and awkwardly put his hand on her arm. He had changed from those days when he used to be all bark and bite, but it still felt strange to him to be that gentle. \"I know something must have happened tonight and I am genuinely sorry. But you can't keep on with this and with Freddy. Eliza, I would like to ask you if you'd...er, well...would you marry me Eliza?\" he asked, finding it harder than he thought it would be to ask her that question. Although she didn't mean to, Eliza couldn't hide her surprise. That was the last question she thought he'd ever say to anyone. She knew this would be a good chance to get back at Freddy and also to marry into a richer family. But she didn't think she could ever be completely...happy. She looked up at him sweetly and smiled. \"Henry, that is the nicest thing I've ever heard anyone say and the sweetest thing I've ever heard you say to me. You are very good to me. But I don't think I could marry you. It's nothing personal and please always remember that you hold a special place in my heart. No one will replace you. I owe it to you for teaching me how to speak and act properly. If it wasn't for you, I'd still be out in the streets. I'm grateful to you for a lot of things, so please, accept my 'no', but remember that I still want to be close friends with you,\" she explained. Henry nodded his head. \"I understand,\" he said quietly, although he was a little hurt that she didn't want to marry him. Then, not meeting her eyes, he added, \"It's too bad about tonight. I don't think you should continue this relationship with Freddy. He seems too fickle and you do deserve better,\" he said, not wanting Eliza to go back to Freddy. In fact, he didn't want her to go to anyone. If he couldn't have her as a wife, he didn't want anyone to. Eliza sighed and hung her head. \"Maybe you're right. I don't think I'd like to spend the rest of my life with someone with such a capricious mood,\" she said sadly. Professor Higgins hid his smile. At least he wouldn't have to worry about Freddy anymore. \"Would you care for me to tell him?\" he asked her as he started to walk to the door. Eliza shook her head. \"No. I think it would be better for me personally to write a letter to tell him. Thank you anyway.\" And so, for the next hour, she composed a long letter to Mr. Frederick Eynsford-Hill, formally telling him that she would not be seeing him again, unless in passing. And so the printed words came true. Two months passed, and neither saw the other nor wrote just to ask how things were going. It seemed as if their friendship was broken-forever.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Once again, I shall introduce you to another main character, Dr. Grant. He is the Eynsford-Hill family doctor. All other characters (except for Charlotte) don't belong to me, as I have mentioned before. And so two months passed. More people came into Eliza's life, and slowly, she tried to forget about Freddy. Eventually, she got over him, but still wasn't that cheerful and happy girl she used to be. In fact, she seemed to have become more grownup about everything and also more serious. Not only that, but on the outside, she had almost completely moved on from Freddy. She started to expand her circle of friends, getting to know more people her own age. Whether this was a blessing in disguise or not, she didn't know. And even though she enjoyed herself immensely at social gatherings, she couldn't help but think of how her old friend Freddy was faring. To answer Eliza's thoughts, Freddy was, to put it simply, miserable. Over the two month interval, Freddy straightened things out with his friend Charlotte, only to find that she was just saying hello and had no interest in marrying him whatsoever. Although relieved, he came to realize that it was his own folly for telling Eliza everything that he said that night and he deeply regretted it. And now it seemed, it was too late. And so, because of his regret, he became someone unlike the Freddy he was before. It was as if he had changed his personality. Most of the day, he was found moping around in his room, hardly venturing from the house, even when he was asked to go somewhere or do something. It didn't matter if he was politely asked or if he was commanded to do so-if he didn't want to do whatever it was, he wouldn't do it. His mood changes were often: one minute he could be sweet and helpful and the next second instantly change to be irritable and unfriendly. His mood could be likened to an earthquake-unpredictable and sometimes destructive. He didn't care what he did or how his actions affected him or someone else. He was reckless and uncaring, and this affected his health greatly. He had gotten a cold during those two months and he just couldn't shake it off. Then again, his habits didn't help him either. He hardly ate anything, and when he did, it was just little amounts. Most nights were sleepless for him. Freddy, who had once been the most quintessential dignified young man, now shunned his old habits and turned for the worse. He took to roaming the streets of London late at night-even when it was chilly or if it rained-trying to find something that would make him happy once again. However, it wasn't long until he contracted viral pneumonia and soon had a high fever and a bad cough. Even then, he tried not to show how bad his cold had worsened, until one morning, he was so weak he couldn't even get out of bed. All the while, he pined for Eliza, degrading his health even more. He didn't say much when either the doctor or maids came by, but when he did talk, it was about Eliza. Of course, the maids thought that he was just saying paltry words, when actually, he was asking for her. He needed her there. Even though Freddy's condition worsened by the day, he at least would have someone to live for. Closing his eyes, he murmured, \"Eliza...I need her...please...\" He coughed several times and looked pitifully at the maid who was standing in the doorway. Dr. Grant soon stepped in. \"Frederick, you shouldn't talk. It might worsen your condition,\" he explained. But Freddy continued on. \"I just want Eliza. Please,\" he said, in between raspy breaths, \"Go find her for me.\" The doctor nodded and walked back over to the maid and asked her quietly to go fetch Freddy's mother. Soon, both the maid and Freddy's mother came back. \"Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, do you know who 'Eliza' is? Frederick keeps on asking for her. If he doesn't recover, but we still find her and he sees her again, his heart may at least be healed,\" he explained. Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, who was very much concerned with her only son and his health realized that that Eliza was what he was mumbling for the past weeks. \"Yes, I do believe she lives at 27A Wimpole Street. She is a nice girl, but discontinued her friendship and relationship with Freddy. If it would please him, may you please go find her?\" she pleaded. Already starting to walk out the door, Dr. Grant smiled at her. \"I'll try my very best. Keep a close eye on Frederick for me,\" he said, tipping his hat. He was off to find Eliza if it was the last thing he'd do. He knew it would be best for Frederick if he had a friend by his side. He only hoped that Eliza would come with him. He knew it would give the final break to Freddy's heart if she didn't want to see him again.[Chapter 5] During the time all of the drama was occurring at Freddy's house, at Professor Higgins' and Eliza's home, there was a distinct contrasting mood. Instead of having tension in the air, as there always used to be, there was a tranquil mood. Eliza and Henry were getting along fine, except for some clashes on trivial matters. This was no surprise as even the most agreeable people have squabbles over little things. And although it seemed the two of them could hardly stand to be apart from each other, it was really Henry who seemed to follow Eliza around. Not actually follow her around-just his heart did. He finally understood that Eliza was someone worthy of his admiration and was actually his equal. She was no longer just a common flower girl, as he had looked at her a few months prior. No, now he saw that she was a proper lady, one with both outward and inward beauty. And just when Higgins thought that all traces of Freddy were gone and that he finally exterminated the mere thought of Freddy from Eliza's mind, there was a knock on his door which brought the memory of Freddy flooding back. Mrs. Pearce walked into the room where Professor Higgins was writing the sequel to his first book, Higgins' Universal Alphabet . \"Mr. Higgins, a man named Dr. Grant is waiting in the hall. He wants to talk to you,\" she told him. Henry, irritated that someone had to come right then, unwillingly tore himself away from his writing. \"This better be important,\" he grumbled to himself. Dr. Grant was pacing back and forth, counting every second. Time was vital and he couldn't waste one precious second of it. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the man he wanted to talk to appeared. \"Professor Higgins, I presume?\" he said, trying to hide the nervousness in his voice. In his profession, he knew he had to keep calm; however, he was young and still had to master that trick. Higgins just stared at the doctor. \"Yes. What did you come for? Make it quick, I'm a very busy man,\" he snapped. \"Yes, I understand. I just came for someone named Miss Eliza Doolittle. Is she your niece?\" the doctor asked. Henry sighed impatiently. \"No, she is not my niece. We aren't that far apart in age, you know,\" he said, although truthfully he was around twenty years her senior. He added, \"However, Eliza is at home. What do you need her for?\" Dr. Grant bashfully smiled. \"Oh, sorry for my assumption. I need to bring her with me. You see, her friend Frederick Eynsford-Hill is ill with pneumonia, and he is my patient. She is the only person that is on his mind; the only person he has to live for. If he cannot live for her, he won't live for anyone or anything. She can keep him fighting,\" he explained. Higgins testily eyed the other man. It seemed a million questions were going through his mind during those few seconds. Should he go get Eliza? Would it actually help Freddy get better? Was Freddy actually sick? If he didn't go get Eliza and Freddy died (assuming he was sick, like the doctor said), would she get over Freddy and move onto someone else-namely, himself? Would Eliza even want to go? Could she stand the sight of an ill patient? Would she be brave enough to stick with Freddy until the end? Just thinking of Freddy made Henry even more irritated than he already was. And this mood affected his answer. \"I will not go get Eliza. She has better things to do than to play nurse with you,\" Henry said, turning around and leaving the room. Eliza heard Henry raise his voice louder than it normally got. She walked out of her bedroom and down the stairs, curiosity getting the better of her as she saw another man in the room. Coming closer, she gave the young man a smile. \"Hello,\" she said, \"May I help you?\" \"Ah, you must be Eliza! Please, come into this cab that I have waiting. It's a matter of life or death and it's all up to you!\" Dr. Grant exclaimed, rushing toward the door, looking anxiously at Eliza. He pleaded silently, Please let her come. Let her save Freddy. Much to Dr. Grant's relief, Eliza didn't ask why she should come. She just followed him into the cab, not even telling anyone else where she was going. It wasn't until they were well on their way to Freddy's house that she decided to ask the question that was on her mind: \"Whose life is in peril?\" \"Freddy's.\" That was the only quiet response she got. Not another word was mentioned during the ride there. Eliza took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She didn't know if this was such a good idea after all.[Chapter 6] Once Eliza and Dr. Grant arrived at Freddy's house, the doctor hurriedly stepped out of the cab. However, Eliza stayed in the cab. \"Aren't you coming?\" Dr. Grant asked. Eliza nodded and slowly got out of the cab. \"I'm coming,\" she said quietly. She followed after Freddy's doctor but stopped for a moment at the door. For a second, she thought she couldn't go through with this. She took a deep breath and walked in, half wishing she could turn and run away in the other direction and never look back. But this was for Freddy. Freddy, her dear friend. Well, once upon a time, a dear friend. And why would he want her to come? For all she knew, he could even have a wife by now, even if it only was two months since she last saw him! Or this could be a set up, just to get her to come to his house. Soon enough, she realized it wasn't a set up. She heard him coughing and as she got to his bedroom, she saw maids going in and out. Eliza turned toward the doctor. \"Are you going to go in first?\" she asked. Dr. Grant shook his head. \"I think it's best if he thinks that you came by yourself. That it was your own thought to come, if you know what I mean. Go on in,\" he said urging her on. \"Okay, I'm going,\" Eliza said, giving a quiet knock on the door before pushing it open. As she saw Freddy, weak, tired, and sick in bed, her heart went out to him. It was the same feeling a mother has when she sees her child sick and alone. Eliza walked over to him and stood above him. \"Oh Freddy, I'm so sorry,\" she said. Although Freddy was still sick, his eyes regained a spark of life in them. \"Darling,\" he said, looking up at her, \"How are you?\" \"Fine, thank you for asking,\" Eliza said, \"I would ask you the same question, but I can already see that you aren't well.\" She took some of his blankets and pulled them up farther for him. \"You poor thing,\" she murmured. Freddy lovingly looked at Eliza, giving her a small but weak smile. \"You are just as beautiful as I remember you,\" he whispered, \"Actually, you're prettier, if that's even possible.\" Eliza blushed a little at Freddy's comment. \"I just saw you two months ago,\" she said, brushing his hair to the side. As much as she tried to straighten it, it just kept on flopping back. She then turned and looked around his room, still quite neat and tidy. Seeing a glass of water on the table, Eliza grabbed it and silently offered it to him, which he accepted. Freddy sighed. \"Two months or two million years. What's the difference? It feels like an eternity when I can't see you,\" he said. Still quiet, Eliza held the glass for Freddy as he drank it. She sat down on the edge of his bed and gave a small sigh. \"Did you really miss me?\" she asked him. Nodding, Freddy didn't say another word. He just looked longingly at her. Finally, after a long minute, he asked, \"Why don't you love me?\" Eliza didn't know what to say to that. She did love him, it was just that she had some feelings for Henry as well. However, those feelings weren't as strong as her love for Freddy. She felt torn between two. She wasn't about to publicly explain her love for him, especially with people listening outside the door. So instead of telling him, she decided to show him. She bent down and kissed his forehead. After that, she stood up and left the room. She'd have to tell Henry her true feelings for Freddy. Eliza just couldn't go on with this love triangle. She wanted to be loved by only one person-and that person was Freddy. Freddy smiled his first real smile in the two months he had been away from Eliza. After all that excitement, he closed his eyes and fell asleep for a few hours.[Chapter 7] As soon as Eliza walked out of Freddy's room, the doctor was there to greet her. \"That was incredible!\" Dr. Grant exclaimed. \"How did you do that?\" Eliza, who didn't understand what he was talking about, just ignored the question, hoping he wouldn't ask the question again. But, just like she predicted, he did. \"So how did you get him to calm down like that?\" The doctor asked again. Eliza gave a shrug. \"I really don't know how. It-it just happened...I suppose,\" she said, turning and smiling at him. Dr. Grant looked at Eliza with admiration. \"Miss Doolittle, it's around two o'clock and I don't have any more patients for the day...\" he said, trying to figure out how to tell her what he wanted to tell her. \"So...would you be interested in having a cup of tea with me at my house? That is, only if you have time for it.\" Thinking about her schedule, Eliza thought that she could fit a cup of tea into her schedule. \"All right. That sounds good to me,\" she said politely. \"Oh, and one more thing. Do you mind if I call you Eliza? If I can, you may feel free to call me John,\" he added. Eliza nodded. \"John, feel free to call me Eliza,\" she said. And so the two went off in the cab that was still waiting for them. Little did Eliza know that at home, someone was waiting impatiently for her. But it wasn't until three o'clock that she arrived back in Wimpole Street. \"Eliza!\" Henry called from the other room. \"Where have you been?\" Eliza gasped and ran toward him. \"I'm terribly sorry Henry. I didn't realize that I'd be that long. You see, I went to visit Freddy. He's sick and then after that John, uh, the doctor-\" she started to explain. However, she never got to finish for Henry Higgins went off explaining what he was doing the whole time he was waiting for her. Henry went on and on, explaining what had happened. It was pretty boring until he handed Eliza a fancy envelope with her name written on the front. But it was opened already, which meant that Henry couldn't wait for her to read it and he went reading her mail. Eliza wished her mail wasn't delivered with his mail. But still, she got an important letter and she had to know what it was about. Without saying another word, she took the letter out of the envelope and read it. And read it again. And again. She could hardly believe what was written on it. \"Do you suppose that they sent this to the wrong person?\" she asked Henry. Henry rolled his eyes. \"Oh yes. They must have. They must have meant another Eliza Doolittle at another 27A Wimpole Street somewhere else in London. That makes perfect sense,\" he said sarcastically. It wasn't his custom to use sarcasm, but in this case, he deemed it important. Once again, Eliza had an internal conflict. Should she be ecstatic or worried? She started to wonder if this was a secret...no, she already had one and was waiting for Freddy to get better before she got her second. How many could a young lady receive? She sighed, took the letter and envelop, and slowly walked up the stairs. She set the letter down on the small seating area to the left of her bedroom and closed the door. She needed time to think this over. Meanwhile, the youngest maid that worked for Henry Higgins, Annie, happened to be dusting around the time that Eliza went to her bedroom. Annie was the most curious out of all the maids, and seeing the letter out in the open, just couldn't resist. She carefully took out the letter and silently read it to herself.

Wow… that sounded remarkably depressing. Please, let me explain, my name is Willow Marx and I'm a Technical Analyst for the CIA and today is my twenty ninth birthday. Twenty nine! I'm only one short year away from turning thirty! I'm going to be turning thirty soon and I'm still single! No boyfriend, no husband, no kids… except my cat. I count her as my only child. My cute, furry and chubby child. Oh dear god… I'm a single twenty nine year old crazy cat lady! Ok… breathe... just remember, I've always said 'I love my cat more than people,' and 'who needs a man if I'm happy with the way my life is.' My mother, on the other hand, has a different idea. Ever since my twenty fifth birthday she has continually brought up marriage and children at every open opportunity. I try not to let it get to me too much though. I know she just wants me to be happy. But now that the big 3-0 is just around the corner it seems marriage and grandchildren are the only topics on her mind. It's really starting to become obnoxious. Despite her pushing I always try to tell her that I'm happy with my life. I'm perfectly happy living in Los Angeles in my adorable apartment with only my chubby baby for company. I mean sure, I would like to meet that special someone, settle down and have a family. Just not right now. How many people can say they love what they do AND work for the CIA? My mom doesn't know the second part though… as far as she knows I'm just a simple secretary living the simple cookie cutter life. Talk about boring… Not only do I love my job but I love the friends I've made from my job. Granted, I'm friends with almost everyone in the office, but I mean actual best friends. I guess you could call me a liar because I do have a man in my life. Two actually. These men need no introduction but I'll introduce you anyway. The first is the ever so charming and deliciously attractive FDR Foster. FDR is one of the funniest, craziest and honest people I know. Of course, I didn't think that at first. Let's face it, I may love the guy to death, but you'd have to be blind, deaf and dumb not to see that he's a huge flirt, a bit of an airhead at times and a womanizer. He can sure make a girl laugh though. It makes our relationship an interesting one. Since we both share a similar perverted sense of humor we flirt constantly. Especially in the office. The flirting is 100% harmless and simply just for fun purposes only. Unfortunately, the rest of the office doesn't seem to think so. Rumors of FDR and I 'hooking up' are everywhere. Someone even told me there was a rumor about FDR and I having sex in the men's bathroom stall. My pants down around my ankles and both of us just going to town. Please, I'm a lady. A skirt is so much easier. Then there's Tuck Hansen. Tuck is by far the sweetest, reliable and most adorable man I have ever met. Not to mention he has one of the sexiest accents I have ever heard in my life. A true gentleman. Don't let his sweet persona fool you. The guy knows how to fight. Seriously. I swear if he wasn't a CIA agent a professional fighter would be his next career of choice. Don't tell FDR… but I think I have a closer relationship with Tuck. He's always been there for me just as I've always been there for him. We're best friends. That's it. Absolutely nothing else. …Alright, I lied again… Tuck and I are best friends. We've known each other for four years and have become quite close. But for the past year we've become best friends… with benefits.[Chapter 2] - I Never Told You - . : Piece of Meat : . Beep Beep An annoyed grumble was heard from under the mass of blankets as a loud shrill beeping filled the air. Beep Beep As the annoying sound continued to ring through the air the blankets began to move. \"Shut up…\" came a disgruntled protest. Soon after a thin arm appeared from below and slammed down onto the nightstand, putting an end to that dreadful sound. \"Thank God…\" From under the blankets a person arose. That person was young technical analyst Willow Marx. With heavy eyes Willow reached up and released her chocolate locks from the bun on top of her head. A groan left her lips as her back cracked from her morning stretch. \"Today is the day.\" Willow yawned opening her eyes. The second her emerald orbs opened her gaze locked with her partner. On the edge of the bed sat her baby, Calliope. Calliope was her three year old calico. \"Well good morning, Calli!\" Willow smiled. \"How is my adorable baby this morning?\" Of course she never received a response. Unless a wide eyed stare could count as a response. Stealing a glance towards her nightstand a grunt escaped Willow's lips as her clock read 7:33 A.M. \"I don't wanna go to work today…\" she whined as she fell to her side. As her long locks covered her face she spoke, \"What do you think, Calli? Call off work today and just stay home? I mean it is my birthday…\" Pushing her hair away from her face Willow and Calliope's eyes locked once again. \"Just you and me cuddling all day. How's that sound?\" Calliope's eyes narrowed, almost in annoyance. With an expression that read 'Are you serious?' Calliope looked away from her owner and jumped off the bed. \"Traitor!\" As Willow walked through the doors of the CIA headquarters she kept her head down. Her chocolate locks were loosely curled and trailed down her back to her waist. Beneath her dark pair of aviators Willow decorated her eyes with a black eye shadow and liner to compliment her green eyes. Her light fair skin contrasted against the adorable black laced dress she wore. The dress had no sleeves, covering her bare arms with a small black cardigan, and ended just above her knees. Finally, on her feet she wore a simple pair of black flats with a small bow tied at the top. \"Morning Willow!\" \"Shhh!\" Willow brought a finger to her lips in a silence gesture. Matt, a fellow analyst, stared at Willow perplexed. It was weird enough to see Willow Marx in all black, no color once so ever, but to be quiet? Something was wrong here. \"Uhhh… something you wanna tell me?\" Matt questioned. Matt was a fairly attractive man. Standing about 6' 5\", quite large compared to Willow's petite 5' 5\" frame, he was well built, dark hair, dark eyes and almond colored skin. Thirty five years old with a wife and three kids. 'Lucky woman…' \"I'm just trying to avoid FDR and Tuck as much as possible.\" Willow thanked Matt as he handed her the spare warm cup of coffee he had in his hand as they walked to her office. Removing her aviators from her eyes Willow folded them and put them in her purse. Matt's brow rose, \"Can I ask why?\" They stopped as they reached Willow's office door. Pulling her keys from her purse Willow looked around. 'So far so good…' she thought. She returned her gaze to Matt and put her fingers to her lips again. Putting her keys in the door she quickly unlocked the door and rushed inside. With her body safely behind the door she motioned for Matt to hurry inside. Once he was inside Willow quickly shut the door. \"Okay, Will, you're starting to worry me.\" Coffee still in hand Matt sat down in the chair on the other side of her desk. Taking a sip of his coffee he questioned again, \"What's going on?\" \"Ok…\" Willow sighed. Putting her purse on top of her desk she sat down. Placing her hands on top of the desk she began to explain, \"Before you say anything, I know this is how ridiculous this is going to sound. But please bare with me.\" \"Alright…\" \"Today is my birthday.\" Willow stated out right. \"Today is my birthday and I know FDR and Tuck are going to make it unbearable for me. So I'm trying to avoid them to the best of my ability in hopes that today ends on a potential good note.\" Matt didn't say anything. Just blinked. \"Well…?\" Silence. \"Matt?\" Matt's booming laugh soon filled her tiny office. Careful not to spill his coffee Matt leaned back into his chair and slapped his knee. \"You've got to be kidding me!\" he exclaimed. Willow's eyes narrowed, \"This isn't funny, Matt.\" \"You're right!\" Matt agreed, \"This is hilarious!\" With a huff Willow turned away from her friend to turn on her computer. \"You can leave now.\" Matt eventually calmed his laughter and wiped his eyes, \"Oh come on, Willow. Your birthday? That's why you were being super spazz? That's not a big deal!\" Willow disagreed. \"You don't understand. It's not just any birthday.\" Matt smirked and rested his elbows on his knees, \"What kind of birthday is it, then?\" Willow lowered her voice to a mere whisper and leaned closer, \"It's my…\" Matt leaned in closer as she whispered. \"My twenty ninth birthday…\" Matt lost it. There in Willow's office Matt lost control and laughed his ass off. \"You're still just a baby! What in the world are you freaking out for?!\" Willow sat in her chair baffled. How can Matt sit there and laugh?! This was serious! \"What do you mean why?!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm officially twenty nine! I'm one year away from becoming the crazy cat lady officially! I'll be old!\" Matt lost control again. \"Willow,\" Matt began once he stopped his laughter. \"Twenty nine isn't bad. You're worrying over nothing. I'm thirty five and I feel just as good as I did when I was twenty five. And besides… you're already the official crazy cat lady. Age has nothing to do with that.\" \"Shut up, Matt!\" Shaking his head Matt stood up. \"Seriously, Willow, you have nothing to worry about.\" With a wide smile upon his face Matt walked towards the door. With his hand on the knob he turned back to Willow. \"Oh by the way… FDR and Tuck aren't here. There were needed for a mission in Hong Kong.\" \"You mean you let me walk crazy creepy like to my office for nothing?!\" Matt held up his hand that was not on the knob, coffee still in hand. \"Hey, I tried to say something. But if I remember somebody 'Shhh'ed' me rather rudely.\" \"I hate you Matt…\" Matt winked, \"I know you do.\" Opening her door he stepped out. \"Now get to work!\" he shouted jokingly before shutting her door. \"Bastard!\" Willow glared at her monitor after Matt's departure. 'Jerk…' Willow thought as she entered her passwords. As the system accepted her passwords and brought up her home screen her eyes began to wonder over her desk. The top of her desk was decorated with three framed pictures. The first was a picture of Willow and her mother, Evangeline. The picture was taken a year ago in New York City in the middle of Times Square. For her vacation Willow decided to take her mother on a surprise trip to New York. Her mother had never been to such a big city before and it was in the middle of July, so the weather was nearly perfect. In the picture Willow wore a large red flannel, left unbuttoned to see a white t-shirt underneath that read 'I Love New York' and a dark blue pair of shorts. Her long hair was braided and hung over her right shoulder and that familiar pair of aviators covered her eyes. Evangeline Marx was quite a beautiful woman and looked fairly young for being in her late fifties. Evangeline's hair was the color of a light sandy brown and cut into a flattering pixie style that framed her thin face. While Willow possessed the same wide eyes as her mother Evangeline's eyes were a caramel brown. Like her daughter, Evangeline wore the same 'I Love New York' t-shirt but wore a simple pair of jeans. Both smiling widely one arm wrapped around each other, both of them looked happy as can be. The middle picture was of Willow and Calliope. This picture Willow was able to take herself. In the picture Calliope was sleeping soundly, with her face buried in Willow's neck, facing towards the camera. It was one of Willow's favorites. Finally the last one was of her, FDR and Tuck. After a long hard week the three of them decided to go out to a couple of bars and have a little fun. In the picture FDR was dressed in a pair of dark jeans, a gray button up and a black t-shirt underneath. Willow was wearing dark jeans, with tears up the legs, a slimming off the shoulder 'Queen' t-shirt and her hair up in a messy bun. Finally, Tuck wore his famous red plaid button up and dark jeans. In the picture Willow was held in both their arms as she laid on her side. FDR stood tall with his hands under her legs while Tuck had his hands placed on her side and hip. The picture was actually quite comical. All three of them were quite buzzed at this point and ready to party. FDR had a open mouthed smile on his face with his eyes as wide as can be. Tuck looked as if he concentrating intently and jokingly appearing to be struggling to hold Willow up. While Willow plastered the most innocent smile as she possibly could on her face with her hands clasped together under her chin. Willow was so deep in thought thinking about that night she never heard her office door open quietly and then shut. Nor did she hear the hushed footsteps as they stopped right behind her. It wasn't until that she felt a pair of warm lips touch her right ear gently and a soft 'Boo,' whispered into her ear did she react. Screaming at the top of her lungs Willow jumped out of her computer chair. \"Tuck Hansen!\" Tuck Hansen stood with his hands up in defense with the largest grin upon his face. Willow screamed again in aggravation and slapped Tuck. \"You are,\" slap \"Without a doubt,\" slap \"The worst,\" slap \"I hate you!\" slap. Tuck laughed whole heartedly and let her slap him but made sure to keep his face protected. \"I'm sorry, darling. I couldn't resist.\" \" I'm sorry, darling,\" Willow mocked Tuck in her best British accent. \"Take your accent and shove it, Hansen.\" Grumbling Willow turned away and sat back down at her computer. Determined to ignore the attractive Brit behind her. \"Ouch,\" Tuck chuckled sitting on her desk to her right. \"What has you so upset today?\" \"Nothing.\" Tuck tsked, \"Now see, I don't believe that. Could it be that today is someone's birthday? Hmm?\" Willow ignored him and continued to type away on her keyboard. \"Wiiiillow,\" Tuck sang trying to get her attention. \"I'm sorry, darling, really. I didn't mean to scare you.\" Willow knew by that tone she was in trouble. Every time he used that sad tone he would stick out his lower lip and pout. It got Willow every time. 'Don't look at him.' Willow thought to herself. \"Please, Willow…\" Tuck continued pulling gently on a lose strand of her hair. \"I purposefully delayed my flight so I could wish you a Happy Birthday.\" 'God Damnit…' \"Alright!\" Willow caved turning towards Tuck. A large grin decorated his face as he pulled a small bouquet of colorful daisies from behind his back. \"Happy Birthday, Willow.\" She smiled and happily accepted the colorful flowers. \"Not that I don't think you look adorable today, darling, but why do you look like you're dressed for a funeral?\" Willow smelled the daisies, \"It's my birthday.\" \"Isn't that a happy occasion?\" Willow chuckled, \"Normally yes. But since I'm going to be thirty next year my mom is going to be on harder than ever this year about getting married and having babies. It's not exactly something I'm looking forward to…\" \"Understandable, darling.\" \"Thank you for the flowers, Tuck. Really. But you should get going. You got a mission to do.\" Tuck smiled and pulled her into a hug. His arms trapping her in his warm chest that she happily snuggled into. \"I just hate that I have to leave you on your birthday. I'm a terrible friend.\" Willow shook her head, \"Doing your job doesn't make you a terrible friend. Scaring the living daylights out of me makes you a terrible friend.\" Pulling her away from his chest, keeping his hands grasped gently on her arms, he asked, \"Please do forgive me darling. How can I possibly ever make it up to you?\" \"Sex. Lots of sex. Maybe some pool thrown in there.\" A mock offended look came upon Tuck's face as he placed his hand over his heart. \"That hurts, love. I'm starting to think all you see as is a piece of meat.\" Willow fake glared at him, \"You're lucky I still even like you after doing that to me. Now get out of here. The sooner you go the sooner the three of us can celebrate my birthday. And I can finally get laid!\" Laughing Tuck gave her a mock salute and walked towards the door. \"Happy Birthday again, Will. Be safe. See you when we get back.\" Willow and Tuck held each other's gaze smiling softly towards each other. \"You too, Tuck. You and FDR get back to me in one piece.\" With a wink Tuck walked out the door and shut it gently behind him. Smiling down at the colorful daisies in her hands Willow pulled them closer to her chest. Yes, her and Tuck were best friends. Best friends who slept together. No strings, no relationship status to be made. It began a year ago, on the night that picture the three of them was taken actually. They didn't plan for it to happen, it just happened. They tried to stop, they really did, but they just kept going. Glancing at the last picture one more time worry filled her eyes as a small smile graced her lips, \"Be careful guys…\"[Chapter 3] - I Never Told You - . : How It All Started : . As Willow fumbled with her keys she spoke, \"I'm sorry for the mess. I hope you don't mind crashing on the couch. I promise it's comfortable.\" Tuck shook his head \"No worries, darling. I appreciate you letting me crash at your place.\" Letting out a triumphant cheer Willow put in her keys and unlocked the door. \"Please, Tuck, it's no trouble. I'd rather you stay here than drive home or waste money on a taxi when you can simply crash here for free. I just can't believe FDR left us at the bar.\" Willow opened the door and led Tuck through. After taking a few steps into the apartment Tuck stopped due to the lack of lighting and chose to wait for Willow. Only moments after the apartment fell into complete darkness after shutting the front door did the apartment illuminate with light. \"Yes… well… we really shouldn't be surprised. Both of us know how he is when it comes to women.\" Willow grunted in annoyance as she slipped off her flats by the door. \"Letting us know he was leaving would have been nice. He's just lucky I live right down the street.\" Pulling the elastic from her hair Willow sighed in satisfaction and scratched her head. \"Would you like a beer?\" Willow asked as she walked pass Tuck to the kitchen. So focused on looking in the kitchen Willow never noticed Tuck's lack of response. Tuck still stood at the entrance of her apartment unsure of where to go. Once she turned on the lights Tuck took the time to study her apartment. It was small, but cozy. The hardwood floors reflected the light from the ceiling; the walls were a complimentary mix between brick and plaster. Before Tuck could continue to study the rest of her apartment his eyes landed upon Willow and nothing else seemed to matter. As she walked passed him Tuck felt his eyes follow her movements. The tight jeans she wore fit her body wonderfully and managed to accentuate her backside quite nicely. It didn't help that the tight shirt she wore clung to her curves in all the right places. Now Tuck knew he was not drunk by any means but he was fairly buzzed. The alcohol in his body left him feeling warm and at ease. Maybe he was a little too at ease if he was blatantly checking out his best friend and co-worker in her own kitchen. Opening the fridge Willow bent over and called out, \"Tuck?\" Tuck gulped at the sight before him. There was this beautiful creature before him. Bent over, showing off of one her best assets on a silver platter. 'Focus, Tuck!' \"Yes!\" he accidentally screeched, which he quickly tried to cover with a cough. If Willow noticed this or not she never led on. She simply pulled a bottle from her fridge, shut the door and held the beer out to Tuck with a smile. With a grateful smile Tuck walked towards her and took the beer from her hands with a soft 'Thank you.' As Willow turned her attention away from Tuck his mind began to wonder. 'What is wrong with me?!' he scolded himself. Tuck wasn't blind; he knew that Willow was indeed an attractive woman. He noticed ever since she started working at the CIA. But tonight he couldn't seem to keep his eyes off of her. Even now as she innocently searched through her cabinets he couldn't help but think of how beautiful she looked. At work Willow always made sure to dress appropriately and professionally. He had seen her in skirts, heels and dress pants. Her hair was always neatly done and she always seemed to wear just the right amount of makeup. But tonight she was dressed for comfort, a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Tuck had never seen her hair so unruly and wild before with only eye liner to decorate her eyes. He liked it. He liked it very much. \"Alright!\" Willow exclaimed. A large smile spread across her face as turned to Tuck. In her hands she held two shot glasses and a bottle of whiskey in the other. \"It's only midnight and I'm losing my buzz. I don't know about you, but I need some more booze in my system!\" Tuck eyed the bottle of whiskey in her left hand. \"Whiskey?\" \" Not just any whiskey, my friend.\" Willow tsked, \"Fireball whiskey.\" No response. \" You mean to tell me you've never had fireball whiskey?!\" \" I can't say that I have, darling.\" Shaking her head in disappointment she sighed, \"Well come on then! I'm going to introduce you to the wonderfully delicious world that is Fireball whiskey!\" As he chuckled Tuck followed Willow into her living room. It was no surprise that her living room held just the same cozy appeal as her kitchen. Her living room was nothing large and spacious but it was just the right size. In front of Tuck sat a medium sized flat screen mounted upon her wall which was painted a light blue. Across from the television was a large white couch with a matching recliner. A glass table sat in the center completing the room. With a smile Willow plopped down onto her couch encouraging Tuck to take a seat next to her. \"Come. Pop a squat!\" Tuck laughed and sat down next to her. As he sat down a surprised grunt left his lips as he felt himself sink into couch. \"This couch is quite comfortable.\" Grabbing a remote off the table Willow smiled, \"See? Would I lie to you?\" \"I don't know. Would you?\" he teased opening his beer. As he took a drink of his beer he watched her begin fumbling with the remote. \"Ahh! Yes!\" Willow cheered as a familiar tune filled the room. \"'We Will Rock You' by Queen. Really, darling?\" Willow's eyes narrowed. \"Yes, really.\" As she faced Tuck she pointed to her shirt for emphasis, \"Is there a problem with that, Mr. Hansen?\" Tuck held his hands up, beer in one hand, in defense. \"Course not. House rules, love. I enjoy Queen just as much as any other.\" Willow laughed and opened her new bottle of whiskey. \"Don't worry, Tuck. My music is set to shuffle. You won't have to endure Queen all night.\" She stuck her tongue out.\"Careful, darling. I heard your face will get stuck that way.\" Tuck laughed loudly as he saw Willow turn away from him and mock him with a sarcastic laugh. As she began to pour both of them a shot Tuck's eyes wondered around her living room taking in her decorations. Framed photographs decorated the walls, he assumed her family members, with a few paintings here and there. But as he continued analyzing her place his eyes landed on an acoustic guitar resting in the corner. It was placed on a stand and stood in front of a built in book shelf. \"I didn't know you knew how to play guitar, Will.\" Willow let out an 'Hmmm' in confirmation as she filled Tuck's shot glass. \"Yes sir. It's something I picked up in High school. I could never seem to put it down after that,\" she laughed. Turning the cap back on the whiskey she placed it on the table. \"Really?\" Tuck graciously accepted the shot glass. \"Any other talents you've neglected to tell me?\" A smirk graced her face and Tuck swore he saw something flash behind those sparkling eyes of hers. \"I have many talents that you are unaware of, Mr. Hansen.\" \"Well then,\" Tuck's voice deepened and sent shivers down Willow's spine. Both of them kept their gazes locked as they clinked their glasses together. \"I guess I have some research of my own to do, Ms. Marx.\" Both of them tipped their heads back and welcomed the deliciously warm burn of the whiskey down their throats. A few hours had passed since their first shot. In these few hours Tuck had managed to have three more shots and was in the process of finishing his fourth beer. Willow had only managed to finish two beers but took at least four more shots of whiskey. The two of them now had a wonderful buzz going and were quite intoxicated. \" Tuck?\" \" Hmm?\" \"Can I ask you a personal question?\" Willow leaned back into the couch, her legs bent under her and rested her elbow on the back of the couch with her head in her hand. In the hours that had passed Tuck removed his flannel revealing his black v-neck underneath, showing off his strong decorated arms. With his fourth beer in his left hand he leaned back resting his right arm on the back of the couch. \"Sure, go on.\" He encouraged. Willow hesitated. This question she had was pretty personal and didn't want to scare him away. \"This a pretty personal question. Are you sure?\" Tuck nodded his head, \"Yes! Go ahead. Ask whatever you like.\" Willow took a breath, \"Ok… how long has it been since you've had sex?\" Tuck immediately choked on the beer he was drinking. His body lurched forward into a coughing fit and Willow immediately began patting his back. \"Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! I knew I shouldn't have asked!\" Tuck began waving her away as his coughs began to calm down. \"Don't worry,\" he coughed, \"You just startled me. I wasn't expecting that.\"His coughing finally ended and he took a deep breath before leaning back into the cushions. \"Well… I guess it's been about six months since I've had sex.\" He answered as he rubbed the back of his neck. \"Why do you ask?\" \" I don't want to say…\" \" Oh come on, love! I told you!\" \" It's embarrassing!\" \" Let me be the judge of that. What is it?\" \"Ihaven'thadsexintfouryears.\" She mumbled. \"What was that?\" Tuck asked her. Not able to understand her response. She repeated her response a little louder but Tuck was still unable to hear her. \"Love, you're going to have to say it a little louder. I still can't understand you.\" \" I haven't had sex in four years!\" Tuck was speechless. He was not expecting that response.\"That's nothing to be ashamed of, darling. So you haven't had sex in a few years. I think it's wonderful to see a woman be patient and hold out on having sex.\" Willow shook her head, \"No Tuck. You don't understand.\" Tuck became confused, \"What don't I understand.\" Willow let out a sigh before answering, \"I've only had sex with one person, Tuck. I want to get out there and see what else is out there but I'm afraid. When I have sex I want it to be with someone I know and trust. Not just some random stranger. But I don't want to be considered a bimbo either. Is that weird?\" \"NO! Not at all.\" Tuck put his beer down on the table and put all his attention on the beautiful girl sitting next to him. \"I completely understand. Willow, you're a beautiful, intelligent and remarkable woman. You could get any man you wanted.\" Willow smiled and placed her hand on his, \"That's sweet, Tuck. I guess I'm just nervous to try after my last relationship. It didn't end well and I'm just afraid of getting hurt again.\" Tuck smiled softly. Using his free hand he gently pushed a strand of hair behind Willow's ear and then rested it gently against her cheek. \"Any man would be lucky to have you.\" At that moment time stood still. The air became thick with tension. With Tuck's hand resting on her cheek and her hand on his drew both of them closer together. At that moment Tuck had never been more attractive to Willow. His usual bright eyes were now dark and clouded leaving her unsure if it was the alcohols influence or something more. Tuck's guard was completely down and he was fully relaxed. With his flannel off her eyes continually travelled from his eyes, delectable lips, down to his neck and strong shoulders. 'A man this good looking should be illegal…' she thought. What she didn't know was as she was admiring Tuck, he was doing the same thing to her. As he gazed into her emerald eyes he was able to see flickers of gold around her irises that he had never noticed before. Her long chocolate tresses, wild and untamed, fell freely down her shoulders and back. Leaving him to want nothing more than to run his fingers through it. Finally, her once pink lips were now stained red, more than likely from the alcohols influence. But to Tuck it only made her more desirable. \" Willow I-\" Before he could say anymore Willow put her lips on his. Love that liquid courage. As she placed her lips upon his, Willow felt Tuck freeze. For a few moments he never moved and Willow felt her courage slipping away. With still no change from Tuck she pulled away and placed her hands over her mouth.\"I'm so sorry!\" she apologized. \"I shouldn't have done that. Please for-\" Before she knew what was happening Tuck had removed her hands from her face and pulled her to his lips once again. Willow felt herself relax and fall into Tuck's embrace. His lips were just as she imagined. Soft…warm… inviting… it left her wanting more. A soft moan escaping her lips as Tuck grabbed the back of her thighs to pull her onto his lap. The once innocent kiss quickly turned into intense passion. Willow wrapped her arms around Tuck's neck with one hand to massage through his short hair. Tuck's right hand gripped Willow's left hip tightly while his left wrapped around the back of her neck, pulling her closer. It wasn't until Willow felt her back hit the couch cushions did she snap out of her stupor. Pulling her lips away from Tuck's she gasped, \"Wait Tuck-\" a moan escaped her lips. Tuck had moved from her lips to nip upon her neck. Shuddering with pleasure she managed to push Tuck away. With her eyes hazy in pleasure she let her hands rest upon his chest. 'His solid… muscular… No! Stop it, Willow!' Tuck's breathing was heavy as he pushed himself up, holding himself up with his hands casing Willow in. \"What's wrong, love?\" he questioned. His voice low and husky. \"Are you sure we should be doing this? I mean don't get me wrong… I really, really want this. But I just don't want to risk our friendship. Not to mention we work together and if Collins were to find out we would be-\" \" Willow…\" \" Yes?\" \" Shut up.\" Willow moaned as Tuck's lips met hers once again. She liked this side of Tuck. She'd never seen him so rough… so dominating. God, he was attractive. Tuck pulled her legs around his waist, signaling for her to lock them there. As she wrapped her legs around his waist she held tightly onto his shoulders. Never once removing her lips from his. With a grunt Tuck rested his hands on her bottom and stood tall. Pulling his lips away he quickly asked, \"Bedroom?\" \" Down the hall…\" A loud continuous ringing pulled Willow from her memory. Jumping in alarm she looked around for the source to see her cell phone lit up and vibrating on top of her desk. Smiling as she read the name she answered, \"Hello?\" \"Hey Willow! Happy Birthday!\" a familiar cheerful voice exclaimed from the other end. \"Aww, thank you, Lauren! You're a sweetheart.\" \"Are we still on for tonight?\" Lauren asked. From Lauren's tone Willow could tell she was excited. \"Of course! Dinner and drinks with my two favorite girls. How could I pass it up?\" \"Alright great! Listen, Trish and I will pick you up at eight!\" \"Awesome! See you tonight, darling!\" \"Bye!\" Willow hung up the call and placed her phone down. A grunt left her lips as she read the time on her computer. It read 1:34 PM. 'Damnit…' she thought to herself. Sighing to herself she began typing away at her computer, 'Please let this day go by a little faster…' Wow... this chapter took me a while to write. I hope you like it! Thank you to all those who have reviewed, favored and added to your lists! It's awesome! But please don't be afraid to let me know what you think![Chapter 4] - I Never Told You - . : Busted : . \"Whoo! Bring on the booze!\" \"Seriously, Willow? You're twenty nine. Not twenty one.\" \"Oh leave the birthday girl alone, Lauren. Girl's thirsty!\" \"That's right! Let me quench my thirst!\" Lauren huffed as she rolled her eyes playfully, \"Why do I hang out with you two?\" There was a pause as Willow and Trish both took a long drink from their beverages. To go along with the beautiful warm weather all three of the girls decided to treat themselves with frozen drinks. Lauren had chosen a tall banana slider, Trish decided on a margarita and Willow happily sipped away on a tropical paradise punch. \"Because you love us!\" Willow exclaimed happily. Still drinking from her margarita Trish let out an 'Hmm' of agreement. \"That and we bring excitement to your boring, dateless life.\" Lauren grunted, \"Seriously, Trish? Again with this?\" Sipping on her drink Willow's eyes traveled back and forth between her two friends. \"Yes, again with this. You need to get out more. You need to have sex!\" \"Trish!\" \"What?\" Feeling bad for Lauren being put in the hot seat Willow jumped in, \"Come on, Trish, she's trying! Let her take her time. She's happy.\" At the look she received Willow gulped. Trish was glaring at her from across the table. From behind her margarita glass she could make out a large frown on her friend's face. She stumbled as she began again, \"I-I mean being single isn't a bad thing. I'm single too and I'm perfectly happy.\" \"Are you ladies ready to order?\" 'Thank god!' The waiter was an attractive young man and if Willow had to guess roughly around the age of twenty three or twenty four. Blonde hair, brown eyes, a tall drink of water. Dressed in a simple pair of black pants with a red t-shirt tucked. On his chest was a name tag with the name 'Adam' engraved in it. \"Yes! Yes we are!\" Lauren smiled. \"Can I get your coconut shrimp please?\" Adam nodded happily, \"Of course! And for you, ma'am?\" Trish gave him a look, \"I understand you're working but here's a tip for you, don't call me ma'am. I'm not that old yet.\" \"Sorry.\" He chuckled. \"I'll take your BBQ pork sandwich. But instead of fries as a side could I get a small salad?\" Adam nodded. \"Great! That will be it, thanks.\" Adam smiled as he took her menu, \"And for you?\" Willow snapped out of her stupor to realize she had Lauren, Trish and Adam all staring at her. \"Oh! Sorry.\" She laughed nervously. \"Well go on, Will,\" Lauren teased, \"What does the birthday girl want?\" \"It's your birthday?\" Willow began to feel shy under Adam's newfound gaze. \"Yes sir. I'm officially an old lady.\" A twinkle flashed in Adam's eyes as a smirk appeared on his lips, \"Well I don't know about that.\" A thick silence filled the table. While Willow's gaze was locked on Adam's she could see her friends from the corners of her eyes. Trish lifted her eyebrows suggestively towards Lauren who leaned back in her chair with a naughty smile. Feeling the silence turn awkward Willow coughed and began playing with the menu in her hands. \"Umm… Can I get your grouper wrap, please?\" Doing her best to stare at anything but Adam she handed him her menu. \"You got it.\" ' Helloooo booze! ' \"Oh. My. God.\" \"Someone wants a slice of Willow.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Willow asked pulling away from her drink. Trish slapped her hand on the table, \"That man, sex on legs mind you, was totally hitting on you.\" Willow dismissed her, \"He was not.\" Lauren scoffed, \"Willow. He was staring at you. And I mean staring.\" The birthday girl began playing with her straw, \"People stare, Lauren.\" \"What is wrong with you? His stare completely said, 'I want that girl blowing me off with my mother in the next room.'\" \"Trish!\" \"What? There's something wrong with you two! You're both undeniably sexy, successful and completely fuckable.\" \"Trish!\" Lauren hissed in a whisper. Her gaze traveled all around the restaurant. \"We're in public!\" Trish, the woman with no shame, continued to drink from her glass. \"Tell you what,\" she put her glass down, \"I'll stop when you two clean out your cobwebs.\" \"Oh dear god.\" Lauren covered her face in embarrassment. Willow shifted in her seat as she felt other customers around them beginning to stare. \"We're not discussing this right now, Trish.\" Willow nodded, \"Exactly. Besides there are no cobwebs here.\" It only took a second of silence for Willow to realize what she just said. ' Oh no... ' \"What-\" \"Did you just say?\" \"Nothing! I said nothing!\" Avoiding looking at either Trish or Lauren, Willow took a large sip of her drink. \"You have been getting laid!\" Trish exclaimed. The restaurant went quiet for a minute. \"You have been fucking someone and you haven't told us!\" Despite her embarrassment Willow tried her best to laugh it off. \"Pshh… No… I mean, I- no!\" ' Smooth Willow… ' \"You have to tell us!\" \"No,\" Lauren stepped in. Elbows on the table she leaned towards Willow, \"You don't have to tell us anything.\" With a snap she pointed at Trish before her friend could speak, \"It's Willow's business and if she doesn't want to tell us she doesn't have to.\" Trish grumbled in response and finished off her margarita with a final gulp. \"Fine.\" At that moment Adam returned with their meals. A friendly smile turned into seductive smirk as he placed Willow's plate in front of her. A faint blush decorated her cheeks as the young waiter winked at her. \"Would you ladies like some refills?\" \"Yes, please!\" The girls fell into a comfortable silence as they began eating. Since her little stumble Willow didn't know what to say. She felt embarrassed because her business was now out in the open. Trish will stop at nothing to get the details and she knew it was coming. But she also felt bad because Lauren and Trish were her best friends. Willow didn't mean to keep it from them… she was just worried of being judged. She didn't want her friends to lose respect for her or think of her negatively. \"But I am curious…\" Willow was in the middle of chewing on her delicious wrap when Lauren began to speak. Their gazes locked, \"How exactly did it start?\" Willow paused, unsure of what to say. \"Honestly? I couldn't really say. It just sort of happened.\" \"So are you dating the guy or what?\" \"No, we're not dating. We're just sorta…\" \"No way! You're friends with benefits?\" \"I guess… I mean if you want to put a title on it…\" Willow began to fidget. Lauren silence was nothing that concerned her too much. But Trish's silence was a whole other story. A speechless Trish was something that never happened. Never. Just when Willow thought she was going to explode Trish's voice rang out. \"I am so proud!\" \"What?\" Trish leaped from her chair and pulled Willow into a massive hug. \"I have never been so proud!\" Was it her imagination or did Trish sound like she was ready to cry. \"Thank you. Thank you! There is still hope for you girls!\" Willow grunted as she felt Trish hold her tighter. \"Umm… Trish… I can't breathe.\" Trish released her friend and sat back in her chair. \"Are we ever going to get the juicy details?\" Willow shook her head, \"No time soon I'm afraid.\" Trish's eyes narrowed in determination. Elbows on the table, hands clasped together Trish spoke, \"I will find out, Will. You can't keep it hidden forever.\" ' Maybe not… But I can push it off for as long as I can… ' Hey guys! Sorry for the long wait but the last month of a semester can really take up your time. Good news though... It is officially summer break! I'll be able to update more often! Thank you all to those who reviewed, private messaged me or added my story to your list. It's absolutely wonderful! But please don't be afraid to review. Let me know what you think! I know this chapter is short and I apologize, but the next one will be better. :)[Chapter 5] - I Never Told You - . : Welcome Home : . A sigh of content escaped Willow's as she finally escaped the confines of her work clothes. After a long day it felt great to finally be able to relax. Now dressed in a pair of black capri yoga pants and a gray tank top Willow walked from her bedroom to the kitchen. Willow smiled as she saw Calliope laying on the islands counter top, \"What's up, babes?\" The slightly overweight cat laid her head down in response. \"Who's my little chunker?\" Even though cats couldn't speak English it seemed Calliope had quite a grasp of the language. Upon hearing the word 'chunker' she slapped her owners hand away. \"Alright alright,\" Willow surrendered, \"Miss sensitive.\" Almost a full week had passed since the boys left for their mission in Hong Kong and they still had not returned. Normally Willow would've heard from them by now. FDR and Tuck both knew how worried she tended to get when they went out on their missions and tried their best to keep in contact. However, worrying wasn't the only emotion Willow expressed when they left. She absolutely dreaded it. Why? Because every time FDR and Tuck left for a certain period of time Willow fell prey to one of the most arrogant womanizers in the CIA office. Jackson Rowland. The guy was a total jackass. Physically he was attractive, sure, but the second he opened his mouth any potential attraction flew right out the window. Jackson stood to a height of 5 feet and 11 inches, with dark eyes and hair that contrasted beautifully against his light skin. Those dark eyes and smooth lips managed to seduce many female agents in the office. Lucky for Willow, she was his next conquest. Willow was in the middle of pouring herself a cup of coffee when Jackson cornered her in the break room. With her attention on the coffee pot she never noticed a form slink in beside her. A startled gasp escaped her lips when \"Good morning, Willow\" reached her ears. Immediately she became tense. \" Jackson.\" Placing the coffee pot back Willow picked up her cup and turned towards her unwanted guest. Jackson leaned against the counter with arms crossed, appearing as cool and laid back as possible. He wore a simple black button up, sleeves rolled to his elbows, and nice dress pants. His short hair in his signature spiked style and smirk forever tattooed upon his face. How she hated that smirk. \" I must say you look absolutely breath taking this morning.\" ' Smug bastard.' Rolling her eyes Willow turned her back to him, \"Yet here you are. Still breathing.\" She had only been able to make a few steps before he was in front of her again. \"Ouch.\" He laughed, \"Playing hard to get this early?\" Willow smirked, eyes narrowed, \"Oh, there's no playing.\" Jackson's smirk grew at her dismissal. \"Come on, Willow. One date. What's the harm?\" \" You mean besides my sanity or the possibility of losing control of my gag reflex?\" \" Don't worry, Willow. I can be quite gentle.\" ' Oh my god. Shoot me.' \" Listen, Jackson,\" Willow began her patience officially at its end and stood tall to meet his gaze. \"I'm only going to say this once so listen carefully. There is no way in hell I will ever go out with you. In fact, I would rather date an ape before even considering going out with you. You're a pathetic excuse of a man and quite frankly, you disgust me.\" \" Has anyone ever told you how sexy you are when you're angry?\" A grunt of frustration escaped her lips and made sure to knock her shoulder into Jackson's as she made her way passed him. The man was a disgusting pig. Willow shuddered at the memory. Meeting Calli's gaze she smiled, \"Why are men such douches?\" Opening the door to the refrigerator Willow began her search for dinner. The fridge itself was fairly stocked with a gallon of milk, carton of eggs, cheese and meats for sandwiches but nothing sounded appetizing. \"Cal-eeeeee,\" Willow sang, \"I don't wanna coooook.\" Shutting the door, a coupon from the local pizza joint caught her eye. Seeing an image of a freshly cooked pizza caused her stomach to grumble. Willow pulled the coupon from under the magnet, \"Looks like we have a winner.\" Her cell phone vibrated against the glass table in her living room followed by an obnoxious ringing. Skipping to the living room and jumping over the back of the couch Willow grasped the small object and read the screen. With a large smile she answered, \"Talk dirty to me.\" \"God, I love a woman in charge.\" \"If you come over later, I'll show you how else I can take charge.\" \"Mmm, promise?\" \"Have I ever left you unsatisfied?\" The other end was silent for a few moments before uncontrollable laughter. Unable to keep a straight face Willow soon followed in rambunctious laughter. \"What's up, Lauren?\" Lauren's laughter died down, \"Just calling to check if we were still on for tomorrow. Did I catch you at a bad time?\" Willow shook her head, why she didn't know because Lauren couldn't see her. \"No ma'am. I was just getting ready to order some pizza.\" Lauren let out a moan of pleasure, \"That sounds so delicious right now. That and a few cocktails after the day I've had.\" Willow walked back to the kitchen and opened the cabinet for a glass, \"Uh oh. Bad day?\" A sigh of exhaustion came back in response. \"Don't worry, Lore, whatever's going on I'm sure it will work out.\" \"I know, Willow, I know. I'm just really swamped at work right now. It seems like things are suddenly being thrown at me from both sides. Just a lot to handle right now.\" \"You'll get it done and I'm sure you'll have lots of fun too. I mean you get to light things on fire and break things for a living! Know what I do? Work on a computer. Nowhere near as exciting.\" Lauren laughed, \"That's true. I'll have to bring you in sometime.\" Willow choked on the water she was currently drinking. \"Willow? You alright?\" With a cough she answered, \"Yes!\" She cleared her throat, \"Yes. Sorry. I got excited there for a minute.\" A sudden knock on the door halted Willow in her tracks. With a furrowed brow Willow walked towards the door. \"Someone at the door?\" Lauren asked from the other end. \"Yea. But I'm not expecting anyone…\" \"Only one way to find out who.\" Willow tucked her cell phone into her shoulder and unlocked the door. As she opened the door her eyes widened and mouth slowly dropped. There on the other side of the door in all his glory stood Tuck Hansen. Using one hand to hold himself against the doorway while the other held his duffle bag. Taking in his casual dress and tired eyes Willow assumed that he came here straight from the airport. \"Hello, love.\" Willow was speechless. She was unsure of how to react or what to say. Only when she heard Lauren calling out for her did she snap out of it. Pulling the phone away from her shoulder and back to her ear she said, \"Hey, sorry. It's the pizza guy. I'll see you tomorrow, alright?\" \"Pizza guy? But Willow you did-\" Willow quickly ended the call. Unaware of the slip she just made. \"Tuck…\" she whispered. Tuck straightened up and let a large smile grace his face. \"It's nice to see you too. Are you going to invite me in or are you going to send me on my way. I do have pizzas to deliver you know.\" Cracking a smile at his joke she stepped aside. \"Sorry,\" she laughed, \"If it helps I leave big tips.\" \"I'm looking forward to it.\" As Tuck stepped inside and walked to the kitchen Willow shut the door. Once the door was safely locked she turned around and leaned back against the door. \"Well it's nice to see that you're alive.\" Tuck had carefully placed his duffle bag down on the floor and was currently greeting Calliope, who had not moved from her spot on the island. At Tuck's gentle touch Calliope rolled over onto her back and began to purr loudly at the affection. \"Hey,\" Willow protested. \"Hey, hey! Just because Calliope is happy with you at the moment does not mean I am. What the hell, man!\" Sensing her owner's distress Calliope rolled back over. Her large eyes darted between the two before jumping off the island. Tuck kept his head down and starred at the counter in front of him. He knew that Willow would be upset and had readied himself for this confrontation. However, dealing with an upset Willow was never an easy task. \"Look, love…\" \"Don't you 'love' me! I haven't heard from you or FDR for almost a week!\" Tuck sighed and finally met her gaze. Her facial expression screamed annoyance and frustration but her eyes held nothing but worry and concern. Purposefully keeping their gazes locked he walked towards her. Willow lost her ability to breath as Tuck stood tall in front of her. His eyes darkening with intensity as he placed his hands upon her hips. Her body let out an involuntary shiver has his fingers touched her bare skin underneath her tank top. Before she knew what was happening Tuck had tightened his hold on her hips and lifted her upon the island counter top and pushed himself between her legs. With Willow distracted by his sudden move Tuck took his chance, \"Please before you say anything else let me explain.\" Willow closed her mouth and gave a nod of acknowledgment. Willow sucked in a deep breath as she felt Tuck's hands slowly wander from her hips to the outside of her thighs. \"Now I understand that FDR and I made you worry. For that I apologize. There were many times both of us wanted to let you know we we're safe. However, this mission was played pretty close to the chest and didn't give us a lot of time to dawdle.\" Gazing into Tuck's eyes Willow knew he was telling the truth. Deep down she also knew she didn't necessarily have a right to be mad at him or FDR. This was their job. They put their lives on the line every day in order to save others. But Willow was also just their friend. She wasn't their sister, girlfriend or wife. \"I'm sorry…\" Willow began turning away from Tuck and his intense gaze. \"I know you two can't help it. I just worry about you two is all. I like to know that you're safe.\" Tuck didn't like it when Willow turned her head away. She had no reason to feel ashamed or apologetic. He understood her concern. \"Willow…\" his hand cradled her cheek as he pulled her back to face him. \"There's nothing to apologize for.\" Despite her light clothing Willow felt like she was on fire. The air was filled with thick tension. Tuck stood still between her legs as his fingers traced imaginary lines against her thighs. The silence and close interaction allowed Willow to really see him. The intensity that once darkened his beautiful eyes had left. Leaving them soft and gentle. His hair was lightly tousled, most likely from the long flight. He also possessed a little stubble, which Willow found insanely attractive. All she wanted to do at that moment was caress his face and feel that stubble beneath her finger tips. Tuck had taken that time to admire Willow as well. From his position he was able to be close to her. Feel her involuntary shudders as he traced lines into her clothed skin. Her emerald eyes were clouded over with an emotion Tuck had become quite familiar with in the past year. Lust. Tuck suppressed a chuckle that threatened to escape his lips. It was remarkable that his slightest touch affected her so strongly. Willow didn't know how long their heated gaze lasted but she forced herself to end it. She coughed, \"So… how exactly did your mission go?\" Tuck's silence made her nervous. She watched as he tried his best not to meet her gaze and opened his mouth before closing it again. He was nervous. That's not good. \"Tuck. What happened?\" Oh man, he was screwed. He couldn't tell her. No way. She was mad enough he didn't get in contact with her but for her to know the play by play of how the mission went down? Game over. He had to come up with a distraction and fast. He locked eyes with her once again. Looking for his opt out. Finally his eyes settled on the side of her neck that was currently hiding itself away behind her dark locks. 'Bingo…' \"Tuck?\" A mischievous smirk appeared on his face and Willow felt her heart jump to her throat. That smirk meant he was up to something. Something bad. Tuck's left hand pulled away from her thigh and found its way to her cheek. \"Do you really,\" Tuck's tone became deeper. Rougher. His hand pushed her hair away from her neck. His face inched closer to her now unprotected neck. \"Really want to talk about work?\" Willow's head fell back the second she felt his lips make contact with her neck. Her eyelids fluttered as he assaulted her in the most wonderful way. \"I um…\" What was she saying? Her hands clutched onto his shoulders and a gasp escaped her lips as she felt him bite down. \"I don't remember…\" With a smile Tuck pulled away from her neck. Seeing Willow's eyes clouded and gasping for breath left him feeling proud. But not accomplished… yet. \"I think… I made a promise to a certain birthday girl.\" His hands clutched onto her hips once again and pulled her closer. A breathless moan left her lips as she felt him against her core. \"And I fully intend…\" Tuck's tone was even deeper and rougher than before. Roughly taking hold of Willow's behind he pulled her from the counter. Her legs wrapping themselves around his waist. With her arms wrapped around his neck she pulled him into a heated kiss. But just as Willow began to nibble on his lower lip Tuck pulled away with a growl. \"To keep that promise.\" ","Summary":" - I Never Told You - Note : This story is inspired by the movie This Means War . I hold no rights t"},{"Movie":"My Fair Lady","Title":"Vital","Author":"MyMadness","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8852224","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Vital I knew I could not post here unless I had something original to add. There have already been so many wonderful stories which resolve the ending of the My Fair Lady story. For months I have felt I had nothing I could possibly add, especially after devouring every installment left by vcatrashfiend. I wondered if there was possibly anything new to say. I hope this qualifies. This starts off with a bang, in that I will immediately make you privy to Henry's thoughts and he is, after all, a male with (repressed) desires. This works, this having it in the first page of the story, because we have the movie as preamble, and I think it in-character. This begins with the scene at Mrs Higgins' house at the near-end of the movie and immediately changes the whole game. There is movie dialogue sprinkled throughout the first chapter, however. Mine is, most simply, a story of sudden realizations and slow declarations. \"She's gone,\" Professor Higgins said, sounding distinctly confused and wretched. \"Well, of course, dear. What did you expect?\" His mother sighed. As angry as she was at him, Mrs. Higgins found it impossible not to be moved by the state he was presently in. \"I heard you with Eliza,\" his mother said cautiously. \"You do not really suppose that the Colonel would propose marriage?\" Turning on his heel, Henry was now forced to really consider that quick, idle notion he had hurled at Eliza. \"Would he marry her?\" he asked himself out loud. His rather impressive brain set at that problem and sussed it in short order. Pickering might, Higgins realized with a palpable start. And he pictured the unlikely pair in his mind. I suppose he just might - out of some desire to protect her. He held a hand to his head while he tried to envisioned such a marriage. The union he saw was polite and friendly and antiseptic. But glaringly, desperately wrong. Because a marriage – not that Higgins had any use for one – was about more than protecting someone. At least, it was supposed to be. And Pickering would never feel emboldened enough to... well, pursue something physical with their former pupil. \"God help me,\" Henry mumbled to himself when he realized the unforgivable and indiscreet direction his imagination had taken. Higgins walked towards the far side of the room, as if afraid his thoughts could be overheard. What he saw in that moment - no matter how hard he tried not to let the thoughts come - was that should he marry Eliza, he would most certainly want that... something. He would want that fullness. That promise. The secret shared. His mind supplied it then, succinctly, but traitorously. A vision. Eliza's pulse beneath his lips as he pressed to her. Oh, dear Lord. There was a moment's internal panic then that made him grip his chest, and there were more flashes of things he could not stop. This should not be happening , he told himself by way of resisting. He was a man, yes. One who understood it was likely impossible to be devoid of these urges. But was he not a man apart? A reasonable and intelligent man, who had happily relegated these things to an ill-used corner of his mind and life? He had these thoughts, occasionally. Certainly less often than he did 20 years ago. But they were, as a rule, anonymous. Rather abstract. But just now he was being plagued by visions... and well, desires... that were entirely too specific in their chosen target. Until it felt as if he had possessed her. Truly. Not only as a man might do at this distance, virtually and with something - some sanity - in reserve. \"Henry?\" his mother prompted. The unstoppable thoughts finally stopped. Cold showered as only a mother's voice can. He never should have told Eliza that she could most likely marry Pickering. That was what had started all of this. \"Damn me,\" he muttered, feeling quite angry with himself. And damn this childish substitution of base desire for logical thought. But this lapse didn't matter , he assured himself a second later. Any thoughts of a shared bed did not mean a thing. Because Higgins knew he wouldn't marry her. That much was easily obvious when rationality was applied. It had been a terribly foolish, regrettable stray thought, he told himself with a returning confidence. A brief loss of control. Nothing more. Nothing more, he assured himself again with an adjustment to his waistcoat as he thrust his chin higher. But... suddenly it was the word 'vital' that had beset him. Yes, yes, everyone who knew her considered her a vital, lively woman. But Higgins suddenly felt that she was vital to him. A necessary, life affirming thing. He could feel his breathing coming quicker with his mind's renewed betrayal. And he saw Eliza again, behind his tightly closed lids. It was her smile that worked at him, the one she gave when she was most at ease, most happy. He felt her fingers run firmly across his shoulders (as they never had). The skin of her neck beckoned, warm. Inviting. Henry? His name would escape her lips in a breathy, pleading sort of way. He groaned. For six months he had avoided this path; these idiocies and these distractions, and now in one instance he had catapulted past the path entirely and to a quite detailed destination. Oh. Bloody. Hell. \"Henry!\" His mother's voice was louder now. \"You are acting altogether quite strangely - even for you,\" Mrs Higgins pronounced as she walked closer to her son. She narrowed her eyes at him and seemed to take a moment to consider what she saw. \"I won't ask if you are in love with her or merely wounded over losing you best toy. I don't trust you, frankly, to know your own heart. Or to give me an honest answer. \" He was nervously biting a knuckle now, but he stopped for a moment. \"Don't be ridiculous, Mother.\" \"But,\" she continued, \"what would you do if you were to suspect that she had fallen in love with you ?\" Startled, he looked up from his inspection of the damage he had inflicted to his hand. \"Has she?\" \"I should think her fit for an asylum if she has, given the way that you have treated her recently...\" \"But...?\" Henry said, stepping closer, sensing there was more. \"But these things happen,\" his mother allowed. \"Pupils fall in love with their teachers. Patients with their physicians. But it would be a feeble, temporary attachment. At least, I suspect it would.\" \"Yes, yes...\" He hummed his non-committal sort of agreement. \"And that woman who assailed and impressed you with her speeches and her surety today? She will likely give way to someone else tomorrow.\" \"What are you trying to say?\" he queried, roughly. \"I was going to counsel you to be patient, Henry. And understanding. To refrain from teasing Eliza, should she ever deign to meet with you again. But then I realized the folly of asking such a thing of you.\" She sighed her frustration. \"She's a wonderful girl. And courageous, Henry, that she would spend half an hour in your company, let alone all these months. But I suspect that Eliza's not quite as strong as she pretends to be.\" Henry seemed to weigh the words, but then in a fit of something akin to pouting, he could only demand of his mother, \"But what about me? What am I to do?\" \"Do without, I suppose,\" the sage woman replied. He stammered. Inside, he was stumbling. And in that moment of confusion, he worked himself up to the best approximation of anger at Eliza that he could muster. \"And so I shall! If the Higgins oxygen burns up her little lungs, let her seek some stuffiness that suits her. She's an owl sickened by a few days of my sunshine. Very well. Let her go, I can do without her. I can do without anyone!\" His mother was not persuaded that there was any real rage in this tantrum, any more than in the hundreds of tantrums she had witnessed while rearing him. Still, this one was harder to watch. She held her tongue, and a second later, Henry was gone with a flourish. \"Bravo, Eliza,\" Mrs Higgins pronounced, once she was alone. / tbc[Chapter 2] Higgins punished the pavement with his feet until he felt the indignation taken from him like wind leaving a sail. It all fell away when he found there was one thing he could not refute. He missed her. As ridiculous as it was, he missed Eliza already. Profoundly. Having her near was not just something he had grown to expect. She was... Oh, damn. Damn. Damn. DAMN! Her company was something desired. Needed. Craved and sought. But dear Lord, he wanted to reject that thought. He fought against it just as he fought against the rising vision of her with Freddy. He battled his own folly, until he knew any bystander on the street would have deemed him decidedly unstable. / / / / / / / \"You aren't going over to apologize. Not when you were right!\" Mrs. Higgins insisted of Eliza. \"No. I'm just going to smooth things over.\" Mrs. Higgins' look was almost pitying. \"If,\" she stressed, \"that sort of thing is even possible.\" \"If,\" the younger woman agreed. \"If it's even possible. Yes.\" … … … ... The door to his house was unlocked, and Eliza pushed in quietly. Indistinct sounds met her and she followed them. Something was playing, she could hear. Something on the gramophone. Her. That realization stopped her. Stilled her feet and her breathing once she had entered the library. She hadn't known he was quite that sentimental. Looking at him, hunched in his chair, she found she truly couldn't be angry with him. Oh, damn, she allowed, indulging a little silent profanity over the state of him and the raw state of her own insides. She sighed, struggling with what best to say to the professor. \"I washed my face and hands before I come, I did.\" It was a gentle offering. An attempt to ease the two of them into some sort of forgiveness. And she had no idea if it would work at all. \"Eliza?\" With just one word, he managed to sound both thankful and relieved. \"Where the devil are my slippers?\" A new tone now. But she wasn't fooled by any resemblance to bravado. Still, his posture changed with that statement. He slipped forward and pushed the hat over his eyes. He was uncomfortable with how vulnerable he was, but unwilling to be anything else just now. Eliza saw in that moment how well she knew this man. His moods. The pride. His soul and needs. And she took her first steps towards him. The slippers had been placed beside the chair again, of course. Mrs. Pearce would have done that. Eliza said nothing, just eased forward until she could stand in front of Higgins. She tried not to smile as she looked him over. How boyish (rather than merely childish) he was being just now, hiding behind his hat. With a less-than-dignified grab, Eliza pulled an ottoman to her. She sat down, reaching for his crossed ankles as she did so. She touched him carefully, yes. But not cautiously, she found. He flinched for a moment at her touch and then, with obvious effort, he forced himself to relax. Given the harsh words they had traded, she mused, he may have expected some sort of violence from her. His feet rested across her knees now, and she began to tug at the laces of one shoe. She worked unhurriedly. One shoe was placed on the ground. Then the other. He groaned with relief. His toes flexed unconsciously, and she wanted to laugh with a strange sense of joy. But then, any time he showed her the mere man he was, rather than the professor, it always thrilled her. Her hand rested at his shin as she leaned down again to retrieve his slippers. Slowly, she reveled in owning this scene between them. She knew something no one in the world would believe. She could slow him down. She could leave him silent... at least this once. Finally, she made a deliberate show of putting his slippers on his feet. \"Better?\" she asked, meaningfully. \"Much.\" They were quiet then, both knowing the exchange was about a great deal more than the state of his feet. With a bit of adjustment to the hat, he peeked at her finally. She saw things much more clearly now, as well. These past several months, he had worked and waited for her to transform. Now it was she who would wait, she realized. But only if she wanted to do such a thing. \"You only did what I asked, by teaching me,\" she said. \"I can't be angry—not angry with you—over my situation now.\" He pulled his legs up to put his feet on the floor. \"Then you are ahead of most of the world's population, which readily blames everyone else for what they have done,\" he whispered kindly. His elbows came to rest on his knees, and he cautiously leaned a little closer. She nodded. \"You managed a great deal, Eliza. Amazing things.\" He paused, seeming a little less sure of himself then. \"You gave me that triumph.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Oh, enough,\" he pronounced in something of a grumble. He was growing squeamish with the rising sentiment. \"We will figure out something for you to do. If you want our help.\" She smiled. Stood. And he followed suit, looking anxious. \"I should retrieve a few things from my room here, if you don't mind.\" They walked the stairs slowly, and side by side. He smiled unconsciously, thinking of the staircase they had managed together at the Embassy Ball. Her nerves that night had endeared her to him. Made him want to reassure and comfort her. Made him think all manner of ill-advised, unreasonable things. It was dangerous to be a man. But thrilling. He had, perhaps, forgotten at least one of those two things in the past decade. He watched from the doorway while she packed a small bag. His hands were shoved into his pockets, his shoulder firmly lodged against the doorjamb in a familiar posture. But his face was different. She could not remember ever seeing this expression. Eliza retrieved two slim volumes from her bedside. \"These belong in your library,\" she said, as she extended them towards him. \"Take the books. I have extra copies of those two, I am sure.\" She doubted that. But she smiled at him and carefully placed the books in her bag. Her valise was almost full. It was time to go. Again. \"Is the Colonel here?\" she asked, hopefully. There was that wry, amused smile that she so enjoyed from him. \"He's off at the Home Office, visiting an old friend and concocting a plan for finding you, no doubt. Rather than sweeping London, I took the more direct, logical route. I asked that man-child Freddy where you might be.\" All he got from her in reply was a thin smile. She was too smart to discuss Freddy. He rebuked himself for not being at least that intelligent in this instance. Still, Henry could not help but remember the meeting. He recalled the profound relief he'd felt that the pair had not immediately eloped. His breath had caught as he had recounted what he considered a tragedy avoided. Higgins looked at the floor quickly before he managed any more. \"I regret my anger, Eliza. But you were behaving quite ridiculously over him.\" She ignored the comment, but held his eyes. \"Be well, Professor.\" She risked a hand to his arm in parting then. \"It isn't goodbye, I hope. I will be seeing you, I should think.\" \"You are off to my mother's, then?\" He damned the emotion evident in his voice. She nodded and looked apologetic. \"I...\" \"We both have our pride; I understand.\" He had cut in early to save her some of hers. \"You don't relish feeling like a beholden house guest. But she will enjoy having you there.\" \"Thank you.\" And with that said, there was nothing left to do but turn for the stairs and head down. He didn't follow her. Instead, he sat on the bed and catalogued with amazement how utterly bewildered the past 24 hours had left him.[Chapter 3] A/N: So, I have three stories in the hopper, and I might be a tad distracted with all that life stuff. Okay. Completely distracted. Sorry. Big thanks to dancesabove for eyeballing all of this. Go Henry! Not that he knows what he is doing, but he is going to hang in there until he figures it out. \"Come to dinner? Well, yes. All right,\" Henry answered his mother on the telephone a few days later. \"Will Eliza be there?\" \"She will. Why?\" \"Just that forewarned is, well...\" \" Forearmed , Henry? Forearmed?! There will be none of that,\" Mrs. Higgins said, quite sternly. He hadn't meant what his mother had assumed. God knows, he was more worried about defending against Eliza than assailing her. … ... … On that evening, it was Colonel Pickering who ventured a quick whisper to Mrs. Higgins to ask about where things stood between Eliza and Freddy. \"Not quite enough substance there to hold her interest,\" their hostess whispered back. \"And Freddy is, I think, appalled to find so much substance in Eliza.\" It was not but another minute or two before Eliza appeared, apologizing for her lateness. Henry's mood had been greatly buoyed by what he had overheard from his mother. Having Eliza in front of him, reminding him of how striking and vibrant she was, helped his mood a great deal as well. He found himself behaving quite magnanimously towards Eliza. Yes, he had had the slightest libation to steel himself for seeing her again – but he immediately felt its effect doubled. Higgins gave Eliza a quick bow, in his manner of mocking such formalities. Then he smiled quite genuinely as he eased forward a half-step more and quietly expressed his pleasure at seeing her. It was more a family dinner than a formal dinner party; Henry's Sunday manners did not even get tested. After dessert he walked to his mother's sitting room and threw himself bodily into a chair. The Colonel and Eliza watched disapprovingly as he twisted sideways to lounge with his long legs over the arm. Mrs. Higgins' fan caught him in the ankle bone in reprimand, and he yelped. \"Mind the furniture, Henry,\" she told him tiredly. He twisted again, making a show of being uncomfortable. Higgins was preoccupied while his formal pupil glided past. Eliza silently walked to the edge of the room to retrieve a small foot stool. When she placed it in front of him, without any hint of bad humor or disapproval, it was his mother who spoke. \"You'll spoil him,\" Mrs. Higgins warned, quite seriously. It took Henry a moment to recover. First from the sight of Eliza stooping to gather up the small thing (because that had been a sight that reaffirmed his physical weaknesses). And then from the wholly accepting manner with which she made a gift to him of the stool. Henry gloated then as he made a show of putting up his feet. \"Oh, yes. Much better. Thank you, Eliza.\" / / / / / / Two weeks later Henry tossed his hat on his mother's hall table and, smiling, bestowed the expected kiss to the old woman's cheek. \"Eliza's not here,\" Eleanor Higgins peevishly informed her son. \"Why do you suppose I am here to see her ?\" he blustered. \"I don't know,\" his mother answered, sarcastically. \"I suppose because otherwise I'd have to believe you were tripling your visits to me recently.\" Henry clasped his hands behind his back and tried to look wounded. \"I have things I wanted to ask the dratted girl.\" \"About your laundry? Papers? Appointments?\" \"I don't know what it matters, why I've come!\" came his strident protest. \"Ha! It would certainly matter to me... if I were the one you wanted to see. She's promised to come help you on Tuesday. Certainly, your household mundanities can wait until then.\" She walked towards the sitting room at the sight of his frown; he silently followed. They kept up their silence until tea arrived to signal the need for détente. They sat opposite each other, the service between them. \"I never had a daughter. Or any child receptive to the things I wanted to share,\" Mrs. Higgins said as she poured. \"So, she is your project now?\" \" You only taught her how to speak,\" his mother replied wickedly. \"Only?!\" Henry thundered. \"You never helped her find something more to say . Some new interest,\" she explained. \"Eliza's taking lessons while she's with me. Art. Music. French. She and the Colonel have their eyes on a nice little shop, as well. Did you know she has a lovely talent for needle work?\" He tried not to roll his eyes. And failed. \"We were rather busy , mother. Rather too busy for...\" \"And I mean to get her out. To plays, and the orchestra.\" Henry slumped in his chair like a pouting child. \"Well, enjoy yourself.\" Side-stepping his mood, she told him, \"I want you to ask that Jonathan Lawrence friend of yours to make a fourth.\" \"Lawrence?\" Higgins quizzed back, straightening up in a shot. \"Yes. That's it. Jonathan. The butterfly man.\" \"The lepidopterist? You can't fix her up with him! Eliza's such a lovely specimen. He'll want to pin her wings. Stick her up on display.\" With his typical inability to sit still, Henry rose from his chair and acted out the whole unlikely prediction. Mrs. Higgins waited less-than-patiently for her son to finish. \"He was widowed 18 months back, I believe. I see his mother occasionally, and she says it is time the poor man got out again. You would come, too.\" Henry began to pace. \"Take Pickering,\" he shot back. \"He won't come,\" she said unhappily. \"He finds my selection too off-putting.\" \"Don't tell me…\" he said, smiling perversely. \"Madame Butterfly.\" \"Yes.\" He shook his head and pretended to glare at his mother. \"Me? You? A lepidopterist and Eliza at Madame Butterfly. Damned odd. And a damned strange foursome,\" Higgins said, wearily. \"Then you stay home.\" / / / / / / / / Henry didn't, of course. He allowed Lawrence to escort Eliza, but he rarely took his eyes from her over the course of the evening. As Higgins watched the way Eliza moved through the world on nights like tonight, he wasn't fooled. They were both keen observers, she and he. And both outsiders. Prone to never fitting in. When she leaned his direction and whispered to him that evening, asking why things were done a certain way, often he could only say that they were. Not that he understood why society had the trappings it did, either. They shrugged together over it. And he enjoyed that. But then she was back to Lawrence with politeness. Henry watched each interaction. Each expected smile she bestowed. She was cordial to the butterfly man. But she was not drawn to him, Henry decided. She was not at all taken in.[Chapter 4] We left our pair at the theatre with Mrs. Higgins and an unlucky lepidopterist. / / / Henry watched each interaction. Each expected smile she bestowed. She was cordial to the butterfly man. But she was not drawn to him, Henry decided. She was not at all taken in. Higgins chased Lawrence off after the performance rather roughly. With his typical (lacking) diplomacy, the professor assured the younger man that he would see the ladies home himself. \"You recognize the sense in that, certainly,\" he said. He did not wait for the answer. … ... ... Outside his mother's now, Henry climbed down from the taxi and then helped the two women out. His mother passed quickly into the house, like a silent, well-dressed wave. Eliza lingered a moment on the pavement, trying not to stare and wondering what he would do. After a mental tug-of-war he did not understand, Higgins told the taxi to wait. Turning then, he considered Eliza. She was so very different from the bulk of women. There was no artifice. No design. Just the same guileless unease. On her it had a lovely... attraction. They said nothing as they finally walked into his mother's foyer. Elenore had gone straight up. It was just the two of them, and a distant footman in the shadows by the door. \"You don't want to be fawned over,\" Higgins whispered over her shoulder, as he removed her cloak quite carefully. \"I would rather be useful. Be talked with. Not at . \" The footman disappeared once he had wordlessly relieved Henry of the garment. And Henry began to wonder what he was possibly doing there. It was common for him to not understand what others were doing. He found it odd and disorienting to not understand his own actions. Eliza lingered downstairs, expectant and aware. Her face a sort of question. If Henry had had an eye for that sort of thing, he would have seen her own disorientation. Higgins stood close, but with his hands shoved into his pockets. His head lowered and his back rounded. He was keenly, almost painfully, aware that he was close enough to touch her. Really touch her. But that he wouldn't. He was no longer able to do such a thing. There was that change. One that they both felt. When they had been at their speech experiment for all those months, he was constantly arranging her as he would a piece of equipment. His hands had often roughly squared her shoulders, lifted her chin. She thought about that. That brusqueness was how it had begun. But his touches had had more gentleness and deference as the months had gone on... Even if his tongue had softened only half as much. Although she had started as one more piece of equipment in his lab, she knew she was not that now. But that did not tell her just what she was to him. And for the life of her, she did not know what she wanted him to be to her . But close was... good, she found. They could neither of them meet the other's eyes. It was Henry who finally broke the silence. \"What is this?\" He had spoken his innermost confusion unwittingly. \"It is difficult in one minute, and all ease the next,\" he complained. \"You mean, between us. You mean that we seem different... recently?\" He could only nod. \"Perhaps it isn't that we have changed. Not fundamentally. Just the situation,\" she tried. Henry mulled this. \"We have always been like this... in each other's company?\" \"Not always, perhaps. But... when I try to remember ...\" she said uneasily. \"Those months,\" he asked, seeming genuinely lost. \"Does it all seem unlikely? Something imagined?\" \"Yes.\" So we both feel it, he thought with a nod and a bit of rising confidence as he leaned away. \"I suppose that is a reason for us to stay...\" Not together . Don't say together, he told himself . \"In contact.\" Oh, God, that's even worse, he thought, a hand to his head. \"We are... co-conspirators?\" Eliza supplied, seeming impish and happier now. \"Like madmen sharing a delusion?\" This new paradigm appealed to him. A temporary madness could explain it all. \"Yes. Quite!\" He gifted her a beautiful smile. And that made her worry about what she had possibly said. Once he had made a mockery of kissing her hand, he was gone – and all without a proper 'goodbye.' tbc. Short, but hopefully sweet. The chapter just naturally broke here. I do not know if it is Henry's influence, but I find this story to be coming to me in ill-mannered and noticeably brusque chapters. Thanks so much for reading. My thanks to dancesabove, as well.[Chapter 5] / / A week later Henry stood at the mantel in his mother's house with his typical impatient bearing. In place of any proper greeting, he groused at his mother when she finally swept in. \"Why is it we are always waiting on you and then Eliza to appear?\" Colonel Pickering made a quick bow towards Eleanor and smiled with a sort of consolation. \"Really, Higgins,\" he said over his shoulder. \"I don't mind waiting on the women of this house one jot.\" He turned his attention back fully to the man's mother then before saying, \"They never disappoint.\" Henry fidgeted, physically torn between wanting to continue his train of thought and wanting to reply to what he considered an odd, pandering comment on Pickering's part. When Higgins saw that his mother actually appreciated that remark from the older man, he rolled his eyes. His company tonight was hopeless, he decided. The evening doomed... unless Eliza was in a mood to be reasonable. Twisting then, Higgins plainly checked the doorway to see if Eliza's arrival was imminent. With a bit of a smile, he picked up where his thoughts had been a moment before. \"She,\" he said stabbing the air toward the other room, \"has thrown off Freddy. Thank God. Nor does she have any use for that Lawrence fellow...\" Mrs. Higgins noted with a sigh that her son seemed to be cataloging Eliza's suitors the way he did books. In this case, used, second additions no one should allow into their library. \"I don't understand what you are on about, Henry. Are you waiting for her to settle on someone? Or noting that she doesn't seem to have a need to?\" his mother complained as she took her seat. Henry looked away as if studying something quite fascinating in the wallpaper. \"It's just all very... disruptive ,\" he said, as if that was at all believable. Disruptive? Wondering at her son's performance, Henry's mother decided that perhaps things had not been disruptive enough. … … … So, it was Mrs. Higgins who threatened the new status quo a mere week later, after another shared dinner. \"We should all go back to Brighton, perhaps. I know at the very least Eliza has earned an outing.\" Colonel Pickering was immediately and enthusiastically for it. Henry let up a dismal, lengthy groan. Eliza simply stopped breathing. A wash of panic worked through the young woman as she finally refilled her lungs. It was only later that Eliza came to understand her body's reaction. That night, tucked warm and safe in bed, she thought on things, and she came to see that it had been that original trip to Brighton with its otherworldliness that had given rise to new feelings toward the professor. Feelings that she could only term 'different.' And, well, 'unhelpful.' / / / A week later the foursome was at the shore, whether happily or not. The older pair good-humoredly stayed to the pier. The Colonel was so kindly attentive to Mrs Higgins that Eliza found herself sighing wistfully from her vantage point. As Eliza gaily walked the beach, she bent to scoop up those things that interested her. The wind pulled at wisps of her hair, and she grinned contentedly to herself. Henry turned his head rather than face the sight of her like that. She was too beautiful. Too disarming. Too dangerous. Her hands full of pebbles and shells and bits of wood, she set upon Henry quite sincerely, quite innocently, and asked him to hold what she'd found. It was inconceivable that Henry Higgins would extended his hands to allow her to pour her treasures into his palms. But he did. He was at a loss over himself. Speechless as he looked up from his full hands to the sight of her whirling away. But then he was shocked to even find himself here in Brighton after his week's worth of pained objections. A half hour later the group was walking along the boardwalk when Henry suddenly growled. He had absent-mindedly put his hands into his pockets only to remember they were brimming with Eliza's finds. He extracted a pebble and made a theatrical production of threatening to drop it to the ground. \"Ooo, you don't dare! Those are mine,\" Eliza told him with a catlike edge to her new manner of speech. Quite forgetting herself, she grabbed for his wrist, and he let her. Smiling over how provoked she was, he let her hold him there for a second. And a second more. The elder couple had stopped and turned to watch the show. Because, oh, the young woman certainly did have a hold on him, and quite obviously in more ways than one. Anyone passing by could see that much. \"Yours?\" Henry teased. \"Then why is this... debris in my pockets?\" he asked with a smirk. \"I will trail these things behind me as I go... like a signal. Here on the pavement. And some sane person will follow on – rescue me from the lunacy of this little outing.\" The two of them froze then until she dropped her hand from him too late for innocence. The shared thought from the couple who stood further up was quite simple. Higgins didn't want to be rescued. Whether the man knew it or not, he was where he wanted to be. Of course, his mother well knew that that did not mean the wretched soul couldn't ruin things, soundly. There was an air of the child in both Henry and Eliza. And Eleanor watched as something her son now said to Eliza provoked the girl's sudden laughter. Henry did not allow himself to join in, but his smile was joyful. Almost proudly wicked. His eyes rested intently on Eliza who moved ahead now to walk with Pickering. Mrs. Higgins took Henry's arm. \"Some seriousness, you two. No one will seat us for dinner if you are misbehaving,\" the elder woman warned. \"You'll make it worse, I'm afraid,\" the Colonel said over his shoulder. \"Yes,\" Eliza agreed quietly. \"He likes a certain amount of scolding.\" She snuck a look back at her former tutor and there was a shamed wag of his eyebrows. … … … What the Colonel noted was that although the man had threatened to rid himself of her treasures, he did not. Hugh did not want anymore tomfoolery on Higgins part to ruin the day. And so once to the station for the trip back, he prodded the man to help him package the contents of his pockets into his handkerchief. And when Pickering's was full and knotted like a little tramp's bundle, the Colonel's prodding became quite physical. \"Yours now, Higgins.\" Henry snapped the cloth from his coat pocket with feigned frustration and arranged it on the train station counter where Hugh was working. \"This sort of indulgence is why women are ridiculously demanding.\" \"Oh. Tosh. Eliza demands nothing from us. But she makes it ever a pleasure to be nice to her.\" Hugh paused in his work then and eyeballed Higgins in a way that made the younger man lean away. \"Really, a pleasure. Don't you think?\" \"Think? With all of this foolishness? I haven't managed a coherent thought all day,\" Henry tried to complain. \"You would tell me if you were angry with me, Higgins,\" Hugh wanted to know a few moments later. \"This idiot day wasn't your fault!\" The older man laughed quickly and then worked a bit distractedly at the bundle in front of him. \"Not that. No,\" he rumbled good-naturedly. \"Are you put out that I've had Eliza hanging about that flower shop where the owner owes me a favor? Where she's been getting the feel for things, so that she can make up her mind about all that.\" When the words finally came out of Henry they sounded less than convincing. \"It's your money. Your time.\" \"If it all interferes with your plans. I mean, your plans to have Eliza help you at the house some days...\" \"As if I would be... befuddled without her help,\" Higgins replied. \"'Befuddled' might be the wrong word. I was thinking 'lost.'\" Colonel Pickering was smart enough to smile at his friend as if the whole thing was nothing more than a joke. \"Lost for want of the exciting company she provides.\" The man has got too much sun , was all the professor could think. \"You all right, Pick?\" Henry wondered with a quizzical look. Once the little packages were properly secured, Hugh held them out to Higgins. \"Do give these to our Miss Doolittle.\" \"Me?!\" \"Oh, let me dust off my hands while you get her thanks.\" And the Colonel nodded toward Eliza with a look that did not allow for refusal. Pickering stood back and continued, quite needlessly, to brush at his hands. He wondered then that his friend could be so blessedly blind to the nudge he was being given. There would be hell to pay, Pickering had no doubt, if the younger man did finally cotton on. And Hugh knew what he would say. He muttered it now to himself as he watched the pair slip the bundles into her reticule. \"It couldn't be helped. I had to do it, old man.\" / / / His hat snugged down, Higgins pretended to sleep on the train ride back. He felt completely turned inside out over his behavior that day. He could not explain what had happened. And did not press himself to do so. Henry knew it best to retreat for now. As he closed his mind to the situation for the moment, he made one allowance. That one promise to himself was that he would not lie to Eliza over this... insanity. He was in no mood to discuss things, certainly. But he knew he couldn't blame her for the confusion he registered. Higgins peeked then with practiced eyes from underneath the brim of his hat. He watched as his mother took up Eliza's hand and the young woman's tired face worked into a smile. The professor was not the only one to notice the scene. Nor the only one affected by how fine the day had been. Hugh leaned forward to quickly place his hand upon those of the ladies. He withdrew again when he realised what he had done. Believing his friend asleep, he whispered to the women. \"Sorry. Just... such a lovely day. Wasn't it?\" There was a pang in his chest Henry could not explain. He closed his eyes quite tightly then and missed Eliza's murmured response. It was too much for Eliza that the dear Colonel Pickering too felt some emotion over the day. It only allowed her to fall completely undone. She replayed the scenes from today. And finally stole a glance at the lean, compelling form of the man who played in every one. She squeezed Eleanor's hand a little harder and turned her head to the woman's shoulder for a moment. It was too frightening to believe yourself in love with Henry Higgins.[Chapter 6] / Oh, Lord, I have lost my brain. I had put up a chapter that was not chapter 6. But then I do not sleep regularly anymore. And checking blood sugars over night means I only look like I am here and aware as I walk about town... or post chapters. In reality, I am down to two brain cells and apparently they were off doing other things this afternoon. I am chucking this up as an imperfect flare. (I'm here! I'm here!) Things got me here. Wrestled me to the ground. And I have discovered I lack the strength and stamina for wrestling. Suffice it to say, diabetes sucks. Tell me you are still there and that this short, tense bit of heavy breathing pleases./ After Brighton there was a series of nights out for the members of the foursome – nights out (nights complicated, Henry would say) with occasional and blatantly-single male guests. These events came at least every week now. But when Mrs. Higgins had not arranged an evening at the theater, there were simple dinners - just the four of them - at one of the two Higgins' households. \"She will begin to resent these efforts,\" the colonel whispered to Elenore when she had proposed yet another outing with a friend of hers and that woman's unmarried son. \"I am wondering if someone else may begin to resent them first,\" she replied. Because all through this Henry watched. Waited. Wondering if Eliza would latch on to a likely prospect. But Eliza had seen her attachment to Freddy for what it was. That had ended slowly, but had been completely over for weeks now. None of the men Mrs. Higgins introduced her to seemed to stick. She was content, it seemed, to be as independent as the others in this group. They each professed independence, yes. But there was a dependency between the four of them and an uneasy dependency especially between Henry and Eliza. There were daytime visits to Wimpole Street when she happily walked about the professor's library, a pencil stuck in her hair as she catalogued something for him. \"You've mislaid it!\" he roared, one unremarkable morning. \"You've merely hidden it better than ever before,\" she replied just as sharply. Henry turned away to shift another pile at his desk. \"Ha! I never,\" he said. \"You always,\" she murmured to herself, with a smile. \"I heard that!\" \"Oh, atta-boy,\" the young woman said with a touch of her old twang. \"Not deaf yet?\" Not romantic words. But he suddenly felt quite breathless, possessed nonetheless. And in that moment all her dig at him had done was make him think that kissing her soundly was the best retort. Making love to her here pressed against his bookcase, better still. Henry had stepped closer to her without meaning to. And then realized the shameful thought that had fueled him. He would not speak his thoughts. Nor would he lie to her. Would not turn what he felt into a false anger the way he might have months ago. Any ruse would have failed anyway, he thought. Because the girl looked scandalized and slightly worried over what had just transpired. He reclaimed some steady breaths and ducked his head to back away. He would not lie to her or himself, his brain echoed. Because, it had taken months to finally see that there was something here, something palpable and frightening, that would not give over. \"We needn't worry about that manuscript, Eliza.\" \"No,\" she said quietly. Suddenly, there was enough else to worry about.[Chapter 7] A/N: I completely messed up last time I posted a chapter. I had been a bit sleepless and stressed out. I had wanted to prove that I could still function. Ha. So, some of you have seen much of this chapter already, because I inadvertently posted a draft version of THIS in July. When I realized my error, I quickly put up the real Chapter 6. So, you may need to go look at (what is now) Chapter 6… What a mess, huh? Thank you if you have made it this far as witness to my madness. Luckily, this has been beta'd by dancesabove. Iz all better now? / Mrs. Higgins had given up on Eliza taking to any of the young men of her acquaintance. Eleanor had, therefore, resigned herself to the reliable foursome of Pickering, Henry, Eliza and herself. They'd been to the symphony on this particular evening, three long, strange weeks after their return from Brighton. One cagey week after the incident in the library. A shrewd Pickering had gone straight back to Wimpole Street when Henry insisted that he would see the ladies home. And so it was Eleanor, feeling like the last sane person for many miles, who looked from the agitated man pacing her foyer to the young woman who seemed ready to melt into the wallpaper. She sighed. The sound seemed to help Henry remember who and where he was. He mumbled a 'good night' to his mother, and kissed her on the cheek at the bottom of the stairs. Silently Henry watched her head up toward her room. He turned then a bit like a man in a trance. As he made to move past Eliza to find the door, he let his hand fall at her elbow. Abruptly, he pulled up short. He hesitated in front of her as if he could not let go. And somehow, he found his lips were brushing against her cheek. As if they were old friends. As if they were distant family. As if... The quick, impulsive kiss Higgins had placed at Eliza's cheek might have been meant to seem quite like the one he had given his mother. But it did not at all, they both realized, as they stood frozen together. He had, whether knowingly or not, plunged them into a brief sort of horror. Because there was nothing chaste about that kiss at all, suddenly. But Eliza did not know if that was by his design or because of her very present desire. She was not shocked by his display. This... this sort of necessary experiment in crossing the line between them had been months in coming. Henry lingered close still. Too close for any propriety. Until he seemed to shake off the intimate mood. \"Damn this tomfoolery,\" he muttered at last, as he pulled away. The words came out weak. Eliza almost pitied him his unease. \"Were you hoping to... to truly kiss me?\" she asked shyly. And Higgins had wanted to. But her insight unsettled him. \"Such presumption,\" he accused faintly and feebly. She nodded, eased a step away. \"If I was wrong, I apologize. My manners will never be what they should, I suppose.\" He narrowed his eyes at her. \"I don't want or need the apology. In truth, I find nothing wrong with your manners.\" \"I'm not sure you are my model in those things,\" she ventured in a firm, quiet voice. \"Be that way if you must,\" he said, tiredly, twisting half away. \"My pride is at your mercy tonight.\" In the past, she would have said no more. But she felt something for this man, and so she would cross that line—even if she merely ended up pushed back to her side of it again. \"I have no patience with... pretense,\" she told him, after an unhealthy silence. \"There is so much said about what should or shouldn't be. I think people forget what simply is . The feelings. The report. There are things that make themselves. Things that can't be helped. Nor stopped.\" She is telling me she feels this tension, too, he realized as he studied her. That the urges are not of our design. Not of either party's making. Unavoidable. Spontaneous and faultless. Would she let me kiss her? Now? After every misstep? Turning back to her then, he leaned very close. Enthralled with the pulse of anticipation, he was somehow unwilling to have their intimate moment come, because then it would be gone again. And so he stalled there, registering, analyzing the change in her breathing and the palpable heat between them. He felt her hand land at his lapel, not to push him away, but to steady them both. As he heeded the urge to draw back and study her, he saw her blush. He did this, he saw. He had known how to make her angry. How to make her laugh. But this? She believed she understood his hesitation and the look in his eyes. Eliza felt his professorial scrutiny turning her into an object. \"Stop,\" she told him as she turned her head away. \"I'm not your experiment.\" \"Not any longer. No,\" he confirmed, lowly. Idiotically. Henry immediately regretted what he'd done in making her so uncomfortable and in losing his chance. Because surely, surely she had been about to let him kiss her. Quickly then, he backed up, a stutter in his step, breaking his contact with her. \"I'm sorry, Eliza. Truly.\" In seeing this new side to her, he had seen an undesirable one in himself—that willingness to mistreat people. She straightened a tad, and went stiff with formality. \"Do you know what it is to be hurt?\" she asked more than accused. \"I do. Of course, I do,\" he sniffed. \"How?\" The truth came easier when speaking to Eliza than to anyone alive, he suddenly sensed. \"Because the same man who hurts you, hurts me. I don't always know how to forgive him, either.\" His admission was so very unlikely—or would have been before this—that it took her a moment to comprehend that he meant himself. Suddenly she didn't know what to do with his admission at all. \"It's late,\" she stammered. \"Perhaps you should see to the taxi.\" It was all the flustered young woman could manage in the moment. She wasn't sure he had heard her, as he stood unblinking before her. Finally he spoke. \"It is ridiculous. I am loathe to be away from you, Eliza. Even for the night. But I haven't another thing I need to say.\" He sighed and gripped at his forehead before turning for the door. \"I believe that says it all,\" he finished. With that, he left the house. It was not the first time his behavior had confused her, she considered. She lingered downstairs, letting up a sigh and relaxing enough to lean against the wall a moment in her fatigue and ennui. She let her eyes fall shut, only to open them a few seconds later when she heard the door open again. It was not the weary footman. \"You've sent off the taxi, then?\" she asked with confusion when Henry walked back in. He only hummed in answer. After striding for the staircase, he sat on a tread, his impossibly long-legged form a study in angles. Eliza was oddly pleased to see him back again. Smiling to herself, she put a hand on the banister and bent her neck to catch his eye. \"You will tire of me,\" she assessed, when she was sure she held his attention. \"Ha. Long after you have tired of me,\" he insisted. \"All these years you have been at phonetics. Do you care about it less?\" He looked confused, but answered her. \"No.\" \"Personally, I find you more fascinating than phonetics,\" she assured him, a tentative smile working at her lips. He pulled at the banister to get back on his feet. So sure of himself did he look in that moment, that she thought he might walk right past her and head for the door. As he loomed now in front of her, he dropped his chin to his chest and his hand found hers. Eliza laughed lowly, quickly, as if they were just sharing an odd little moment. Embarrassed and confused, she made to drop his hand. But he held tight. \"Eliza... you will marry me. Stop our infernal traveling back and forth. All these inconvenient partings,\" he said. \"Just...\" \"Yes.\" He had acted very self-assured, but he hadn't been. He groaned in relief now. Moved to stand a little closer. Close enough to hear her tattered-sounding breaths. \"Henry?\" she ventured, the unfamiliar name barely making it off her tongue. \"Hmmm?\" \"You will kiss me? Please.\" \"You... want my kisses?\" He was a foolish, lovestruck man suddenly, wanting to hear her say it again. But he couldn't bring himself to care how far he'd fallen. It was a lovely fall. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"As out of practice as I am?\" he whispered, then mentally chastised himself. More idiocy, Higgins? \"And how would I notice such a thing?\" She hid a blush. \"I can't explain. I... I want to be near you. It feels as if I need you close.\" She sounded a tad ashamed of such a thing. And he didn't want her to be. Because he understood that need, to touch and be touched. Suddenly. Completely. \"You don't need to explain,\" he said, his voice hushed and warm against the spot between her cheek and ear. She looked up at him. \"Are you in love with me?\" she was brave enough to ask. \"I suppose I am.\" His voice was pitched higher with the realization of it. She smiled, almost laughed. \"I love you, too.\" \"We should be practical about this, however.\" \"Discuss this, you mean?\" she asked. She caught her breath, wondering if she would ever get her requested kiss. Impossibly, then, he asked her, \"Do you care about household allowances? Social expectations?\" \"A girl tends to worry more about… marital expectations.\" He raised an eyebrow at the frankness of her worries. \"I can be a complete trial about some things, Eliza. I know. But not about that.\" \"Meaning?\" she said, feeling small, but trying hard not to seem it. And he realized his statement could be misconstrued. She might think he meant he had no desire for a marriage involving a regularly shared bed at all. Laughable. Well, almost laughable, when he considered that it had been the then-frightening flash of such shared things that had both derailed him and put him on track. \"Meaning...\" he started to explain. Words failed him for a second, and he quirked a smile as he decided to proceed without them. He kissed her then, pressing against her, tenderly, yes, but all along her body. It was the most gentle thing, and yet unerringly intimate. It was an offer. \"Yes?\" he wondered, as if he expected her to say something. She sighed in answer as they broke apart. \"Meaning,\" he whispered now, \"my regard for you will be quite evident in those moments. I promise you. I will not pounce on you with demands. When you are alone with me in our room, you will know... that I care for you.\" They were lovely words. They just seemed a tad difficultly spoken. \"Our room?\" She manufactured a pout. \"Although I may need some place of my own to hide in, when your moods strike.\" \"So says the lion tamer. You shall have your room, for those rare moments I am out of sorts. And I can hide in mine when you are the same.\" \"Kiss me, then.\" His grin grew as he pressed his lips to her cheek and jaw. \" Henry,\" she pleaded at his teasing. And finally, his kisses found her mouth.[Chapter 8] The ceremony was arranged quickly. It and the brunch that followed were conducted with the minimum fanfare that Mrs. Higgins would allow. The honeymoon was to be a week at the coast. The journey was made by rail and then taxi. The intimacy between them was felt but not overtly shown as they travelled together. The newlyweds had gone to their hotel room to get ready for dinner. They hung their outer coats and freshened up quickly. Each went silently about their tasks. Dinner would not be formal. There was no need to change from their traveling clothes. When Henry moved to leave the room, Eliza blocked the door. Her hands behind her, she leaned back into the paneled surface. \"What? Eliza.\" He looked distracted and confused at first. \"I'm going to go insane if I don't know if you feel the same way I do,\" she told him quietly and carefully. His eyes narrowed. \"Oh, God. It's started. Or continuing? Only what was occasional sport will now be a way of life?\" \"I don't understand,\" she said sadly. \"Exactly. I have no idea what you are saying or why. But... I take it you do not want to go to dinner?\" \"Not directly.\" \"You want to talk,\" Henry predicted almost derisively. \"Not necessarily.\" Eliza was staring at his lips. Remembering the feel of them at her wrist and on her neck. \"I was thinking I want to slow down a minute and ask you...\" \"Go on,\" he prompted gently now. \"To kiss me.\" Ordinarily his mind might supply him with fifty replies that could tease or wound. He was incapable tonight. And more than that, unwilling. He did kiss her and being quite unable to stop, and sensing the same in her, he decided they should move away from the door. Henry guided her to the bed and sat her on it. As he advanced on her, it caused her to scoot backwards looking surprised and chagrined. She had not expected to find the two of them atop the bed while still wearing the bulk of their clothes. But then she wasn't sure what she had expected. \"You seem a tad confined in that. Would you like some help?\" he ventured quite seriously. She nodded and swallowed hard. The jacket of her traveling suit was soon thrown to floor. She squeaked a note of protest at its handling before the feeling of her husband's hand, smooth and firm, and working up from her hip bone, distracted her. \"Oh... Blimey,\" she purred. He chuckled and bent his head to her neck. She pulled at him without words. The woman in her was nascent but eager. He shrugged off his jacket and sent it to lie with hers on the floor. Feeling her tremble, he stopped his kisses to look at her. \"Eliza?\" The look to her was so similar to how she had been the night of the ball. The same anxiety was there in the set to her eyes. It was the same, and it was different. Lying here with him, she wanted this. She touched him, returned his kisses with her own eager ones. Tight, tiny fists tugged him closer, gifting him her desire. But the memory of the Embassy Ball stuck with him. She had been frozen in their hallway then. The look, the worry, were quite similar to now, but her actions were so, so different. This was an inopportune time for a realization, but he couldn't help the way his mind worked. He kissed her softly in a way meant to slow and calm. \"You didn't want to go to the ball, did you? You couldn't have wanted anything less. It was something I forced on you,\" he said. \"It was your price, I decided. I wanted you to teach me. I had to let you do it your way. That meant going to the ball. But it was the most frightening thing I've ever done. And I didn't see the point in it, not beyond winning you your bet.\" He rolled away onto his back and pinched at his brow. \"You're angry,\" she assessed. \"Not with you.\" Blind. That much he could readily admit to. It was much easier than the idea that nagged underneath. He'd been horribly unfeeling. She had been an unwilling participant in the most terrifying evening of her life. And at the night's end, he had managed to overlook her. He had touched only the surface of this in his reconciliation with Eliza. It wasn't Freddy who would leave her prematurely gray. It wasn't Pickering who could not do her justice. The Colonel had begged him to call off the bet. Hugh had known. He had known. Henry didn't believe, and never would, that life should be some emotional roller coaster. Every mood should not be pursued or commented on. But there was some line between indifference and cruelty, and he had most likely crossed it from time to time. \"What was your favorite part of the ball?\" He choked on the question, regretting, but suspecting the answer before she could give it. \"Dancing with you,\" she said quite simply. He could see her smile in his memory of those moments. It had been the only full, truly happy smile he had seen on the girl all night, he realized now. At the time, his favorite memory of the ball had most likely been the moment he had found out she was presumed to be a princess of some sort. He and Eliza had something in common that night, he realized. They were both there in service to his ego. \"Why did you ask me to dance with you?\" she wondered quietly. \"I couldn't resist you. You were so beautiful. Regal. An angel. A masterpiece.\" \"One of your making?\" \"Of God's. You will think me crude, Eliza. But you were what every man in that room wanted that night... beside him and beneath him, even though they did not know the half of what makes you beautiful. How could I not ask to have that in my arms. There is my ego...\" \"Yes,\" she concurred softly. \"And by accepting me when I asked you to dance, you made me the envy of every man.\" \"Ah.\" She nodded. \"But I was so proud of you, Eliza.\" His voice was deep and haunted. He paused and let out a ragged breath before he told her, \"Words are not my forte.\" \"Oddly, no.\" \"I thought if I danced with you, you would know I was proud of you.\" \"You thought that?\" \"Not that clearly, no,\" he admitted. He worried she would want some space from him now, that perhaps the mood was ruined. \"Do you want me to take you to dinner?\" \"No.\" \"Come here.\" He slid from the bed to stand, and took her hand to have her do the same. It felt for a moment like rejection, but when his hands soothed down her arms, that changed. \"Take your hair down, please?\" he said in his most pleasing voice. \"I could try to, for whatever romantic capital that is worth, but I would likely leave you maimed and angry.\" Grinning shyly, she began to pull the pins. Henry smiled broadly enough to work unfamiliar muscles. He pulled at his tie then, leaning forward to kiss at her neck once the silk was in his hands. He threw it behind her and the motion seemed to lead him to cast his arms around her. His fingers settled at her back, at the hook at the top of her skirt. Her hands tightened on him as he worked the garment open and pushed it to the floor. It was Henry who kicked the thing toward the window once she had stepped out of it. \"Don't be silly,\" he tried to chide when she stiffened under his touch. He thought better of his words though. Instead of risking any more, he moved to pull back the covers, to make it truly their bed. And he led her to lie down there, still half clothed. She thought perhaps she should turn away when he shucked his shirt toward the chair and then set to work on his trousers. But, she tried watching only his eyes. They worked together and silently to remove the remainder of her clothing and his. It was almost reverential and too good to be true, until a particular piece of her under clothing proved entirely unyielding to his touch. \"For pity's sake. These things should be banned!\" he announced. \"I quite agree,\" she told him with a smile in her voice. He pressed his mouth to her skin, but drew his hands aside. She felt the joy in his kisses, and she sensed how eagerly he was waiting for her. He was leaving her to finish disrobing there under the sheets... with his encouragement, but wisely, without his scrutiny. She was skittish, but trying hard not to show it. A lifetime of guardedness and modesty could not fall away in in a mere half hour's time, he knew. \"Now?\" she wondered. He smiled, feeling more amusement than he dare show. \"Not just yet. Not quite now.\" Some things in life were earned. He knew this. She... this... was one of those things, quite clearly. He would know when that had been managed. \"I...I...\" she stammered and questioned, as his touch provoked her. His smile was pleased and not at all predatory. \"Just kiss me, Eliza.\" Soon she couldn't. It was just two fingers that traced along her thigh and up to her hip bone. She was sure. Just two fingers, but they had swept to whisper against that demanding bit of her. And she moaned with relief as he pressed and explored. The way she smelled. The many scents involved. Her hair, her skin. He was a man for whom language and sounds were everything and he had no words just now. He grinned in response to her sigh. He was triumphant when he felt her stiffen and grab for him. This was blissful and unexpected. And for a moment he was quite moorless. Sweetly and strangely adrift. He questioned what he felt. How the mighty have fallen. \"I'm sorry,\" he said quite seriously. \"What's the matter? What, possibly?\" \"Nothing. A thousand things. Just one.\" \"Can you tell me?\" she soothed. Can I tell you that I only properly understand what it is to love you now ... hours after I married you. Weeks after my proposal? He thought to himself. \"I've been told the most successful husbands apologize quite frequently.\" \"What ever it is... whatever it really is... I'm fairly certain I forgive you,\" she teased. He drew in a breath and squeezed his eyes closed a moment. And he almost delighted in seeing that he had not denied himself this sort of thing before. Because he could have easily gone on as he'd been forever... if not for Eliza. For the way she was. For what she was. She was some key that had unlocked this blessed newness. \"It's all right.\" For me to feel this way, he finished to himself. \"It's perfect. Fine,\" he said aloud, but still, more to himself than to her. He let go then of the stiffness in his posture, and he eased to rest against her then. To hold her. He would not love her grudgingly. Thank God he had fallen to this. To her. /fin/ ","Summary":" Vital I knew I could not post here unless I had something original to add.

Chapter 1: Summer Sun. The California sun blazed down on Amelia Hart, much to her annoyance and discomfort. She hopped out of her SUV, wiping away the light sweat that formed on her brow. She heaved out an exhausted sounding sigh as she moved around the truck. Amelia had moved to L.A. about five months ago, and she was finding out quickly how different it was from Washington, DC. Weather wise especially. The weather she could handle, because in the end she found L.A. to be gorgeous, the blazing heat was just something she'd grow accustomed to. It was the loss and dramatic turn her life took that would have her waking up from migraines in the middle of the night. It was the stress that was wearing her down. Five months ago, her sister Amanda and her husband Richard died in a car accident. So not only did she have to deal with the tragic loss of her sister, but as it turned out Amanda and Richard had a will naming Amelia to become the sole guardian of their two daughters, Maggie and Abby, whom she was helping out of the car right now. \"Aunt Amelia, I don't want to go to school today.\" Maggie, the eight year old whined as she hopped out of the truck, pout cutely formed on her face. Amelia rolled her eyes as she helped five-year-old Abby from the truck. The little girl held tightly onto her aunt's hand as she was set to the ground. \"Maggie,\" Amelia began exasperated as she smoothed out Abby's rumpled shirt. \"You can't miss school today. In fact, you can't miss any day of school unless you're sick. Which you are not, so don't even try and play that game with me.\" Maggie's pout deepened and she huffed crossing her small arms over her chest. \"Maggie, stop your pouting.\" Amelia demanded in a soft tone and held out her hand to the eight year old so they could cross the street to James Monroe Elementary . The girl continued to pout and didn't move. Amelia sighed in defeat. \"Maggie… if you will please behave for the rest of the day, I'll take you and Abby out for ice cream after school.\" Maggie took a moment to consider it before nodding satisfied and took her aunt's hand, while Abby happily cheered about ice cream. After getting the girl's settled at school, Amelia drove back home. She still had a hard time calling it home. It was Amanda and Richard's house. They had paid for it and cared for it—and they had left it to Amelia in their will so she could continue to raise their children in it. It's a medium sized blue house. Two levels. It has a good portion of land as well that was occupied with the girl's jungle gym, patio, and pool. It wasn't a difficult home to afford and care for. Though Amelia is a single woman now having two extra mouths to feed and send off to school, she finds financially it hasn't been so difficult just yet since the government also steps in to help in these sorts of situations. Not to mention the job she received with the CIA was a godsend when she moved to LA. Being a doctor, Amelia planned on transferring from MedStar Washington Hospital to a local hospital here in LA. The first month after her sister's death, she worried because all of the closest hospitals were already fully staffed and not currently hiring. She desperately wanted to respect Amanda and Richard's wishes with keeping the girls in LA to grow up and finish school, but at one point it didn't seem like that was going to happen. Then the CIA actually gave her a call about being their headquarters newest doctor/physician. Though she was shocked, Amelia eagerly accepted the job. It paid well and there were benefits. And they even gave her the time to settle in with Maggie and Abby. It wasn't a bad deal at all and she almost couldn't believe how lucky she had been in that front. Today is going to be her first day at work. As she walked into the house, she contemplates what she should wear. She's not entirely sure what the dress code is with the CIA. She decided on a conservative gray dress and of course her white lab coat. She's a bit unsure of the black stilettos she's wearing, but she likes to be a little stylish. She just hopes her new boss isn't absurdly conservative. She once worked in a hospital that hardly allowed anyone to not wear scrubs at all times. That was in the beginning of her career, and oh! How she hated it. Glancing up at the clock, she saw she has another hour to kill before she's supposed to be at headquarters. She figured that she should get there earlier to set up her new office and meet her new boss in person. She's only spoken to Ms. Collins a few times over the phone, and they were very brief conversations. Walking into CIA headquarters with her box of supplies for her office was a bit nerve wrecking. This was a whole new ball game for Amelia. She had always worked in hospitals, never a government agency! She's surprised they even called her—she never even applied here. Although lately, she's been thrown into a lot of new things and put into a bunch of new ball games—such as parenthood. Yet Amelia Hart kept her head up and a kind smile on her face as she passed by actual CIA agents. Never let anyone tell you that Amelia Hart wasn't brave for she has proven many times in her thirty-one years of life how damn brave she can be. However, when she felt a hand firmly on her shoulder, she nearly screamed. It comes out more as a strangled gasp when she turned to face her 'assailant'. A tall dark skinned woman stood before her in a conservative gray business suit. Her arms were crossed over her chest and a hard eyebrow was raised. Her expression was deadly serious. \"Dr. Amelia Hart?\" She questioned and Amelia nodded quickly. \"You're here early. Welcome to CIA headquarters. I'm Collins. Follow me to my office.\" She said before swiftly turning on her heel motioning for the doctor to follow. Amelia eyed her box of supplies, which seemed to be getting heavier by the second in her arms. Yet she scurried after her new boss not wanting to make a bad impression. \"You can put that down.\" Collins gestured to the box and motioned to one of the chairs in her office. Amelia gratefully set the box down. \"Oh, thank you, Ms. Collins.\" \"Just Collins, Dr. Hart.\" The woman responded leaning against her desk, arms once again crossed. \"Now, I am well aware of the situation with your sister and nieces,\" she paused a moment. \"My condolences.\" She said after consideration. \"We are usually moderate with the time of absence for our workers. We're also very strict with our rules. Considering that you are not an agent and working in our medical field where we have plenty of back up, your time off can be flexible. Being a single parent, we understand that there will be emergencies. However, I want you to understand that I will not tolerate lateness. I expect you to be here on time and if you cannot be I expect you to call your supervisor to let him know.\" Collin stated in her firm authoritative tone. \"I completely understand.\" Amelia said with a nod. \"Good. Also, as I'm sure you already know, you'll be working under Dr. Rosenburg. You will be taking more of the younger agents as patients, but age ranges could be sporadic between the both of you depending on who's on the clock. There are some low level doctors and then there are trainees, so I don't think you'll ever get too overwhelmed.\" Amelia nodded again in understanding. \"Do you have any questions, Dr. Hart?\" Amelia considered it. Most questions she would have most likely were better directed towards Dr. Rosenburg, her supervisor. \"Do I…\" She trailed off wondering if this was a silly question, but Collins motioned for her to continue. \"Um, do I have to do any type of… special training?\" Surprisingly, Collins smiled somewhat. \"Getting trained in self defense is entirely up to you. We have a list of recommended places for that. You are not an agent, Dr. Hart, and we have no intention of putting you in any danger. I recommend knowledge in self defense, but like I said, it's up to you.\" Amelia smiled and nodded once more. \"Anymore questions?\" Amelia was almost tempted to ask why she was hired for this job in the first place. She had never applied, but when someone called and told her that they were looking for someone for the job, they explained that they look through the applicants of overstaffed hospitals to see who was available. Still, she found it a bit odd that they picked her out of what she was sure were many applicants. \"No, ma'am. Thank you.\" She responded reaching her hand out for her boss to shake. Collins stood at her full height and towered over the small brunette. Amelia was slightly embarrassed, but most people do tower over her 5'2 form even when she donned on heels. Collins' handshake is firm and Amelia was impressed with how strong the woman is. Box back in her arms; Amelia was escorted out of the office by Collins who went over by the rail and yelled for two agents to go into her office. The doctor attempted to scurry away for that one. It didn't sound like it would be a pleasant conversation. \"Dr. Hart,\" Collins demanding voice stopped her in her tracks. Amelia quickly turned around to find another small smile on the other woman's lips. \"Nice shoes.\" A/N : Alright, so this is going to be my first multi-chaptered fic I've written in a long time, and I'm writing this mainly for my own pleasure. I know that a lot of mistakes are going to be made especially since I'm not all that knowledgeable in the medical field or in the CIA. Most information I'm getting is from the internet, but if you see any noticeable mistakes, please don't hesitate to let me know, I appreciate advice! EDIT : So, I did a bit of an edit and tried keeping the format in one tense. Decided on past tense. I apologize if it's still confusing or annoying to anyone, but I tried fixing the issue.

Chapter Song : Summer Sun by Jukebox the Ghost[Chapter 2] Not Here For War. Chapter 2: Yellow Light . The first day of work hadn't been all that bad. Basically the day had consisted of setting up her new office, meeting some of the agents, other members of the medical staff and Dr. Rosenburg. Her supervisor is a kind man with short cropped graying hair and a perfectly shaped mustache. He looked to be in his mid-fifties yet very healthy looking. They had discussed how things were going to go about. Afterwards, she picked up the girls from school and they did indeed go out for ice cream. Then they took out the pull out bed and fell asleep watching Disney movies. In the morning, they woke up to the alarm Amelia set on her phone. It was the same routine then—make the girls breakfast, pack up their lunch, get them dressed for school, buckled them safely into the truck, convinced Maggie that going to school wasn't so bad which ended in the bribery of ice cream again, going home and cleaned up some in the house, and then finally headed off to work. The second day was going to be nothing like the first day, however. The moment she stepped into her office, Dr. Rosenburg tapped at her door. \"Good morning, Dr. Hart.\" The elder man greeted kindly. Amelia smiled warmly in return. \"Good morning, Dr. Rosenburg. How are you doing today?\" \"I'm doing quite well, thank you, dear.\" He responded stepping further into the office. \"So as we discussed yesterday, the agents are to receive their annual physical exams. Since there are so many agents and only two of us today, this may go on until tomorrow.\" She nodded once. \"Of course.\" \"Alright, meet me in the exam room in ten minutes so we can prep.\" Amelia and Dr. Rosenburg split the amount of agents they were to exam by age range. She took 20-30's and he took 40-50's+. She found that she didn't mind the agents so much. Though most of them seemed quite shocked that such a young looking doctor was working for the CIA. Yet some of them congratulated her and wished her luck. One woman even offered to give her some self-defense lessons. She kept the agents card in her pocket. After doing ten exams, Amelia was beginning to feel exhausted. She was ready to go home and snuggle up with her girls, whom were being picked up by their baby sitter today. She was prepping the room for her next patient when two men bursted into the room seeming to be in deep conversation. She looked to both men wide eyed and cleared her throat trying to gain their attention. The men trailed off in their conversation looking over to her and their jaws slackened a bit. The taller one even let out a low 'whoa'. Suddenly feeling self conscious, Amelia tucked a strand of her dark hair behind her ear and chuckled nervously. \"So… ah, I don't usually take two at a time.\" She said and they continued to stare at her. \"Well, except that one time in college.\" They said nothing still and she felt herself become more nervous. \"That was a joke.\" Silence continued to fill the room and she became uncomfortable under their shocked staring. Amelia clasped her hands together in front of her and awkwardly stated, \"Well, it's a good thing I didn't go the comedian route in college like I wanted to.\" Snapping out of it, both men stopped gawking at her. \"I am terribly sorry about that.\" The shorter man said straightening and reached out his hand towards her to shake. \"I'm Agent Tuck Hansen.\" \"And I am FDR.\" The taller one stated, taking her hand and planted a kiss on it before she could shake Tuck's hand, which earned a glare from the other agent and an odd look from the doctor. FDR just continued to smile charmingly. Amelia cleared her throat. \"I'm Dr. Amelia Hart.\" \"Like the pilot?\" FDR questioned, eyebrows scrunched slightly. She raised a brow. \"That would be Amelia Ear hart, but I suppose I can understand the mistake.\" She responded amused then turned to retrieve something from the lower cabinet. Both Tuck and FDR managed to look away as she bent over, her dress becoming noticeably tighter at her backside. When she stood back up and saw they were both still there, her brow rose again. \"You know, one of you has to leave.\" Snapping out of it again, FDR was the one who decided to leave and pat Tuck on the shoulder. \"Good luck, man.\" He said then left the exam room silently closing the door behind him. There was an awkward silence between the doctor and agent for a long moment before Amelia smiled kindly. \"Please, stand on the scale, Agent Hansen.\" She gestured to the scale and Tuck nodded doing as he was told. She grabbed her clipboard and balanced the dials and recorded his height and weight for her file. \"Alright, now if you'll please take a seat.\" She motioned to the exam table and he did so without question. \"I'll be taking some blood in a few moments. You've fasted, correct?\" He nodded. \"I have.\" \"Okay, good.\" She checked his ears and mouth quickly, seeing no infections or anything out of sorts there. \"I'm going to check your blood pressure now.\" She said pointing to his bicep, which he willing gave. Gently, she took his well-toned arm and wrapped the sphygmomanometer around it. As she pumped the device, Amelia noticed Tuck stared at her intensely. \"You know, it's a bit rude to be staring like that.\" She stated not stopping her work on him. As if she snapped him out of his reverie, he stammered, \"I… uh, I apologize. I just… forgive me, but how old are you exactly?\" Amelia actually laughed a little. \"I am thirty-one years old.\" Tucked looked at her with disbelief and she nearly laughed again. She got this a lot. She's always had a baby face. \"Now that I refuse to believe. You can't be thirty-one.\" She grinned releasing the pump and removed the wrap from his arm. \"Would you like to see my birth certificate?\" She questioned playfully. \"I just might have to. You could be an imposter.\" He teased back. \"I think the big boss already took care of my background check.\" She said chuckling softly. \"You're blood pressure is very good, by the way.\" \"That's lovely to hear.\" He responded, grinning. She asked him a few questions about his health as she prepared the needle to take his blood. He seemed to be in perfect shape health wise. Most of the agents did. She took his arm again, and found his vein easily. \"Oh, you have wonderful veins!\" She told him without thinking. He laughed. \"I've received many compliments in my life, though never once about my veins.\" They both smiled at each other and Amelia mentally slapped herself when she realized they were flirting. She knew better than to flirt with coworkers or patients! But oh, she couldn't deny that Agent Hansen was attractive and his accent had her knees nearly turned into jelly. Amelia straightened up then and suddenly became serious and professional. She finished Tuck's exam as quickly as she could. And then came FDR. Though he was attractive—very attractive—Amelia quickly became annoyed and frustrated with his flirting. If this were under different circumstances, a different place, and a different time, she maybe wouldn't have minded too much flirting with FDR, and Tuck for that matter. \"So, how long have you been working here?\" FDR asked as she wrapped the band around his arm about ready to take his blood. \"I started yesterday.\" She responded simply. Before she prepared the needle, she needed to get something off of her chest. \"Look, I want to make something perfectly clear to you. I'm not here for romance or flings or one-night stands or anything like that. I'm here to be a doctor and I plan to keep any relationships I make here strictly professional. So, flirt with me all you'd like because I get the feeling that's in your nature, but don't try and pick me up. It's not going to happen. I have big responsibilities, there's not time for 'fun' with me. Got it?\" Amelia hadn't meant to sound so harsh and felt guilt form in the pit of her stomach at the expression on FDR's face. He looked somewhat hurt and yet there was an understanding in his eyes. She didn't think that he actually understood what she was going through, but she knew that he understood her seriousness. \"Yeah, got it, Doc.\" He responded with a short nod. She nodded back. \"Okay, good.\" She said and then began to take his blood. Since becoming sole guardian of Maggie and Abby, something in Amelia changed. She used to flirt a lot and went out on plenty of dates, even had some one-night stands. Yet she had given up her entire life up in DC for those girls. She had done it without hesitation, because she would do anything for Amanda and she would die for her nieces. She wasn't going to mess this up for anything. Her girls come before everything. Tuck was at his desk staring intensely at his computer screen when FDR returned. \"Hey, what're you up to?\" FDR asked plopping down at his own desk. \"Um, not much.\" Tuck answered glancing away from his screen only a moment. The fact was Tuck was a bit shamed that he just did a background check on Dr. Amelia Hart. It wasn't that he didn't trust her; in fact, he was quite interested in her. She's beautiful, intelligent, and seemed to be quite funny. He's been interested in dating again, and he's pretty sure he'd like to start that with the new doctor. The shame he felt came when he read about why she was here in LA in the first place. He certainly knew what it was like to have parenthood unexpectedly thrust upon you, but not like how Amelia had it brought to her. It was tragic, and yet Amelia seemed like quite a sane and happy person, which he believed showed her strength. \"You're looking pretty deep in thought there, buddy.\" FDR interrupted his thoughts. Tuck glanced over again to see his partner looking at him concerned. \"I've, uh… been thinking about dating again.\" He responded honestly. He's thought about it for a while now. FDR actually smiled at that. \"I think that's a great idea!\" \"Really?\" Tucked asked. \"Yeah. It's about time you got laid again.\" FDR said as he began typing at his computer. \"Ha-ha, very funny.\" He said rolling his eyes before becoming serious again. \"I was actually thinking of asking the new doctor—Amelia—out on a date.\" FDR stopped typing suddenly. \"Not a good idea.\" He said turning in his chair so he faced his best friend across the room. Tuck frowned. \"Why? Why wouldn't it be a good idea?\" \"Well, while I was getting my exam, I was putting on the ol' FDR charm. And well—she just wasn't interested.\" He responded with a shrug. He wouldn't let that bother him too much. Tuck rolled his eyes again. \"Just because she's not interested in you , doesn't mean she's not interested in dating. You don't flirt with your doctor while they're giving you an exam anyway.\" He said despite the fact that he flirted a bit with the good doctor himself. \"I guess that's true.\" FDR said though he looked unconvinced. \"But then she told me that she intends to keep all relationships she makes here at the CIA strictly professional. So, if you're thinking of getting back into the dating game, it's not going to be with her.\" There was a surge of disappointment in the Brit. \"She really said that?\" \"Yup.\" FDR stated making a puckering sound at the 'p' before he typed away at his computer again. Tuck looked at his computer screen again. There was a picture of Amelia in her lab coat, forced smile on her face. Obviously, the picture had been taken for an ID card of some sort. It disappointed him because she seemed like such a good person—after all, who left their entire life in DC behind to step in and take care of their deceased sisters children? A good person. But he figured she had bigger responsibilities now and didn't quite have the time for dating. Tuck, however, was very ready to date. He figured joining that dating website wasn't such a terrible idea now after all. When Amelia returned home, she was exhausted and completely ready to fall into bed. \"Aunt Amelia!\" Maggie and Abby yelled in unison when she stepped into the living room where they were watching a movie with their baby sitter. Their little arms wrap around her small waist and Amelia suddenly forgot all about her tiredness when she hugged her girls back. \"Hello, my loves. How was your day? Oh, why aren't you in your jammies yet?\" She asked and glanced at the clock, which read nine o'clock. \"We were watching a movie with Martha.\" Maggie exclaimed. Martha, the girl's baby sitter, got up from the couch with a kind smile on her face. Martha was a middle-aged woman who used to work at a daycare. Her hair was a dyed blond color, light wrinkles were beginning to form at the edge of her eyes and the corners of her lips, and she had the brightest blue eyes. Amelia hired her for her experience with children and for her unyielding warmth. The woman was very kind and loved children automatically. The girls seemed to like her too. From what she knew, Martha was a single mother of three children. They were all adults now, the last one just off to college. \"Alright then, go on upstairs and get dressed for bed. We can finish watching the movie and then it's bedtime.\" Amelia told them. The girls agreed before they scurried to their room. \"You know, you're doing really well with those girls.\" Martha said as Amelia turned and smiled at the woman. The smile faltered somewhat. The self-conscious part of Amelia didn't think she was doing so great a job. She wasn't their mother. She never could be. She wasn't a parent. She had been married to her job back in DC. Of course, she had been on plenty of dates and had some boyfriends, but the issue came down to her job—it was more important to her than any relationship. Then Amanda and Richard died and everything about her life changed. The only thing that matter to her then was Maggie and Abby, but no matter what, she didn't think she could ever be what they needed—their mother. Despite herself, Amelia continued to smile politely. \"Thank you, Martha…\" She trailed off and eyed the hallway the girls just went down as she heard them moving around in their room. \"Has… has Abby spoken to you at all today?\" Martha frowned and shook her head. \"No. She would only talk to Maggie still.\" Since her parent's death, Abby had become rather quiet. She would talk to anyone besides Maggie or Amelia. The doctors said that it was a coping mechanism and that Abby was simply sticking to what she was familiar with. They were putting her through therapy, but Amelia only allowed it for once a week, twice a week tops. She didn't think it right for a five year old to be going to a therapist so much. Amelia sighed deeply, but suddenly smiled again when the girls came back into the living room. \"Alright, girls, say goodnight to Martha.\" It was Maggie who did so, but Abby at least waved at Martha when she left. They finished watching the movie, which was James and the Giant Peach in content. Yet there was still the lingering worry in Amelia for her girls. She wanted so much for things to get better for them, but how could they when their parents were gone? It never quite crossed her mind completely that she was their parent now; no matter how unfit she may have thought she was. A/N: Alright, so I feel like I should state that the romance between Tuck and Amelia isn't really going to be happening until later chapters. There will be some tension and stuff, but the romance won't really be happening until later. Also, I'm not entirely sure about the timing in the movie so I'm mostly going to be making assumptions with that and it may sometimes be inaccurate. Apologies ahead of time!

Chapter Song: Yellow Light by Of Monsters and Men[Chapter 3] Not Here For War. Chapter 3: Carnival. The week passed quite well for Amelia work wise. She was getting along great with her co-workers and she even made some friends with the agents. She was amazed with how she was able to do this job with such ease. Yes, she's a doctor and completely professional, but she's constantly reminded that she was working with people who could kill without even flinching. She would try and not stare at the guns on their belts. However, she was quickly growing used to it and that in itself was a tad bit disturbing to her. Today had been a quiet day at work as Amelia worked over some papers—the agent's results from their physical exams. Everyone one of them was at top health. Only some suffered from either high blood pressure or sugar. Nothing that couldn't be straightened up with a healthier diet. She was writing down some results for Collins when two agents burst into her office. Amelia supposed she shouldn't be surprised that it was agents' Tuck and FDR. Yet she smiled kindly at the two men and stood from her desk. \"I see you two have a habit of entering rooms together—and not knocking.\" Her smile faltered when she saw the men didn't seem too happy and actually seemed uncomfortable in each other's presence. A stark contrast from the first time she met them. She found it a bit odd for partners to have this uncomfortable air about them. \"I see my comedian streak is still poor.\" She said awkwardly shifting in her stilettos and shoving her hands in her lab coat pockets. \"Uh, we've just come for our exam results.\" It's FDR who spoke and Tuck gave him a dark look. She eyed them a moment longer before she nodded once. \"Of course.\" She responded seriously and going to her desk to go through her files, and picked theirs out. \"Alright, so your results are excellent. You're both in perfect health.\" She told them handing them each a sheet. \"I've… uh, made you copies of your results in case you're interested in taking a look yourself.\" \"Thank you.\" FDR said sharply and snatched the paper from her and left the office quickly. Amelia was more than a little shocked and she looked to Tuck for an explanation. He at least looked shamed on his partner's behalf. \"I apologize for that, Dr. Hart. We aren't exactly having a good day and we're pretty wound tight with being grounded.\" Tuck said taking the sheet from her. He's upset that his friend had taken out his frustration of the issues they had of Lauren on Amelia. She nodded once. \"Alright then.\" There was a long silence between them and Amelia was expecting him to leave. However, he lingered and pointed to something on her desk. \"Are those your children?\" He asked gesturing to the picture of Maggie and Abby on her desk. They had been on the beach with their parents that day. It had been taken a year before the tragedy. They were happy and Amelia wanted to see that everyday. Tuck very well knew who the girls were. He had never seen them, but he knew of them from reading on her biography. However, he wasn't about to admit to her that he did in fact do a background check on her. He was sure the doctor wouldn't have appreciated him digging his nose into her personal life. Amelia smiled fondly at the picture before her eyes returned on Tuck. \"Oh no, those are my nieces—Maggie and Abby. I'm actually their guardian. So… I guess in a way they are my children.\" She shrugged still very unconvinced of that. Tuck smiled gently. \"It sounds to me like they are.\" Despite herself, Amelia's smile grew at that. \"Do you have any children, agent Hansen?\" She asked conversationally. \"Please, just call me Tuck.\" He said despite knowing that this woman wanted to keep things professional. \"And yes, I have a son named Joe. He's seven.\" He beamed as he spoke of his son, yet there was a sadness in his eyes as well. \"You and his mother are separated?\" Amelia asked suddenly. Tuck's eyes landed on hers sharply and she blushed when she realized her mistake. \"I am so sorry about that. I just… I just noticed the lingering sadness… and, I'm so sorry. That was inappropriate of me.\" She said quickly, very much embarrassed with herself. He laughed softly and motioned for her to relax. \"That's alright. You just took me by surprise. You have some good observational skills. You could be a detective.\" Amelia outright laughed and shook her head. \"Oh, I'm not so sure about that. I don't think I could ever have the mentality for that—though, in a way being a doctor is almost like being a detective. I mean it is our job to detect if there is a problem within a person. But we have machines to help with that so it's probably not like detective work at all—and I am completely rambling right now, aren't I?\" She asked noticing the amused smile on his face. \"Just a bit.\" He answered grinning. She laughed again and crossed her arms over her chest. Once again, she realized what was happening here and she strongly pushed away the butterfly feeling in her stomach. She firmly reminded herself that she needed to stop flirting with this man. That she has no time to be flirting with anyone. But the smile on her face refused to falter. \"I, uh…\" Tuck began in a stammer and rubbed the back of his neck. \"I should go now.\" Amelia swallowed the disappointment and she forced her smile to be kind. She told herself that she wasn't upset. At all. \"Of course. I'll see you around. Hopefully not too much though because that would probably mean you're injured. And we don't want that.\" She rambled again. Tuck found he didn't mind her ramblings. In fact, he found it endearing, which made him want to leave the office all the more. He reminded himself of Lauren and the idiotic 'gentlemen's agreement'. Lauren. She was what mattered right now. \"Thank you, Dr. Hart.\" He said before he hastily exited the office. Amelia let out a deep sigh. This was exactly why she wanted to keep all relationships here professional. She didn't need the complications nor did she need that pesky butterfly feeling that was still fluttering around in her stomach. She wasn't some teenage girl gushing over her first crush. She's a doctor, dammit! There were bright lights and excited shouting. There were victory cheers and large stuffed animals being handed out. There were clouds of cotton candy melting in happy mouths and the delicious aroma of popcorn popping in the air. Amelia hadn't realized how much she missed going to carnivals until she stepped foot into this one. She hadn't been to one since she was a kid! It was a spur of the moment decision to come here. When she had come home from work, the girls seemed bored. Like complained about every little thing bored. She remembered Martha mentioning about a carnival being in town and then that was it. They were buckled in the truck and off to the carnival. She had even invited Martha along for some fun. The babysitter was actually with the girls now at the bathrooms while Amelia purchased the tokens. She was grinning like a fool too. She was childishly excited about being here. She felt like a little girl again and she hadn't felt like that in a very long time. As she headed towards the restrooms, she checked out every ride she passed and decided she was going to ride every one of them. \"Dr. Hart?\" A voice from behind her exclaimed. Amelia swiftly turned to find the smiling face of Tuck Hansen. And the smiling face of the blond woman holding his hand. She quickly plastered on a smile and pushed away the jealous feeling that was creeping up on her. \"Oh hello, agent Hansen.\" The blond woman grinned. \"I didn't realize even travel agents were addressed as 'agent' outside of work.\" She said to Tuck amused. Amelia raised a brow at that and Tuck chuckled nervously. \"Ah, yes. Dr. Hart is quite professional.\" Tuck told the blond and Amelia was still quite confused. \"Lauren, this is my doctor, Amelia Hart. Dr. Hart, this is Lauren Scott, my… my date.\" Amelia stared at the two for a moment. It hit her that Tuck was lying to his date about who he really was. She understood. She understood why he was doing it. His job was dangerous, very dangerous. He must have to lie to people, probably even his loved ones, to protect them. She found that a bit sad and she made the hasty decision to go along with his lie. \"Hello, Lauren. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" She finally acknowledged, reaching out her hand for the other woman to shake. Lauren's smile was very kind as she shook Amelia's hand. Despite that lingering jealousy, she couldn't bring herself to dislike Lauren. Kindness seemed to radiate off of her, and though she doesn't know Tuck very well, Amelia thought that this was what he deserved. She just hoped that his 'career' wouldn't ruin this. \"Alright, well I've gotta go find my girls and their babysitter now. You two have fun!\" She said kindly to the couple. \"You too, Dr. Hart.\" Tuck responded with a grin. \"Oh, we're in an unprofessional environment now, Tuck. You may call me, Amelia.\" She had no idea why she said that. She didn't mean to. The words just came tumbling out of her mouth like word vomit. But Tuck continued to smile at her and it was much too late to take it back so she smiled back. \"You've got it, Amelia.\" She tried to ignore the fact that her name sounded so wonderful with his accent. \"I'll see you next check up.\" Amelia simply nodded and waved them off as they went their separate ways. With a heavy sigh, she bought some cotton candy and headed off to find her girls again. When she did, they stole her cotton candy to which she pouted at them childishly, earning the wonderful sound of giggles from her beautiful auburn haired girls. They dared her to go on nearly all the rides they saw, including some of the kiddy ones. Amelia had a wonderful time and so had the girls. They all laughed much more than they ever had these past five months. \"I'm telling you, Martha, I'm lost!\" Amelia nearly yelled into her Bluetooth as she drove down the unfamiliar street. \"I don't understand how you can be lost. Didn't your navigation system re-route you?\" Martha questioned exasperated. Leaving work today had been something of an adventure/disaster. There had been a car accident on her usual route home so she had to take a detour. Her navigation system went all wonky and sent her into some district she had no idea about. \"I don't know where this stupid thing sent me, Martha!\" Amelia responded seething with frustration. \"You know what, I'm doing this the old fashioned way and asking for directions. I'll call you back.\" It took Amelia a total of ten minutes to find a parking spot. This was a busy street filled with restaurants, clubs, and bars. Finding a place that wasn't dark and pounding with music was proving to be difficult. But she finally found a quieter place where someone was able to give her directions back home. Gratefully giving her thanks, she began to exit the restaurant. She stopped dead in her tracks at the sight of FDR with a blond woman. Not just any blond woman either. Amelia recognized that it was Tuck's date from the carnival two nights ago—she recalled her name being Lauren. She and FDR seemed to be arguing. Amelia managed to hold back a gasp when they kissed. And it was some heavy kissing. She flew out the back door of the restaurant and practically ran to her truck. She wanted to pretend that she never saw a thing. After all, Tuck and Lauren had only gone out on a date as far as she knew. It could have been nothing serious and they went their separate ways. But there was a nagging feeling in the back of her mind that she couldn't shake off. She's reminded of why she wanted to keep strictly professional relationships with her co-workers/patients. She didn't want their issues stressing her out. And Amelia knew this was going to stress her out. She wasn't going to let it go. A/N: So, I don't know how well I'm doing with this, it's still the beginning and I haven't done this in a long time, but I just want to thank the people who have reviewed so far. They're very much appreciated! Also, to answer the 'anonymous' question; yes, I do have a face claim for Amelia. It's Rachel Bilson. As for the girls; Alissa Skovbye for Maggie and Josie/Lucy Gallina for Abby. As for Dr. Rosenburg, I was thinking Tom Selleck, at least that was the image that kept coming to my mind as I wrote him. And I don't really have one for Martha. I just kept getting this image of my Walking for Wellness professor back when I was in college, not that that's helpful! XP Disclaimer : I do not own This Means War or any of it's characters. I only own the OC's that will be seen and mentioned in this fan fiction. Chapter Song: Carnival (Acoustic) by The Cranberries[Chapter 4] Not Here For War. Chapter 4: Push. The following two days had been nothing but stressful for Amelia, and it was hardly because of the issue with Tuck and FDR (though that still strongly lingered about in her mind). Today Amelia had to miss her lunch break for a parent-teacher meeting with Abby's Kindergarten teacher. Miss Robins was younger looking, maybe only a little older than Amelia herself. Her hair was a silky blond and so perfectly straight, swept over her shoulder in a loose pony tail. She dressed in white tennis shoes, casual tan pants, and a light purple blouse. Amelia felt only somewhat uncomfortable in her black sleeveless skater dress and gray heels. She had decided to leave the lab coat in the truck. \"Mrs. Hart, I asked you to come here today because I'm worried about Abby.\" Miss Robins stated in an overly sweet tone. Amelia didn't bother to correct the teacher on her title. \"She hardly ever speaks, even when spoken to. She hasn't even made one friend this year. That's very concerning to see in a five year old girl.\" Amelia frowned. \"I understand your concern, Miss Robins. Abby's been going through a lot. The therapists say that it's quite normal after a child loses their parents that they want to stick with what and who they know.\" Miss Robins nodded but she didn't look exactly cheered over this. \"Hmm. Well, I don't find that allowing Abby to seclude herself is helpful to her mental health. I think that there should be a change there.\" Amelia's jaw nearly dropped. \"I'm… I'm not encouraging Abby to seclude herself. She has therapy sessions once sometimes even twice a week.\" \"Perhaps more sessions would be helpful?\" The teacher suggested, sweet tone and judging eyes. \"I don't think it would be beneficial for a five year old to be spending most of her time in a therapists office.\" \"Well, she doesn't seem to be spending her time doing much else, Mrs. Hart.\" \"It's Dr. Hart,\" Amelia snapped, eyes blazing. \"And excuse you, but you have no idea what Abby does outside of school. I understand that there is an issue with her. Trust me, I do. Your mistake is thinking that I'm not doing everything I can without compromising her young mind. I apologize if you feel that what I'm doing for my niece isn't enough for you.\" She seethed in a calm tone. Amelia was far from calm, however. She was furious. Furious with this woman and her judgmental suggestions. Furious with herself for not doing enough to help Abby. Furious with the world. She almost wanted to jump over this desk and smack the fake cheeriness from the young teacher's face. Though she had enough mind to know that getting the girls potentially kicked of school wasn't going to be helpful to anyone. Miss Robins blinked once looking positively shocked. \"Mrs—I mean, Dr. Hart, I'm not trying to attack you here. I called you here because I was concerned and I was hoping that we could do something to help poor Abby.\" \"Don't do that.\" Amelia grounded out. \"Don't call Abby 'poor'. Yes, something extremely tragic happened in her life, but don't say that she's poor because she has me as a replacement parent.\" The teacher gawked. \"That is not what I mea—\" \"Yes. Yes, it was what you meant.\" Amelia interrupted standing from her seat abruptly and flinging her purse around her shoulder. She planned on making some witty comment, but instead she sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. \"Have a good day, Miss Robins.\" With that, the doctor hastily left James Monroe Elementary. The moment she stepped foot back into headquarters, Amelia was very much reminded of another stressor in her life—the Tuck and FDR situation. She had been avoiding the two men like the plague since finding out they were dating the same woman, which surprisingly proved difficult because 1) She had to pass by their office in order to get to hers and 2) Tuck has apparently been looking for her. According to Dr. Rosenburg, Tuck had stopped by Medical asking for her. The last thing she wanted was to face either man. She didn't know how to face those two men knowing what she knew. She could potentially ruin their friendship and partnership! Dating the same woman could easily destroy what the two agents had. Amelia did not want to be the bearer of that devastating news. This was not the kind of stress Amelia needed at her place of work, especially after today's meeting with Abby's teacher. It all had the doctor currently pacing in her office contemplating what type of action she should take. On one hand, she could just ignore it. It's none of my business anyway. She thought, turning on her heel and paced to the other side of the room. But it was going to keep bothering her until she exploded. On the other hand, she could tell one of them what was going on and of course that would bring the possible ending of their friendship/partnership. Along with the issue she just made with Miss Robins today, Amelia could already feel the massive headache coming. She was thinking far too much on this situation. She ceased her pacing and grabbed some Aspirins from her desk. There was suddenly a knock on her door. \"Come in!\" She called out, shaking two pills into her palm. As fate would have it, one of the very people she was avoiding walked into her office. \"Tuck.\" She acknowledged shocked. She fixed herself quickly and smiled somewhat. \"I mean, Agent Hansen. What, uh… what brings you to my office?\" Tuck smiled kindly and he closed the door behind him, stepping further into the office. \"Dr. Hart.\" He acknowledged in return. \"I've been trying to talk to you these past few days.\" \"Oh, have you now?\" She asked and did her best to ignore the guilt that was building inside of her. \"Yes. I just wanted to thank you for going along with me on what I've had to tell Lauren. I'm sure that seemed quite strange.\" He said, his smile turning shy. \"I don't really enjoy lying about it, but I don't have much of a choice in the matter. This job… could be a potential danger to my loved ones.\" \"It's alright. I completely understand.\" She told him and her smile faltered as that terrible feeling grew in her stomach. \"Is… is, um, Lauren a loved one now?\" Tuck blushed and even ducked his head at the question. He looked like a schoolboy with a crush, and Amelia thought it was adorable. \"Ah… I'm not so sure yet. I'm hoping so. I really like her.\" Amelia gulped. She really didn't want to hear that. It only intensified that dreadful feeling in the pit of her stomach. She felt so bad and she didn't want to break the news to him. But she had to. She felt that it was the right thing to do. \"Um, Tuck. There's something I have to tell you.\" She started nervously. He suddenly looked concerned as he watched her put the Aspirin down on the desk and crossed her arms over her chest. \"What is it?\" The more she looked at him, the more Amelia was losing her nerve. Tuck seemed like such a sweet and good man. It hurt her to have to tell him that he and his best friend were with the same woman. \"Um… the other night I saw something…\" She trailed off not sure how to continue. Yet Tuck waited patiently, storm colored eyes watching her with soft concern. \"I really do hate saying this, but I saw FDR and Lauren together. And they were… kissing… a lot.\" Tuck rightfully looked shocked to hear that. \"Oh…\" Amelia couldn't stand that crushed look on his face. \"Look, he probably doesn't even know that you and Lauren are dating. This is all probably some big misunderstanding.\" She amends hoping to reassure him in some way. \"No, he knows.\" Tuck responded much to her disbelief. \"I… excuse me?\" She asked very much stumped. Tucked rubbed the back of his neck, an abashed expressed forming on his face. \"FDR know that I am dating Lauren. And I know that he is dating her.\" That only caused more confusion on Amelia's part. \"Wait… you're both dating— knowingly dating the same woman?\" \"Erm… yes.\" \"Does… does she know?\" \"No!\" Tuck answered quickly. \"No, Lauren has no idea that Frank and I know each other. It's… it's all quite complicated.\" Amelia said nothing, simply watched him expectantly. It was none of her business, but still she waited for him to explain this confusion to her. \"Lauren and I met through a dating website. FDR wanted to watch over the date, instead he waited at a video store down the street from where Lauren and I had our date and then…\" He trailed off with a frown and she almost felt sorry for him. Almost. \"Um, we've just recently found out that we've been seeing the same woman, and we've decided to let her choose. We have a 'gentlemen's agreement'.\" Amelia blinked once. \"A gentlemen's agreement? And what does that entail?\" She doesn't know why she asked. She's not so sure she even wanted to know. For someone who wanted to keep things professional, she asked some personal questions. Tuck wasn't so sure why he decided to tell this all to the doctor. He and FDR had decided to keep this between themselves. But for some reason, he felt that he owed Amelia some explanation. \"The agreement is that we don't know each other, we stay out of each other's way, and… and, um, no sex. Also, if it starts to effect our friendship, we walk away.\" Amelia was speechless at first. This was what she had stressed out over these past few days? Over something as silly as two men fighting over a woman? \"That is one of the most disgusting things I have ever heard.\" She finally said in a clipped tone and she adamantly ignored the shocked expression on Tuck's face. She wasn't quite sure why she felt so angry at Tuck. None of this was her business. What Tuck, FDR, and their girlfriend Lauren decided to do with their lives was absolutely none of her concern. In the end, she knew that most of her anger wasn't towards Tuck. It was towards her ever growing stress. She was still waking up from migraines in the middle of the night. She knew that she wasn't well and that she hasn't been since her sister passed. Today's meeting with Miss Robins just made it grow. Now this situation was the clincher for her. \"Amelia, I—\" \"I think that you should leave my office now, Agent Hansen.\" She interrupted him and nodded towards the door. Tuck wanted to say something to defend himself. He kept his mouth firmly shut though, but he stayed in the office for a moment longer. Stormy blue hues bored into dark brown ones, as if trying to speak to her through sight. Even then, she was withering with anger and judgment. He wasn't blind. He saw the dark circles under her eyes she tried to conceal with makeup. He clearly noticed the Aspirin's she was about to take before he came in. She's stressed. Overly stressed, even. He didn't know if it was over her new job with the CIA, something in her personal life, or if it actually was his and FDR's situation. Maybe it was a mixture of all of those things. He knew better than to comment on it now. Silently, Tuck left Amelia's office and gently closed the door behind him. Amelia stared at the closed door for a long moment before she sighed deeply and plopped down in her chair. She took the two Aspirin's and popped them into her mouth, swallowing them dryly. She felt like an absolute idiot. She just meddled herself into someone else's business and then completely judged them for it. She didn't approve of what Tuck and FDR were doing with Lauren, and she didn't so much approve of Lauren knowingly dating two men at the same time, but Amelia knew she had no right to do what she just did. With that now heavy on her mind, Amelia pinched the bridge of her nose and attempted to get some paperwork done. The LA sky turned dark and the clock vibrantly informed Amelia that her shift has ended and it was time to go home. Eager to get home to Maggie and Abby, she walked quickly to her SUV. Technically Amanda's truck, but it seems what was Amanda's is mine now. She thought sad and bitter. However, it seemed like her night was hardly over for when she strode over to her truck, she found Tuck leaned against it, waiting for her. She didn't want to know how he knew this was her truck. \"Agent Hansen?\" She questioned almost breathless. \"We're both of the clock now, Amelia. You may call me Tuck.\" He told her with a small smile. She said nothing and smile melted away instantly. \"I… I'm afraid I've given you the wrong impression about the sort of person I am.\" \"Oh?\" She inquired with a raised brow. She knew she was being unfair and she hated herself a little more for it. \"Yes. I… I'm not the sort of man who… who shares a woman with my best friend.\" He told her, looking embarrassed and even desperate. \"That is not me. Not at all. I just… this whole thing with Lauren… I truly like her. She is a good woman and I would like a future with her. The issue I've always had in my life was that I never fought for what I wanted. I fought for nearly everything else, but not for what I wanted. That's what I'm doing with Lauren now—I'm fighting for her.\" Amelia was silent for a long moment after Tuck's confession. She still wasn't entirely approving of the situation, but she could hardly argue with him. She had completely misjudged Tuck and she had done so completely unfairly. She took her own pent up stress out on him, and she was ashamed of herself for it. \"Tuck,\" His name was soft on her lips and he looked up to her, pushing himself off of the SUV, \"Why are you telling me this?\" He looked thoughtful before he licked his full lips and spoke again. \"I… I just don't want you to think I'm that sort of man.\" He was being earnest and Amelia had to wonder why he cared so much what she thought of him. As if he'd read her mind, he continued, \"I want to be your friend.\" Amelia opened her mouth to say something, but she found she was at a complete loss for words. It seemed Tuck Hansen was a constant surprise to her. \"I know that you want to keep everything professional.\" He continued and she assumed FDR passed along that bit. \"But I don't think there's anything wrong with having a few friends.\" She chewed on her bottom lip lightly. She hardly expected any of this. After what happened today in her office, Amelia half expected him to avoid her and be offended. The very last thing she expected was for him to seek her out and try to redeem himself in her eyes and asking for friendship. This was all something so very new to her. \"Alright.\" She stated suddenly. Despite himself, Tuck looked surprised. \"Alright?\" Amelia nodded and smiled kindly. \"Yes, we can be friends. I think that would be nice.\" Tuck smiled happily at that. It may be a little pathetic of him to be this joyed over making a friend, especially considering Lauren. But he couldn't help it. Something warm spread inside of him at her acceptance. It had made him feel near sick at the thought of Amelia seeing him as some sort of… well, as FDR. \"Yes, it does sound nice.\" He repeated stepping away from her truck and closer to her. Even in the dark, he could make out the redness of her cheeks, she blushing at their proximity. He briefly wondered if he hadn't listened to FDR about Amelia desiring for professionalism—what would be happening right now? Would he have ever put his ad on the dating website? Would he, or FDR for that matter, have ever met Lauren? Does it even matter now? He snapped out of his thoughts when he realized Amelia was speaking to him. \"I'll see you tomorrow, Tuck.\" She told him almost shyly. \"Yes, see you tomorrow, Amelia. Drive home safe.\" He said patting her tiny shoulder. Tuck wasn't a tall man, but Amelia Hart practically dwarfed compared to him. They went their separate ways then, but Tuck watched her drive away until he can no longer see her tail lights as they disappeared in the sea of darkness. A/N : Okay, so once again, thank you everyone who has reviewed. Seriously, they're very much appreciated and they inspire me to keep going! So in the next few chapters, you'll be learning some more about Amelia's past and her struggles with-well, I don't really want to give too much away. Stay tuned!

Chapter Song: Push by Matchbox Twenty[Chapter 5] Not Here For War. Chapter 5: Breathe Me. A few days had passed since Amelia and Tuck's moment in the parking lot-since their 'friendship' began. And what a friendship it was! He had visited her office many times just for idle chat and to see how she was doing, and since then he's been walking her to her car at the end of her shifts. They talked a lot, but not about anything personal just yet. Amelia noticed things about Tuck. Things that excited her—like the way a smile would spread across his face so suddenly and the corners of his eyes would crinkle cutely. Then she noticed things that upset her—like when he would get this far away look in his eyes when she mentioned FDR. She knew that this whole ordeal with Lauren was taking its toll on Tuck and FDR's friendship. Amelia wanted to tell him that it wasn't worth it—that this woman wasn't worth losing your best friend over. But she never felt like it was her place. Tuck had told her that he never fought for what he wanted before. She felt sorry for him in that aspect. She also recognized that he was an adult and he would make his own decisions no matter what she would say to him. And who was she to assume that Lauren wasn't worth it? She very well could be. Tuck practically beamed when he talked about her! But still, Amelia saw how negatively this was affecting his friendship with FDR, and she didn't like it. Not one bit. Even so, the doctor couldn't bring herself to say anything to him. They're in the very beginning stages of their friendship and she didn't want to upset that. She was mildly content with just letting things go on the way that they were. She still didn't want to get caught up in anyone else's issues. But that all changed when she bumped into Tuck as she was preparing to leave headquarters, blood trickling down the side of his head. \"Tuck! What happened to you?\" She near shrieked striding over to him, concern evident on her features. Tuck looked appropriately embarrassed and he shifted uncomfortably on his feet. \"Ah… just a little mission gone awry. Nothing to worry about.\" Amelia hardly believed him. \"Why didn't you come to me?\" She asked stepping closer to him and inspecting the cut better. \"Well, I knew that you would be leaving soon so I was planning on going to Rosenburg or—\" \"Don't be silly.\" She interrupted, taking his hand into her own. \"Come on, let's go get that cleaned up.\" Her tone demanded no argument as she led him to one of the med labs. Tuck didn't dare argue, and he tried to ignore the fact that her hand felt so soft within his own. He had the urge to trail his fingers over her skin. He blamed this on the adrenaline rush he had experienced when capturing Ivan, yet he wasn't foolish enough to be unaware of the fact that Amelia is a beautiful woman. Amelia didn't like worrying. She had enough on her plate. She had two children to worry about—to worry if she was doing what was best for them, if she would be able to help them grow up properly. She didn't want to add Tuck into the mix, but ever since he came to her seeking friendship, she knew he was going to be on her worry list. And that worry was certainly weighing down on her now as she cleaned the cut on his head. It was irrational, she knew. It was such a small injury and she's very sure that Tuck's had far worse happen to him, but that's what she worried about—the future and what could happen to him then. Yet she managed to keep her face impassive as she fixed him up. Tuck didn't take his eyes off of her, devouring each of her movements. \"So,\" she broke the silence as it was deafening to her, \"Tell me exactly how this happened.\" There was a hint of questioning in her tone as if to assure him that she wasn't demanding anything. Is he even allowed to tell me anything? She wondered, suddenly regretting speaking. But Tuck had found a way to give her some answers while still being vague. \"FDR and I were going after a 'suspect'. Things got a bit rowdy. There was gunfire, chasing around, and all those lovely things, but we got the guy anyway.\" \"And how is working with FDR going?\" She asked, swiping once more at his cut before grabbing a small bandage. \"We've been working together for years.\" He responded, a sound of detachment lingering in his tone. Tearing the package open and gently placing the bandage on his brow, Amelia was close to his face smoothing out the Band-Aid. \"That doesn't answer my question, Tuck.\" He said nothing for a long moment. He didn't want to admit that he and FDR were beginning to resent each other. They had promised each other that the moment this affected their friendship they would end things with Lauren. That certainly wouldn't be happening now—they were in too deep. They both deeply cared for Lauren. Yet, Tuck felt the unfairness of it all and he supposed Amelia felt it too. \"We're working together just fine.\" He lied and it was incredibly evident in his voice. Amelia sighed stepping away from him and crossing her arms over her chest. \"Tuck, when you asked to be friends, I assumed it meant we would be honest with each other.\" Tuck looked away feeling shamed. She knew that she was being unfair and prying again. She's hypocritical, she knew that, but she felt affronted for a reason she couldn't comprehend. \"How long ago did you and FDR get back?\" She asked suddenly. That question came to her abruptly, and she needed an answer. \"About an hour ago.\" He muttered still unable to look at her. She raised an eyebrow. \"Why didn't you come to me then?\" \"I had to do something else first.\" Amelia told herself to let it go. That it was none of her business. That she needed to stop meddling in this man's personal life, despite them being somewhat friends now. She tried to reason that he most likely had to report to Collins or something when returning. But something inside of her told her that wasn't the case and she refused to let it go. She hated herself a little for it. With a gentle hand, she cupped his cheek and forced him to look at her. Tuck's stormy eyes widened in surprise by the gesture, but he managed to look back into her chestnut eyes. \"Tuck, what were you doing?\" She asked firmly, daring him to lie to her. The agent was stubbornly quiet for a moment. \"FDR and I were checking on Lauren.\" He finally confessed. \"Checking on her?\" She started confused. Then it dawned on Amelia and she felt something tighten in her stomach. \"You… you're spying on her?\" Tuck didn't say anything and that was enough of an answer for her. Amelia recoiled her hand as if burned and stepped away from him. She was furious. Though she doesn't know Lauren and isn't entirely fond of her due to this situation, the doctor found this to be a massive invasion of the woman's privacy. She's thoroughly disgusted. \"Are you insane?\" She seethed. \"That has to be breaking so many laws!\" \"You think I don't feel horrible about it?\" He asked defensively. \"I don't like doing this, but I have—\" \"No, you don't, Tuck!\" Amelia snapped. \"You don't have to spy on someone to win their affection. It's wrong and even if you do win the girl in the end, it's going to be based on a lie.\" Tuck's eyes snapped on hers, burning with a fury. \"Oh, and you're such an expert on relationships then, Doctor?\" He swore that hadn't meant to sound so harsh. He was frustrated with the whole ordeal and he was taking it out on Amelia. She looked utterly affronted and the shame that was already boiling in his stomach grew, but he didn't apologize. He was too proud and frustrated at the moment. \"You know what?\" Amelia broke the uncomfortable silence, looking defeated. \"I don't think this friendship thing is going to work out.\" Tuck frowned deeply and he oddly felt panicked. \"We've hardly even tried. Amelia, friends have fights and—\" \"I know that.\" She interrupted sternly. \"I know how friendships work. I've had friends before—I have friends, Tuck! I just… I don't approve at all with what you are doing with Lauren. I'm forming a pretty bad judgment of your character and I know that isn't fair, but I'm sorry, I just can't do this. I have enough on my plate.\" She spoke quickly and she left the room just as swiftly, not daring to look back. Tuck watched as the door to the exam room slammed shut. Though he understood what he and FDR were doing with Lauren was quite ridiculous and out of the norm, he was beyond confused with Amelia's reaction. He didn't understand why this had such an effect on her. He thought that maybe she was right though. Maybe a friendship wasn't ever going to work between them. That left a terrible feeling in the pit of his stomach, but he ignored it. He had to ignore it. He couldn't start developing any deeper feelings for this woman, whether it be for want of a friendship or something more. He had one week to win over Lauren and that's what he'd put his attention to. Amelia cried for the first time since being told of sister's death. She had driven home tensely, apologized profusely to Martha for being late, put the girls to bed, and then climbed into her bed in the guest room (she refused to sleep in the master bedroom). She cried into the pillows. She cried until could hardly breathe anymore. She had cried when she received the phone call about Amanda's death. She had silently cried some on the plane, but the moment she stepped foot in LA, all the tears vanished and all the responsibilities of Amanda's life was put on her shoulders. The moment she stepped foot off the plan everything became about Maggie and Abby. Her uncle James took care of preparing Amanda's wake and funeral. Now it dawned on her all over again—her sister was dead and Amelia was taking over her life. It's not that Amelia minded—or rather that she didn't want to mind it. She would do anything for Amanda and the girls. But she hardly felt like herself anymore. She gave up her life for them without a second thought, and now it was beginning to take its toll on her. She supposed the ordeal with Tuck opened her eyes to it because she wanted him. Whether it was she wanted him for friendship or something more, she didn't know, but she knew that she wanted him somehow. Yet she felt the need to hold back. Even if Lauren weren't in the picture, she still wouldn't be able to be with him. She couldn't bring herself to date anyone—because who was she kidding? She would love to date Tuck—right now, and probably not for a long time. So why couldn't she even be friends with him? Despite the ordeal with FDR and Lauren, Amelia knew that Tuck was a good person. He was strong, kind, and polite. Perhaps that's why she didn't want to be friends with him. It scared her. Those butterflies that fluttered around in her stomach when he was nearby. She hardly knew him and she hoped the less she knew him that feeling in her stomach would disappear in time. He would break her heart without even meaning to, and she would break his all the same. She didn't feel like Amelia Hart anymore. She was alone and she was going to stay alone by her own stupid choice. She doesn't go to sleep until the wee hours in the morning, tears stained on her pillowcase. In the later morning, Amelia woke up by Maggie shoving at her. For a moment, she worried that they were late for school, but then she remembered that it was Saturday. She blinked a few times, Maggie's curious face becoming clearer in her view. \"Mmm. What is it, Maggie?\" She muttered, voice still drowsy with sleep. \"Aunt Amelia, it's the afternoon.\" The little girl said, sounding older to Amelia than she should. \"Oh.\" \"And Big Uncle James is on the phone.\" She continued, holding up the phone to her aunt. Amelia blinked again and took the phone. She watched Maggie scurry out of the room before sitting up on the bed and putting the phone to her ear. \"Hello?\" \"Just wake up, sweetheart?\" Her uncle James' voice was rough yet jolly when he spoke. James Hart was the brother of Amelia's mother. Despite living all the way in Texas, he's always been there for his family. Always calling to check in on them and visiting when he could take off work at the factory. When Amanda passed away, he stayed in LA with Amelia and the girls for as long as he could until he had to return to Texas to his job. Her uncle James had been a constant in Amelia's life—he helped her through deaths and devastations, and she's sure she would have shattered a long time ago if it weren't for him. \"Yeah,\" She croaked. She cleared her throat and spoke again, \"I had a pretty rough night.\" \"I know, I felt it.\" He said and Amelia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. James was a bit spiritual. He always said he could 'feel' when his family was in trouble. He had told her that when her mother died, he woke up crying. He said he did the same with Amanda. Amelia wasn't so sure how much of that she could believe, no matter how much she loved her uncle—she had never been a very 'spiritual' person. \"What happened, honey?\" Amelia ran a hand through her messy hair and tried not to sigh. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" A moment of silence passed on the other end of the line. \"Are you having man troubles?\" She groaned. \"Uncle James…\" \"Do you need me to come there?\" He asked seriously and Amelia very much knew that if she told him some guy was bothering her, he would be on the first flight to LA. \"No, uncle James, you don't need to come here. I'm just… having a personal crisis, I think.\" She responded unsure of herself. \"Tell me about it.\" He demanded in a tone that left no room for arguments. \"Uncle James, I really don't—\" \"Amelia Francesca Hart, you better start telling me what's going on or I really am coming over there.\" Amelia sighed and gave in. She told him all about her bottled up feelings on this whole ordeal with the girls, with Abby still not speaking to anyone outside herself and Maggie, with how she felt like she was taking over Amanda's life, with how she didn't much feel like herself anymore, and even a little bit about Tuck (though she completely left out the part about Lauren). She told him how the weight of it all was finally becoming too much to hold on to. \"Oh, sweetheart.\" James said solemnly from the other line. Amelia didn't know when she had started crying again, but she felt the warm tears roll down her cheeks and she couldn't stop them. \"I don't know what to do, uncle James.\" She said in a small voice, and she felt like a little child again. \"You're putting too much on your shoulders, Amelia. You don't have to give up everything to be Maggie and Abby's guardian.\" \"But I've already given up everything.\" \"Amelia, you gave up what you had in DC, and I understand how difficult that is especially considering the circumstances, but that doesn't mean you have to give up who you are or what you enjoy for the sake of the girls. That's not what Amanda would have wanted.\" He told her in a stern yet soft tone. She covered her mouth as a sob rose in her throat. She knew Amanda would be upset. She knew that if Amanda could feel anything right now, it would be regret for putting her sister through this. If Amelia could, she would tell Amanda that she didn't put her through this, that she was putting herself through it, because she didn't know how to cope. \"Have you considered going to therapy? You remember what happened after your mother passed… I had to practically force you into therapy.\" James suggested, weary to be bringing it up in the first place. He realized that his niece was in a fragile state at the moment. Amelia shook her head and wiped her eyes. \"I don't have time for therapy. I have two chil—\" \"I understand that, but you also need to take care of yourself. Throughout all of this you've only had your mind on the girls, which is good to an extent, but you can't forget about yourself, sweetheart.\" Her uncle's voice is soft, but she heard the clear worry in it as well. She practically drowned in it. Amelia rested her head in her palm and she tried to control her breathing. \"I have to go, uncle James. I have to go feed and check on the girls.\" She thought she heard him sigh deeply. \"Alright. Just consider the therapy things, okay? You're not gonna be doing those girls or yourself any good if you're having panic attacks.\" \"I will.\" \"And Amelia, you know that if you need any held, you call me. I'll drop everything in the world for you.\" James told her earnestly and she did feel a bit relieved though guilt lingered with that as well. \"I know, uncle James, thank you. I'll talk to you soon.\" After hanging up, Amelia felt a little better. Her uncle, her savior—he always managed to make her feel better when she was at her worst. She knew he made a point about her putting too much on herself. She always had. She never handled death well either. When her mother passed away, it was when she had just graduated from college. Amelia fell into a depression that nearly destroyed her career before it even began. Her uncle James came in before it became much worse and convinced her to get help. She had been put on anti-depressants and had gotten better within a year. She had put most of her focus on her career then, and eventually she was able to have a normal social life again. Amelia was beginning to feel those same effects of her mother's passing recently. She hadn't wanted to admit it. She didn't want Maggie and Abby to have a depressed person taking care of them. They deserved normality in their life. But her uncle was right—no good would come from keeping this bottled up inside. With a new resolve, Amelia got out of bed, washed up, got dressed, and head down stairs to the girls. She stopped in her tracks when she found them with Martha. \"Martha, what are you doing here?\" She asked, stepping into the dining room as he girls munched on their lunch. The babysitter smiled kindly. \"Maggie actually called me.\" Amelia was thoroughly shocked. \"She did?\" \"Yeah, come over here and have something to eat.\" Martha motioned for Amelia to join her at the island. Amelia did so with a small frown. She sat at the counter and Martha handed her a sandwich and a glass of water. The doctor silently thanked her, and before she was about to bite into her lunch, Martha spoke again. \"Maggie called me at about ten thirty this morning. She said you hadn't woken up yet and that she heard you crying last night.\" She froze up at the blonde woman's words and set her sandwich down. \"I… I'm sorry about that, Martha.\" She said meekly. She hadn't realized she cried so loud that the girls heard and a deep shame instilled in her then. She could only imagine what her nieces thought of her now. Martha gently rested her hand on Amelia's causing the younger woman to look her in the eyes. \"When my husband passed away, I fell into a terrible depression. It was bad. I had become suicidal. I almost hung myself in front of my ten year old son.\" She said in a hushed tone, mindful of the girls eating at the table close by. Amelia looked into Martha's sad cornflower blue eyes and she almost felt like crying again. \"What I'm trying to say is that this is the toughest path to go down—to lose the most important person in your life but still have all the responsibilities in the world. I'm here to help you, Amelia. You're not alone.\" Amelia was touched by Martha's words and she also felt a deep sorrow for the woman. She had no idea about this. She knew Martha was a single mother, but she had assumed it was divorce. Now the woman was opening up to her about that tragic part of her life. \"Martha,\" She stood and hugged the other woman, \"thank you so much.\" Martha hugged Amelia in return and rubbed her back soothingly. \"There's no need to thank me. I'm here to help and whenever you're feeling too pressured or overwhelmed, do not hesitate to call me.\" She said backing up and took Amelia's face into her gentle hands. \"You've got a lot of people who care about you and the girls—people who would drop everything to help you—don't be afraid to ask for help. You're not alone.\" Despite herself, Amelia tears stung in her eyes, but she smiled too. \"I'm beginning to realize that now. This has all just been… pretty hard, and I don't think I realized that until recently.\" \"Honey, I know it's difficult. I can only imagine all the things going through your mind. You weren't prepared for any of this.\" Martha reasoned touching Amelia's hair. Warmth spread within the doctor as she recognized the maternal care in Martha's eyes. \"You haven't had the time to properly grieve your sister. But you need to know that I'm not just here for the girls, I'm here for you too.\" Amelia wiped away a tear that inevitably escaped from her eye. She realized something suddenly—Martha was her best friend. She rarely received calls from her friends in DC and she understood that they were busy, but it's been radio silence for about three months now. When she first came to LA they called almost everyday to check on her and then those calls eventually faded into nothing. Martha was a constant in her life now. Always there with a kind smile and an eagerness to help. It would have been a little sad, but Amelia only saw it as a blessing. Martha was a blessing. She looked back to the girls eating and she was suddenly struck with awe. Maggie knew what to do when she saw that her aunt was in a dilemma. She took matters into her young hands and she did good—especially for an eight-year-old girl. Maggie took care of her family too, and Amelia realized that she's been a fool this whole time. She certainly wasn't in this alone—even her eight-year-old niece was very prepared to help in anyway her young self could. Though it saddened her a bit, it also made Amelia proud that Maggie knew how to take care of her family when an issue arose. Finishing off her sandwich, Amelia walked over to the girls and kissed them both on the head. \"I'm so proud of you, sweetheart.\" She whispered to Maggie. \"I love you, aunt Amelia.\" Her niece whispered back. \"I love you too.\" She was amazed how wise a child could be. I've greatly underestimated them , she thought as she exited the house and onto the back patio to make a phone call. She needed to fix something. When Tuck went to answer his phone, he was shocked to see Amelia's name on the caller ID. They had exchanged numbers the other day, but after last night he wasn't expecting to ever hear from the woman again. \"Hello?\" He answered and he knew he sounded uncertain, as if this were some mistake on her part. \"Hi, Tuck,\" came Amelia's timid voice on the other line. \"I'm not catching you at a bad time, am I?\" \"Um, no… no, you're not.\" He replied still unsure of what was happening. \"Is there something I can help you with?\" He heard her sigh. \"No. I, uh… I just wanted to apologize for last night. It was uncalled for and I was out of line. I'm sure I seem like a complete crazy person to you. I'm just in a really bad place right now. My… my sister passed away five months ago.\" \"Amelia,\" he interrupted, \"you don't have to tell me anything.\" \"It's okay.\" She said softly. \"I want to tell you.\" For some reason, that sent a thrill up Tuck's spine. Not over the news that she was going to tell him, but because Amelia trusted him enough to open up to him about a tragic part of her life. He sat on his couch and settled. \"Alright.\" He said for her to continue. Amelia was silent for a long moment on the other end. Tuck thought that she may have changed her mind, but in a soft tone again, she spoke, \"My sister and her husband died in a car accident five months ago. I moved here to LA from DC because they named me their children's guardian in their will. It's been… it's been very difficult for me. I love my nieces, but I just… I feel unfit to be their mother, not that I'm trying to be. I feel unfit to take care of them.\" She poured out suddenly and Tuck felt sorry for her. He hadn't realized how much that affected her and he felt like a fool to think that it didn't. \"I've been beginning to see how much this is affecting me in such negative ways. I've been keeping all of these emotions bottled up and last night I think was the boiling point for me, and I am so sorry I took it out on you.\" \"It's alright,\" was his automatic reply. Though he had been upset over the ordeal, Tuck found that he had already forgiven her and that he was never really angry to begin with. \"No, Tuck, it's not alright. It wasn't fair of me and I shouldn't have done it.\" She sounded upset with herself and Tuck wanted that to stop. He didn't want Amelia to be upset over this—it was so unimportant compared to everything else she's going through. \"Um, if… if you would still like to be friends, I would like that. Though I feel it's fair to warn you that I'm a mess and I'm still grieving. I can't promise… that something like last night won't happen again. And I'd completely understand if you didn't want to start all over again with me.\" There was a short silence then. Tuck honestly had no idea what to say. She had opened up to him about her troubles. She was then apologizing to him about her behavior, but wasn't asking for forgiveness. And she wasn't making any promises, but she still wanted to be friends. There was something small in the back of his mind telling him to let Amelia go—that she wasn't worth the time and effort, and he needed to keep his mind on Lauren. He spoke without thinking, \"Of course I still want to be your friend, Amelia. Like I said last night, friends get into fights. As far as I'm concerned, the friendship never ended.\" Tuck thought he heard her sigh in relief, but he smiled when he was sure he heard her laugh softly. \"Thank you, Tuck.\" \"There's no need to thank me.\" \"I'll see you on Monday, Tuck. And once again, I'm sorry.\" \"Please, stop apologizing.\" He demanded kindly. \"I will see you on Monday, love. Take care of yourself.\" \"I'll certainly try to.\" A/N: Well, my friends, I certainly apologize for the lateness in this update! But here, I gave you a bit of a longer chapter than the previous chapters... and some drama! And don't worry there will be plenty of more drama in the coming chapters. I'm afraid to say that I don't know how long it will take me to update, because I'm going to be going on vacation this coming week and I have the next chapter only somewhat halfway finished. But hang in there! I am not giving up on this story. Please, feel free to review-feedback is wonderful and helps motivate me! Oh! And looky-looky, I've given this story a cover photo!

Monday came along with Amelia feeling refreshed and relaxed. Over the weekend she had spoken with her uncle James via telephone, spent time with the girls and even Martha, had contacted a good therapist that Martha had suggested, and she even exchanged some texts with Tuck. It was nice, but she very well knew that it didn't mean everything was better. She still had a long way to go. And she would survive this. She promised herself that she would for her girls and for herself. So she walked into HQ today with her held high and smile gracing her red polished lips. \"Dr. Hart!\" Amelia swiftly turned, her high ponytail slapping her cheek as she did so. Her smile grew when Agent Maria Vega greeted her. Maria was a Latina agent standing at a short five foot three inches. Though the other woman was only an inch taller than Amelia, the doctor was quite sure the woman before her could destroy half—maybe even most—of the male agents who weighed twice as much as her. But Maria was one of the nicest people that she's met here. \"Agent Vega, how can I help you today?\" \"How many times do I have to tell you to call me Maria?\" The agent asked amused. \"Only a few more hundred times. Give me a break, I'm still getting used to working with CIA agents.\" Amelia replied, grinning. Maria shook her head. \"You're so professional. Don't worry, we'll wear you down at some point.\" She joked, patting Amelia on the shoulder. \"Look, I'm going to be doing a self defense session Wednesday night if you're interested. It'll mainly be the newer trainees and non-agents there so we'll be going a slow beginners pace.\" Amelia considered it and nodded. \"I'll see if I can get the babysitter to watch the girls late that day and I'll let you know tomorrow.\" \"Alright, sounds good. I really hope that you can make it. I'll see you around.\" With that, the two women went their separate ways. Amelia didn't stay in her office for long today. She was in Medical mostly, taking care of injured agents until her lunch break. She had wanted to stay and continue working, but Dr. Rosenburg—or rather, Henry was what he told her to start calling him—practically forced her out of HQ to fetch something to eat. She was nearly out the door when someone called out to her. Her smile was instant at the sight of Tuck hastily walking over to her. \"Hello, Tuck.\" She greeted, wondering if she looked as happy as she felt. Tuck was practically grinning from ear to ear. \"Good afternoon, Amelia. Where are you off to?\" \"Oh, I'm off for lunch. Kinda sick of cafeteria food so I'm heading out to find a place.\" She explained as she tried desperately not to ogle him. She found that black t-shirt to be deliciously fitting on him, and she was mildly mortified to have such a thought about him. You are hot-blooded woman, Amelia Hart. You are allowed to notice when there is an attractive male before you. She mentally scolded herself. \"It's a good thing I caught you then. I was about to have lunch as well. Would you like to join me? I could show you some good spots.\" He suggested. \"That sounds great, actually.\" She replied not missing a beat. Normally she would have hesitated but she didn't quite want to do that anymore. \"Lovely,\" Tuck replied and held the door open for her. \"After you, doctor.\" Amelia laughed softly, nodding her thanks. They ended up walking to this deli Tuck suggested. It was only a few blocks away from HQ; though she still felt a dull ache in her high heel donned feet. They talked about a lot of things over their sandwiches and drinks. Currently the topic was their children. \"So, now Maggie wants to play soccer and sign ups are next week.\" Amelia conversed and sipped on her water. \"That sounds like an excellent idea to me. Sports are good for kids.\" Tuck responded, taking the last bite of his sandwich. \"I know that. I'm… I'm still reluctant though.\" She admitted and he raised his scarred eyebrow. \"Why's that?\" He asked after he swallowed his last bite. \"Because… this is going to sound silly, but with my schedule, I'd miss all or most of her games. I don't want her to be that kid whose parents aren't at the game.\" That sounded strange to her own ears, because she knew damn well that Maggie's parents never actually would attend one of her games. A deep frown suddenly settled on her face and Tuck immediately noticed. Gently, he rested his hand atop hers and her eyes snapped on his. He smiled softly. \"In the end, that's not what it's about. In the end it's about the children and them maintaining some normalcy.\" He explained. \"It's wonderful when we're able to attend, the kids love it, but even when we can't be there, they'll still be children having a good time. There's no need to stress over it, your kids are still going to love you and enjoy themselves.\" Amelia actually smiled, feeling more relaxed now. The feeling of sadness and regret faded away swiftly. \"You're right.\" She agreed. He patted her hand. \"I know that I am.\" \"Oh, now don't be modest, Tuck.\" She joked, a grin playing at her lips. \"Does Joe play any sports?\" \"Yes. Karate.\" He answered downing some of his iced tea. \"Ah, a fighting young man, huh?\" \"He tries to be. He definitely tries to be.\" Tuck sighed and Amelia frowned, looking at him imploringly. \"His… his coach is a bit of a whacko. Honestly, he's too intense for seven year olds. I know that he's built for it, but he holds back a lot. He let's people overpower him.\" \"Why do you think he does that?\" She asked, head tilted slightly to the side. Tuck scratched his brow. \"I suppose it's because I do it.\" \"You do it?\" Amelia questioned skeptically. She found it hard to believe that Tuck allowed anyone to overpower him. \"It would be out of the norm for a travel agent to beat the crap out of anyone who messed with them.\" He replied, chuckling softly. She felt sorry for him. Yes, this was part of the job—needing to lie to protect the people around him, but she imagined it was stressful for him to be someone he wasn't, and to watch it affect his son. \"Alright, lunch break is almost over.\" Tuck's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. \"Best we start heading back.\" Amelia nodded in agreement, rising from her seat and grabbing her wallet so she could pay for her meal. Tuck's hand on her wrist stopped her. \"I already paid for it.\" \"You what? Oh, Tuck, you didn't have to do that.\" She admonished, putting her wallet back into her bag. \"It's in my nature, love.\" He replied shrugging. \"Fine, but next time I'm paying for you.\" She told him firmly as they began their trek back to HQ. He grinned cheekily. \"Don't know if I can allow that, dear.\" \"Oh, you'll allow it, darling . Otherwise, you'll have to deal with an angry doctor, and trust me, we can certainly be deadly.\" Tuck laughed and she frowned at him. \"Don't laugh! We're experts on the human body. You'd be surprised with how many ways we know how to hurt a person.\" \"Should I be worried about you, Dr. Hart?\" He asked in a serious tone, but there was mirth in his eyes. Amelia smiled slyly, suddenly feeling much better than she had in a long while. \"You just might have to be.\" \"You enjoy lunch, Tuck?\" Tuck glanced over to FDR as he entered the office and went to sit at his own desk. His partner was leaned back in his chair, feet propped up on his desk. There was an expression mixed of sourness and amusement on his face. He raised a scarred brow at him. \"Yes, it was nice.\" He replied warily. FDR nodded not saying anything else for a long moment. Still confused, Tuck started up his computer and prepared to work. \"And how about the good doctor, did she enjoy her lunch?\" Tuck tensed instantly and brought his attention back on his partner. FDR and Tuck stated each other down. Bright blue eyes and stormy ones bored harshly into each other. Neither said anything and the room turned into a dead silence. It was FDR who spoke. \"So, does this mean you're finished with Lauren?\" \"Just because I had lunch with a friend doesn't mean I no longer want to be with Lauren.\" Tuck replied in a steely tone. \"I thought Dr. Hart didn't want any non-professional relationships.\" \"Perhaps she said that so you would back off. You have that issue—not backing off.\" FDR's jaw clenched. \"It seems you have that issue too.\" The two men glared at each other. It was plain to see they were going against their own rules of this 'Gentleman's Agreement', though they were hardly following it to begin with. They both realized that, and they both knew they were in too deep at this point. They both cared about Lauren too much to give up. So, with nothing else to say, the two grumbled and went back to work. A/N: Sincerest apologies for the wait and the shortness of this chapter, my lovely readers! Honestly, this turned into a filler chapter. I planned on doing more with it-like I was planning on doing another Amelia and FDR scene, but what I had planned for that just didn't seem to make sense with how I intend to go with this story. I do promise that the next chapter will be longer and it will be more meaningful! Also, after I posted the last chapter I edited it a bit and stated that James Hart's faceclaim is Jeff Bridges . And to answer one of guest reviewers, you're right, I never did give faceclaims to Amanda or her husband. Amanda would actually be Nora Zehetner (look at her and Rachel Bilson and tell me that they couldn't play siblings!), and her husband Richard I was thinking Ryan Kwanten . Oh yes! And I can't forget the new character I've introduced, Maria Vega. Her faceclaim is Colombian actress Danna García . Disclaimer : I do not own This Means War or any of it's characters.

It was a rainy night in Detroit Michigan ,Adam and I had a Vampire Date Night "},{"Movie":"This Means War","Title":"Immune to Me","Author":"LadyHawk98","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10266597","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This Mean War I'm wearing a tight form fitting black dress and I'm not exactly happy about it. One reason is the lack of movement I have in this dress which, given my occupation, can mean life or death. On top of that I'm wearing high heels which further hinder my abilities. My boss doesn't seem to care. She told me I am strictly to be eye candy on this mission. I've been called many names \"bitch\" seems to be the most popular one out of them all, but I have never once been called \"eye candy.\" I was raised to be the best and my father expected a lot from me him being one of the best agents the CIA has ever seen. I hope to follow in his footsteps. My training contains a lot of martial arts jujitsu being my favorite. I am also one of the best snipers the CIA has seen. My knife throwing skills are decent, but nowhere near where I want them to be at. I can speak 7 languages and read and comprehend 10. I am also a good researcher, but the computer things some of the tech guys have shown me are totally foreign. I hear some static coming from my ear piece \"Mission is a go. I repeat you are good to go\" I hear Collins, my boss, say. I turn and scan the crowd for my team members. I spot them talking to some women with way too much makeup and not enough clothing on. Its typical behavior for FDR, but my heart sinks as I see Tuck flirting with one of the women. My father taught me that emotions were a spy's downfall and I have a foolish attachment to Tuck Henson. I quickly suck up my feelings as I hear a helicopter land. I walk to my position at the bar near the opening to the helicopter pad. I order a random girlie drink to keep up with my act even though I despise girlie drinks. My job is to distract the younger brother, Jonas. He has a reputation of being a playboy and I fully intend on exploiting that reputation. I get my drink and turn just as the two brothers enter the room. I flip my long brown hair over my shoulder and give him a seductive smile paired with a flirty finger wave. Naturally Jonas starts to think with the brain that isn't in his head and starts to walk toward me. It was going according to plan, but his brother grabbed his shoulder and whispered something in his ear in German. I effortlessly translated it to \"stop thinking with your dick. We have a job to do.\" I smile and try not to laugh. \"But she is so beautiful\" \"So we can pick her up on our way out.\" Pick me up? Was I just some prostitute? Jonas turns to me and says \"I will be back later. I promise.\" His accent is very good and his English surprisingly not bad. I put on my best pouty face \"Alright I guess I can wait a little while longer.\" He gives me what I guess is supposed to be a sexy smirk, but it ends up making him look like he is in pain. I turn around and give an eye roll. \"You are doing great.\" I hear Tuck say in his sexy British accent. \"We aren't supposed to be communicating over the system Tuck. Collins's orders.\" \"Yeah I know, but you look like you need encouragement.\" \"Yeah Izzy. I'm surprised that you haven't punched Jonas in the face.\" FDR chimes in. \"Can we talk about this later guys?\" \"Aww come on Iz quit being a goodie two shoes.\" \"I am not a goodie two shoes Franklin .\" \"Hey that was uncalled for.\" He always gets touchy when I use his real name instead of FDR. \"Are you kids finished? Cuz last time I checked you guys were on a mission.\" Collins interrupted. I scan the room and see FDR and Tuck look like a child being scolded and I'm pretty sure I look the same way. \"Yes ma'am.\" We all say in unison. All of a sudden gun shots are fired. \"Shots fired. I repeat shots fired. Five men down.\" Collins says as Tuck and FDR get into position. I spot Jonas and I try to lure him a way with a smile and a tug of his arm as he walks my way. It works for a moment, but Karl stops him and says in German \"just take her with you!\" Jonas nods \"come on lets go.\" He takes my hand and leads me to the helicopter \"where are we going?\" I ask trying to keep up with the ditzy girl façade. \"Someplace other than here\" he replies in English laced with a rough German accent. Forget the façade. I yank my hand out of his grip \"I am not going with you.\" This is when he gets forceful. He grabs my arm hard and yanks me toward the door. Jonas is stronger than I am and with the dress and shoes on I can hardly keep up let alone fight him, but I still try. I yank and pull only getting him angrier. He pulls harder and I almost fall, but my dress rips. I stamp the heel of my stiletto into his foot causing him to cry out and let go. I quickly shuffle away and that when all hell breaks loose.[Chapter 2] Alright I want to thanks to musicluver246 for following my story. This is my first ever story so please be gentle. I would really enjoy comment and constructive criticism as long as it nice and not rude. Also I may not be able to publish stories that often due to high school. I run and get behind the bar cursing silently cursing Collins \"no problem my ass.\" I mumble under my breath. All I brought with me was a knife. Then I get a bright idea. If there was a meeting the Japanese people had to have packed some heat when dealing with the Heinrich brothers. I attempt to make a run for it, but Jonas comes after me. I guess almost breaking his foot wasn't a big enough sign that I was just not that into him. He grabs my wrist yanking me back. Damn heels. I quickly throw an elbow back, but he catches it. Again he pulls me toward the helicopter and succeeds in getting me close. \"Isabelle!\" I hear Tuck yell as he jumps up taking aim at Jonas \"Let he go.\" \"Make any move pretty boy and I will end her\" Jonas growls jamming his gun in my temple. \"Tuck take the shot\" I say calmly because we both knew if he took me it wouldn't end well at all, but he doesn't listen. Jonas chuckles pulling me back into the helicopter, but I notice that the other door is open so once he is teetering on the edge I throw my body toward him making him fall on the ground on the other side of the helicopter , the side closer to the roof's edge. I kick him as he tries to get up and throw a punch knocking him down. I reach down and try to free myself from my heels, but the clasps won't give. Jonas seizes the opportunity to grab my arm and throw me out of the helicopter and over the edge. I manage to grab on and hold myself up. Karl steps to the edge and hands Jonas the gun that he dropped in our struggle \"shoot her\" he orders in german. This is the only moment that fear seemed to grip at me as I stare down the barrel of a gun hanging fifty stories in the air. I close my eyes expecting a gun shot and my life to be over, but I hear a struggle and see a flash of two men who mean the most to me (one more than the other). Tuck is beating up Jonas as FDR grabs my arm helping me up. Tuck punches Jonas in the face really hard. Jonas looses balance grabbing the ripped fabric in my dress and FDR's suit pocket. My dress fabric was already compromised and ripped off in his hand. FDR's suit pocket couldn't handle Jonas's body weight and his pocket rips as well. I drop onto the ground and make a grab for Jonas's arm trying to prevent him from a horrible fifty story drop, but I am too late and I watch him as he drops. I stand and brush myself off and take inventory. Few cuts and bruises nothing to serious my dress is torn and my heels are surprisingly still here. I reach down grabbing the ripped fabric in both of my hands and pull ripping the dress up to my upper thigh so I can walk freely. Tuck and FDR both give me a weird look \"What you try wearing this dress. Now hold still.\" I grab FDR's shoulder and take off my right heel and then I alternate to Tuck and take off my left heel. I chuck them off somewhere in the mess. FDR looks down \"Heinrich is not going to be happy.\" \"I'm more concerned about the boss\" Tuck replies \"I have to agree with Tuck on that one\" We all make our way to the exit \"Isabelle I am impressed\" FDR says to me \"Impressed with what exactly?\" \"You had Jonas on the hook from the first time you flashed a smile at him\" he states. \"So?\" \"So Izzy? Your power over men never ceases to amaze me.\" Tuck chimes in \"Yeah, but it seems that you are immune to me.\" I mumble \"What did you say?\" \"Oh nothing\" but FDR heard what I said and gives me a sympathetic look. \"Hey I wonder if those girls are still here\" he says changing the subject Tuck just shakes his head and I give him a look \"yeah I thought so too.\"[Chapter 3] Thanks to , Aroara Moon, BlueEyedGunSlinger, Dominic19832002, Mimaligirl2012, Mrs. Hanes, Ms Saxobeat, Nicole0930, PhoenixUnicorn115, TheNinthSaint, andrea1234, back2vintage, bug813, charlottekerr25, kinkymistress87, luna-auroraqueenofthenorth, obbbid, , xMidnightLilliex for following my story I never expected so many people to like it. I apologize for not updating life has been pretty hectic and I only get a certain amount of time on my laptop. I only had time to drop my bags off and take a shower at my apartment then back to HQ. I meet FDR and Tuck at the door and we ride the elevator up together. \"Maybe Collins isn't upset at us at all.\" FDR says nervously I just gave him a look we all knew better than that. \"Yeah she is pissed.\" he mummers we walk out as the elevator door open. We make it to the middle off the vast room of CIA workers when we hear Collins \"Tuck, Isabelle, FDR\" we all look up and sure enough Collins is on the balcony. She jerks her thumb back which means she wants to see us in her office… great. We all go and sit like three kids in the principal's office. Tuck is on my right, FDR on my left, and I'm in the middle. \"Six men in the morgue. A body in the middle of the street.\" \"Yes \" piped up Tuck \"but we did mange to…\" \"Shut up.\" Collins interrupted \"That's me shutting up now\" I pat his hand, but that sent a storm of butterflies in my stomach racing so I quickly placed my hands in my lap. Collins glared at us \"the mission parameters of the Heinrich case were clearly indicated to be covert.\" She throws down a picture of Jonas in the street spectators surrounding him. \"Thanks to you three geniuses. Heinrich will be seeking revenge for his brother's death. You guys are grounded.\" Grounded. I stare at her shocked \"What!\" I glance at Tuck and FDR \"Grounded?\" Tuck groans and puts his head in his hands. FDR just stares like and idiot and I throw my head back a sigh. So we go to our shared office and sit there. I start to tap my feet, FDR joins with tapping pencils, and Tuck spins his gun on his desk. I feel my phone vibrate and I look to see a text from my best friend, Lauren, asking if we could hang out. Thankful for the distraction I quickly escaped this boring office to hang with my best friend. I head to our favorite sushi place, well its actually her favorite place because I despise sushi. The idea of eating raw fish that has the potential to give you a parasite has never had a really big appeal to me. I enter the shop and sit down at our usual spot and seconds later Lauren walks in and from the look of her she has been at the gym. She seemed upset though. She rushes over and sit down I open my mouth to ask what's wrong, but she beats me to the punch. \"I just saw Steve and I said peace as I walked away. I totally want to die right now.\" I try to console her and I was interrupted yet again by the one and only asshole known as Steve as he walks in and sits down next to us with another girl and seeing the huge rock on her finger I assume she is his fiancé. \"This is too funny. Oh this is probably for your boyfriend Ken\" I look over at the guy who usually served us and his name tag read \"Ken.\" Man I need to teach her how to lie better. \"No, Sushi for one always for one.\" I glare at him and he quickly went back to making sushi. The rest of the meal went without a hitch except for when Steve and his fiancé start to make out which almost makes me throw up. I mean who makes out after eating raw fish? Lets just say that I have never seen Lauren eat sushi faster in my life. I felt bad for her and I really wanted to kill Steve for what he did to her. When she was finished we went to her place so that she could change before having an emergency girls meeting but unfortunately Trish had to go grocery shopping so we went to the supermarket with her. \"Ugh! It was the most humiliating moment ever.\" \"Your problem\" I tell her \"is that you need to learn how to lie better.\" \"Yeah, you should have said 'I have a fiancé to but he's not here since he has surgery for a penile reduction scheduled for today because his penis is so big that it lands a poltergeist.\" \"That's a little extreme and it doesn't really make sense Trish\" I tell her \"The problem is that I can't think of anything when I see him. I just can't believe I gave up everything for him. I just feel so stupid! I mean I left my friends and my family-\" \"Don't say that\" Trish interrupted \"We are happy that you moved here. We all have a very happy life together.\" Lauren just sighs \"I just thought that he was my person.\" I rub her back \"We both thought he was your person, but he turned out to be an ass.\" \"You need to get back out there Lauren.\" Trish adds \"Hey I'm dating.\" \"No you aren't.\" she glares at me but she knows that I am right. \"Hey you know what you need to do!\" Trish exclaims and we both give her puzzled looks \"Join a dating website!\" Lauren groans \"Again with the dating website!\" \"Actually its not a bad idea\" \"Well if you join with me I will. I mean you need to date other men and stop pining over that coworker of yours\" I lightly hit her \"I do not pine!\" Trish and Lauren give me a look \"I don't and to prove it I will join the website\" \"Yay!\" Lauren squeals. What did I just get myself into?[Chapter 4] musicluver246, kinkymistress87, back2vintage, obbbid, PhoenixUnicorn115, xMidnightLilliex,charlottekerr25, Aroara Moon, andrea1234 ,luna-auroraqueenofthenorth ,TheNinthSaint ,bug813 ,Dominic19832002 ,Nicole0930 ,Mimaligrl2012 ,Ms Saxobeat ,BlueEyedGunSlinger , , Mrs. Haynes ,Heartless-Princess33 ,LucienCaesar ,FabFiction15. Thanks everyone listed for following my story I really didn't expect so many people to like it. I also enjoy all the reviews and I would appreciate more! It's been a few days since I created a profile on that stupid dating site and I have yet to hear if Lauren kept up her end of the bargain. I realize that in doing this all of my personal imformation is out in the open which can be a really big disaster especially in my line of work, but I could handle myself. I went to my room to get changed into some workout clothes when my phone buzzed in the back pocket of my jeans. I take my phone out and saw that FDR was calling me. \"Hello?\" \"Hey Issy I was just wondering if you could come with Tuck and I to my Nana's.\" \"Your Nana's?\" \"Yeah we are having a little family get together.\" \"I don't know FDR I wouldn't want to intrude. I mean if it's for family\" \"Isabelle stop that you are one of my best friends you practically are my family now get ready and we will pick you up soon.\" FDR hangs up before I could even reply to that statement. Truthfully I was always uncomfortable when I went to FDR's Nana's house. He has such a big family and they are all so loving and growing up I never had that. My father was cold and calculating he never shared or showed his feelings. My mother was the opposite, but she left me with my father. She told me I was \"to much of a burden.\" I could tell her leaving him hurt my father and after that he always treated me differently keeping me at arm's length. So having so many people being all caring and saying \"I love you\" makes me feel smothered. I get ready as I was told to do letting my hair down from its braid giving it soft pretty waves. I decide to wear a sea foam green sundress since all I usually wear are pant suits or pencil skirts so something less professional and more fun was just what I needed. I applied some makeup but not much just the basic eyeliner and mascara. An hour later I hear my apartment intercom buzz which told me that FDR was here. I quickly grab my purse and slip into some flats as I opened the door and locking it behind me. In minutes we were on our way. When we arrived we walked straight to the table that Tuck was saving with us. Seeing him in his brown sweater with the sleeves rolled up made my heart beat a little faster. I hated the way my body reacts when I see him and if I could control it I could. My heart seemed to have its own agenda and started beating faster especially when he noticed us and his blue eyes sparkled as he smiled at us. This terrified me even more because the last time I felt this way something awful happened. Even though I realize that Tuck is nothing like him I still feel a little scared. We head over to the table and on the way FDR grabs some cake. We sit down \"Thanks for having me at your Nana's\" Tuck says \"Yeah thanks.\" \"Are you kidding me? You two are my best friends we are family.\" FDR then takes a bite of his cake and groans \"Oh my god. This is gluten free here have a taste\" holding the fork out to me and I take a bite and it was surprisingly good. Then FDR's grandpa walks up and says to me \"What is a beautiful young woman like you sitting around with two losers when you could be dancing with me?\" \"You know I was just asking myself that question.\" I smile and take his outstretched hand \"Hey.\" FDR and Tuck say in unison. I just look back and smile at them. It was a slow dance nothing special and the song quickly ended as I went to sit back down I see that FDR's grandpa and nana go off to dance. I sit down and notice that Tuck had a dreamy look on his face and I was wondering what he was thinking about when FDR interrupted with \"it's kinda gross when they kiss.\" I roll my eyes at him \"Hey Mr. Deep-In- Thought you wanna talk about it?\" \"I was just-. That kind of thing's lovely isn't it? It's really lovely.\" I look over at FDR and see that he was just as confused as I was. \"What's lovely?\" I ask \"I love the way they look into each other's eyes like that\" \"I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.\" FDR replies. I punch his arm \"you are so unromantic.\" Tuck looked a little hurt at that comment \"Okay. You asked me a serious question didn't you?\" \"Yeah\" \"well you want a serious answer?\" FDR and I nodded \"Put down the cake.\" \"Alright cake is down.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Alright talk to us.\" I tell Tuck. \"Okay I trust you both. I know you guys will do anything for me. You guy will take a bullet for me. I would for you both as well, you know that right? Can you imagine what that would be like with a woman?\" I leaned back in my chair \"And what does that make me?\" \"Oh come on Issy you know what I mean?\" \"Obviously I don't\" I grab my purse and storm off only to realize that FDR drove me here. \"Dammit\" I mumble as I pull out my phone to call a cab. On my way home I realize that I over reacted a little but the idea of Tuck being like that with another woman made my blood boil. I arrive home soon after and walk up the side walk searching for my keys when I notice a bouqet of roses on my door step. I pick up and open the envelope addressed to me. There was only one word Soon.[Chapter 5] Thanks to all of the people who have followed this story. I know that I don't post new chapters all that often and I apologize for that. I would also appreciate some rates and reviews if it isn't too troublesome. I just want to remind anyone that I am not an experienced writer so there may be some mistakes and I apologize in advance for them. *Warning Language gets pretty intense* I sit on my couch and stare at the bouquet of red roses that now lay on my coffee table. My hand shakes as I reach to pick up the note that one little word causing ice to course through my veins. There was no mistaking who the note was from. It's from my ex, Dylan. His handwriting was unmistakable, but his reason behind it was completely unknown to me. You see the last time I saw Dylan was when I stabbed him in the back both figuratively and literally. Dylan and I were partners. It was my first mission as a full fledge agent. We were to pose as a married couple and get close to Anthony Rijn and his wife Helen. Anthony Rizzoli was the head of the Rijn family, a notorious mafia that was trafficking drugs and illegal weapons into the New York area. The mission went off with a without a hitch and we took down the Rijn family, but along the way we became involved. At first the relationship was great it was the first time that I have ever felt loved and coming from an affectionless childhood it was a pretty big deal for me. If I had to describe our relationship I would describe it as perfect. His love grew to the point of obsession. He became possessive, jealous he started to hate me just as much as he loved me. I didn't realize how toxic the relationship was until the night he accused me of looking at another man. \" I wasn't looking at him I swear!\" I pleaded with him. I have never seen him this angry before \"I would never do that!\" \" Don't lie to me!\" he roared and I flinched as he grabbed my arm tightly. \"I saw you looking at him you little whore!\" he yelled in my face. That's when I got angry \"I am not a whore! If you see that waiter as a threat then that's your problem! Don't take your insecurities out on me!\" I didn't see his fist strike me but one moment I was yelling and the next I was on the ground clutching my cheek seeing dots. I was too stunned to react, but Dylan didn't stop there he pulled me off the ground by my hair and shoved me up against the wall causing me to slam my head against it. His hand wrapped around my neck and he squeezed. \" Don't you ever fucking talk to me like that again you understand me? Ever.\" His breath was hot against my cheek and his voice was low, barley a whisper. I knew that he was a violent man I've seen him beat men senseless before, but never did I think that he would ever do that to me. Dylan relaxed his hand and I dropped to the ground clutching my neck and gasping for breath. I knew I needed to get out I just didn't know how. On my last solo mission I had to find a mole. One of our agents was selling secrets to Iran and Russia and my orders were to find an intercept him, but if things got hairy to eliminate the threat. Going deep undercover I realized it was Dylan. So I set up a fake meeting convincing him that I was an interested buyer and he bought it. We met at an old abandoned warehouse cliché I know but it was private. I arrived early and concealed myself in the shadows. Soon after Dylan came in searching for his \"potential buyer.\" I will always remember his face as I stepped out of the shadows. \" Isabelle what are you doing here?\" His voice was a dangerous whisper a sign that he was pissed. I learned to read emotions fast so I can prepare for his fits of anger. Normally I would have flinched, but I was in charge I had the power and that is when I made up my mind to do what I had to. To get out of this relationship permanently. \" The question is Dylan what are you doing selling our secrets to rival governments?\" I circled around him like a predator does his prey. \" That's none of your damn business!\" He was arrogant and kept his back to me as I stood behind him. He believed that I wouldn't do anything and in any other situation I wouldn't, but I was desperate and so I took a knife out of its sheath and plunge it down in his back to the hilt. I left him there to die. I actually thought I killed him, but I was wrong and this note was the only evidence of my failure. Now he would get his revenge how I didn't know but I know that he will keep his promise. I grabbed the bouquet ignoring the thorns digging into my palms and shoved them down the garbage disposal. Once the last stem was ground up I felt a little better but not much. I was stressing out about what to do when my computer binged. I realized that I never shut it off and it was still logged on to my dating profile. Since it's already up I decided to check it out just to see who I was matched with. I scroll through my potentials and right at the top is Tuck. My heart squeezed at that sight. \"If only.\" I mumble as I scroll down again. There were some pretty interesting guys, but none that really caught my eye. There was a small ping alerting me that I have a message. James: Hey just wanted to know if you would like to go out some time. I look at the profile picture and the man was attractive. He was your All American boy type: Blonde hair, Blue eyes, strong jaw, thin lips, and a straight nose. I checked out his profile. James Hall, 32 years old, 6'3\", Interests are football, long walks, dogs, and girls who aren't afraid to speak their mind. \"He seems interesting.\" I open my company laptop and type in James name and information to the CIA security database. My phone buzzed a second later. \"Agent Connors, verification code Alpha, Charlie, 81926.\" A complete background check pops up onto the screen. James wasn't on America's most wanted list, but he wasn't exactly a choir boy either. I was sitting there contemplating on wheither I should say yes or no. I scroll up to reply when I saw Tuck's picture again. I hit reply. Isabelle: Saturday sound good? The reply came two minutes later James: Sounds great! I'll pick you up at 7. I take one last look at Tuck picture. \"Can't wait on you forever.\"[Chapter 6] I am so sorry for the wait just been in kind of a funk lately. Hopefully you will enjoy. Leave me some reviews please! James told me to dress up since he's taking me to a nice restaurant so I put on a form fitting floor length red dress, curled my long brown hair and pinned it to where it cascades down my left shoulder, applied dramatic eye makeup and apply red lipstick. I slip on my black stilettos which added 4 inches to my height making me 5'6\". I check my phone and see that I have some text messages from Tuck all of them apologizing for earlier. I send him a text. Don't be sorry. I overreacted. The intercom to my apartment buzzed so I toss my phone on my bed and run to answer it. I push the speaker button. \"Hello?\" \"Hi, is this Isabelle Connors?\" \"Yes this is she.\" \"Hey Isabelle this is James.\" \"Oh. Hi yeah I'll be right down.\" I grab my purse and I run to grab my phone. I lock up my apartment and head down stairs to meet James. I get down stairs and I see James and thank the lord he looks exactly like his profile picture. He smiles when he sees me and I notice that he has dimples. \"Hey you must be Isabelle.\" \"As a matter of fact I am and can I just say that I am happy to see that you didn't lie on your profile.\" \"Oh God trust me I know how that feels.\" He rolls his eyes and rocks back on his heels \"Well shall we go?\" he asks kind of shyly. My reaction is to smile at him and say \"we shall.\" We arrive at the restaurant and we got seated immediately. He was trying to impress me, but I saw him slip the hostess some money. Still it's the thought that counts I guess. I have never been here so James helps me order. The waiter writes it down and leaves us to our own devices. \"So what do you do?\" James asks suddenly \"I sing actually\" I take a sip of wine and continue \"on a cruise ship actually.\" \"Wow that has to be exciting.\" I smile and take another drink. \"It is actually. I get to travel to all different places. Meet new people. I love it\" I sigh and look at my hands \"it does have its downsides though.\" A look of concern crosses his face. \"What do you mean?\" \"It's just with traveling you don't really get to have friends or really have any roots. I mean I haven't had a chance to really see L.A. Whenever I get off one ship I then get on another. It's actually really tiring.\" I look away until James touches my hand that is lying on the table. He looks like he is about to say something, but then his phone buzzes. \"Excuse me\" he says as he looks at his phone \"I got to go make a call.\" \"That's okay go ahead.\" I smile and wave for him to go. As soon as he is gone I blow out a sigh. I set my elbows on the table and I take in my surroundings. It really is a nice place. \"My my you always did look good in red\" a voice said behind me. My heart drops as I hear him. I never thought I would especially in the state I left him in. \"Dylan.\" I growl as he sits in the seat James was occupying only a few moments ago. \"Isabelle it's been a long time.\" He smiles as he places the napkin on his lap. \"Not long enough and what do you think you're doing?\" He holds his hands out as if it was completely obvious. \"I'm eating with an old friend.\" He says as innocently as he can. I stand up and lean in \"We are not friends.\" I growl at him. I then hear the familiar cocking of a gun. My eyes widen as I look into his. \"Sit down Isabelle.\" Since I didn't bring my gun I comply with his request. \"good girl.\" \"Don't talk to me like I am a dog.\" I seethe at one time I was afraid of this man, but not anymore. Even if he has a gun pointed at me. Dylan wasn't expecting my hostility. I guess he thought that I was the love sick girl that I use to be. Truthfully I still am, but I'm no longer love sick over him. \"I've never seen you as a dog Isabelle. You are much too pretty for that.\" I roll my eyes as he leans back in his chair surveying me. \"I forgot just how beautiful you were.\" His voice was softer as if he wasn't really speaking you me, but to himself. \"Just tell me what you want Dylan.\" I was starting to get a little scared. Dylan did not seem like the man that he used to be. He looks imbalanced like the smallest thing could make him snap. \"Don't you see Issy?\" he looks at me almost pleadingly \"I want you back. I love you more than anything.\" He grabs my hand with his and holds on like I'm the only thing keeping him here. That is when it hit me and I start to panic a little. He is desperate and from experience I know that desperate men do desperate and dangerous things. I try to pull my hand away, but he grips tighter. I could feel the bones in my hands grind against each other. I grit my teeth hiding the pain. \"You had your chance Dylan. Actually you had a lot of chances. I loved you more than anything, but you betrayed me and our country.\" I yank my hand out of his grasp and flex it a little. I stand and turn to walk away when he grabs my arm. \"You are mine Isabelle. Don't you ever forget that.\" He growls. I yank my arm away and get in his face \"I am not a piece of property. I am a human being that can make her own decisions.\" \"Well you are going to regret this one.\" \"The only thing I regret is not making sure that you were dead.\" I walk off and this time Dylan lets me. I know that this isn't the last time that I was going to see or hear from him. I realize that James drove me here so I have to call a cab to get home. The whole time I am holding in tears and when I finally enter the door I slam it shut and lock it. I turn and slide down my door to the floor. I was crying and no matter what I couldn't stop. Everything I have been holding in flows out of my body along with my tears and I hate it. Crying has always been a sign of weakness in my family. I tell myself to be strong and suck it up, but it doesn't work like it normally does. Then my phone goes off and the caller ID tells me it is Tuck. Perfect. I wipe my face and clear my throat before answering. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, I was just calling to check up one you.\" His voice bring solace to me and I calm slightly. \"I am perfectly able to take care of myself.\" \"I know, but I can still worry can't I?\" I smile at this \"Yeah I guess so.\" \"So how was your date?\" My mind suddenly races. Should I tell him? I wait for a while until I hear Tuck's voice again \"Hello? Issy you there?\" \"Yeah sorry. My date was okay, but I don't think im going to see him again.\" Technically it wasn't a lie. \"Why not?\" \"We just didn't hit it off I guess.\" We talk for a little while longer about the usual things like work and end up hanging up. I wash my face and let down my hair. I stare at myself for a while. \"You are not going to be like that again. You won't be weak. You won't be used. Never again.\" I promise myself this and I go to bed and succumb to sleep.[Chapter 7] Hey Guys I am SO sorry that it has taken me so long to actually post anything. I would just like to thank all the people who decided to favorite and follow this story. Please feel free to message me with anything and PLEASE please please review. I awoke to my phone ringing, but I didn't get up fast enough to answer it. I rush over nearly tripping over my discarded heels on the floor. I check my missed calls. It was Tuck and he left a voice mail. \" Hey Izzy its Tuck I was just wondering if it would be possible for you to pick Joe up from his karate match. I can't make it-\"hearing his voice was lovely, but I didn't wait to hear his excuse. I quickly sent him a text telling him that I would and rushed to get dressed. Putting on a minimum amount of make-up on, jeans, a tank top, and flannel I ran out the door slipping on my boots out the door. I barely made it in time, because he was up for his match. I spot Tuck in the bleachers and I go over to stand by him. \"You lied to me.\" I state simply crossing my arms over my chest and watching Joe's match. \"I know. I knew that you wouldn't have come if I had just asked you.\" \"Why do you need me here anyway?\" \"Because I needed to talk to you.\" \"Alright\" I sigh \"I'm listening.\" \"I just wanted to apologize again for being so stupid and insensitive.\" \"Tuck it's alright. I told you I just overreacted.\" \"So I'm forgiven?\" \"You're forgiven.\" I turn my attention back to Joe's match to see him get hit in the face. I flinch and fight my motherly instinct to go out and protect him. I had a hard time watching the rest of the match, but it was soon over with Joe tapping out. Tuck spots Kate and goes over to talk to her. Jealousy snaked through my veins, but Joe runs and hugs me which draws my attention away from Tuck and Kate. \"Hey Buddy! You did so great out there!\" \"I got creamed.\" He says glumly \"You didn't get creamed.\" He sits down on the bleacher and I kneel to help him with his shoes. \"What do you know about fighting? You're just a singer on Uncle Frank's cruise ship.\" I am working the knot on the other shoe when the father of Joe's opponent comes over. He slaps my butt and that makes me stand to look at him. He towers over my small frame and I have to look up at him. \"Pain?\" he asks \"That's just weakness leaving the body.\" He finishes I wanted so bad to show the man exactly what pain felt like, but Joe was there so I just smile, grab Joe's hand, and walk him to the car. \"Hey Kate.\" I smile and wave at her \"Hey Izzy.\" I help Joe into the car and let Tuck and Kate finish their conversation. I get into my car and drive back to my place. I get dressed for my workout. First I start with the punching bag. I get a few reps in when my phone rang \"Yo Izzy it's me!\" FDR's voice rings through \"I was gonna go shoot pool with Tuck later and I was wondering if you wanted to come.\" \"Sure where at?\" I ask \"The bar that we love!\" \"Alright I'll be there. See you later.\" I hang up to get ready. I arrive at the bar and walk in to see Tuck and FDR there already setting up the table. I walk over and hear FDR talking to Tuck. \"Let me get this straight YOU put YOUR personal private details on a very public website\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you insane? Izzy tell him he is insane.\" I felt like I was being put on the spot so I grab a beer and take a swig. \"I can't.\" I finally reply \"Why not?\" FDR asks confused Feeling kind of sheepish I tell him \"I did too.\" \"What!?\" He yells \"Guys we can't just do that it's dangerous.\" I roll my eyes and pull over a bar stool to watch them play. \"where are you taking her?\" FDR asks Tuck. \"You got a date?\" I ask and Tuck nods. Okay that hurt. My stomach clenched and not in a good way. I see him smile like a goofy teenager and that only makes it worse. This was Tucks moment so I just hide my feelings and pretend to be happy for him. \"Don't do that to me\" Tuck says answering FDR's question. \"Taking her to Blarney Stone\" FDR starts dancing Laughing I tell FDR \"Youre and idiot.\" I point to Tuck \"and you are a cheeseball.\" \"What?\" Tuck's voice got really high causing me to laugh again. FDR steps in \"You're going to go on this date and I'm going with you\" \"No you're not.\" \"Yes I am.\" I give FDR a look. \"What I'm scared for him. He hasn't done this in a long time. This girl could be all sorts of crazy\" I nod and add \"Besides half of those girls pee standing up, Tuck. And the other half are on one of our watch lists.\" \"Hey you're on the site too and I'm pretty sure you don't pee standing up.\" \"And you would be correct, but I was on one of those watch lists.\" He opened his mouth to reply, but realizing that I had him there he shut it again. \"Look lucky for you we are free tonight.\" FDR butts in with \"And I'm going to bring the binoculars, the hand cream-\" I cut him off \"I'm not going to be a part of that.\" I give FDR a weird look and he winks at me. \"No please don't bring the binoculars I need a little privacy.\" Tuck objects. I smile at the way he says \"privacy\" FDR compromises and we agree that I am going to get lunch at a restaurant down the street from where Tuck was taking his date and FDR was going to go to the movie rental place. \"One ring means you need and extraction, two rings a cleaner, and three rings means we can go home.\" FDR concludes Tuck takes a drink of his beer \"Two hundred yards.\" He says pointing at each of us \"Sold!\" FDR yells I laugh and try to focus on something else other than Tuck's upcoming date. The date had arrived and FDR and I were in our places. I try to push out the horrible feeling in my stomach. I order my food when the call came. I hope and pray for only one ring, but to my dismay it rings three times. A lump forms in my throat, but I swallow it down. \"Good for you Tuck.\" I whisper quietly.[Chapter 8] Dear readers, I would like to thank everyone for their support.

He himself stood there, arms folded, his shillelagh on the ground beside him. He had admired the dead man on the cart. Monk had found it ironic that the man had taken a clerical nickname like he himself had done. He had not wanted to fight in this war, but the price the man had offered, and the very fact that he was fighting for people like Monk, made the mercenary decide to join in. That man was Priest Vallon, former leader of the Dead Rabbits, the most powerful gang leader in the Five Points. Or rather, was. Now it was Bill the Butcher, the man who had led the Nativists to victory in the snow on this bloody day. Monk sighed to himself as he turned to look at Priest's killer. Bill was leading his companions away in great jubilation, eager to begin their takeover the next day. Monk looked down at his shillelagh; it had killed nine of their men. Nine new notches for his shillelagh. He should have been paid ninety dollars for that. Good money for a bloodbath like this. And he had had one chance to take from this man what was owed. And he had done the right thing instead. He had taken the man's most precious belonging so that the man's son would be able to inherit it. He had not thought of this before. Not even when the horn rang, signifying the death of the leader. He had made his mind up when he had seen the little son of Priest Vallon weep over his father's body. He had a feeling that the son would avenge the father, and he knew that he would see that day with joy. He looked down at his shillelagh. It had had eight notches on it before today. Now he would have to add nine more for the men he'd killed. He suddenly wondered how many he'd laid low; he'd seen men crawl away with injuries that wouldn't heal for a month. Pushing the thoughts of broken men out of his mind, Monk wondered what he would do under the regime of Bill the Butcher. Bill was still young and already a reputation for being a cruel man. Monk had seen the death of Priest, he'd seen how Bill had sneaked up behind Priest and distracted him with a dying man. Bill was certainly a dirty fighter, but somehow tried to keep a sense of honour by refusing any man to touch Priest's body. Now that tall bastard was the top gang leader of New York's Five Points. It was a sad day for the Irish, indeed so it was. And now Bill would take over, unless the Irish could regroup and fight back. However, the Dead Rabbits were done for until someone could resurrect them. Thinking of that, Monk's thoughts immediately travelled to a small boy who had taken his father's knife and swung it at three Nativists. But it would be years before he could even consider putting young Amsterdam on his father's old throne. And Bill would make sure he was locked away for a while. Monk growled to himself as he watched the victorious Natives head off to tell the news and begin to carve up the spoils. Things were taking a turn for the worst, Monk thought as he picked up his shillelagh. Fuck it, he thought. Priest Vallon had been a very good and noble man, but a foolish man. Surely he could not have envisioned a world without enemies? Surely he could not have believed that a faithful heart defeated all else? Bill had received a mighty beating from Priest, but that hadn't stopped Bill from coming back up to kill Priest. He hurried into line with the rest to bid farewell to his old friend. They had been together far too long, no matter what had happened to them since leaving Ireland together for America as youths. No matter what had passed between them, Monk owed Priest his attendance at the very least. He walked in line with Hell-Cat Maggie and Happy Jack Mulraney. They were two of Priest's former lieutenants, and the two of them had fought fiercely in countless battles. Monk had fought with them before, and knew that they would not soon forget Priest Vallon. It was McGloin that Monk distrusted. The Irishman was a mighty fighter but his loyalty had not been as assured as the rest. McGloin had been an Irish born in America, and though he had inherited an Irish accent from his parents, he knew little of Ireland and the old country ways. He might not decide to fight back against the Americans, for he counted himself American more than the others. Priest hadn't minded it, and Monk had always warned him about trusting American-born Irishmen. They were unpredictable. He looked at the body of Priest. So noble, even in death, he should have died long ago. Monk wondered how much of it was because of his followers and how much of Priest's own fighting ability; both had helped Priest to become the true leader of the immigrant Irish landing in America to carve a living out of its great promise. Some bloody promise indeed, what with gangs of vicious Natives that would have loved to kill every man, woman, and child that landed on their coast. Bastards, the lot of them. Monk sighed; he had never believed that the war between these sides would end. He had seen it take his father in Ireland, he had seen it take many lives of good men, such as Priest. This was a war that would not go away soon. He felt the common razor he had taken from Priest's pocket, and he knew then that he ought to do something about it. Succeed where his friend had failed, and then pass on the legacy to Priest's son when he returned. Monk himself had no children that he knew of, and he didn't want to supplant Priest anyway; just continue what he had been doing, but properly. Slowly, calmly, Monk sung an old Irish tune for the dead, in the Gaelic language. He wondered how many of these Irish still knew the language, apart from Hell-Cat and Happy Jack. He'd soon find out, he thought, even as the two began singing along with him. The song spread, until several dozen people were singing in fluent Gaelic. The others were either too caught up in grief to sing, or far more likely, didn't know the traditional Irish language. Monk sang louder to make up for the ignorance. He'd find a way to undo the damage here. Some way, somehow.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two The sea spray got into his eyes as he craned forward to look at the incoming harbour. He stood on the edge, balanced so delicately that the merest change in wind could make him slip. To save the risk, he grabbed the shoulders of the man in front of him, who was kind enough to let the seventeen-year-old hold onto him for support. He stared out to where endless opportunities lay, an escape from the hell that he'd left behind. He could put the past behind him and focus on what was coming ahead in his life. He looked at Vallon, standing not too far away from him. The young man was tall, dark-haired, and looked five years older than his twenty years. He had an air about him that suggested a lifetime of experience and harship. Anyone knowing Vallon would agree that that was a fine description of Vallon. \"Watch it, Monk, you'll not be in America yet before risking your neck,\" Vallon called to his friend. Monk looked at Vallon, \"Vallon, you're surely not thinking that we'll be leaping like spring lambs in America?\" Vallon glanced at Monk sharply, \"You heard what they said about America.\" \"Aye and I saw the coins they took for saying such tripe. I don't trust anything just said in the wind, Vallon.\" He never called Vallon by his nickname. Incidentally, he had gotten his own nickname the same way and the same time as Vallon himself had. Most of the people on the boat knew about their reputations, and doubtless their reputations would be well established when they reached New York and got settled. Monk picked up his shillelagh ; that prized shillelagh that was the last thing he had from his father, Seamus McGinn. Seamus had been a streetfighter, and a fierce one at that before the drink slowed him down. It had led to his death in a gang fight against a group of Protestants that came with the English. Monk had been his eldest son and so he had inherited the man's weapon. His shillelagh. It was a finely crafted Irish club, although slightly shorter than the usual shillelagh. Seamus had spent days finding and shaping the blackthorn wood, smearing it with a layer of butter and hanging it on the chimney to cure and fire-harden, giving it its amazing durability and its shiny black appearance. The hitting end had been half hollowed out to be filled with lead in order to make it heavy enough to smash a man's skull clean open. Seamus had gone further though, by cutting notches into it for every man he'd killed. Monk had thus inherited a notched shillelagh, but also a charmed one, for no man had killed his father when he was armed with it. He had relinquished it in favour of an axe one fight, when he'd seen that the fight was a failure for the Irish Catholics. The Protestants would have coveted the shillelagh, but Seamus wanted Monk to inherit his prized weapon, and he had given it to another man to hand over to his nephew. Irish honour required that the man give it to Monk, and his life would have been forfeit if he had stolen the weapon for himself. Monk had since fought with it every time, and so far he had not yet killed a man with it. He had been raised by his mother to have a fear of God no matter what you had to do in life to survive. Monk had tried to avoid killing with his shillelagh, remembering how his father had died in battle. Walter was only seven years old when he realized what his father did. He discovered it in a shocking fashion. The little boy came into the small kitchen of his Dublin home, thirsty for a drink of water before going back to bed. He had noticed that a light was still on in the kitchen, and knew that he ought to turn it off to avoid a fire. Fires were a threat always spoken of but never seen due to the Dubliners' fear of it consuming buildings and valuables. So Walter walked into that kitchen with the intention of doing good. He didn't want to give his mother a shock when he walked in, but it happened anyway. His mother was standing in the kitchen with her sleeves rolled up to her elbows. She was holding a rag that was a dark red in colour. Her hands too were reddened, and it contrasted with her pale face as she whispered in horror, \"Walter! Away with you an' back to bed this instant!\" Walter didn't understand the fear in his mother's voice but it frightened him too. He was also confused; had seen her with blood on her hands as she was preparing a meal. Was she cooking something tonight? Why? Walter looked around as he said, \"I'm thirsty!\" Then he noticed his father. Seamus was seated in a chair so awkwardly that it looked ready to tip over. The big Irishman's shirt was off, and several bandages were bound over his ribs. The bandages were red on the right side. That wasn't the most disturbing part of it, though. What got Walter's attention was the deep cut in Seamus' forearm that still oozed blood. Seamus looked at him in astonishment, \"Ach, did ye not hear your muther's words, Walter? Up to bed!\" Walter started to cry, \"What's the matter with Pa?\" His mother wrapped her bloody arms around him, \"Calm down now, Walter, it's alright.\" But Walter could hear the fear in her own voice. \"What happened, Pa?\" He asked his father. Seamus paused, \"A fight.\" Walter's eyes widened. He had been beaten for getting into fights with other children. Had Pa been in a fight? Seamus sighed, \"I won, son. I won.\" Walter was really confused now. Seamus smiled, \"A man called me a bad name, and we had a little fight, son. I made him apologize to me. Do you understand that son?\" Walter nodded hesitantly, no longer sobbing. \"Good. Now if you go up to bed now, I'll tell you about it tomorrow when I'm well.\" Walter headed upstairs, but not before hearing, \"Don't fret, Rose, it's about time he learns anyway.\" Rose answered in a hushed voice, \"But Seamus, this is serious. I don't want my sons to follow you to yer grave. I want them to get out of here and be able to find peace!\" Seamus broke through, \"Come now Rose! He's going to be a man for God's bloody sake!\" Walter heard his mother gasp, and he too was shocked. He'd never heard anyone say that about God before. Was Papa going to hell now? he thought to himself as he crept up the stairs. Monk sighed as he made the sign of the cross. Then he jumped down to stand next to Vallon as they entered a new and bloody phase of their lives.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three Monk and Vallon got off the boat, to wild Irish music playing just to the left of them. Some jolly Irishman had pulled out a fiddle and was playing his heart out. Monk almost began singing along with the man. The joy in the Irishman's heart was clear, it flowed with the music that he played so easily and merrily. Vallon grinned at Monk's joyful nature, and clapped his friend on the shoulder, \"Come on, Monk. Let's get out of here and into this new country.\" Monk suddenly felt horribly excited as he approached the plank to exit the boat. Was this the start to a glorious new chapter in his life? He made a sign of the cross, wishing for good luck and health. Behind him, he knew that Vallon was doing the same. The fiddle player continued on in front of Monk. The young Irishman couldn't see past the bulk of the fiddle player in front of him, and there were two others to his left, denying him any sight of New York. This mystery heightened Monk's anticipation. Dear Lord, he prayed, is this the miracle that thou promised me would be mine? The fiddle player began strolling down the plank, still focused completely on his music. Monk suddenly ignored the music, and wondered if the man was aware he was no longer in the pub back home in his village. Monk's feet almost slipped on the wood as he walked down to his new home. He could hear Vallon breathing behind him, and he wondered if Vallon was as excited as him. Surely he must be; this was the chance of the lifetime that they had fought hard to get. Monk grabbed the small bundle where he knew his shillelagh was hidden. He didn't want to carry it so boldly here. This was not downtown alleyways of Dublin, this was America. The fiddle player suddenly faltered in his music as he stepped off the plank and onto the dock. Monk wondered what was going on, but he soon found out. A thud suddenly sounded and halted the music instantly. The fiddle player screamed after another thud sounded the air and the Irishman bent forward, moaning. Monk stared in shock at the smashed handled of the fiddle, and the wounded man moaning on the ground. A third stone was suddenly thrown- Monk knew instantly that the man had been pelted with stones- and struck the man in his right hand, breaking two of his fingers with a sickening crunch. A group of voices called out contemptuously, calling the man names that Monk had heard many times on the streets of Dublin, along with some that he'd never heard before. He looked up and saw three youths, much like himself, throwing rocks at the people getting off the boats and insulting them with a barrage of slander. Near them, a security guard did nothing to stop them. Monk stared in shock; this was what had been promised? Had God in his Infinite Wisdom chosen such brutal youths to be the welcoming party? He looked at Vallon, and he looked equally surprised. Monk's astonishment suddenly melted away into a seething anger at himself for getting his hopes up so much. Of course America wouldn't be the perfect land of opportunity that the men had said it was. Of course he should have expected flaws. Priest, however, was still unable to understand what had happened. He helped the man get to his feet and looked back at Monk, \"What the hell is this?\" Monk sighed, \"This is home alright. Just like I remember it.\" \"\" \"\" \" \"\" \" \"\" \"\" \" \" \"\" \" Later, the two youths were walking down the streets of New York, seeking some kind of sign on where to make their home. They glanced around at the many different people. They drank in the sights around them, marvelling at how their imaginations had pictured something much grander. However, it was good enough for now. They wondered where they could get a drink, or something to eat. Monk clutched the bag that held his shillelagh tightly. After the encounter on the dock, he no longer trusted the dreams in his head. He wondered if it was wise to brazenly carry the shillelagh down the street. He decided against it. Vallon kept his Irish cross and short sword on his back and at his side. They spied a small pub that looked remarkably Irish. They shouldered their way through the streets to get to it. Monk's mouth watered as he smelled the cooking meat inside. He was glad that it was not Lent; he was hungry enough to eat a whole cow. A serving girl stood at the bar, her cleavage inviting to the eyes of the men in the pub, \"Can I help you two gentlemen today?\" Despite her thin stature, it was clear that she was a tough girl. Monk could tell by the flinty look in her eyes that was barely concealed by the brightness of youth. Vallon spoke up, \"Two bowls of Irish stew, and a good round of coddle.\" The girl narrowed her eyes mischievously, \"Ah, a couple of Dubliners fresh off the boat, so I reckon!\" Monk grinned, \"Aye, that's the truth.\" The girl grinned, \"Take a seat, lads, it's on its way.\" Monk and Vallon found a small place to sit down and watched people go by down the street. Neither spoke for a while, each lost in their thoughts. Monk looked at Vallon, wondering what the serious-faced man was thinking. Monk himself was waiting eager for a good taste of coddle. He suddenly looked at Vallon, \"Oy there, Vallon, who in the hell are we goin' to pay for that?\" Vallon nodded, \"I was thinkin' of that myself.\" Monk sighed, \"Well, we'll have to make do with the farthings and ha'pennies we got, but I don't know how much it is in American coinage. What do you even call them here?\" \"Dollars,\" Vallon answered. Monk laughed at the odd word. He looked at a group of men in top hats walking down the street. One was an older man, paunchy and morose-looking. He walked in a way that signified power and influence. Behind him were several men of varying ages deferring to him in silence. Monk's eye caught on to a young man not to far from the old man's side. Based on features, Monk thought the youth was his own age. There was a certain ferocity to him though, one that suggested a fierce temper and a man's notions of life. Monk's hand strayed towards his shillelagh, as though expecting the teenager to pull his knife from his belt and fight Monk here and now. Vallon noticed Monk's movement, \"What's going on with you?\" Monk grimaced, \"I don't like that one there. See him?\" Vallon followed his friend's gaze and nodded after a pause, \"You're right. I have a bad feeling about that boyo.\" Monk suddenly clasped a hand to his forehead, \"My God! He was at the dock! He struck the fiddler on his fingers.\" Vallon growled at the thought of that act of cruelty, \"The slimy little bastard!\" Monk suddenly checked his response when he saw the coddle and Irish stew placed on their table. The serving girl smiled down at the young men, \"There we are!\" Vallon looked up hesitantly, \"Listen, lass, can we pay in farthings?\" The girl adopted a look of mock exasperation, \"Oh? And how could I trust ye not to cheat me, sirs?\" Monk hastily put a hand in his pocket, \"Ach, look you tell us how many farthings go into a dollar, and the like.\" The girl, who looked about fifteen, smiled mischievously at Monk, \"So you'd trust a pretty face to give you the honest answer?\" Monk smiled back, \"The Good Lord wouldnae be so unkind to a pair of poor bastards such as us in America.\" The girl laughed, \"Hand me ten farthings and I'll let you keep the rest, because I can see you're going tae need it.\" Monk's mirth suddenly faltered as he remembered the violent youth at the dock who'd just walked by, \"Aye. I think we will.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Monk tasted the sausage and bacon in the coddle. Soft and juicy, like his mother had made them. The potatoes were a bit stale, but the meat made up for it by far. Suddenly, he thought back to the last time he'd eaten coddle. Rose McGinn laid the dish down in front of her children. Walter, being the oldest, was given the smaller piece on the account of the fact that to be good was to give the greater share to those who needed it more. Like Seamus, their working father, or young Christy, small and frail for her age. Walter's mother continually quoted the words of the Bible to her children, stressing the necessity of that. Walter's stomach was growling, but knew that his mother wanted him to say grace on the account of their father not being present, but at the dockyards working on the waterfront. He was the oldest child and at nine years old, behaving more and more like the man of the house. Rose rarely mentioned their father unless it was to comment on how he was a hard worker and a loyal husband but flawed because of his lack of faith. Walter would not be lacking of faith, she promised him with a shaky voice occasionally, after discrediting Seamus. Walter would grow to love God and fear his punishment of the wicked. He would rise above the world that his parents inhabited. Years later, Walter would realize that it had all begun from that one night two years before when he'd realized that Seamus was in a gang and fought against the Protestants who competed fiercely for work on Dublin's docks. Seamus had come into Walter's room a few days after the initial incident and told him about how he defended his Catholicism in battle and fought bad people. He told Walter about how a man must fight in such times, or else fail to be a man. Walter wondered if Rose had insisted that he reference his faith to Walter, but there likely was a fear of God in his soul, suppressed by the reality around him. Seamus had shown him the scars on his body, and the notches on his shillelagh. He told Walter of how he put the markings on his weapon in celebration of triumph. Walter would forever be disturbed by the thought of each little nick on the weapon to be the life of a man on Seamus' soul. God would surely punish him for it when he died. Seamus shrugged it off when Walter said as much, making him even more uneasy. As the years passed, though, it was easier to comprehend. Walter became exposed towards the danger of the streets, and he saw his first fight when he was eight years old, watching two boys going at each other with pieces of wood, until Seamus waded in with his shillelagh, halting the violence. Walter had loved his father at that moment, and was even more assured of his father's goodness when Seamus immediately told him that only a fool sought violence blindly. One must be able to bite his pride at small insults, knowing when someone was serious or not. Of course, Seamus often broke that rule. Walter would be confused for many months at why this was so, then as he got older, he knew that his father was most involved in fighting when he was drunk. The spirits he drank were the cause of his most violent tempers, when he staggered into the house late at night, cursing as he rubbed an old wound. He would holler at Rose, who prayed to God to forgive her husband for being so blasphemous. Walter heard words he'd never imagined existed from his father. Seamus was a good worker, though. He would always show Walter around his work, showing him that he must never rely on a job at the docks to get him through life. He must take up a proper trade. So at ten, Walter was already wondering what he was going to do with his life. It was on one day that he decided what he was fated to do. Walter's family lived only a few blocks away from the Liffey, which split Dublin in half. Walter frequently crossed the river on his exploring walks of the city, trying to avoid any trouble. Because he was a young child who looked reasonably cared for, few people truly wanted to mess with him, thinking that his parents were nearby. One day, he found himself watching a group of older boys playing football in the street. It wasn't easy to play, and the youths were frequently interrupted. He walked up to them, \"Can I play?\" \"Piss off!\" the first youth said. He was considerably bigger than Walter, and about three years older. All of the lads were thirteen it seemed to Walter. Walter was hurt by the hostile tone and felt humiliated to be so insulted in front of everyone. One of the other boys glared angrily at the speaker, \"Mind your tongue, Fin. The lad didn't ask for an insult.\" Fin gave a leer, \"Aye and we didn't ask for little pricks to come up to us and bother our game.\" Suddenly, a fierce anger consumed Walter; he was being humiliated. Was this what his father had been talking about when he spoke of honour? Was Fin expecting him to fight back? So be it. Running forward in his anger, Walter yelled out his first swear word in his mother's Gaelic, \"Hey, amadan, you don't call me those names!\" Turning around in surprise, Fin yelled as Walter, shorter and lighter than his opponent, slammed into Fin's midriff with his head. Because he hadn't been expecting it, Fin fell over onto the ground. Waving a childish fist with all his might, Walter landed a fierce punch where his arm was nearest; right in Fin's gut. Fin gasped in pain, swearing foully, and then he kicked Walter in the leg. Ignoring Walter's wail of pain, Fin landed a fierce punch of his own on Walter's eye. Weeping from the pain, Walter clutched the swollen area around his eye. He didn't see the second kick from Fin that landed him flat on his back. All of a sudden he heard a meaty thud followed by another scream from Fin, but far more higher pitched than the yell he'd uttered when Walter charged him at first. Even though he was consumed by his own pain and humiliation, Walter could tell that Fin was in real pain. Blinking away his tears, he noticed Fin doubled on the ground, clutching his groin and wailing. Over him stood the boy who'd first reprimanded him. \"Yer a bloody little bastard, Fin, an' you'll feel both my shoes on your shrivelled blein again if you ever do that again!\" The older boy, who was taller than Fin, almost picked up Walter in his arms and took him into a little shop on one side of the street. Walter noticed that there was a sign in both English and Gaelic. It read \"Vallon's Barbershop\" in both languages. Inside, it was cramped, but still very comfortable-looking. Several customers were sitting down, waiting for a haircut while a small boy went around shining shoes for money. A tall man was also administering haircuts. He looked somber and serious as he gazed upon the hair he was working with. His shears seemed to be extensions of his fingers as they sought out the hair and trimmed it to their perfection. Almost forgetting the pain he felt, Walter looked at his rescuer, \"Who's that?\" The boy smiled, recognizing the awe in Walter's prebuscent voice, \"That's my da. Cillian Vallon, best barber in Dublin, so he is!\" Cillian noticed the appearance of the two boys and hurried over to see them, \"Now then, son! Who's this?\" The boy- Walter realized his surname was Vallon- patted Walter on the shoulder, \"This young lad wanted to join our game and Fin was being a bully and this lad goes right for Fin and takes him on!\" Walter expected Cillian- who seemed more like a clergy member than a barber- to tut, lecture Walter on fighting, and perhaps even cuff him over the head. Instead, however, Cillian chuckled to himself, patted Walter on the head and said, \"You're a brave lad! Soon to be a mighty fighter, no doubt! What's yer name?\" Walter spoke in a hesitant voice, trying to hide the pain in it from his injuries, \"Walter McGinn, sir.\" Cillian nodded, \"Aye. Well it figures to see who your father is.\" Walter wasn't sure if that was an insult or a compliment. It had been delivered in such a neutral voice that he wasn't sure. He suddenly noticed that the shoe-shiner was being given a tip from one of the customers. The sight of such easy money filled Walter's eyes with a longing. He knew that his mother was afraid of having no money. Maybe if he could get a job, like his father said, he could help her. Vallon noticed the look and spoke quickly to his father, \"Say, da, you think you could employ this lad in the shop?\" Cillian started in surprise, as did Walter. Cillian recovered instantly however, thinking about it. He spoke to Walter, \"Do you want to work for me, lad? Work in the barbershop?\" Walter thought about it. Learning to cut hair from this man, earning money, having somthing to do that got him out of trouble, like his parents said. He knew he wanted it badly. Saying as much to Cillian, the man chuckled, \"Well, ask yer parents first, lad. If they want, they can come talk to me about it. But for now, I want you to go with Liam and check out your eye. It's turning into a real shiner, lad.\" Vallon took Walter out back and washed out the youngster's eye, and afterwards brought him home on his father's orders. Walter thanked Vallon for walking with him and hurried indoors, where his family was about to sit for dinner. Surprisingly, Seamus was there too on one of those rare days when he ate with the family. Seeing Walter's appearance, Rose screamed. Seamus stood up in shock, \"Bloody hell!\" Ignoring her husband's blasphemy for once, Rose bent on one knee to examine Walter's face, \"What happened to you!\" Walter told the story in its full entirety, not missing one thing. At the end of it, Seamus had a wide grin on his weathered face, \"My son loses his first fight, and gets offered a job. I don't know whether to beat you or hug you, Walter.\" Walter beamed, and Rose smiled feebly through her tears at the chances her son had been offered; her prayers were answered, it seemed. She stood up, \"I'm thinking tomorrow we ought to eat something special to the occasion.\" The next day, while Seamus was off to arrange the terms of work with Cillian, they had coddle. Vallon had been invited to join, and he sat next to Walter. Monk smiled at the memory. It was the first time he'd met his favourite mentor, and one of his best friends. Not only that, it had led to his developing a trade to live on. It had also given him a taste of fighting, and a sense that he could win if he fought hard enough. Though at the time he hadn't understood it so clearly.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five Monk and Vallon finished their meal quickly, neither saying anything as they ate. The girl came back to collect their empty plates. Monk and Vallon had made sure that they had eaten everything, as they knew that any meal you got should be enjoyed as much as possible, for the next meal was never a guarantee. Monk looked at the girl, \"Say, do you know any places for a couple of Irish lads down on their luck?\" The girl shook her head, \"This isn't what your fathers said it would be when they paid for your tickets.\" Vallon flinched, \"We found that out quick enough, miss. But say we want to make our own luck.\" The girl laughed, \"Will ye stop callin' me miss? I've got a name for feck's sake!\" Monk flinched at the mouth this young girl had, but felt attracted to her spirit, \"Well tell us then!\" The girl looked down at Monk with a mock imperious tone, \"Name's Maggie. Any of you have names?\" Monk smiled, \"Walter McGinn, also known in Dublin as Monk, and this here is Liam Vallon, known fondly as Priest.\" After Maggie's giggling subsided, Vallon asked, \"Where would you say is a good place for us to make our own luck in this new country?\" Maggie sighed, \"Well, if you want to start from the bottom up, there's the Five Points.\" Monk smiled, \"Where's that?\" She pointed northwards, \"You'll get to Cross Street as you go that way, and then you'll find the Five Points. Can't miss it, on the account it looks like the misery you left behind in Ireland.\" Vallon looked somber and got up, \"Thank ye, Maggie. We'll not forget this.\" Monk glanced one last time at Maggie. She smiled at him suddenly, in a way that she hadn't already smiled. Before, it was a smile that she would probably give to any customer, but this one was suddenly genuine. Monk returned it as best he could, wondering what she meant. He turned away from her to follow Vallon. The two headed off towards the Five Points. As they went on, they could tell that things seemed to get worse the closer they got to the Five Points. Monk looked at Vallon, \"Weapons out, ye reckon?\" Vallon shrugged, \"Suit yerself. But I have a bad feeling about this place.\" Monk pulled out his shillelagh, looking at the many markings of his father's record. Seamus McGinn had killed many men in his time, and he had died as violently as he had lived. Monk made the sign of the cross instinctively as he thought of his father. The two Irishmen walked into the Five Points after another passage of time, wading through crowds and looking for street names. The sight they beheld was beyond even their low expectations. Animals were almost as common as people in the area. The houses were rickety for the most part, and while some lucky ones were made of stone, they were scarce indeed. The great square was full of people and fenced off in different places. It was the people that made it the most unappealing. Their eyes were sunken, their bodies malnourished for the most part. Their presence brought back images of the Dublin streets to Monk. He shuddered; had he left the stew pot and fallen into the fire? He held his shillelagh ready as he walked down the street. Alleyways leaned out, daring any foolish lad to enter, where thieves lurked. Vallon and Monk were both well accustomed to such a suspicious place. Trying not to breathe through their noses, they walked around, looking for an opportunity. Anything that could work to their advantage. Suddenly Vallon bumped into a group of men. They turned around aggressively, staring at the tall, strong Irishman with a sword strapped to his waist. Monk groaned. It was the same old man that he had seen before. With him were almost the same group of people, including the violent youth at the docks. The old American glared at Vallon, \"Watch where you're going, you little Godless Mick!\" Vallon smiled dangerously, \"No need for that tone, sir.\" The Americans paused; clearly nobody treated the man like that. Vallon, Monk knew, never treated anyone different unless he had seen for himself that they were worthy of respect. It had often gotten him in trouble. Monk was glad he had pulled out his shillelagh. He hefted it daringly, prepared to help his friend. The old man smiled at the sight of the two young men prepared to fight, \"Piece of work, the two of you. Must be right off the boat.\" The young American called out, \"I recognize them, sir. They're fresh beggars.\" Vallon growled behind clenched teeth, like a guard dog sensing a fox. The young man leered at the tall Irishman and pulled out a long and wickedly sharp knife. Vallon spat and prepared to swing his hefty cross in defence while he pulled out his sword. Monk stepped in between Vallon and the Americans, \"Hold, Priest. Another time.\" Vallon snorted and lowered his weapon. The older man grimaced, \"Here's some advice for you two. Stay out of the Five Points if you know what's good for you. We don't like the vermin crawling around too much around here, and if you're not careful we'll hang you by your necks.\" Monk knew they had been given a reprieve and they should take it while they could. Monk led Vallon away but not without Vallon uttering a threat, \"The rats can rise up and overwhelm the pig, so they can.\" With that, he turned to follow Monk as they hurriedly went off. Monk shuddered, \"Fuck! What is goin' on around here? There's nothin' for us here, Priest. Let's get outta here.\" He only ever called Vallon by his nickname when he felt truly worried. Vallon knew that too, and he put a comforting arm on Monk's shoulder, \"Put your trust in God, Monk. We'll get through yet.\" Monk smiled, \"And how are we to do that? So far I ain't seen one other bloody Irishman around these parts...\" \"Oy! Who are you two, eh?\" Vallon and Monk looked around to see another Irish youth approach them. He looked very scruffy, a little older than Monk. He grinned at the two of them cheerfully, and in a thick accent, he repeated his question. Vallon answered, \"We're two lads from Dublin fallen on hard times in the land of plenty.\" The youth's grin widened, \"Aye, an' youse just stood up to the great Brian Cassius, so ye did! Anyone who stands to Cassius is welcome with me. I'm Jack Mulraney, known to all as Happy Jack.\" Bemused, Monk and Vallon shook Happy Jack's outstretched hand. The young man was friendly enough, so Vallon introduced himself, \"I'm Priest Vallon, and this un here is Walter McGinn, known as Monk.\" Happy Jack grinned beneath his moustache, \"Monk and Priest eh? Jesus but that's a fine pair of nicknames for youse two. Say, where're you from?\" Monk spoke up, \"Dublin. We ain't a pair of bogtrotters an' the like.\" Bogtrotter was slang for a country bumpkin, and Monk was baiting Jack intentionally, for the young man's tongue and behaviour clearly showed he was from the countrysides of inner Ireland. Jack flinched, but smiled at Monk, \"A fine slagger y'are, Monk.\" A slagger was a man who made jokes good-naturedly. Both Monk and Vallon could hear the sarcasm in Jack's voice. Vallon broke in, \"You'll have to excuse Monk. He was in a run-in with one of Cassius' boys.\" Jack frowned, \"Which one?\" \"The youngest. He was eating the head off of some poor Irishman on the docks. Also was a-chucking rocks and the like.\" Jack glanced at Monk with less hostility in his face, \"Shikes, I'd be in a foul mood after runnin' into Bill Cutting. He's supposed to be one of Cassius' fellas that he done took under his wing from out of the orphanage at Hellgate.\" Vallon frowned, \"Right bastard?\" Jack nodded, \"To his bloody arse and halfway back. He'll be a nasty piece o' work unless he gets killed first.\" Vallon looked at Jack, \"Do you know anybody that we could look to for some employment?\" Jack nodded, \"I'll be just be a minute.\" He headed off into the crowd. Monk knew that the young man wouldn't have come to them had he not been looking for recruits. Vallon struck him suddenly on the shoulder, \"Leave that lad alone, Monk!\" Monk shrugged sourly, \"He's a proper little culchie, Vallon. A damn near savage by the looks of him. I don't like this whole thing about the gangs, Vallon.\" Vallon stared at him suddenly, \"What? Come now, Monk, this isn't a gang he's taking us to.\" Monk grimaced, \"Want to wager the last of yer ha'pennies on that?\" Jack suddenly reappeared, \"Oy, how'd you like to join the Roach Guards?\" Vallon paused, \"Mayhaps. What are they exactly?\" As Happy Jack talked and talked about the Roach Guards, Monk sighed inwardly. The Good Lord had failed him. They hadn't entered a new society, just a new country with the same principles. Author's Note= Hell-Cat Maggie would have been twelve if resources can be trusted, but even they're unsure about her age, so I decided to age her up a bit to fifteen to contribute more to my story. Oh, and the Roach Guards were indeed a gang that later dissolved. One of the gangs that was branched out from that gang was the Dead Rabbits. Finally, there will be much Irish slang in the dialogue from this point on. Readers may be confused at times, but I'll try and define as many as I can.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Monk and Vallon followed Happy Jack into a large building that seemed to be the big home for every Irish person in the Five Points. Everywhere there were Irish people involved in some kind of activity. Monk almost felt homesick, it was so much like Dublin. This was where people tried to live as if they hadn't endured a terrible voyage over the high seas to escape their home. Vallon felt the same way, and in a choked voice, he asked Jack, \"How many are here?\" Jack shrugged, \"I couldnae tell you, Priest.\" They went into a small room, which unlike every other room they had seen so far was not crowded with people. Instead, a group of three men were seated around a small table, counting up coins that glinted in the candlelight. Jack spoke to them swiftly in Gaelic, \"Two new lads off the boat looking for jobs.\" The biggest of the men looked up, and Monk almost stepped backward in shock. The man's rugged features and scraggly beard gave him a look that Monk's own father had had. The same resilient fighter's look was undeniable. The man spoke in an accent that suggested he was from the Ulster region up in the north of Ireland, \"So? What's this about employment?\" Vallon nodded, \"I'm Priest Vallon, and this is Monk, my friend. We're wondering if there's anything we could do in your establishment.\" The man smiled at the nicknames, \"Establishment? Is that what they're calling it back home?\" His two friends snickered. Vallon grimaced, but said nothing. After his moment of amusement, the man introduced himself, \"I'm Keenan McFay, known as the Captain. I'm leader of the Roach Guards, and I say that now in case either of you have come here to kill me and take my place.\" Monk and Vallon looked at each other in bemusement, and Vallon spoke again, \"No, not at all.\" The Captain smiled, \"I can see you're both good lads, but I don't know if I want to put you both in my gang. What will you do?\" Vallon spoke up, \"I'll be a full fledged member. Service in exchange for protection and a share in the reward.\" The Captain nodded, \"Can you prove it?\" Monk felt disgusted. It was just like this back in Dublin. An initiation that you had to do in order to secure their trust before taking you on. Vallon smiled, \"I'll make you a hundred dollars by tomorrow.\" The Captain did a double take, \"What?\" Vallon shrugged, \"Monk and I can do it.\" Monk looked at Vallon blankly. Partly he was thinking of their old business in Dublin, and how they had always made a surefire profit, but on the other hand, he wasn't sure if he wanted to do this. He had come to America to escape the gangs. He had noted that many of the Irish accents in the place were fading, replaced by the more flat tone of the Americans. This was no Dublin, just a cheap replication. He said nothing of the sort. Maybe he had it wrong, after all. He didn't want to antagonize the Captain against Vallon or himself. There was still a profit to be made. The Captain spoke up, \"A hundred dollars then, gents. Tomorrow. But I'm raising the stakes here now. I want three ears from each of you. American ears.\" Monk shuddered. Brutal fucking system down here. Even the hardiest of Dublin gangs never asked for ears. They treated their dead with a tad more goddamn respect that cutting off their fucking ears! Vallon looked astonished too, but hid it immediately, \"One for each man?\" The three men laughed, and Jack, standing by the door, added, \"Aye. One per man.\" Vallon nodded, \"Do you need a witness with us? To make sure we do it?\" The Captain grinned, \"If you want.\" Vallon nodded towards Jack, \"I'll take him along, and you can choose another.\" The Captain grinned, \"Well, fine by me. I'll send them wherever you want to meet up with them.\" Monk spoke up, the first time he had done so, \"There's an Irish pub as you go to the harbour from here. It's called Finnegan's, and one of the bar maids is a girl named Maggie. We'll be sitting outside waiting for them.\" The Captain nodded, \"Very well.\" Vallon had suddenly looked at Monk in surprise, and when they were back outside, he muttered, \"What was that all about?\" Monk spoke up, \"I don't trust them, Vallon. This is bloody worse than what we left behind. Cutting off ears for feck's sake!\" Vallon sighed, \"Such is the way of the world.\" Monk spat, \"Well let's get going and wait for these two culchies.\" \"\" \" \"\" \"\" \"\" \" \" \" \"\" \" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" Maggie was still there when they got back. She looked at them in surprise, and smiled, \"Well! That was fast! Any luck?\" Monk spoke up, \"Aye, there's two lads from the Roach Guards going to meet us here and we head off to the docks and make our money.\" Maggie paused, and then took their order for something to drink. The two young men took up the exact same table they'd had only an hour and a half before. Maggie came up and handed them their drinks, \"You're going to go raid ships?\" Vallon grinned, \"Aye, that was our specialty in Dublin.\" Maggie sighed, \"Hate to break it to you boys, but this aint the bloody Liffey, this is the New York harbour. It's different here.\" Monk growled, \"Tell me about it.\" Maggie looked Monk directly in the eye, \"You've noticed too?\" Monk nodded, \"It's amusing that I left Dublin for this place hoping to get away from the violence.\" Maggie chuckled, \"Aye, my Da thought so too. And then he died of tuberculosis here.\" Monk felt a pang of deep sadness and he reached out to touch Maggie's hand. To his continued astonishment, she made no attempt to recoil his touch, \"I'm sorry, Maggie.\" Maggie smiled warmly at the concern, \"Thankee, but it was four years ago. Bit late to start crying again.\" Vallon pointedly looked away from the two of them (to Monk's gratitude) and he spoke to her again, \"So what are you doing in a place like this?\" Maggie jerked her head over inside the pub, \"My mother married the owner of this pub. He's an alright fellow with a deathly fear of God's anger. So he treats us well, and pays me wages and provides for us.\" Monk felt relieved, \"You're a lucky girl.\" Maggie shrugged, \"Aye, and all I have to put up with is a few pinches and catcalls from the men I serve here.\" She sounded very bitter as she spoke about her work. Monk said nothing to this, and looked at Vallon, \"You keepin' an eye out for them?\" Vallon nodded, \"I am.\" Monk looked back at Maggie and gave her his last ha'pennies, \"Here. My treat.\" Maggie looked astonished at his generosity and smiled. Monk felt an excitement within him again as he looked at her pretty, well-fed face. Tenderly holding her hand, he gave it a gentle kiss. He felt her hand shudder, but she did not withdraw it until someone called her name. When she was gone, Monk sighed nervously and sat back. Vallon grinned at him, \"Love how you always live up to your nickname.\" \"Shut up,\" Monk said automatically. He had felt a feeling for Maggie that he'd never felt for anyone before. Vallon chuckled, \"America's not so bad innit?\" Monk growled, \"America didn't produce that girl. She's a reminder of what the good we left behind.\" Vallon thought about that, \"It always seems so good and pure once it's gone.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven Happy Jack arrived within the hour, accompanied by a short, powerfully built man that looked to be older than Vallon by a few years. His hair was cropped close to his skull, and he was clean-shaven. Monk looked at the second man with a wary gaze. He didn't know if the Captain had sent him along as a spy or not, or maybe even an assassin. He just wasn't too sure about this man. Happy Jack looked pleased to see the two of them again, though. He introduced the two men to his companion, and then introduced his companion as McGloin. Monk briefly shook hands with McGloin, and said a greeting in Gaelic. He didn't like the dark look on McGloin's face. Vallon, as usual, was far more open to introductions, and soon was speaking about the plan that he and Monk had already concocted. Maggie had provided them with information concerning the docks in between servings. Monk sighed, and looked back to where Maggie was, and blew her a mock kiss. Blushing deeply, Maggie pointedly looked away in order to focus on the customers. Vallon spoke to McGloin and Jack, \"Alright, here's what we do. We're going to raid some of the ships that are coming into this harbour. We'll make a profit, and set aside a hundred for Captain Keenan of the Guards.\" McGloin shrugged, \"Aye, but how are we going to do that? There's plenty of competition along the harbour and they don't appreciate outsiders taking the spoils.\" His accent was even thicker than Jack's and Monk wondered if any non-Irishers could understand him. Vallon smiled, \"We've got some tricks up our sleeve.\" \"\"\" \" \"\" \" \" \"\" \" \"\" \" \" That night, two American men stood watch over the view of the harbour. The reason they stood ready to attention was the fact that a ship was coming into the harbour. It was a cargo ship, but smaller than the usual ones. Possibly a private ship owned by one of New York's wealthiest families or businesses. It was these kinds of ships that were most especially preyed upon by the gangs on the docks. For it was these boats that insulted the gangs most of all, and the fact that people could afford such unimaginable luxury. One of the men drew heavilly on a cheap cigar that was common throughout the poor classes in New York. Cursing its incompetence, the man looked to his partner, \"When are the rest of the boys coming with the boat?\" The partner checked the position of the moon, \"Shoulda been here already, but-\" The man suddenly stopped in mid-speech due to the heavy blow on the back of his head. He fell forward without another sound. The second man jumped back in shock, his gasp cut short by the blow to his own head. Monk smiled at his handiwork despite the depressed feeling he'd had all day. Patting his shillelagh, he checked to see that both men were still breathing. He headed down the dock to where the unconscious bodies of five others were lying at the water's edge. Beside them, floating in the water, Vallon and Happy Jack held a sixth man at gunpoint. The man was gagged with a belt and held the oars in his hands with a death grip. Vallon held the pistol that they had taken from one of the five men lying on the dock's edge, \"So? McGloin heading off to prepare the the decoy?\" Monk nodded, \"He told me ten minutes and then the signal would be out.\" Vallon grinned, \"Excellent. Let's get going then.\" \"\" \"\" \" \" \" \"\" \" \" The fire was already blazing merrily when dozens of men came running up to see what was going on. Men started to douse the flames until the fire brigade got there. In the meantime the unconscious men were ignored in favour of the dangerous flames threatening to spread to the rest of the buildings. The fire brigade arrived, but could not find the fire hydrant because a representative of another fire brigade on the way had hidden it. Even as the second brigade arrived, the first one was seething with fury and began to start a fight next to the burning building. Even while all this was going on, one gang member noticed the unconscious bodies and brought them about. Within ten minutes, roars of rage could be heard along the dock and the local gang noticed that two of their three boats were gone. Taking the last one, they headed out to where they could see, in the moonlight, one of the boats headed out towards the cargo ship. Two men were in the boat, as far as they could see, and they were eager to take as many as they could to take vengeance for this insult. Manned by twice as many oars, the gang's boat closed the distance quickly between them and the stolen craft. They yelled out towards the craft and swore by Hell and Satan that they would kill them both after a day of torture. A gun shot rang out suddenly, and the men on the gang ducked in shock. Looking up, they saw that none had been hit and it was safe to look up again. To their astonishment, they saw that the two men were no longer visible. They noticed one body lying down. Christ, they were preparing to shoot again! Doubling their efforts at the oars, the other gang members took out their own pistols and fired at the stolen boat to keep the enemies' heads down. Finally they got to the enemy boat, and to their horror, they saw only the body of their comrade, a bloody bullet hole between his eyes. No other person was on the boat. \"\" \"\" \" \" \" \"\" \" \" \"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\" Monk, Happy Jack, and McGloin worked quickly. They looted as much as they could off the ship, anything light that could be carried. Luckily the sailors offered little resistance after Monk's shillelagh broke a few arms and legs. Picking up a jeweled necklace, Jack smiled at the other two men, \"Well done, Monk, but I don't understand what Priest is up to.\" Monk did not return the smile, \"Vallon's outsmarted men like these before. He'll be fine.\" McGloin was far more suspicious, \"How? He'll never outrun the gang and he'll have to fight his way through them. Even he's not that tough. Irish hide can't repel bullets.\" Monk grimaced, \"Just get the loot and hurry the feck up!\" Jack quickly stuffed some more coins in his pocket, \"You two did this in Dublin too?\" Monk suddenly smiled, and spoke a sentence in Gaelic. Jack paused, looked at McGloin, and back at Monk, \"That means \"If you're not strong you'd better be smart\", doesn't it?\" Monk nodded, \"That's true, Jack. My father taught me that many times.\" McGloin looked at Monk, at how he continued to lean nigh off the boat, observing the dark waters of New York's harbour. McGloin spoke up, \"What're you looking for, Monk?\" Monk turned to look at McGloin, \"Pass me the lantern and you'll find out.\" Jack stared at Monk, \"But they'll see us!\" Monk shrugged, \"We'll risk that. Light it up and give it here.\" Holding the lantern just a hand's breath above the water's edge, Monk prayed that this worked. After a waiting time that seemed to last hours to Monk, he could see movement just under the water's surface. Monk suddenly hoped that it was what he thought it was. Vallon's head burst up from the surface, gasping for air like a bullock crossing a river. Jack and McGloin jumped in shock, swearing foully and pointing at Vallon as though he was a ghost. Monk was amused by their reactions. But indeed, their surprise were well-placed; who else in New York could swim so well? Vallon's skill in swimming was almost equivalent to a miracle to many people. Vallon crawled into the boat, and after being handed three layers by Monk, he spoke in a voice that shook with cold, \"G-g-get me the f-f-f- fucking hell to land! \" Monk was so tickled by the sight of Vallon that he couldn't help but laugh. This was as close to Dublin as New York had come so far in terms of familiarity. He somehow knew that it was probably just a last hurrah before the storm returned.[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight The four men counted the loot up properly, and divided the extra shares amongst themselves. Vallon grinned at Monk, \"Things are starting to go our way, no?\" Monk shrugged, \"Aye, it was successful. But we have to get out of here.\" Vallon nodded, \"Right. We'll just collect the money here and give it to the Captain.\" Jack suddenly piped up, \"There's still the matter of the three ears, Vallon.\" Monk shuddered. He had completely forgot about that, perhaps willingly. He didn't want to kill someone just to take one of their ears. If he was going to kill someone, let it be for a proper reason. Vallon looked at Monk, \"Well, I have one already.\" He pulled a bloody human ear from his pocket and held it up in the light.\" Monk stared at him, \"What?\" Vallon nodded, \"Aye, so we'll have to go find ourselves other victims.\" Monk did not break his stare; Vallon showed no remorse over this fact. He seemed quite eager to fit in with this new country. Monk had thought he would have kept his dignity. McGloin gave Monk a level look, \"Somethin' the matter boyo?\" Monk glared at McGloin. The smug bastard seemed to see Monk as a squeamish weakling for not wanting to cut off a person's ear. Well fine, Monk thought, if higher morals and a fear of God's judgement was squeamish, so be it. McGloin was not finished though. He had clearly been sent by the Captain to judge the two young men, \"Do you have a problem with showing your loyalty?\" Vallon looked up as though ready to interfere, but Happy Jack held up a hand. Clearly this was a test that Monk had to take. Monk didn't notice Vallon's attempted interruption, \"I was taught to honour mine enemy. I was taught that I'm being judged by superior beings.\" McGloin paused, and spoke again, \"Monk, there's things that we need to do to survive this world. God can forgive an act that helps us to survive.\" Monk spat, \"I don't need to deface fellow men to survive. My existence doesn't depend on it.\" \"Take care in saying that later,\" McGloin replied darkly. Monk almost laughed in contempt, but checked himself. McGloin was actually serious, which was laughable, but he did potentially have the power to unleash persecution on Monk's head. Monk looked at McGloin with a less aggressive air, \"I haven't threatened you at all McGloin. Nor have I insulted the Roach Guards.\" McGloin acknowledged that with a shrug, \"So?\" Monk stood up, shillelagh looped in his hand but pointed at the ground, \"If deforming a person is the way to show loyalty here then I won't have any part of it.\" Vallon did a double take, and stood up with him, \"What are you doing?\" Monk looked at Vallon, \"You can tear heads off and destruct the world with the rest of these Americanized Irish if you want, but I'm not going to join in.\" Vallon stared at him, \"You're walking away from me? After everything?\" He looked ready to attack Monk in rage. Monk felt the same way about Vallon but refused to show the emotions tearing his insides apart. He kept his face calm and determined. He spoke to Vallon again, \"I'll always remain your friend, Vallon. You'll be welcome to stay with me wherever I stay if I have a say in it, but I will not be involved in the gangs again. Not like my father.\" Vallon shuddered, both men knowing just how intertwined their stories were. All three of them were staring at Monk in surprise. Monk wondered if he was going to be attacked, but knew Vallon would kill them before he killed Monk. There was too much history, and the thought of all that history made him want to weep at this separation between him and Vallon, who he had regarded as a friend and brother in Ireland. Vallon spoke again, \"So what will you do?\" Monk smiled in relief at the lack of hostility, \"Find a place and run a business.\" Happy Jack nodded, \"Fair enough. And what if we could use yer services?\" Jack was smarter than he seemed, Monk thought. He knew Monk was still useful as a mercenary and a fighter. Monk wondered how much he could blacken his soul before stepping over his ideals. Monk sighed, \"There's two things that drive men in this world. God and money. You can't offer me God.\" McGloin spat on the ground, \"Very well. You go and enjoy yerself working straight.\" Monk gave one last grin, \"I'm a crook like you. The difference is I don't bend further with the times.\" McGloin's look darkened, \"Oy, I can only take so much guff from a man.\" Monk nodded, \"Ay well, I'll let you continue acting the maggot on someone else time.\" McGloin, who did not believe he'd been behaving foolishly at all, turned a beet red with anger. Nevertheless, he let Monk go as the young man walked away. Monk headed back to the Five Points, but as he walked along, he suddenly ducked into an alleyway and roared in anger. He let out the emotions that had been festering in his guts ever since he'd last looked Vallon in the eye. The man had been such a good friend and had meant a lot to him over the years. Now their closeness was over, for Vallon would immerse himself in the gang life, as he'd done in Ireland. Cuffing away at tears, Monk wondered what he'd do now. What was he to do? He was seventeen, strong, stubborn, and bound by nothing other than the fact that he was alone and without friends. Well, almost. \"\" \"\" \"\" \" \"\"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \" Monk hurried along through the streets, his rucksack pounding along on his back and his shillelagh still looped in his hand. The money he'd earned from the job would have been jingling in his pocket had he not put it in a small sack along with strips of cloth to muffle their clinking. He hurried on, oblivious of who was in his way. He ran out of a desperation that filled a man when he knew that he was facing his last resort. Monk wondered what he would do if this didn't work out the way he hoped. He stared at the buildings he passed by, trying to remember if he was going the right way or not. It hadn't been too long ago since he'd seen them. Monk's feet felt like individual lead weights, having run all the way from the harbour to here. He was sure that he would be able to find it, there was no way he could miss it now after all he'd been through. He bumped into a very wealthy-looking official. He looked at Monk with much irritation and annoyance, \"Watch yourself lad!\" Monk stared at him wildly, \"What time is it sir?\" He gasped with air as he waited for the official to pull out one of those expensive pocket watches that the city had begun to sell in a higher quantity. The man looked at Monk again, \"Quarter to midnight.\" Monk thanked the man and ran along. After a minute he cursed himself for not asking where the pub was. He needn't have bothered though. He was still cursing himself when it came into view. Monk stopped and stared. It was the same still, only with fewer customers at this time of day. Monk suddenly drank in all the details. The pub was lit more than any other building around it. It seemed to shine with another sheen altogether by the fact that he needed this place now more than any time before today. To think that this had been the first place he'd stayed at since landing in America. It was also the place that could save him from being a destitute wanderer. The first person he'd truly met in America worked here, and he had fallen in love with her over the course of the day. It had been like divine intervention that he'd seen her again and again. Was she still here? Or was she asleep? He'd have to wait for the next day, and the thought was too much to bear. He stepped forward, and in shock, stopped again. She was there. Maggie stood at one of the tables, wiping it down with a rag. In the light, she seemed to shine. Monk's heart pounded in his chest so hard it hurt. He stared at her with the love he'd felt but had been suppressing in front of the others. He took a step forward, afraid to be unable to walk to her. With one step, though, he took another, and another, until he was almost running for her. He called out her name in his joy and fear. She turned in shock, then saw who it was, and her look turned into bemusement. He should have stopped just short of colliding with her, and he should have explained himself completely. He should have told her of his plight, and explained his actions when he'd last seen her. He should have listened to her answer politely and then asked the question he most yearned to ask. Then an answer would be given, and he would go on from there. He had no time for that. He had no words to describe it. His half-admitted feelings were only just full-fledged. He was a young man not even in his prime, and she was so beautiful. Grabbing her around her middle, he swept her off her feet and gave her a passionate kiss. Time seemed to freeze. He kissed her deeply, feeling no response from her. Then after a beat that seemed to extend into ten minutes, she suddenly fiercely grabbed the back of his neck with two hands and kissed him back. He was tired as a race horse, but he would have held her there forever to keep the moment. He would have killed for her at that moment. He would have crossed Hell for her at that moment. His joy could not be recorded properly. He suddenly put her down, though. She stared up at him with shining eyes, breathing heavily for air. She spoke softly, \"So I'm to assume you were successful?\" Monk paused, wondering if there was a trick in that, then spoke again, \"I'm going to try and live my life without depending on the gangs. I'll have a life that I'll defend with my shillelagh and my honour. I'll follow God's ways as best as a flawed man can do, and I love you.\" Maggie laughed at the last part, \"Jesus, Monk, you really need to find a better nickname than that.\" She suddenly embraced him and kissed him again. Monk heard ironic applause from the others watching this, and didn't give a damn.[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine Monk was readily accepted by Maggie's foster father as a good worker. Of course, he was given the job of being a bouncer for the place. Even at seventeen, Monk was a well-built man with a fearsome weapon. Monk privately wondered whether people thought the notches represented men that he had killed. Of course, that was not the case; his father had done that. Monk had yet to kill a man with this weapon. For the next year, he worked in the pub, earning his keep through the many drunks he would kick out of the pub, or the gangsters he kept away. He also kept a room downstairs, as far away from Maggie as the parents could manage without being rude. While Maggie would have loved to share her bed with Monk, her mother- a devout Catholic- had strongly objected to this. Monk himself knew that it was the right thing, as much as he longed to hold Maggie as a lover. During the course of the year that he worked, he became well acquainted with a fellow bouncer that Maggie's foster father had hired. The man's name was Redmund Sirocco. Redmund was twenty-one, married, and settled in a house not too far from the pub. He had been born in New York to Irish immigrants, and he was interested in stories of Dublin and Ireland from Monk. Monk liked Redmund; the man was a sound thinker, sharp with his wits, and fierce in combat. He was a part-time member of the Roach Guards, and he was able to provide Monk with information on them. And about Vallon. Monk tried to contact Vallon in the first few months, but never seemed to get through to him. After meeting Redmund, he would speak to Redmund about talking to Vallon for him. Redmund became the middle man in their conversations, but the message became more and more infrequent as time passed. Vallon was becoming heavilly involved with the Roach Guards as they competed for power and wealth with the Bowery Boys and other such gangs. Monk stayed out of the conflicts, trying to live honestly and showing himself to be a good man to Maggie's family. He desperately wanted Maggie's mother's blessing, and so he was quite willing to wait and show her what kind of a man he had been raised to be. And he had indeed been raised well. Not just piously by a good mother who believed in morals and higher values, but also as a man who could provide for his family by a flawed but loyal father. Monk had been taken aside early on by Maggie's mother and her husband, and the three of them had talked about Monk and his family. Maggie's mother was a stern, drawn woman that had reminded Monk of his own mother. She approved of Monk's description of his mother; a dear woman who had placed the love and fear of God into her children from an early age and had made them attend Mass. He had served as an altar boy in his early youth, and had been taught prayers in Latin. Then Maggie's mother began asking questions of Monk's father. His father. Monk knew that even if he lived to be a hundred, he would never truly know whether he was proud or disapproved of his father. Certainly he honoured him, as God had decreed, and the man had remained faithful to his family, and had worked honestly enough, but he had also been a drunk and a ruthless fighter in the streets of Dublin. His shillelagh had crushed skulls and broken spines; he had held his position with a ferocity of a true Irishman. As Monk expected, Maggie's mother disapproved of the description, however positive Monk tried to sound in defending his father. She then asked what his first job had been. Monk had smiled as he remembered that happy time in his life. Walter was set to be an apprentice of Cillian's in order to learn the trades of being a barber. However, in the beginning, Walter was mostly busy as a shoe-shiner and a cleaner of the hair that fell onto the floor during Cillian's business. He would often find himself working with Vallon, who had a part-time job as a cleaner of the store or a manager of customers in waiting. The two boys became good friends as they worked together. Seamus would always ask Walter to see the money that he earned, and he would smile at the coins and ruffle his son's hair. He would then take half the money for drinks while instructing Walter to give the rest to his mother. Seamus was part of a gang of Irish Catholics that fought fiercely with the Protestants that came over to try and secure the best business in Dublin. The two religions had long ago made their feud well known, and it seemed that God intended for them to forever be at odds. Walter and Vallon were caught up into it immediately. Both were put through a long education from the church, and they learned about saints, miracles, retribution, and the books of the Bible from the priests. Vallon, being the older one, entered the world of the gangs earlier than Walter, and he certainly made the transition much easier than Walter did. Cillian was impeccable while working. He was always on time, always cleanly dressed, always cordial to his customers and speaking with them in friendly conversation. He was purely respectable in appearance, and if one would tell one of his customers that he was one of the most ruthless assassins of the dark Dublin alleyways, one would not expect much acceptance. But a gang fighter he was. And a great one at that. He and Seamus began to see each other more regularly now that Walter worked as an apprentice, and the partnership benefited both men. It also benefited Vallon and Walter. The two boys became altar boys together at their church, and they both argued whose father would win in a fight against other famous gangsters. Of course, there came a moment when Walter, at age twelve, began to cut people's hair. He had moved up from shining shoes and cleaning, and was starting to learn the art of cutting hair and shaving beards. Cillian showed him everything, all the skills that were required of a barber. Walter learned to trim the hair behind a man's ears, and he learned to shave a cheek without breaking the skin. He also learned to make a clean cut for bloodletting and the like. All the while he made money for his family. Walter's mother was able to get more food for them all, even with the money Seamus spent on drink. She ran a tight, God-fearing family and she would hold hard even if it killed her. Walter's dedication to the church was also getting him a nickname. The other altar boys, amused by Walter's piety, called him Monk. Walter was relieved that it was not a nickname to feel bad about. He knew one boy who had been nicknamed Baill, Gaelic for 'spot', because of the pockmarks that had covered his flesh. In the meantime, Vallon began to flaunt his piety, even in battle. He wore a priest's collar when he got into a fight with local boys like Fin, who never forgave Vallon the beating he had received. He started to be called Priest, for though he loved God, he was not as dedicated to His service as Walter. Thus their nicknames started, and all the while their fathers fought in gang wars.[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten Fourteen months had passed since he had taken on the job of bouncer at Maggie's bar, and Monk's happiness had not abated. A full day's work, good pay, an occasional kiss from Maggie, and the pleasure of the company made him feel like the luckiest man in New York. Redmond Sirocco was a good companion, and Monk would often talk with Redmond, or if he was lucky, Monk would speak with Vallon if their paths crossed. However, Monk felt that there was a rift between them now, one that would not fade off with time. It had started when Monk and Vallon had spoken together a year after Monk had found his job. It had been the first real conversation they had had since splitting ways. Vallon had approached him first. It had been a sunny day, and at dusk, the pink and yellow tints on the clouds added a mysticism to it that only miracles could rival. The sky had been turning dark, and the first torches were being lit. Monk had been off duty, in order to enjoy a drink by himself. He had not seen Vallon coming until the man was in front of him. \"Happy birthday, Monk.\" Monk, in spite of his surprise, had smiled. Vallon had always miscalculated his birthday by about a week or two. In this case, he had been a month late. Nevertheless, Monk got up to greet his old friend, \"Thank ye Vallon. It's good to see you again.\" Vallon nodded, \"Aye. It has. Much has happened since last we spoke directly.\" Monk shrugged, \"Redmond might have told me about it.\" Vallon grimaced, and sat down, \"Can I have a drink with you?\" Monk sat back down, \"Of course. Who would I be to deny you that favour?\" As if on cue, Maggie came hurrying over, completely ignoring two customers she had been taking orders from. Her alertness to Monk's actions was surprising. She had seemed to know when Vallon came to Monk's table. Redmond, who was acting as bouncer at the time, would later say that Maggie had given him a nod when Vallon appeared and headed for Monk, as if to make sure Redmond was alert. Monk smiled tenderly at Maggie, and ordered a drink for him and Vallon. He felt surprisingly protective of her for some reason, as if Vallon were threatening her. He couldn't help but feel uneasy in Vallon's presence, especially since Vallon now carried a vicious short sword around wherever he went. Vallon smiled politely at Maggie, and when she left, he looked back at Monk, \"So how's the engagement?\" Monk shrugged, \"I'm to be watched for my behaviour. To see if I've truly been taught the proper manners of an Irishman. Though in this case, we live in troubled times so Maggie's ma wants me to wait two years.\" Vallon shook his head, \"Two years? That's a while for a man to wait.\" Monk shrugged, \"I'm in no hurry. Besides, I want it to be proper.\" Vallon smiled, \"Still the same as ever, Monk.\" \"Aye. I try to uphold what I was taught.\" Vallon frowned, \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Monk sighed, and unleashed the feelings he was holding in his gut, \"Vallon, I'm not gonna pretend that I respect what you do. Butchering American boys like they're animals.\" \"Oh aye, and you'd do the same if you saw how they treated us like animals.\" Vallon's voice was bereft of the friendliness he had had before. Monk felt uneasier than ever, but continued on, \"This isn't the Protestant war in Dublin, Vallon.\" \"You see, I'm of a different view, Monk. From where I'm standing, it's the same battle.\" Monk shuddered, \"I came to this country to escape that battle.\" \"So did I, Monk,' Vallon replied, 'but the Good Lord wants us to prove our worth in finding a place to live as free men should.\" Monk sighed, \"Well, I've found my place to live.\" He gestured around him, at the bar and the house in the back. At Maggie and Redmond and Maggie's mother, who also worked as a waitress. He had found a home to live in and grow old in, and in the past year, Monk had set aside much of what he had done in Ireland. He had been able to leave behind his past before he had committed the act of murder. Vallon, who had killed people in Dublin and in New York, looked upon Monk with a new light in his eyes, \"You can't run away from life, Monk.\" Monk frowned, \"What the hell's that supposed to mean eh?\" Vallon gave a smile that made Monk think of the old days, \"I mean that I would love to do what you've done here. I'd love to find a family and be able to raise children, and teach them of God's greatness. But I can't.\" \"Why not?\" Monk asked. \"Because evil exists in our world, Monk. I could live with that, but evil is on our doorstep, trying to break through and drive us out for good. That evil must be kept at bay or else it shall consume us all. That evil must be fought before any kind of hope can exist in living peacefully. God may stand and support the righteous, but we're still here on earth, and the Good Lord doesn't always come down to help us. We need to help ourselves as well as trust in God.\" Monk was dumbfounded by this speech, and a deep resentment began to grow in his mind. He had always known that faith in God could not save him from everything that occurred in life. But he had always avoided those wonders in his mind of where God ended and man began. He had not felt comfortable with those questions of God, for they dared to go places where he didn't want to go. He looked at Vallon, \"I can avoid the evil by not being evil. I don't have to run with the gangs anymore. I'm content to stay here and live an honest life. Your father tried that too and he almost succeeded.\" Vallon frowned, but acknowledged the point with a nod, \"Yes he had a respectable home, and a good business, but the man he took them from wasn't so lucky.\" Ignoring Monk's look of surprise, Vallon got up, thanked his old friend for speaking with him, promised to keep in touch, and left. After that encounter, Monk and Vallon couldn't help but feel strained in their relationship with each other. There was something blocking them from bonding like before. But Monk was not too worried. Vallon was plunging headlong into a world that he had come here to escape from. He had a new family, and would become a husband in time, and then he would fulfill a dream of opening up his own barbershop, and he would prosper in that thing that was dubbed the American dream.[Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven \"My name is Mr. Antoon. I have a proposition for you.\" Monk looked intently at Mr. Antoon. The man certainly looked like he had promise. The man was dressed in a fine coat that would have been torn to pieces in the Five Points. His face was unshaven, yes, but it had a strength showing out of it, a lean hunger for power. Monk continued to cut the man's hair. Antoon could speak freely due to the fact that nobody else was in the shop this early. Most people had work to do, and besides, Monk had the unfortunate luck of being in the Five Points. A few song lyrics floated in through the open window. Monk cursed as he realized it was another troop of Bill's bunch. Ever since their victory over Vallon five years ago they had been insufferable. Not that they had been the best of sorts before the damn wars. Mr. Antoon spoke up again, \"The Irish are scattered. The Dead Rabbits are outlawed, and Bill is busy securing his empire. It is not in my best interests that this continues.\" Monk refused to be distracted from cutting the man's hair with talk of what was going on in the Five Points. He had no interest in the affairs of the Dead Rabbits, and not a week went by when he didn't look at Vallon's special razor and wonder why he'd gone through the trouble of keeping it. But for some reason, Monk just couldn't throw it away either. He worked his way through the man's oily locks that turned his naturally gold coloured hair to a thick walnut shade. Monk reminded himself to ask the man if he wanted to have his hair washed before he left. \"You want a shave as well?\" He asked the man. Antoon grinned and nodded, \"I'll take on, thanks.\" He put a few more coins onto the counter in front of him from his pocket. Monk began applying shaving cream to the man's face. Antoon spoke up again, \"I said I have a proposition for you.\" \"I heard you before,' Monk said, 'but what exactly are you referring to?\" \"I'm referring to resurrecting the Dead Rabbits and taking back what's ours.\" Monk paused in surprise, \"Ours?\" \"The Five Points belonged to us when Priest Vallon ran the place. He was a legend, and he commanded the respect of the Irish,\" Antoon said, \"In his day, we could expect our kind to look out for each other. Since his death, the Dead Rabbits are gone and splintered off. The other Irish gangs are weakening. Bill's gangs get stronger by the month. Soon we will be unable to fight back.\" With the razor in his hand, Monk simply stood there, taking in all the words Mr. Antoon was saying, trying to garner something of a view on the man. What did Antoon want? Monk looked at the man, \"What does all this have to do with me, eh?\" Beneath the shaving cream, Antoon smiled, \"You and Vallon got off the goddamn boat together.\" Monk looked at the man curiously, \"How do you know that?\" \"I was there too.\" The razor fell from Monk's hand and clattered to the floor. Monk bent down to pick it up, and began to shave the man, silencing him. Antoon ceased to speak, not wanting to get cut by the razor, but his eyes remained fixed upon Monk. The burly Dubliner focused on his work, carefully shaving his customer to the best quality that he could. Monk stopped for a moment, \"That's the truth?\" Antoon nodded, \"I swear on the Holy Trinity and my soul's right to enter heaven that I was there.\" As Monk took the information in, Antoon spoke again, \"Meet me tonight, where Vallon perished.\" It was a warm night for New York. Monk stood still, his shillelagh ready in his hands if need be. No Irish gangs roamed Paradise Square anymore. Instead, the gangs were true blue Americans. They didn't seem that interested in him, though, for Monk had no trouble standing in the square. Mr. Antoon appeared out of the shadows, \"I say we rally the Irish gangs and take back what is ours before it's too late.\" Monk grimaced, \"And who'll be the one to do that?\" Antoon smiled knowingly. Monk paused, and then spoke again, \"I'm not a patriot or a hero. I don't pretend to be Vallon's successor. That's what Amsterdam's for.\" Antoon paused, \"What?\" Monk nodded, \"Amsterdam Vallon. Son of Priest Vallon. He's growing up in hiding somewhere.\" Antoon laughed nervously, \"How did Bill let something like that go under his nose?\" \"It wasn't under his nose. He fucking ordered the little boy to be given to the law and given an education. I don't know where he is or what else Bill planned.\" \"God in his heaven, but does Bill know about him?\" \"Maybe, maybe not. I know I'm aware of him, and when he comes back to New York, which God knows he will, I'll be there for him.\" Antoon paused, \"You're loyal to the boy.\" Monk shrugged, \"I owe it to Vallon to take care of his wee son.\" \"So why not get him to stay with you?\" \"He's safer in there than he is with me.\" \"Maybe not. What if Bill decides he's not worth the trouble?\" Monk looked around as some loud footsteps pounded down Cross, \"He's been in there for three years. He's nine years old, he's no fucking threat to anyone but himself.\" \"Not for long. When he gets out, they'll come for him.\" Monk looked at Antoon, \"You know you've got a strange fascination for Vallon's boy.\" Antoon shrugged, \"I want him safe, so I do. When's he scheduled to come back to the Five Points?\" Monk didn't even think about it, \"I have no idea. I don't know when he gets out of wherever they're keeping him and even when he does get out, who's to say that he'll come here?\" Antoon laughed, \"A minute ago you said you were sure that he'll be back. Are you protecting him from me?\" Monk stepped forward, \"I may not have been a Dead Rabbit or any of those Americanized Irish gangsters, but Vallon was an old friend of mine, and regardless of what he did in his life, his son's another matter. And I'm frankly starting to wonder if I can trust you, Antoon.\" Antoon smiled, \"Yeah, go ahead. Turn on me and strike me down with all your might. The greatest street fighter in the Five Points, they call you. Great enough to beat Bill himself, they say. I'm sure I'd be easy enough to kill.\" Monk frowned darkly but did not say anything. Antoon turned to leave, \"I'll come back for a shave in two weeks. Best one in the Five Points, I'll say that.\" Monk watched him leave, and he wondered what the man was planning.[Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve Monk sat with Maggie as they watched the sun emerge in all its golden glory over the Atlantic ocean. They had worked out that Maggie had turned seventeen, and Monk's two year period of waiting was almost at an end. To celebrate, they got up early to watch the sunrise together. Maggie's mother had found no fault with Monk in all the time that he had spent working in the pub. He had carried himself responsibly, and his honesty had impressed both Maggie's mother and her stepfather. Monk had earned a reputation as being a tough man to cross, and he was vicious in enforcing order upon the pub. Drunks were given one warning, and if they refused that courtesy, were thrown out by either the 19 year old Monk, or the 23 year old Redmond Sirocco. Both young men were being toughened by the streets of New York, but Monk could proudly say that he was part of no gang. As the sun turned the sky red, Maggie rested her head on Monk's forearm, \"It's beautiful, innit?\" \"Aye,' Monk replied, 'Almost makes me forget what kind of world we've made out of God's own Earth.\" Maggie sighed, \"Ach, Monk, let's not bring all that up for the moment. We're supposed to be rejoicing.\" Monk smiled and put his arm on Maggie's shoulder, \"Of course I'm rejoicing! We'll be together soon, and one day in the far future we'll be in charge of that pub. Why, I've even thought that I might change the name to 'McGinn's'.\" He began to smile, but suddenly found that a niggling thought in the back of his mind prevented him from embracing the idea. Maggie sensed the discomfort in Monk. She suddenly sat up and looked at him, \"But Monk, are you no longer interested in yer other idea?\" Monk paused thoughtfully. He had told her about his trade. Of course he had. He had her mother and stepfather as well. They had asked him if he planned to go back to that trade. Monk still wasn't sure. He hadn't found any property that seemed well suited, and even if he did, he had no amount of money that would pay for it. His savings were small, as he was often paid through his lodgings and food. \"I'm not sure about it, anymore, Maggie. It seems like I don't have the means to do it. And besides, the pub will be a fine profit for the pair of us. Finnegan's got no other children, we'll be set to inherit the place.\" Maggie nodded, \"Aye. But are you sure that you'd be happy?\" Monk shrugged, \"After all I've been through, even the smallest bit of happiness seems like God's own miracle.\" \"\"\" \"\" \" \" \"\" \"\"\" \"\"\"\" \"\"\" \"\"\" \" \"\"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" As the morning began, the pair hurried back to the pub so that they could prepare for the first customers. Maggie's mother usually worked at night, so she was sleeping in, but Finnegan was awake and about. Finnegan was a tired-looking man in his middle age, losing what little grey hair he had left on his head. Looking up from his task of wiping the tables, he was surprised to see Monk and Maggie hurrying up, \"Oy, where have you two been?\" Monk pointed towards the docks, \"We were watching the sun come up. That's all.\" Finnegan frowned suspiciously, but said no more of it. Monk had had so many opportunities to betray his trust, but Monk had never done so before. Finnegan had learned to trust the young Irishman through experience. All the same, the idea of sneaking out just to watch the sunrise seemed rather daft to such a man as Finnegan. New York City was a busy place even so early in the morning. It was no time before a few early birds and some sleepy-looking night owls came in for a drink or something to eat. Monk kept a beady eye on the customers, searching for common thief practices amongst the customers. At one point, Maggie handed Monk a container filled with milk from the small kitchen, \"Here. A sample of some breakfast later.\" Monk kissed her chastely on the cheek in thanks before draining his cup, \"So how much longer do ye think before we can set a formal engagement?\" Maggie shrugged, \"I'm not sure. Haven't asked yet, to be honest.\" Monk nodded, \"Ah well, it cannae be long now.\" Suddenly raised voices reached the young couple's ears, and they turned to see where it was coming from. Finnegan was standing at the doorway of the pub, his arms folded defensively as he stared meekly at a man standing in front of him. The man was yelling and cursing, poking Finnegan's chest with his accusing finger. Monk instinctively started forward, grabbing his shillelagh where it leaned against a nearby post. Maggie hurried to make sure that there was no other disorder amongst the customers. Finnegan saw Monk approaching, \"Walter! Stop right there and go do your job! I don't need any help here!\" There was a note of pleading in his voice, as though he wished that nobody had noticed this confrontation. The other man turned and stared angrily at the young Irishman, who stood his ground with his shillelagh in hand, \"You keep out of this! This is between me and Finnegan!\" The man had a flat American accent, and he wore a black top hat on his head. Monk frowned at the condescension in the man's voice, but knew that he should obey Finnegan, his employer. Reluctantly, he turned and resumed watching the other customers, while the two men continued their conversation, except with much lower voices. Eventually the man left in a huff, pausing once to spit at Monk's feet when he thought Monk wasn't noticing. After the man had turned the bend, Monk looked at Finnegan, who had a humiliated air about him, \"What was that all about?\" Finnegan sighed bitterly, \"Nothing. He's just a man looking to get money that isn't his.\" \"Money?\" Monk was curious. Finnegan shrugged, \"Aye. Money. He's saying that we fall under the territory of the Nativists now. Bloody Americans want a tax on any non-American shops and businesses here. As if they have the bloody right to do so!\" Monk was worried. The gangs were a constant threat, but he had so far been lucky in keeping out of the fight. However, there constantly remained the threat of being swept into their fights. \"What are you gonna do, then?\" Monk asked. Finnegan looked at Monk frankly, and Monk could see the desperation in Finnegan's eyes, \"What am I gonna do? I've got little choice, don't I? Cassius will send his goons after me until I pay up. And while I hate the thought of it, I see no way around this mess. Of course if I do start doing this, it means I'm gonna lose money on this place and it'll only go downhill from there.\" Monk nodded in agreement, but even as he did so, an idea was forming in his head. A way to pay the Nativists back at their own game. But for that, he would have to see an old friend.[Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen \"Well well, Monk. It's been a while since I saw you last.\" \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" \" \" \" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" \"\"\" \" Monk knew that he stood no chance on his own fighting a problem that he did not fully understand. Finnegan was unhelpful, his explanations too simple to explain why now of all times the Nativists were pressing on the neighbourhood. Perhaps a power shift? Had Finnegan offended one of the Nativists? Monk knew that he had to return to the Five Points and find things out for himself. So one day, shillelagh in hand, he had strode into the Five Points, avoiding the Nativists or any of their allies. Primarily, there were the Bowery Boys and the Atlantic Guard, two other American gangs who opposed the immigrants coming to New York. As he moved along, Monk noted the conditions of the buildings he passed. All of them were in some form of disrepair, often with at least one window broken or missing. Animals were in the streets, and the people stank worse than usual. As Monk looked around, he noticed one building that was different from the rest. It was built on a sort of mound. Stairs led up to the building, and there was no other way to reach it. The building looked faded and worn out. Monk wasn't sure what to make of it, as there was no sign that it was a place of business or just a home. A call suddenly broke his train of thought. He looked around to see none other than Happy Jack running towards him. The young Irishman had put on some considerable weight since Monk had last seen him. There was also the beginning of a moustache appearing on Jack's face. \"Hi there, Monk! What are ye doin' here?\" Jack asked as he skidded to a halt. \"I'm looking to have a word with Vallon. Is he around?\" Jack paused, and sighed, \"Well, it's been a while since you saw him, eh?\" \"Aye. So what?\" \"Well... Priest has risen in importance, shall we say. He's The Captain's right-hand man nowadays.\" Monk almost took a step back in surprise, \"So soon?\" Jack shrugged, \"Aye. Captain's taken a liking to him, and he's been a big help in the fight against the Nativists.\" Monk nodded slowly. Certainly he was surprised at Vallon's rise to power in such a short amount of time. But then again, Vallon had always been ambitious. He'd inherited it from his father. Brushing memories of Ireland out of his head, Monk looked at Jack, \"So can I see him? Or is there some kind of ritual I need to fulfill?\" \"\"\" \" \"\"\" \"\"\" \"\"\" \"\"\" \"\"\" Vallon was sitting in the headquarters of the Dead Rabbits, the same building that he and Monk had been brought to by Happy Jack almost two years ago. For a brief moment, Monk felt the entirety of those two years disappear as he embraced Vallon in greetings. Vallon had always acted older than he was, but now it seemed that his age was catching up to him. He looked far more adult-like than the last time Monk had seen him, and he suddenly wondered if his own experiences in New York had made him grow up the same way. Vallon sat down after his first wry comment, and waited for Monk to do the same. Monk noticed that there were five others in the room, including Happy Jack and McGloin. \"How have you been, Vallon?\" \"I've been as well as can be expected. It's been a rough struggle with these so-called Natives, but it's nothing that I haven't been prepared to deal with.\" Monk nodded in understanding, remembering Dublin. \"So what are you here for?\" Vallon asked. \"Are you changing your mind about this city and your place in it?\" \"Not quite that. I need some information that I haven't been able to find by myself.\" The men with Vallon looked at each other bemusedly. McGloin stared at Monk with a suspicious look in his eyes. Vallon was undeterred by this, and cocked his head to the side, \"And what would that be?\" Monk explained about his encounter with Finnegan and the Nativist, and concluding the tale with Finnegan's brief, evasive answers. Vallon smiled knowingly, \"Finnegan's in trouble, so he is. It's a well known fact here.\" Monk didn't say anything, waiting instead for Vallon to continue explaining. \"Finnegan's one for the gambling. And I don't just mean the odd deal with a bookie and whatnot, I mean his very nature. He tries to be responsible about his life and his pub but he isn't taking the gangs into account. So he tried to make appeasements to both sides, hoping that it would keep them both out of the way. Unfortunately, both sides have come to figure it out by this point. We aren't that concerned, because we've got bigger problems for now, but that Nativist boss Bill Cassius is a right thrifty bastard. He's put that young lieutenant of his, Bill, on the job of collecting dues. An' as you may remember, young Bill's got a right hatred of the Irish. So he's figured that expanding the Nativist territory will force Finnegan to pay twice as much to him and nothing to us.\" Monk was surprised by this explanation. He had not realized that Finnegan had been paying tribute to the gangs. Though as Monk thought of it, it would certainly explain Finnegan's nervous disposition, as well as the idea that there never seemed to be that much money available despite the pub's reasonable success. \"So what's going to happen to the pub? And Finnegan?\" Monk asked. Vallon shrugged, \"Who knows? It's not in our power. We're outnumbered for now and we have enough troubles here in the Points. Finnegan will have to pay the tribute, but I don't think it will matter.\" \"Why not?\" Monk asked, alerted to Vallon's last seven words. \"Because Bill will most likely evict him by force. And he'll end up doing the same to you, Monk.\" Monk felt a deep anger growing in his guts. Finnegan meant no trouble to anyone, and now the Nativists were going to take away his livelihood? \"There must be something I can do, Vallon!\" Vallon's mild neutrality suddenly faded, replaced by genuine concern and regret, \"I'm sorry, Monk. But I can't help you this time. I can only suggest that you avoid the matter by moving somewhere else.\" \"How? And where?\" Monk stood up, bewildered and frustrated that these were the only bits of advice that Vallon could give him. Behind Vallon, McGloin put his hand on the handle of his knife, as though he expected Monk to start swinging his shillelagh. Vallon took no notice of McGloin's reactions, but gazed sadly at his friend, \"I'd offer to help you with that if I could, but maybe there's a place for you to go? Does Finnegan have any kin that could help him?\" \"He's got nobody but me. I'll be engaged to Maggie soon, which will make me his stepson-in-law or something along those lines.\" Vallon stood up in surprise, \"What? So it's happening after all?\" Monk nodded slowly, realizing that he and Vallon had been far more out of touch than he'd realized. He smiled, \"Aye.\" Beaming, Vallon embraced Monk heartily, \"Congratulations!\" For a brief moment, Monk felt the urge to laugh at his good fortune, but then he remembered what they had just been talking about and his mirth left him. He and Maggie would be destitute once the Nativists took over Finnegan's pub. What then? It was then that Monk remembered what Maggie had brought up. His plan to become a professional barber. He had the training and experience, he just needed the supplies and a safe location. Was this a sign that he should go after this plan? But what about Finnegan and Maggie's mother? He would have to provide for them, and would Finnegan's pride allow for that? Vallon suddenly spoke up, \"What are you thinking?\" Monk shrugged, \"I was thinking that I could finally follow in your father's footsteps.\" At the mention of his father, Vallon seemed to look more sombre, \"He would have been proud tae see that.\" Monk nodded, \"Aye, well I don't know how or when or where yet. I still need to figure out what to do about this whole Nativist problem.\" One of the Irishmen behind Vallon suddenly replied, \"Aye, that's what the rest of us are dealing with too!\" Ignoring the laughter, Monk continued talking to Vallon, \"Listen, if you find word of any new location that we can move Finnegan to- a safer place where he can rely on his countrymen to help out- then let me know. In the meantime, God go with you.\" Vallon nodded appreciatively, \"Very well. And thank you.\" Monk shook Vallon's hand one last time, and headed out of the room.

It had landed smartly on the handle of the fireplace poker in its rack. He stalked over and seized it, unsuccessfully trying to suppress a grudging good shot in his mind. He wheeled round at Eliza. \"You VIXEN! Complaining that you thought I would strike you, which I never would, and then turning round and striking me first! Treacherous wretch!\" \"Your hat. I meant to hit your hat.\" Was she smiling? \"The devil you did, you...\" \"At any rate I succeeded in getting your attention.

And you dare to enter my presence under that circumstance and ask for employment! You selfish...!\" \"Save your righteous rage, Professor, I'm afraid I broke it off with Freddy about an hour ago.\" He recognized the enunciation, projection, and lowering of pitch that he taught her when he had complained her \"proper\" voice was too soft, and now regretted offering that lesson. She sighed. \"You were right on that account. I was just using his affection to solve a problem, and that was not at all fair to him. It was hard on the poor boy, but I think I saved him some heartache in the future. Hopefully the experience will help him grow up a bit.\" \"Your father, then.\" \"Really, Professor?\" \"Right. Of course not. Well then, where on earth are you getting money for lodging?\" \"From my position as your scheduler, of course.\" Oh you poor silly girl , he thought as he grinned widely. \"And what makes you so certain that I would hire you, after you have treated me so villainously?\" \"Because I know you will be needing your appointment book at some time soon, maybe even tomorrow.\" Higgins paused, stared, and bolted to the desk. The appointment book was not on the desk, nor was it in the top drawer. \"You snatched it! That, young lady, is a matter for the police!\" \"I did no such thing. I merely put it... did not put it in the usual spot during preparations for the ball last evening. I thought nothing of it at the time.\" He knew that now he could never turn her over to the police. He knew she knew he would never turn her over to the police. \"Appointment books are lost all the time,\" he said hastily. \"I'll get in touch with my colleagues and students and ask them to remind me of the engagements. I could reconstruct the entire upcoming year in a week's time at the most.\" \"Of course, Professor,\" she smiled. \"All you need is your address book.\" His jaw flapped weakly for a moment. \"Which is... of course... where the... Oh, bloody hell, Eliza, you're hired! Eight SHARP tomorrow morning and NO EXCUSES.\" He slammed some coins down on the desk. She took no outward notice of the shocking language, gracefully placed the coins in her purse, turned to face Higgins, and grasped his hand, shaking it cordially. \"Thank you very much, Professor; you will not regret it.\" Their eyes met more than briefly, and as she turned and left, he found it more and more difficult to remain properly angry with her.[Chapter 2] Assumptions Higgins spent most of the evening pacing about the house, occasionally and half-heartedly looking under odd piles of papers and books. At about nine Pickering breezed in. \"Good news, Higgins, I have an old friend at the Home Office who has put three men on the case. She's as good as found.\" \"She's back.\" \"There you are! Jolly good! Knew I could count on old Boozy. Damn fine afternoon over at the club, remembering our old... ah... events. So where is Eliza?\" \"She's not here.\" \"Confound it, Higgins, make up your mind, is she here or not?\" \"She's taken lodgings at a women's boarding house.\" \"A bit hard on her to throw her out like that, wouldn't you say?\" \"I did NOT throw her out.\" He glared at Pickering. \"She says if she is going to work for me she would rather live elsewhere, and I suppose there is some merit in that. I'm paying her sixteen shillings a week to be a secretary and scheduler.\" \"But did you have to drive so hard a bargain? The typewriter girl at the club gets one-and-three, although she's been there a few years, and she is a lightning fast typist, almost as fast as one can talk, it's really a marvel how the technique's come along since the days of...\" \"ELIZA...\" Higgins' outburst silenced Pickering. \"...suggested the wage herself. She doesn't feel her spelling is good enough to command a greater wage.\" \"She must have done that out of consideration for your position then. I understand, right sporting of her.\" \"Well, I don't! Consideration for my position! What about me does she need to worry about?\" \"Oh, come Higgins, it's fairly obvious you do have some feelings for her. Now don't protest. Your actions betray your words, and your rationalisations are just a bit too strenuous.\" \"That's a bit rich coming from an old bachelor like you.\" \"And where in hell are you getting this old bachelor nonsense? I thought I'd heard you say that. before. You've read Spoken Sanskrit , didn't you see the dedication?\" Higgins paled and suddenly could not look Pickering in the eye. Higgins had written fourteen books and never had any use for dedications. Whenever any other book came into his hand he skipped the front matter and went straight for the meat of the work. He slowly crossed to a bookshelf, carefully pulled out Spoken Sanskrit, and turned the first pages over. Of course. To my own Millicent, with my love and gratitude forever. He forced out words he hardly ever said: \"Pickering, I'm terribly sorry.\" \"Millie was born in India. Her father was the colonel in my regiment. I met her at an officers' ball. She had such a great affection for the place and the people. Some said too much. We were married fifteen years. No children, so she was every child's favourite aunt. She was actually my best informant for the book, and proofread the manuscript. About ten years ago, while I was away on an inspection tour, she caught cholera... \" Pickering was stone faced. There was nothing more to say. All Higgins could think of to do was go to the mantle, pour two glasses of port, and offer one to Pickering. \"I shall try to be more attentive in the future.\" Pickering graciously took the glass. \"Hardly your fault, old chap. I shouldn't avoid talking about past times like that. We had fifteen wonderful years, which is more than many men get. More than many men get the opportunity to have.\" He toasted Higgins with a sly smile. Higgins hesitantly returned the toast, tried to get his bearings, and tossed back his port. He needed to steady his nerves. The wind had changed direction entirely too many times today.[Chapter 3] DISCLAIMER 1: I do not own any of the characters or any portion of the script/score of My Fair Lady.

Eliza Doolittle was proud that she no longer really needed to ask Mrs Pearce to proofread her letters, but she asked her anyway, out of respect. She enjoyed diving into the multivolume Oxford Dictionary that Higgins owned. It gave her ammunition in her somewhat peppery discussions with the professor. She recalled that he once said that arguments could be \"fun\", which she did not believe at the time. But she now allowed that possibility since she had started winning a few of them. Eliza had been Higgins' assistant for nearly a year. She gave all the books and the newspapers that crossed her desk a good looking over, and took as much as she could from them. She was also meeting a great number of fascinating people, from worlds she never knew existed, come to collaborate with and learn from Higgins. Between what Higgins and Pickering had taught her and what she realized was the resourcefulness she had had all along, she thought she could do anything. Some days she felt like the world was her plaything. And some days she felt like the only thing she truly wanted she could not have. The bell rang. The postman, right on time. \"Afternoon, Miss Doolittle, the governor here?\" \" Off at a meeting, Mr. Floyd. How is your little family today?\" \"Perfect, perfect! The missus and the baby are settling in, and little Ned hasn't decided to be jealous yet, so he's still a help.\" \" You're a lucky fellow, Mr. Floyd.\" \" Oh, don't worry, Miss Doolittle, a pretty and capable lady like yourself, your time will come. You have two from India and one from Portugal in this batch. Good day to you.\" He's entirely too happy for a sleep-deprived dad with a squalling baby at home, thought Eliza, scowling. She willed up memories of caring for her neighbors' brats as she was growing up, but it didn't work. Higgins kept getting in the way. All the world out there beckoning her, and it was that acerbic, self-centered old scholar she couldn't be without. She deplored his rationalising, yet his clever talk and wordplay were almost like absinthe to her. So here she was, her own prisoner. But she had to be careful, because he could sack her at a moment's notice if things got too uncomfortable for him. She cursed herself for allowing Higgins the upper hand in this arrangement. &&&&& Henry Higgins stormed round the corner onto Wimpole Street. Today he preferred walking to a cab, it wasn't that much slower, and he was still agitated about his Philologics Association meeting. He thought being asked to fill the vacant seat on the journal committee was an honor; now he wondered how many people had said no first and why he was not aware of that. He had envisioned seeing cutting-edge research in advance of publication, and instead he was inundated with politicking and petty territorialism. He looked forward to returning home and unbottling his complaints on Eliza. No matter that she was frequently stubborn, or that her opinions often differed (sometimes strenuously) from his, she generally was a patient listener, even sympathetic at surprising moments. Eliza. He recalled the conversation he overheard in the front hall before the meeting came to order. \" Higgins. I'd pity his wife. Is he married?\" \" No. He should probably marry that assistant of his, though. They already bicker like an old married couple.\" \" No, I've seen her. She can do a lot better than him.\" General subdued merriment. His sour mood returned. How long could this last? Certainly Eliza would move on eventually. She was bright and able, too spirited for an old academic like him, easily one good row away from giving notice, and then where would he be? Despite all he had achieved in his life, it would feel like starting from nothing again. He couldn't help feeling that Eliza had the upper hand in this arrangement. &&&&& Higgins opened the front door and saw Eliza at her desk in the front hall. His mood lifted just a bit. She looked like she had some good news. Maybe his three o'clock cancelled. \"Good afternoon, Professor.\" She cheerily handed him a small stack of letters. \"How was the meeting?\" \" Dreadful. Absolutely dreadful.\" Higgins sorted the stack. \"If they aspire to being the premier society for the study of linguistics in the world, they need each one of them to stop being so blasted parochial. Hm. Delhi. By George, it's from Pickering!\" He tore the letter open. \"Excellent, excellent, he's come into some family property in Harrow. Says he'll be returning to England for good in about two months. Splendid!\" \" So I've heard.\" Did she know everything? \"And how did you find out?\" \" He sent me a postcard.\" She blithely waved a hand-tinted photo of the Taj Mahal under an impossibly blue sky. \" Yes, well, I imagine you'll be happy to see him back in town after dealing with me on your own for ten months.\" \" It's built my character.\" Eliza smiled defiantly. Higgins snorted. \"And you'll be happy to see him as well, won't you, Professor?\" \" He's certainly always good for a chuckle. Not always intentionally, poor fellow.\" \" You could do with a chuckle from him now. Your three o'clock is here.\" \" Lord give me strength.\" \" And Mr Parsons has a request. It seems that the meeting with his fiancee's parents has been moved ahead, and he wishes to ask if you would consider giving him a discount on the per-hour rate if he takes two hours of lessons a day instead of one.\" \" Discount? The man's from Newfoundland. I should be doubling the rate. Honestly, you might think that the letters T-H are forbidden there from appearing together in public\" \" I think you should do it. You're bound to succeed with him, and the word of mouth will bring more business in the door.\" \" Business is good. I can afford to turn away a client if it is a question of my sanity.\" \" Your reputation, then. You've already given him two lessons, and it's only for a fortnight. Certainly getting a Newfoundlander to speak English is a significant achievement!\" Eliza said wryly. \" Already done. Mulholland wrote a paper on it three years ago.\" \" Then your reputation as a gentleman of your word! You have already agreed to take him as a student.\" \" Yes, and he's trying to get me to agree to twice our agreed time!\" \" It would be a valuable show of good will toward a student...!\" \" I don't care about good will!\" shouted Higgins. \" And that's why you hired me!\" shouted Eliza. \"To care FOR you!\" They stared at each other. It happened again. Certain phrases or words slipped out at odd times, phrases that threatened to open the door between them and let their real desires see the day. It happened twice yesterday. Eliza had offhandedly commented that the calendar indicated that Higgins belonged to the Philologics Association next Tuesday through Thursday, and he said he would write a request he had for Cambridge the next Friday \"when I belong to you again.\" Then after tea Eliza, annoyed with his delay in writing the request, said he needed to \"propose quickly while you have a chance.\" This of course was nothing compared to luncheon at Higgins' mother's home the day before. Mrs. Higgins was fond of Eliza and had chided her son for not bringing her along more often. Eliza graciously replied that she was often busy and not available to accompany him, and he countered with, \"Nonsense, I can have her anytime I want.\" Mrs. Higgins coughed into her napkin for some time after that. \" ...for you, in a manner of speaking,\" Eliza mumbled, red-faced. \" In a manner of speaking,\" acknowledged Higgins, red-faced. More staring. They were both uncharacteristically silent. Eliza set her jaw and stood up. \"We need to talk. About everything. We can't keep letting... unsaid things... get in the way.\" \" Exactly!\" Higgins broke eye contact and started to pace. \"Air it all out. Put everything on the table and decide forward courses of action. It's the prudent and necessary thing to do.\" \" But not now, because Mr Parsons is in the next room.\" \" Oh, please!... Very well, you're the scheduler, let's schedule it. When are you- rather, when am I free?\" Eliza turned over a page in the calendar, then turned it back. \"Today at five o'clock, assuming this lesson goes that long?\" Higgins growled and struggled with his control. \"Yes! Yes!\" he barked. \"Five it is! Could have been four, but I seem to be busy!\" He flopped into a chair, took a few deep breaths, and looked at Eliza. \"I will endeavour to be calmer. I know this is important.\" Eliza smiled a bit. \"You can start at five by telling me all about the lesson.\" The study door opened. An impeccably dressed and pathetically eager young man put his head out into the front hall. \"Ah, Professor, you're back! She's settled, den?\" Higgins sighed, put his hand to his forehead and said carefully, \"Who is settled, Mr Parsons?\" \" She's settled dat you'll be teaching me anodder...\" Higgins gave Parsons a withering glare over his shoulder. Parsons trembled a bit. \"An... anottthhhher oar... OW-er.\" Higgins looked at Eliza again, then slowly stood up to go into the study. \"Another hour, yes, Mr Parsons, I will. We shall need it to discuss your pronoun use. As a rule, 'she' is ONLY to be used for people, pets, and occasionally boats, is that understood?\" The door to the study closed. Eliza took a slightly tremulous breath. Well, this is what she had been wanting for so long, and now it was imminent. Things would be settled one way or the other after this evening. She looked down at the calendar. She would write it in, just in case anyone called, and also to make it more real to her. What to call it? \"Appointment?\" Too vague. \"Planning meeting.\" She wrote it and immediately erased it. It assumed there was something to plan, and that seemed dangerously optimistic. \"Discern future...\" Oh no no no, that sounded like a solicitor. \"Assignation...\" What was she thinking! She scribbled that out and then erased it. Now think, she scolded herself, before you make a hole in the page. If not in content, why won't this be the same in form as any other discussion you have with him? In the book she wrote, \"Debate.\"[Chapter 4] Busy times. Sorry for the delay. This was also a little squirrlier to write than I anticipated! I do not own the characters to My Fair Lady or Pygmalion; I do these stories in tribute to Shaw, Lerner & Loewe. The little train slowly inched up Mont Blanc and readily came to a stop at the small wooden platform and shed in the meadow. Eliza bounced out of the train in a bundle of nervous energy. \"I'm here! In the Alps! This is amazing! It looks like every fairy tale you've ever heard! Oh, that track was so narrow I thought the train would fall off the side of the mountain!\" Henry collected the rucksacks and moved more slowly. \"I know you did. Everyone aboard knows you did.\" Eliza took a rucksack from Henry and slung it onto her back. \"I'm so sorry, but I do feel so much better with my feet on solid ground. Now let's not waste another second. Here's the trail. I've stared at the map so much I feel like I know the place. Off we go!\" And over the stile she went with Henry struggling to catch up. So it went for the next hour, Eliza constantly scrambling forward to discover the next view or rill or rock formation, and Henry behind shouting \"Blast it, Eliza, how is a soul to take in a place if you won't stand still for a bit?\" Finally she came to a meadow at the foot of a cliff, which gently sloped down before it dropped off into some trees. Further down, there were green farms, a small river, and the lower terminus of the railroad in town. Above, snow-capped crags and gleaming slopes dared travelers on. Eliza, however, proclaimed, \"Here. This is the place.\" She removed the blanket from her rucksack, and spread it out with Henry's help. Then she sighed and flopped down onto it on her back. Henry looked nervously up the trail to see if anyone had seen Eliza's unladylike display, and then sat on the blanket, cautious but glad for the rest. Eliza glanced at him. \"Oh, do lie down and look up, Henry, the clouds are incredible!\" \"Really, what if someone were to come upon us like this?\" \"You're nowhere near me. Now come on, there's a good fellow.\" He was near enough for Eliza to swat his left arm out from under him and send him backwards. White and grey clouds glided serenely across a magnificent blue sky. They were so sharply defined, Henry felt like he could catch one in his hand. He looked over at Eliza who was taking deep breaths. \"Are you all right?\" \"Never better. I am positively drunk on pure clean air. I cannot get enough of it.\" \"That would certainly explain the giddiness.\" \"This,\" said Eliza, flinging her arms above her, \"is why I wanted to come here, not Paris or Venice or Rome, but someplace without so many people, or so much smoke. And mountains with snow on them! I know it seems silly, but that's always been a dream of mine. And to be able to share it...\" Their hands clasped tightly in between them on the blanket. Each of them seemed afraid to say anything further. Whenever they discussed their relationship in too much detail, it would degenerate into an argument. Even their engagement was born of an argument. Henry sighed as he thought about that odd day. After the first tentative words about considering marriage, they were suddenly blaming each other for a lack of freedom! Henry had bellowed, \"I answer to no one regarding the conduct of my business, do you understand?\" And Eliza had just picked up where she left off earlier that day. \"It's you who don't understand! You answer to everyone you see every day. If you keep mistreating them it's just a matter of time before they answer back.\" \"You have no compunction against answering back.\" \"Of course not! All these tools you've given me, all these abilities you've helped me find, I cannot let them languish now! I will use my skills!\" \"Good heavens, now I'm Frankenstein, with my creation turning against me!\" \"Your creation again! I'm sorry, Professor, but I was already quite thoroughly created when I first came here. And honestly, it sounds like I should be turning away at this time.\" \"Yes, after all that high talk about marriage.\" \"Well, I'm glad we got that straightened out now. Probably for the best.\" \"What's for the best?\" \"My leaving your employ.\" \"You wouldn't dare!\" \"If you won't let me help you there is no sense in my staying on as your assistant. I've saved up a bit, I have some time to look for a situation where I'm free to do the work I'm best at!\" \"And that would be...?\" \"Smoothing out the rough spots, getting people together, getting things to happen, solving problems ... I want to be allowed a bit of a challenge!\" \"A challenge, eh? That's it? Marry me then, damn it!\" shouted Henry. \"All right, I will! You've been warned!\" growled Eliza. And then they glared at each other until they both burst out laughing. It was absurd, but frightfully typical. They enjoyed each other's company, and there was no denying the physical attraction. They were also both exceptionally stubborn, which had always served them well... individually. Eliza, broke the silence and brought Henry's thoughts back to the mountainside. \"I see a little boy teaching a dog to sit up, and an old woman walking with a crooked cane. What do you see in the clouds?\" Henry thought for a moment. \"Over there, that's definitely the statue of Marcus Aurelius on horseback in Rome.\" Eliza rolled her eyes. \"You would.\" Henry sniffed. \"Well, to his right is a young Roman lady in a fairly short toga, but as I am now a married man and should not be looking at other women, I thought it indelicate to mention.\" \"Oh, you are impossible!\" \"You knew that,\" Henry sang. \"I did, I did.\" Eliza affected a pained sigh and smirked a bit. Henry felt happier than he ever thought he could be. He wanted to tell Eliza somehow, but he was no good at lovers' talk. He looked off to his right at the grasses and little wildflowers growing near him. His eye was drawn to something that looked like a daisy, except its petals were rimmed with pink. Still clutching Eliza's hand, he contemplated the flower a while, then reached out and picked it. He sat up and offered it to her. \"It reminds me of you,\" Henry said. \"Unassuming... tenacious... and beautiful.\" Eliza sat up, looked at the flower, looked deeply in Henry's eyes, and smiled. She cradled the flower in her hand for a minute. Henry thought, hoped, that she might put it in her hair or her hat, and was surprised to hear her say, \"Do you have the water flask?\" He handed her the flask and watched as she scraped under the moss next to her, into the thin layer of soil, and covered and watered the base of the stem. Henry was stung. \"I thought you liked flowers.\" \"I do, really, it's just that... Oh, you couldn't have known. I can hardly bear to look at cut flowers anymore. It's nicer to see that they have a chance to keep growing. Please don't worry about it. What you just told me is... it really means so much to me.\" She kissed him on the cheek, but he still pouted. Neither wanted an argument here, it was too beautiful. That there was no argument was, in hindsight, remarkable. But the picnic lunch was quieter than it should have been. The dark cloud over them, like all clouds, would not last. But each continued to find the other completely baffling.[Chapter 5] Some relative discomfort Does Higgins' mother have a first name? I don't have access to the movie right now, and Shaw did not mention one in Pygmalion, unless I missed it, which is well within the realm of possibility. So I'm getting all Rowlingesque and calling her Grace for now. These characters do not belong to me. They belong to Shaw, Lerner, and Loewe, and I pay tribute to them thus. ... \"Won't be long until we're at the dock now.\" Henry took a deep breath of salty, smoky, wonderful English air. It had been a fine month, but he was ready to be home among familiar things. \"Thank heaven!\" Eliza gripped the rail and looked straight ahead, willing the land to come to her. \"Oh, don't be too concerned about it. Lots of people get seasick on the Channel. It's actually a pretty rough...\" Eliza drew herself up. \"I was not seasick! That egg was not cooked correctly is all\". \"Now you know I had the exact same egg and... Eliza! Is there a chance of you...\" Henry's voice lowered and he leaned in toward Eliza. \"...expecting?\" Eliza was exasperated. \"Absolutlely no chance! Do I need to explain why?\" \"No no no, please!\" Henry said quickly, wishing to avoid a public biology lecture. Eliza generally kept her temper under contol better than Henry, but when she did lose it, the results were usually more spectacular. Henry squinted toward the dock where the customary small crowd was gathered. \"I say, did you tell my mother our return plans?\" \"I mentioned that we were coming home today, that was all.\" \"I do think I see her at the dock there. I wonder what that's all about.\" \"Oh, my, isn't that Colonel Pickering with her?\" \"By George, it is. This can't be good.\" \"They don't look particularly grim. I think they're smiling. Oh, they see us! Wave back, Henry.\" Henry waved but did not smile. \"Something is up. You don't just decide to drive four hours to meet someone at the ferry.\" But Henry's mother and Pickering seemed to be acting in just that manner. Eliza recovered almost immediately upon leaving the gangplank and skipped over to them with Henry in pursuit. There were smiles, kisses, handshakes, like they happened to be in the neighborhood. Henry waited mutely until someone mentioned the reason for the excursion. When he couldn't stand it anymore (the longest fifteen seconds of his life), he cried out, \"Oh, out with it, Mother, what's the matter?\" \"Why, nothing is the matter, dear, we happened to be here and thought to take a chance that this was your ferry. Did you have a good time?\" \"It was perfect!\" said Eliza. \"Or nearly so. I think I had a bad egg for breakfast this morning. But aside from that, it was all so beautiful, and everyone was wonderful. I don't know why people say that the French are rude, they were all very nice to me.\" \"But what is it that one does in the Alps if one is not a mountaineer?\" said Pickering. \"Oh there are plenty of wonderful walks for regular people, and someone is always playing music or singing.\" said Eliza. Henry grimaced and coughed in recollection. \"And Henry got to collect some new accents. It's the border of three countries, you know.\" Henry's mother gasped. \"Henry, you did NOT take your gramophone on your honeymoon!\" Eliza laughed. \"It's quite all right. He got his accents, I got my mountains. The perfect place, really.\" \"Pickering!\" Henry burst out. \"What – are – you – doing – here? What – are – you – TWO – doing – HERE?\" \"Well,\" said Pickering, \"if you must know-\" Henry stifled an angonized groan. \"We are on our way to Sandwich for the week. The golfing is quite good, and these seaside resorts are very enjoyable out of season.\" \"What? Mother? You and … him? I mean, he's a good chap, but, but, well really, you're both a bit old to be carrying on like that.\" Pickering smiled even more broadly. \"Oh, don't worry, Higgins old boy, it's all quite on the level. You see, the last few months have been so damned confusing... \" \"Hugh, please, your language!\" Despite her words, Henry's mother didn't seem that displeased. Eliza gasped, her eyes sparkling, as she thought, \"She called him Hugh!\" Henry stopped breathing, his face falling, as he thought, \"She called him Hugh!\" \"Well it was, to have two Mrs Higgins-es about, so I suggested a remedy, and Grace was very amenable, fine woman your mother, Higgins, and we got married about two weeks ago!\" \"MARRIED!\" Henry roared. \"Now don't worry, Henry,\" said Mrs Higgins, or rather, Mrs Pickering, \"you'll still inherit. I got it all straightened out with the solicitor.\" \"Hang the solicitor! You know I'm all right on my own! But, Mother... at your age... really... \" \"And what age is that, please, son?\" \"An age of discretion, I would have thought.\" \"But we are being discreet. We married, after all.\" \"Oh, Lord help me!\" Henry paced and fanned himself vigorously with his hat. \"I think it's absolutely wonderful!\" said Eliza as she kissed each of them on the cheek once again. \"But I do wish we could have been there for the wedding. We did wait for you to return from India for our wedding, Colonel.\" She couldn't look properly reproachful while she was smiling so. \"Well, it's a bit different when you're older and it's your second time round,\" said Pickering. \"You don't really want to make a fuss.\" \"Getting married becomes less important than being married,\" added Mrs Pickering. \"Now I hope you might have some time to have tea with us before your train.\" \"I'm sure we must!\" Eliza looked almost as happy as she did at her own wedding. \"Do you have the timetable, Henry?\" Henry was still trying to comprehend what had happened. He looked at Eliza blankly, finally mumbled, \"Timetable,\" and produced the paper after rummaging in several pockets. \"Oh, splendid, we have a little over two hours. Let us just get the luggage sent the right way and we'll meet you at the restaurant.\" \"If you don't mind I'll take the liberty of ordering,\" said Pickering. \"I recall you enjoy strawberry tart, isn't that right... Mrs Higgins?\" He gave Eliza a smile and a wink. Eliza laughed and turned to Henry, who was already halfway to the baggage claim. She ran to catch up to him. \"Now what is the matter?\" \"The matter is that my mother needs to learn to act her age! Flirting like a schoolgirl! And Pickering just encouraging her!\" Eliza wondered if they had just witnessed different scenes. \"Now, Henry, you mustn't be selfish. Everyone is entitled to some happiness. Especially your mother... oh, my goodness.\" Eliza stared down the quay. \"What?\" \"It's my father. There. The fellow in the bowler and the green tie, trying not to look at me.\" About twenty yards away, Alfred Doolittle sighed when it was apparent Eliza would not release her gaze on him, turned to her as though surprised to see her, and waved. \"Oi! Liza!\" Eliza approached him, with Henry warily a step behind. \"Going on a trip, Dad?\" \"And why not? I 'ave the means, I 'ave the time, and it's spring! Paree beckons! May as well take advantage of the opportunity to spend a few free days in France, the land o' romance. Speaking of which, you just got back from 'oneymoon, no doubt? 'Ope Liza was good to you, Professor, or perhaps I should say, 'Enry me boy!\" \"Perhaps not,\" said Henry very clearly. \"Riiiight. Well, awfully good of you to invite 'Arry and Jamie along to your wedding breakfast. Since I've 'ad to lately carry the burden of being the most fascinating person in the room- apart from the bride, apart from the bride!- it was a nice 'omey touch to have a couple of mates from down the lane that I could toast the 'appy couple with.\" \"I invited them to make sure you got home all right,\" said Eliza. \"Made sure I...! I don't like the implyin' of that, young lady! I can 'old me liquor as well as the next and better'n most! Matter of fact, I beat 'em 'ome that evenin'!\" \"Dad, they carried you into a cab. I paid for it.\" Doolittle looked at Eliza puzzled. \"That's not 'ow I remember it.\" \"I believe that's the point,\" said Henry. \"Oh THERE you are, Alfie!\" Eliza's jaw dropped again as a woman not much older than her leapt to Doolittle's side. She was wearing a red and black suit adorned with a frightful amount of feathers, and carried a paper sack. \"They're starting to board. I've got sandwiches and cakes and a pint for each of us for the boat, and then dinner tonight in PARIS!\" She started to bounce. \"And is this your lovely wife, Doolittle?\" Henry asked in a rare moment of diplomacy. \"Oh 'eavens, no, Alfie and I ain't married!\" said the candid young lady, \"But we 'ave so much fun together, maybe we ought to, while we're in PARIS, wouldn't that be romantic?\" She resumed bouncing. Eliza crisply began, \"I'm sure that your wif...\" \"Well, 'ate to rush,\" bellowed Doolittle in a rush, \"but they are boarding, wouldn't want to miss the boat now would we, come along Tilly, cheerio Liza, off with you now, wouldn't want you to miss your train or cab or whatever.\" He scowled at Eliza and pulled Tilly along the quay. Tilly looked back. \"Who did you say that was? I'd 'ave liked to meet 'em.\" \"My NIECE, my dear little niece, who just got mar- back from a 'oliday.\" Eliza was dumbstruck. Henry called after Doolittle, \"Bon voyage, DAD!\" and Eliza hissed at him to be quiet. \"I'm sorry, is there something wrong, dear?\" said Henry, smirking. Eliza just rolled her eyes. When she saw them ascend the gangplank in the distance, she finally spoke. \"My mum not marrying him may have caused people to talk- and it certainly did- but I'll go to my grave thinking she did the right thing.\" Henry had been looking after Doolittle and his lady friend as well. He clasped Eliza's hand and fervently said, \"Agreed.\"[Chapter 6] Apologies for the delays, and thanks for all of the good feedback. I hope the next two chapters will come quickly after this one, which I decided was needed to set them up. This has been a great opportunity for me to do a bit of historical research, which has been fun, although the period is a bit depressing. Again, this wouldn't be possible without fun, meaty characters that are the creation of Shaw, Lerner, and Loewe, and my work is done in tribute to them. Enjoy. Henry Higgins shook the snow from his shoulders and strode into the front foyer of 27A Wimpole Street to find his wife seated at the reception desk greeting him with a smile. \"Good evening, Mrs Higgins!\" he said jauntily. \"Good evening, Professor!\" Eliza smiled. \"How was your meeting today?\" \"Quite interesting, quite interesting. Let's have tea and I'll tell you all about it.\" They addressed each other formally in public situations, or when they wished to demonstrate their high regard for each other, or when one or the other wished to be sarcastic and cutting. This exchange, happily, was representative of the second scenario. Not quite a month after they had come home from France, Archduke Ferdinand was shot, and England was drawn into confusion, uncertainty, and before summer ended, war. The news seemed to change the direction of the war every day, and Eliza took great comfort in the old routines, like continuing on as her husband's scheduler for his work. However, it grew more difficult to avoid the war's influence. Eliza had assumed that Henry would never be involved because he was too old to enlist. And then just after Christmas, he was summoned by the War Office. \"They can't afford me,\" he had told Eliza upon reading the letter. \"Not to mention that I am not interested in adjusting my methods to suit the ways of the military. Imagine, Mrs Higgins, your husband taking orders from some little lieutenant.\" Eliza laughed heartily. \"I would pity even the generals!\" She even sent Henry off that morning with \"Now don't be too hard on the poor generals, Professor!\" But as they sat in the parlour over their tea, it quickly became apparent that the meeting did not go as Eliza thought it would. Eliza grew agitated listening to Henry's account of the meeting. The War Office people did not order, bully, or beg. They simply and cleverly appealed to Henry's very high opinion of himself. \"...and of course no one in Europe has taken the study of phonetics and dialect in the direction I have. They admitted as much. Means I can dictate my own terms.\" \"Then you won't have to go overseas.\" \"Oh, I shall need to a bit, but away from all the action of course, and only for a few weeks at a time, I'll need to stay in close touch with the War Office...\" \"Why can't you just give them some books like the Colonel did?\" Eliza wailed. The MI5 had contacted Colonel Pickering only the previous week about using his skills to help quell the uprisings in India. \"I gave them a copy of Spoken Sanskrit and a copy of Hindi Dialects of the North and told them everything they needed from me was in those two volumes,\" he had told Eliza and Henry at a dinner party, sounding very old as he said it. Henry dismissed Eliza's question. \"Oh, I think he wanted to avoid being in a position of inadvertently getting some old friends in trouble. Not questioning his patriotism, mind you, he's as solid an Englishman as they come. He's given his best years for king and country. And now it's my turn.\" \"But what about your business, your research, your family...\" Eliza was trying to raise reasoned concerns, but her voice broke when she mentioned \"family.\" Henry put his arm round Eliza's shoulders. \"Come, Eliza, it's not like I'll be in harm's way. It will likely be more like a regular job than anything I've ever done... with a few trips here and there of course. But don't you see the opportunity? You and I know the value of my work, but there are always those who think it of no importance. Now I have a chance to prove its worth to society, to our country, by using it to help bring down the Kaiser! That will silence the naysayers once and for all!\" Eliza looked quietly at Henry. \"So are you doing this for Britain or for yourself, Professor?\" \"For mys-! For my DISCIPLINE, Mrs Higgins, for the study of language! It will never be marginalised again!\" Eliza sighed. Henry was his work, the man and the vocation were inseparable, so his words confirmed her suspicions. \"And what is it exactly that you will be doing?\" Henry said nothing for a moment, then took a deep breath. \"Ah. Yes. The consensus is that it would be better if you did not know all about my work. Of course I trust you, I know you are trustworthy, but generally if family members in this particular department are ah, unaware of the particulars of the officer's work, they are less prone to be... used, or... sought out.\" Nothing could make that explanation sound reassuring. Eliza felt faint, but returned Henry's look with a hard stare, from which he had to look away.[Chapter 7] I'm rather surprised how long this got, my apologies. Thanks for all your great responses so far; they're keeping me honest. I do not own the characters. They are the property of Shaw (Pygmalion) and Lerner and Loewe (My Fair Lady). That I can do so much with them is because they were created well, and my work is a tribute. Enjoy. 88888 The Duchess of Manchester, founder of the Field Surgery Aid Society, always made her \"unannounced surprise inspections\" of the Society's warehouse in London every other Wednesday morning, but that didn't make the staff and volunteers any less nervous about her scrutiny and criticism. Only Eliza Higgins, the warehouse's manager, was unperturbed by the visits. She had dealt with much worse than the Duchess. \"It is good to see such low breakage figures, Mrs Higgins. We mustn't waste our volunteers' efforts.\" \"Yes, Your Grace.\" \"Your bandage supply room is very clean. See that it stays that way. Our brave wounded soldiers deserve no less.\" \"Yes, Your Grace.\" \"And remember that no item should sit here longer than a week. The supplies must get where they are needed quickly.\" \"Yes, Your Grace.\" Eliza and the Duchess walked together to the loading yard, where the Duchess's maid held the car door for her. (The chauffeur had enlisted months ago.) \"Remember, Mrs Higgins, we must redouble our efforts. We are needed more than ever. No slacking now!\" \"Thank you, Your Grace,\" said Eliza as the car door closed, and muttered under her breath, \"I'll take that as your way of saying 'good job.'\" When the Duchess wasn't there, which was most of the time, the warehouse was on the whole a pleasant place to be. There was a constant flurry of activity involved in unloading and sorting hospital supplies before sending them on their way overseas. Eliza's biggest challenge was getting women of leisure who were not accustomed to work to do their jobs at the necessary pace. For her brusque, efficient demeanour she was nicknamed \"the sergeant,\" but she was generally liked and took a quiet pride in earning the name. And all the activity took her mind off home and Henry. His first few months with the War Office were apparently glorious, then descended into monotony and further into frustration. His tours of duty were only a few weeks at a time at first, then grew longer. He was both drained and agitated when he returned home, and he and Eliza chafed at the prohibition against discussing his work. This time, he had been gone nearly four months, with no correspondence permitted, as usual. As the Duchess's car pulled away, Eliza noticed a young woman in khaki standing on the step of a lorry, who had been watching the exchange. Hmph, cheeky thing, Eliza thought. \"May I help you, miss?\" she asked. And then she gasped. \"Ee-loi-za Doo-li'le!\" said the lorry driver as broadly as she was smiling. \"Fanny Bowyer!\" squealed Eliza as they pounced into each other's arms. \"'Ow long's it been since I've seen you!\" cried Fanny. \"Five years if a day!\" \"I know, I'm sorry. I went back to the flower market once after I had my lessons and no one recognised me. It was awful. I've been scared to go back since.\" \"It's all right, we're all of us wearin' different 'ats now!\" Fanny held out her breeches to their full extent and curtseyed comically. \"What ARE you up to, then?\" \"Women's Land Army in Newbury! I'm a farmer now! And some of the churches out there 'ave been collecting medical supplies and were looking for a lorry driver, and well, I can drive a lorry now too! So 'ere I am!\" \"I envy you, Fan, outside in the fresh air, while I'm stuck in this old barn in the middle of the city.\" \"But look at you 'ere talking fine and running this whole place!\" \"Oh, I don't run this place! The Duchess of Manchester runs the place!\" Eliza said with a smirk and a raised eyebrow. Fanny grinned at the sarcasm. \"Well, dear, it looks to me like you're doin' a tip-top job of not runnin' it! And married too? Your dad 'as some stories to tell.\" \"Some of which may be true!\" \"Your 'usband, is he in the war?\" Eliza sighed just a bit. \"Yes, his speciality is accelerated language instruction. Teaching the Allies to understand each other.\" This was the standard story she gave when asked about Henry. \"Aow, someone's finally teachin' the Yanks to talk English!\" Fanny grinned. Eliza smiled very weakly. \"You've 'eard that one before, then.\" \"Only about forty times. No, really, it's all right! Let's get you unloaded and I'll give you a quick tour.\" Eliza flagged down a passing Girl Guide. \"You! Looking for something to do, dear?\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" \"Get three of your mates, make sure each has a cart, and put everything in this lorry into the proper storerooms. And how do we carry the bottles?\" \"Slow and easy, ma'am.\" \"Excellent. Off you go.\" The Guide scampered off. The warehouse tour was much more of a catch-up on years of gossip. Perhaps Eliza's fears were overblown, or the war had erased a few class lines, or Fanny was a better friend than she'd given her credit for, but it was a great relief to talk to her and learn she would see her regularly with deliveries. Eventually duty called, or at least gave warning, as Eliza could hear someone down the hall say, \"Let sergeant know, she'll straighten it out quick.\" Eliza quickly walked Fanny to the loading yard. \"They'll be wanting me now. Fan, it's been so good to see you. Please give everyone my love.\" \"An' I'll be 'ere next week. I 'aven't told you 'alf of what's been up!\" Fanny always liked an audience. \"I can't wait!\" \"Mrs Higgins, please!\" came Mrs Ames's shrill voice behind Eliza. Eliza rolled her eyes and smiled conspiratorially to Fanny in farewell, then calmly turned to Mrs Ames, Mrs Millstone, and Mrs Stroud, who had followed her out to the loading yard and were now arrayed before her. \"What can I do for you ladies?\" she said with an efficient smile. \"It's about Mrs Bartram,\" said Mrs Millstone. \"Mrs Bartram! Is she all right?\" Millie Bartram had just found out two days ago that her husband had been killed in action in Turkey, yet she appeared as scheduled for her volunteer shift today. It was unusual, but not unheard of: many women who had suffered such losses kept their schedules for the war effort out of a sense of duty and as a tribute to their fallen. \"Well, several of us are thinking that she ought to go home,\" said Mrs Ames. \"Is she upset?\" \"No, well, frankly, she may be! She just keeps talking! On and on!\". Mrs Stroud seemed agitated. \"To her husband?\" \"No, to us, about her husband!\" said Mrs Millstone. \"Everything! About when they met, silly things they did together...\" \"And the letters!\" said Mrs Stroud. \"Yes, about the letters he wrote from the war, and what was happening in Turkey, some of it was... not at all nice...\" Mrs Stroud grew impatient and interrupted Mrs Millstone. \"In the first place I think the frivolous chatter is very disrespectful of Lieutenant Bartram's sacrifice in battle. Also I suspect it is very bad for morale to be constantly...\" \"Reminded,\" said Mrs Ames. \"Over and over again!\" Mrs Stroud's voice rose almost as high as Mrs Ames's. \"Michael this and Michael that! We know he has passed! We know things are unpleasant in a war! But we don't go dithering on about our husbands! You certainly don't, Mrs Higgins!\" That's because I can't, Eliza grimly thought. Mrs Ames smiled. \"Poor Mrs Bartram is obviously hysterical. She needs to be home where she can be properly looked after by relatives until she regains some control...\" Eliza's jaw dropped. Every time she thought she had figured out upper class British society, she was dumbfounded in a new way. This would never even happen in Lisson Grove. Her own mum died when she was twelve. Terrible pains in the stomach, a fever, and then it was over. Henry had later told Eliza it was probably appendicitis. Eliza's dad had been on the other side of town when it happened, but no matter, all her neighbors stepped right up to help with what they could from their own meagre stores. Right after Gert was buried, all of her friends and relatives got together for what Harry the dustman called an \"Irish wake,\" and all the Gert Farrier stories started flying until people were crying and laughing at the same time. Gert had been a barmaid at Tim Cooper's pub, and Tim put his arm round young Eliza and said, \"I've seen ladies and gentlemen in me time, but for takin' care of other people, and stayin' true to 'erself, there was no finer lady than your own mum.\" It couldn't be easy being a barmaid and a lady at the same time, and Eliza never forgot those words. Or the stories. They made her mum seem alive and with them all for just a bit longer until they were ready to let go. Why couldn't people take care of each other like that? Death was no stranger in this war, why pretend it didn't happen? Or that the deceased didn't exist? Or that he was some legendary hero and not a real person who had been a part of everyone's messy little lives? Or that their lives weren't messy?! Hurricane Eliza was about to strike. The mistresses Ames, Millstone, and Stroud continued to walk right into it. \"... We do need to consider the feelings of the other ladies who work with her.\" Mrs Ames had still been spinning rationalizations. \"Consider their feelings,\" Eliza said, nodding. The three ladies nodded eagerly in response. \"Consider their feelings. And what of Mrs Bartram's feelings? In heaven's name, she's just lost her husband! She has just paid you, paid us all here, the great compliment of coming to us in her time of trouble because she feels comfortable and accepted here, and you propose to just leave her flat because she's not saying pretty things when she's bereaved! You may need to think about the way you would like to be treated in that situation.\" Mrs Stroud jumped in. \"Well, I for one would...\" \"No!\" snapped Eliza. \"Don't tell me; it's not my business. Just think about it. If coming here and working and chatting helps Mrs Bartram get through this time, then we shall let her. If she troubles you so much, then send her over to the office to help me with filing. If you cannot handle helping her, I will be happy for the privilege.\" Eliza stormed through the line of silenced ladies back into the building. From the driver's seat of the lorry, Fanny peered discreetly over the road map she pretended to read, smiled, and quietly said, \"Bra-vo E-liza!\"[Chapter 8] Life intervenes, which is why I'm late posting this next chapter. Which is also, I suppose, the overriding theme of these vignettes. I do not own the characters, They are owned by Shaw, Lerner, & Loewe, and I'm just looking for an excuse to do a little historical research. And answer some of my own questions. What are your answers? Enjoy. ... Autumn in Passchendaele \"Thank you for all your help, Private.\" said Lt Murray, rising from his chair. \"Can you tell me when I can rejoin my unit, sir?\" said the soldier eagerly. \"Soon as we get the communication through. In the meantime, we ask that you wait upstairs. Corporal? Could you please escort Pvt Williams to the front room and supply him with some tea?\" Murray watched the two men climb the narrow stairway of the half-bombed-out farmhouse. Then he turned to Henry Higgins, who had been sitting quietly through the interview taking notes. Murray lowered his voice. \"Sloan?\" Higgins also spoke quietly. \"Bavarian through and through. The A's were very obvious, and he was clearly not yet master of a British V.\" Once he left England, Higgins was not Henry Higgins, nor even Captain Higgins, as he was known officially in the Army. He was Lieutenant Henry Sloan, a clerk who was particularly adept at shorthand, called upon when soldiers who were separated from their units were debriefed about their experiences. But instead of taking down interviews, he analyzed speech patterns, looking for imposters who may try to infiltrate the Allied forces using the identity of a killed or captured Allied soldier. The interviews were done by Lieutenant Murray. Higgins was told nothing about him other than that was not his real name either, though his speech gave him away as being born in Cardiff and having studied at Eton. Murray had a quiet, reassuring demeanor that won the men's trust from the start. \"Damn, third this week,\" sighed Murray. \"This isn't a battle anymore, it's a harrassment to see who makes a mistake first.\" The corporal came back downstairs. \"Corporal, I'm afraid we have to take the fellow calling himself Williams up to GHQ and try to find out what happened to the real SamWilliams. Thank you... That seems to be the last one for now.\" Higgins snorted and shook his head. \"That jerry has a better shot to survive this experience now he's off the front, as opposed to the rest of us. That's the irony of the whole exercise. I'd always been interested in visiting Belgium, you know, but I hadn't planned on such an extended stay,\" He shuffled his notes for the day at the wobbly wooden table. \"Well, the rain's stopped for the moment.\" Murray chuckled, lit a cigarette, and flung the burning match carelessly out the window as he watched \"Williams\" being led away. \"At least we needn't worry about brush fires.\" Higgins had been away from Britain for four months, and stationed at this soggy base for four weeks. The base served to supply the men in the trenches, whose entrances were just a few hundred yards away, with food, and had a cook crew and a kitchen that was constantly being rebuilt after bombings. From that end of the base Higgins could smell smoke and something like vegetables, and if you thought about it hard enough, meat. The supper preparation was done and now the men could rest while it cooked. Pvt Horner got out his asthmatic concertina and started to play and sing. Higgins was drawn by the words. He stepped out to the yard to listen. Nights are growing very lonely, days are very long; I'm a-growing weary only list'ning for your song. He didn't know the words to the verse. But every tommy, yank, canuck, and anzac knew the chorus. There's a long long trail a-winding into the land of my dreams... He joined in without thinking about it. There was a slight melancholy silence after the last chorus, and then Horner said, \"'At's right, Lt Sloan, sing the couple o' notes you 'ave and the rest will come by 'n' by.\" The men laughed and Higgins knit his brow and said \"Mind, Horner, or I'll have your number before the night's out!\" \"Oof, someone else better sing, me voice is gettin' me in trouble wi' the brass!\" More laughter. This had become the usual evening banter. The enlisted men had figured out quickly that despite his bluster, \"Sloan\" was loath to write anyone up. Higgins for his part had too much admiration for how the men handled the hellish conditions on the front to want to add to their troubles. But Horner threatened to cross the line the most. Miles struck up \"Bombed last night and bombed the night before...\" and Higgins shook his head and went back inside to the refuge of his papers as the other joined in. The next verse would be \"Gassed last night...\" and then the language of the following verses found levels of crudeness he didn't think anyone would dare voice. Eventually, \"Meal's ready, transport front 'n' center!\" came the head cook's call from the kitchen. Horner, Dodson, and MacMillan headed for the kitchen to pick up the big heavy pots of stew to carry to the trenches. When they returned the men at the base would eat. As officers, Higgins and Murray would get their bowls before that, but from the beginning they had a wordless pact not to touch their meals before the return of the transport men. Higgins thanked the soldier for the bowl placed before him, and then quietly pushed it away to transcribe his notes, letting his attention wander briefly to that fool Horner whistling Bombed Or What Have You Last Night across the barren field toward the supply trench with his two heavy pots of slop. The drone of an airplane engine quickly grew louder. Higgins pulled his notes together, stuffed them into a strongbox, and locked it. After four weeks this close to the front, this move was well-practiced. All the men either ducked or manned a battle station as usual. Except Horner. He was closer to the farmhouse, but gambled on making it to the trench entrance. He didn't. The missile hit, rocking the ground. From under the table, through the open doorway, Higgins saw Horner fly into the air, stew going everywhere. Higgins yelled and bolted out the doorway. No one followed him. He heard a blast to his left and veered wide, made it over to Horner, grabbed him under his arms, and began to drag him to the farmhouse. Horner cried out in pain. \"Steady, old man, you're all right now,\" mumbled Higgins as he suddenly felt his age under Horner's weight. \"Those poor blighters on the line, supper's gonna be late, make sure they're fed tonight, sir?\" \"In due time,\" Higgins grunted as he pulled Horner into the house. \"Now let's see what- MEDIC! NOW!\" Horner bled freely from his side, his breathing laboured. He had almost no colour. \"Sir,\" Horner gasped, \"me wife Wendy, tell her I thought of her, I love her.\" \"Tell her yourself, Horner,\" snapped Higgins as he pulled off his jacket and shirt and tried to bind the gash. \"Oh I wish, but I think I'm done for.\" Higgins grabbed Horner's face. It felt cold. \"They're on their way! Stay awake! Stay with me here!\" \"Sorry Leften... 'at's one order I jus' can't obey.\" Horner laughed quietly, closed his eyes, gasped twice, and was gone. Horner's death was the unit's only one that day. But this death seemed to rob the unit of its voice. As he wished, the men on the line were fed that night. All who were not wounded or tending wounded pitched in regardless of rank to reconstruct the kitchen and the stew, working in near silence. Higgins had never cooked anything besides toast on a fork, but he chopped potatoes and measured flour with determination. Murray helped too, and glanced over at Higgins frequently. Well after midnight Higgins stumbled through the rubble back to where he hoped his bunk still was. Something he kicked wheezed sharply. He bent down and moved a rock. Horner's concertina. There was a gaping hole in the bellows through which he could see bent and broken reeds. He held the concertina carefully, not knowing what to do or what to think. Outwardly, he did not move. Inwardly, he felt like someone had flung him against a wall like he was a rag doll. He started to tremble. He put the ruined concertina carefully on a ledge and walked very quickly into the supply room. Murray watched Higgins go in. He waited uneasily about three minutes and then went in himself. The supply room was a narrow pantry with a small window at the end opposite the door. Murray saw in the moonlight the silhouette of a man near the window, his face in his hand. \"Sloan, is that you?\" said Murray casually. Silence. Then a little more insistent: \"Sloan.\" \"I will thank you to leave here, Mr Murray, I will be out presently.\" Higgins' voice was angry and authoritative but wavered once. \"Afraid I can't do that.\" Murray walked over to Higgins and put his hand lightly on his shoulder. \"I'm fine!\" shouted Higgins, except \"fine\" turned into a sob. Murray just left his hand on Higgins' shoulder while Higgins quietly shook and slowly regained enough control to speak evenly. \"The men can't see that I'm not master of myself. You shouldn't have seen that either.\" \"On the contrary, when you stop having emotions, that's when I'd worry. Like this, you're still capable of bravery and nobility. Like pulling Horner to safety. You'll probably get a medal for that.\" \"Ha. All the good it did. He still died.\" \"Yes, in safety and relative peace, knowing someone cared.\" \"That's still not bravery, that's common decency.\" \"In times like these common decency often gets off at the first stop.\" They stood together wordlessly for a few minutes, then Higgins looked at Murray, clapped him on the shoulder, and headed for the door. Murray understood and nodded with a small smile. He also knew that the attack likely created some chaos up and down the line, and there would be \"customers\" by sunup. He followed Higgins out and pulled the door behind him.[Chapter 9] 9 Clear View From The Edge My apologies. It has been entirely too long, I've been having an eventful life (good stuff, don't worry). This chapter was actually the first thing I wrote when I decided to do this project, and I have revised it a million times as the project grew. This is NOT the last chapter, this is comparatively serious, and I still want to tie up a couple ends and get a couple laughs. Next installment in a couple weeks, hopefully. ... The crowd stood on the train platform chatting surprisingly quietly for their size, ignoring the horizontal mist, typical November weather for London. Eliza stood with them clutching a telegramme, the first communication she had from her husband in five months: \"Arriving troop train victoria 1540 henry.\" He was alive, and he was coming home. She had heard of so many who weren't: Mille Bartram's husband and Roberta Goldsmith's husband from the warehouse where she volunteered, Jamie Pennyworth and Reg Horner from Tottenham Court Road... It seemed like Fanny always brought bad news with the gossip and the weekly deliveries from the country. \" There it is!\" a woman cried, and all heads on the platform turned as one to look down the track at the approaching train. The crowd was behind a rope five yards from the track, as the railway police saw a need to keep anxious family from storming the still-moving trains. Before the train reached the platform, soldiers popped their heads out the windows, waving madly. Eliza, on the far end of the platform, looked intently at the front cars where the officers rode, though she knew her husband was not the sort to wave out a window. The brakes squealed, and even before the train had stopped, men were leaping from the carriages, their families already in their sights. \"Michael!\" \"Albert, here!\" \"Calm DOWN Mum, he SEES you!\" \"Dad Dad Dad Dad!\" Eliza was surrounded by chaotic reunions and bided her time. The waiting area started to thin almost immediately, and then she could see him, just out of the carriage, walking the emptying space between the the train and the rope. He stared at her intently, but wearily. He looked a stone lighter. Yet he walked very briskly and with purpose to her, not taking his eyes off her. He stepped in front of her, dropped his duffle, put his hands on her shoulders, and asked, \"Is your hat pinned on?\" \" No, why?\" She later chided herself for having to ask. Henry snatched the wide hat off her head, pulled her to him, and kissed her very hard. He had never kissed her frequently, let alone in public. She was shocked, but she enjoyed it too much to want to stop. When their lips parted, she looked in the eyes that looked back at her unblinking. \"Rough tour?\" \" Rough does not begin to describe it,\" he said, allowing his eyes to close as his forehead touched hers. He looked \"like he's got a sack of trouble on his shoulders,\" as her mum used to say. \" I've got a cab waiting out front.\" She put her hand on his arm and he pulled her close as they walked to the exit. The ride home was quiet, except for a polite \"Welcome home, sir, and thank you,\" from the elderly cabbie who had had this job before and understood. Pearce had hot coffee, plum preserves, and sponge cake waiting as instructed, and then quietly closed the door to the parlour. Henry pulled off the wool jacket and breathed deeply the scent of the potted flowers lining every windowsill . Eliza caught the jacket, noticing the epaulets. \"Major! You left a lieutenant and came home a captain last time!\" \"Yes, the promotions only come after I have had to do something particularly annoying.\" \"I don't want to know where, but... the front?\" \"Yes, it was bound to happen sooner or later. A war like this, there is no such thing as a job that never sees combat.\" \"I suppose I understand that. You do need to go where the spies are, and the front is where they...\" He wheeled round at her. \"Spies! What do you mean spies? Where did you hear that?\" \"Nowhere, I just thought that given your expertise...\" \"And with whom have you discussed my supposed work with spies?\" he spat. \"No one, of course! We've talked about that! I don't see that it's so dangerous to talk at home...\" \"Dangerous!\" he thundered. \"Damn it, woman, it's a matter of life and death!\" She said nothing, but looked at him carefully. Usually she would blow up right back at him. The quiet unnerved Henry, and he collected himself as best he could. \"Eliza, I apologize. I know you are too bright to betray me even by accident. And I suppose I at least have a few fellows I can speak frankly with, and you haven't even had me round.\" \"You were gone so long this time. Over a month longer than they first said. I know it can't be helped, but it's so hard to not know what to say to people, not know how...\" She had kept the tears at bay, but her voice began to crack. Henry sat down beside her as she tried to be as businesslike as possible with the handkerchief. \"You may have noticed I was rather demonstrative at the station,\" he said. A laugh helped mask the sob. \"I'm used to you being impulsive. And it wasn't at all unpleasant.\" He smiled briefly. \"I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that the front is everything you could imagine and more. I've watched too many men die... I'm probably in for more of that... Well, one day we were favoured with a simultaneous shelling and gassing, courtesy of the Kaiser. I very heroically cowered in a corner, sucking on a mouldy gas mask.\" \"Better than the air at that point.\" \"Marginally. And I might have thought only marginally better than death, except...\" His voice dropped to almost a whisper. \"Liza, I was desperate to see you. It's trite to talk of being at the point of death and thinking of things left unsaid. But that was it. I have loved you dutifully, I enjoy your company, and yes, I need you, but I have never said how much I truly, deeply love you, dearest Eliza. Please forgive me for not having the courage to tell you this before now.\" His grip on her hand might have hurt her had she not been gripping almost as strongly. She smiled lightly but her eyes held him. \"We're a pair, you and I. I've loved you for years but I didn't want to burden you with that. It... didn't seem your style... and I had so much to be thankful for I determined to be content with that. Well, maybe not content, but at least happy. I should be the one begging forgiveness\". Henry relaxed his grip, his whole body, but still held her, and returned the smile. \"Perhaps we should start by forgiving ourselves. You looked at me for a moment like you wanted to ring up the staff at Bedlam. I can't blame you.\" \" No! Well... yes, as a matter of fact. I went to a lecture last week about recognising the signs of shell shock.\" Henry nodded ruefully. \"Shell shock. Perhaps I do have that. It would stand to reason, I suppose.\" \" Oh, no, I hope not, everything you have been saying has made such lovely, wonderful sense to me!\" They held each other close and kissed again, finally, freely. When they parted, they looked for a long time into each other's teary eyes. They couldn't help thinking of the dead and the survivors they knew. Here they were, happier than they had ever been, but the happiness was tempered in the midst of so much sadness and pain.[Chapter 10] Way too long since I updated, sorry. I do confess that I lean on my writing sometimes when things aren't going well and ignore it when things are. Actually things are going well now, which is why I realized I couldn't leave things quite so serious as they were at the end of the last chapter. I think one more chapter after this will do it. The bit about Eliza's mad piano skillz is in act 3 of Shaw's Pygmalion , and I am hypothesizing about how they came to be. But lest you think I get away from the musical, I am still giving Higgins a hard time about his questionable singing skillz. (That's Rex Harrison's fault of course.). So here's to Lerner & Loewe, here's to Shaw, and their great characterizations, which aren't mine, I'm just playing. Enjoy. 88888 Hespera tottered to the door of the Pickerings' parlour. \"Madam, Master Henry is on the telephone for you.\" Mrs Pickering had been expecting the call since her daughter-in-law phoned to say she received the telegramme that morning. \"Oh, thank Heaven!\" she cried. \"I didn't want to bother them myself but I was quite tempted.\" She leapt from her chair, yet placed the magazine on the endtable just so. From behind the newspaper in the other wing chair came a snort. \"Now, Hugh, Hespera has served our family since before Henry was born. He will always be Master Henry to her, and there is nothing wrong with that.\" Colonel Pickering lowered the newspaper as he tried to stop laughing, but his heart wasn't in it. \"Terribly sorry, Grace, dear, but I just find it preposterous to imagine Professor Henry Higgins as a boy!\" Mrs Pickering turned at the door to smile sweetly at her husband. \"But Hugh, all men are boys.\" She glided off. The colonel paused, considered, cogitated, turned it over, and finally said, \"I say, Grace, that's not very...\" But she was long gone down the hall. 88888 \"Hello, Mother.\" \"Henry, it's so good to hear your voice! I hope you don't mind that I asked Eliza to have you phone me when you got home.\" \"If you must know, dear, I'm a bit annoyed that you think I wouldn't do that on my own.\" \"But this was such a long trip this time, and I thought you might be... distracted. Were things more difficult?\" \"Mother, you know I cannot discuss my work.\" \"Of course.\" \"But yes, they were rather.\" \"I'm so sorry. How is Eliza holding up?\" \"Oh, Eliza's been a brick.\" From the background there was an inelegant giggle. \"Henry, Henry, ever the romantic.\" \"Now, Mother, Eliza's a sufficiently sensible woman to know that it's a compliment. She's a wonder with the gardens here, and they can't do without her at the Field Surgery warehouse. I stand by my statement.\" \"Very well, very well. Dear, we would love to have the two of you over for dinner tomorrow evening if you are up to it.\" \"That sounds capital! A little later than usual, perhaps? I do have to go in to the War Office in the morning.\" \"No time off at all?\" \"In my position, I don't go on leave, I just change location.\" 88888 \"Oh, my, that is good, I don't want to stop eating it, but it is awfully spicy.\" Eliza reached for her wineglass. \"What did you say it was called?\" Henry and Pickering proclaimed \"Curry!\" at once, smiled knowledgeably at once, and gave each other a competitive glare. \"Hugh says they eat it all the time in India,\" said Mrs Pickering. \"I try to tell him it's not the sort of thing that would catch on in Britain, but he still insists on serving it to guests.\" \"Only those with educated palates, my dear.\" Mrs Pickering dabbed her mouth with her napkin. \"Well, I hope dessert will cool off the palates a bit. We have a trifle. We've gotten round the sugar ration with a good deal of fruit; I hope it's acceptable. Martin, will you refill the wine for everyone, please?\" \"Yes. Ma'am.\" Martin, an abstainer, had also been part of Mrs Pickering's household since she was Mrs Higgins. She was accustomed to his frosty responses and puritannical attitudes regarding alcohol. \"And then perhaps you could treat us with a little more music, Eliza. It's a joy to hear you play piano, it seems like so long since we've heard it. What was that you were playing before dinner?\" \"Just a few tunes from Mikado that I remembered. Yes, I've certainly felt a lot more like playing lately!\" Eliza glanced over to Henry. Henry cleared his throat and suppressed a smile. \"Mikado, eh? It did seem rather more elegant than all that when you played it.\" \"Perhaps I added a few things.\" \"It still amazes me how well you have always played the piano,\" said Pickering. \"I could not believe how you just seemed to pick it up the first time you sat down at one after we took you to that Brahms concert.\" \"But Colonel, that wasn't the first time I ever sat down at a piano! You only asked me if I had ever had lessons, and of course I never had money for those.\" \"Well, then, how the deuce did you learn to play?\" Eliza took a genteel sip from her wineglass, placed it on the table, smiled demurely, and with perfect upper-class enunciation and phrasing, answered, \"I listened to the blokes play at the pub where me mum tended bar.\" Pickering was caught completely off guard and started to cough. Mrs Pickering shuddered. \"Ah... Martin, please get a glass of WATER for Mrs Higgins.\" \"Indeed. Ma'am.\" Martin's eyebrows said, I told you so. Mrs Pickering subtly turned to her husband and whispered, \"Hugh, do you think she's all right?\" Pickering rather less subtly answered, \"Well, she seems so.\" \"HAAA!\" cried Henry. Mrs Pickering grew more concerned. \"Now Henry, you mustn't be angry with Eliza...\" \"Nothing of the sort!\" said Henry. \"I simply realised that she learned to play at the Royal Lisson Grove Academy of Music!\" Both Pickerings expected Eliza to take offense, but instead she dissolved into laughter. \"The Royal Lisson... Oh, goodness, if only old Tom Cooper could hear that about his pub, God rest him! I'd love to go back and call him headmaster and hear what he would say!\" \"Imagine the recitals! the repertoire!\" \"The audience! Oh, goodness!\" Martin knocked over two glasses at the sideboard. Henry rose from hs seat. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the Marylebone Harmonica Quartet are pleased to offer this evenng their Variations on a Theme of Florrie Forde!\" Eliza curtsied flamboyantly. \"Followed by the art song Sister Susie's Sewing Sh... \" (\"Ahh, take care!\" goaded Henry.) \"...Sewing Shirts for Soldiers!\" she proclaimed perfectly, but Henry roared wth laughter all the same. Mrs Pickering leaned over to the Colonel, keeping a wary eye on her son and daughter-in law's continuing antics. \"I don't think Henry is... drunk, do you?\" \"From what I could see, neither has partaken enough for that.\" Eliza tried to stop Henry from singing with one of the good embroidered linen napkins. Mrs Pickering gasped and muttered, \"Perhaps the aperitif had gone bad... do you think they may be ill?\" \"Well, dear, if so, I do hope it's contagious!\" Mrs. Pickering wheeled round to see the Colonel smiling at her wryly, and quite hopefully.[Chapter 11] The final chapter, finally! Things have been going well for me of late, which meant that I had gotten away from the writing a bit. It's interesting to see so many opinions of what happens to these two; hopefully mine will add to the discussion and keep the fine original works by Lerner and Loewe and GB Shaw at top of mind. Anything I do here is merely a tribute to those writers and composers and how multidimensional they made their characters. And an occasional excuse for a laugh. I have a couple other ideas up my sleeve. Thank you all for your feedback; see you down the line! Berenice the governess was asleep in her chair, and therefore unavailable to tell Hughie to stop singing that song. She called it a \"dangerous\" song that could produce bad words. But Hughie was a Higgins and a Doolittle, with a quick ear and a wonderful memory, so he was never in any danger of committing social atrocities. And anyway, he learned it from listening to Berenice: Sister Susie's sewing shirts for soldiers. Such skill at sewing shirts our shy sweet sister Susie shows! Some soldiers send epistles saying they'd sooner sleep on thistles Than without the short soft shirts for soldiers sister Susie sews! \"What's an epistle?\" Hughie asked Muriel. Muriel was seven years old and fancied herself an expert on theology and, because she was a Higgins and a Doolittle, just about everything else. She declared, \"It is a book from the Bible.\" \"The soldiers were giving Susie BIBLES? That doesn't make any sense at all! Why were they giving her BIBLES?\" \"It is probably an award, like they give in Sunday School. They do give Bibles as awards in Sunday School.\" \"But what are you going to do with all those Bibles? They all say the same thing! … don't they?\" Hughie could read but was fairly new to it. \"Of course they do! They would all have different titles otherwise.\" Something was unsatisfactory about that answer but Hughie couldn't figure out what. He was silent for a moment. \"Anyway, I don't know why Reggie and Trudy got to go to Uncle Hugh's party and we didn't.\" Muriel huffed. \"It's not a party, it's a funeral! Uncle Hugh is dead!\" She was the direct sort. \"I know he's dead!\" Hughie was tired of Muriel thinking he was stupid. Yet, at age five, he was still a bit muddy on the permanency of the condition of death. The doorbell rang. Hughie bolted past Muriel, out the nursery door, and down the stairs. \"Father 'n' Mum are home!\" Muriel sighed and rolled her eyes. \"Of course they are!\" She shouldered the burden of her great wisdom and headed to the front door. The door swung open before Pearce arrived; the bell was merely a signal that Professor Higgins was home. First in was Mrs Higgins in a straight black dress just past her knees and a hat with a thin black veil over her eyes. Then came her husband the Professor in his usual tweed suit. Gertrude, in a grey drop-waist dress, was tall for not-quite-eleven. Reginald, in black knickerbockers and white shirt (the bow tie was already off) was short for nine, but large hands and feet indicated that would not be for long. Mrs Higgins placed the card from Colonel Pickering's funeral on the side table and let her eyes rest on it, as reluctant to look away from it as she was to say goodbye to the Colonel. Trudy stood in the front hall a moment, obviously holding her tongue about something, and then deliberately turned to the Professor and said, \"Well, Father?\" Higgins stared at Trudy sternly, which was difficult because he was very proud of her and Reggie. \"You did of course notice that there was no one at the church anywhere near your age. It is quite irregular to take youngsters to a memorial service. But I do know that Grandmother was grateful, Trudy, for you speaking for her when she felt overwhelmed by the conversations. And Reggie, I'm sure...\" He swallowed for a moment. \"... sure Uncle Hugh enjoyed you and your mother giving 'Come Thou Holy Spirit' after the eulogy. It was very well sung. And played, Mrs Higgins.\" Mrs Higgins smiled and nodded, and turned to wipe her eye. \"When I first said the two of you should not go, I was concerned for your comfort. I know how much you loved Uncle Hugh, but a funeral is not a place for children. Adults are too busy taking care of themselves and each other to have time to worry about children. However, I must say that I was impressed with how very well you carried yourselves. I underestimated your maturity. I'm happy to say I was wrong about that.\" Mrs Higgins brightened immediately. \"Well done, Trudy! I've never been able to get your father to say he was wrong about anything!\" Higgins raised an eyebrow at his wife and sang, \"You knew that.\" \"I did, I did.\" Mrs Higgins lifted her eyes heavenward in a touch of light supplication. Hughie and Muriel stood at the foot of the stair to greet their parents when their turn came, but Hughie could not be quiet any longer. \"You played the piano, Mum? And I missed it!\" Berenice scurried down the stairs. \"Hugh! Is that the proper way to greet your parents?\" Muriel and Hughie took turns kissing their parents, Hughie a bit more efficiently. \"Good evening father good evening mum MUM! I wanted to see you play piano!\" \"Well, little man,\" said Mrs Higgins as she picked him up, \"it was actually the big church organ. You really would not have been able to see me. And I'd never done it before. I'll have to practice before I'm ready to have you hear.\" \"How did these rapscallions behave for you, Berenice?\" \"A bit rambunctious, Professor, but I got them to calm down and behave good and quick. You need to keep a constant eye on them. I believe they are very nearly civilised at this point.\" All four children exchanged conspiratorial smirks. Berenice always took long naps in the middle of the day, leaving them to their liberty, and they were not going to ruin the opportunity by telling their parents about it. Cook came into the hall. \"Tea is ready in the solarium. With butter tarts. I thought we all could do with a lift.\" Trudy, Reggie, and Hughie ran to wash up. Muriel hung back with her parents. \"Mum, I would like to learn to play the piano like you.\" Higgins never missed a chance. \"If you mean, young lady, to learn to play the piano in the manner in which your mother learned to play, the answer is absolutely not!\" \"Really, Professor! Hush, Muriel, dear, of course you can learn to play. I'll show you what I know, and if we start butting heads like two nanny goats over it, I'll find you a teacher. Would you like that?\" \"Hurrah!... In what manner did you learn to play, Mum?\" \"We will discuss that later. Now go wash up.\" Higgins fell into a wicker chair in the solarium. The parade of various and sundry relatives who were none of them at their best drained him. Much as he loved his wife, she had her foibles as well, and his usual course of action was to unload his exasperation on good old Pickering over a sherry. He'd miss that. He realized he was still wearing his hat and tossed it on the table. Pearce came in with the tea cart and efficiently moved the hat to the endtable to make room for the tea. Hughie just as efficiently grabbed the hat and put it on, and started running laps round the chairs with the other three in hot pursuit. \"Now, don't upend the tea before Grandmother comes, she said she would be along to see us in a bit,\" said Mrs Higgins in what she hoped was a calming voice. But it just made Hughie shout \"Candy candy candy candy!\" and the others run and giggle more in anticipation of the sweets that emanated from their grandmother's handbag. \"Well, I am happy that you are looking forward to seeing Grandmother… do slow down just a moment, children, I have something exciting to tell you… that's better. Grandmother does not want to live in a big house by herself anymore, so in a short while she will be coming here to live with us.\" The children froze, dumbfounded. Grandmother was much more observant and vigilant than Berenice ever was. \"Well, that's the end of that then,\" sighed Reggie. Higgins sat up. \"End of what, please?\" \"End of the candy, she surely won't feel like giving us candy anymore,\" said Trudy quickly, delivering a subtle kick to Reggie's shin. Mrs Higgins laughed. \"Oh, now, I don't believe for a moment that we could stem the sweets tide quite that easily!\" \"Father, why is it we called Uncle Hugh Uncle Hugh and not Grandfather?\" Reggie was always curious about this, but he thought the diversion wouldn't hurt either. \"The convention is that a grandparent is a parent's parent. Grandmother is my mother. My father died when I was young; he would be your grandfather.\" \"Oh, that's terribly sad!\" said Muriel with a bit of drama. \"We never knew our grandfather!\" \"Yes, but we knew Uncle Hugh,\" shouted Hughie, \"and that was important for me because of my name, right?\" Trudy stood tall. \"And he was a very good grandfather to us even if he wasn't our REAL grandfather! But, then… Mum… \" Mrs Higgins held her breath. She knew what was next. \"Papa Alfie is your father, right?\" Mrs Higgins nodded deliberately. \"Then why do we call him Papa Alfie and not Grandfather… or Grand… Anything?\" Mrs Higgins resisted suggesting to call her dad Grand Pain In The Arse and answered, \"Papa Alfie loves you very much. He very much enjoys having grandchildren. But he has always been a little uncomfortable with the idea of being a grandfather. I think he feels he is too… young.\" The Professor snorted. Mrs Higgins shot him a look and took a deep breath in anticipation of the next question, which came from Hughie. \"Then shouldn't we call Daisy Aunt Daisy because she's married to Papa Alfie?\" Daisy Skinner was in fact not married to Alfred Doolittle, not for lack of trying. But Doolittle would have to divorce Tilly first, and divorcing Nerissa was sufficiently harrowing (and financially costly) for him that he did not want to go through it again. Higgins recalled the overpowering odour of gin on Daisy Skinner's breath each time he met her and shot back, \"No, because there are some people who are simply not ready and able to handle an influx of extra relatives!\" \"Now, Henry, dear, don't be so hard on yourself!\" Higgins's mother had appeared in the doorway during the outburst. She leaned on a cane to walk now, but stood straight and tall. The day had been hard, but finally being here with her nearest put a genuine smile on her face. \"Oh, and by the way, Eliza, your father stopped by the churchyard, just as we were leaving of course, and he said he would be coming here to call in a little while, to pay his respects, as he put it.\" \"Splendid, we were just talking about him,\" pouted Mrs Higgins. \"If it is any consolation, he was by himself at the time, and hopefully is coming for the food and not the drink. Now, let's see…\" Mrs Pickering opened her handbag. \"I do believe I saw a few peppermint humbugs in here…\" The children began running toward her. \"...for POLITE CHILDREN.\" The children stopped, stood up straight, and racewalked toward their grandmother, giggling. Higgins rolled his eyes, grabbed his hat from Muriel's head as she flew by, and covered his face with it as he slumped in his chair. The day refused to end, and his mother's teasing and the prospect of dealing with Doolittle were not helping. Then he felt a sticky hand on his leg and tentatively picked up the hat a bit. Hughie said, \"Here father, I got two!\" and affixed a peppermint humbug to his trouser leg before running back to his grandmother for the pear drops that had just been discovered. Higgins examined the fuzzy candy with one eye, then stole a look at Eliza, who returned the look with a raised eyebrow, a wry smile, and a shrug. He put the hat back down, allowing himself a smile and an idea that he'd likely get through this too. ","Summary":" Advantage Miss Doolittle WHAP! Higgins' hat, which had been covering his eyes, flew across the room"},{"Movie":"This Means War","Title":"It's A Spy's Life","Author":"Tigra-Bengal","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8267927","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Spy Times Three Book Two Chapter One I was tackled from behind and my head slammed into the concrete. I saw stars for a moment before I cleared my head and spun around. I kicked up and heaved the man off me. I scrambled to my feet and looked around wildly. This was the fourth goose chase my father had sent us on. I sighed as the back up came in and took care of the rest of the baddies. I sank onto a small bench and dropped my head into my hands. It had been two months since Collins had told me that my father had escaped and was at large. He had been sending us on pointless chases while he ran circles around all of us. I cursed, grabbed a brick and threw it into the wall. I was scared and angry. I hated my father. \"Hey,\" a familiar comforting voice greeted. I turned and gave Tuck a tight smile. \"Come here darling,\" he murmured opening his arms. I let him fold me in his arms. Tuck never failed to make me feel safe and protected. \"We'll get him,\" he assured me squeezing me tight. I smiled and breathed in his wonderfully unique scent that always made me weak at the knees. FDR walked up and rubbed my back. \"We won't let him hurt you. Now, Nana wants all of us at her house for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow,\" he told me. I smiled at the change of subject and nodded. Back at the office I finished my report on the mission today. I tucked it to the side and looked around. FDR was talking on the phone and by the look on his face I knew it was Lauran. I was happy that they were so in love. Tuck was tapping away on his computer with his feet up on the desk. The box and photo album that contained our memories was on the corner of my desk. \"I want food,\" I stated. Tuck and FDR glanced up. \"Why don't we go meet Lauran for lunch? She wants to try out a new café,\" FDR suggested. \"Sure, I haven't seen Lauran in a while,\" I replied grabbing my purse and jacket. All three of us stood up as FDR hung up. \"I've got the address,\" he announced waving a piece of paper. We drove to the small café where Lauran waved from a table. I waved back as we entered. \"Hey baby,\" she greeted FDR giving him a swift kiss. \"Hey Lauran,\" I greeted giving her a hug. I sat down and picked up one of the menus. \"Ooh, this sandwich looks good,\" I murmured. A waitress carried a meal past and the smell suddenly sent my stomach roiling. I winced and pressed a hand to my belly. \"I'll be right back,\" I gasped bolting for the bathroom. I barely made it before I began to throw up into the toilet. I felt hands holding my hair back until the vomiting stopped. I sat back breathing hard. \"Are you alright?\" Lauran asked. \"I don't know. It was weird but weird things have been happening lately. I'm sure its just stress because my dad is back,\" I assured her. I washed my face off and drank some water. I cleaned my mouth and took deep breaths. \"See I'm fine now. It's just stress,\" I told her with a smile. She still looked unsure. \"Maybe you should go to a doctor anyways,\" she said slowly. I shook my head waving my hand dismissively. \"Nah, it'll just worry Tuck. I'm fine. Let's go eat,\" I replied walking out. \"Are you alright?\" Tuck asked as soon as I sat down. \"I'm fine,\" I told him soothingly kissing his cheek. We ate and soon my little episode was forgotten. Later that day I was walking back to my desk when my back suddenly burst into pain. I bent over unable to move as my back began to cramp. \"Great,\" I muttered, \"Just what I need.\" I waited until the cramps faded then went to my desk. I grabbed a small bottle of Midol and took two pills. \"Are you sure you're ok?\" Tuck asked. \"I'm fine,\" I told him once more. He looked unsure as I rubbed my back. He stood and came behind me. He began to rub my shoulders and I sighed as his talented hands took away the pain. \"I love you,\" I breathed leaning into him. He chuckled. \"I know darling. I love you too,\" he replied. FDR walked in and I waved lazily. He laughed. \"Aw how adorable,\" he teased. I scowled at him and he just winked. I rolled my eyes as Tuck kissed my neck and moved away. \"Thanks babe,\" I told him. \"Welcome darling.\" I gathered my reports and stood. Dizziness suddenly swept through my body. I grabbed my desk as I swayed and my vision spun. \"Darling, are you alright?\" Tuck asked in alarm. I took deep breaths clearing my head. \"Yeah, I just stood up to fast,\" I told him. I smiled at him and took my reports to Collins. \"Are you alright Rayne? You look pale,\" she asked. \"I'm fine,\" I said exasperated. It was stress. I was fine and I wished people would stop asking me. \"Still, I want you to visit the doctor,\" she told me. I sighed. \"That's an order.\" I went down to the doctor's office and knocked on his door. \"Come in,\" Dr. J called. I came in and waved at him. \"Hello Rayne, how are you?\" he asked. I scowled. \"I'm fine but Collins wanted me to come in for a checkup,\" I told him with an eye roll. He chuckled and stood up. He started checking me out with a calm gentle touch. \"Has anything strange happened to you lately?\" he asked. I thought. \"I've had cramps, dizziness and nausea. Oh and my period's late but that too be expected. With my dad back I'm sure it's just stress,\" I told him with a smile. He smiled back and his fingers gently prodded my stomach. \"Rayne, I know you believe you're just fine but would you mind if I ran a few tests?\" I sighed but shrugged. Dr. J had always known best. An hour later I was back on my bed watching my feet swing. The tests had been fine but I was starting to worry. Dr. J hadn't come back in yet. Finally the door opened and he walked in. His face looked troubled. \"What's wrong?\" I asked in a tight strained voice. He looked down at his clipboard. \"Rayne, I don't know how you'll react to this but…\" he trailed off. \"But…what?\" I demanded silently freaking out right now. \"You're pregnant.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter Two I stared out the window in shock. I was hiding out in the library. My arms were wrapped around my stomach and my knees were curled up. This couldn't be happening. Not now. I felt like crying. \"Rayne?\" Tuck called. I ducked behind a bookshelf unable to face him right now. The door closed again and I peered out. He was gone. I sighed in relief then looked down at my stomach. There wasn't a big bulge and I had never noticed it before J had pointed it out. It was tiny, barely there but it was solid proof. \"What am I going to do?\" I mumbled to myself. I managed to avoid Tuck all day but all too soon it was time to go home. \"Hey darling, I haven't seen you all day. Is everything alright?\" Tuck asked as soon as we got into the car. I couldn't take it anymore. I burst into tears. \"Rayne,\" Tuck cried in alarm. He quickly wrapped his arms around me. \"I'm pregnant, Tuck, I'm pregnant,\" I gasped. I felt his arms still and looked up into his face. It was frozen, staring down at me. \"Tuck,\" I whispered. A huge smile suddenly broke out across his face. \"That's fantastic Rayne,\" he cheered kissing me senseless. I couldn't help but smile at his exuberance but it quickly faded. \"Tuck, what about my father? He's still out there,\" I said quietly. His cheerfulness vanished to be replaced with deadly anger. \"If he ever tries to hurt you or our baby, I'll kill him, plain and simple,\" Tuck told me in a dark voice. I nodded trusting that Tuck would protect me and our child. My hand found my stomach and I through the last of my tears, I smiled. The next day work was slow for me. I did reports and worked behind the cameras. I suspected Tuck had asked Collins to keep me here and while a part of me was mad that he would try that, a larger part of me just wanted to be safe for once. \"So I hear you'll be having a baby,\" Collins stated walking in. I smiled. \"Yeah, it was a big surprise to us,\" I told her. She smiled and sat down. \"If you need anything just tell me Rayne,\" she said firmly. I smiled back at her. \"Thanks boss.\" She patted my head then left the room. I finished the report I had been working on and sat back with a sigh. My hand found my stomach as it had been doing all day. It still blew my mind that a little person was growing inside of me. \"You're having a baby!\" I looked up as FDR stomped in. I ducked my head guiltily. \"Why am I the last person to know this?\" he demanded. \"I'm sorry FDR. Things have been so hectic and I just didn't have time,\" I replied. \"Didn't have time to tell your best friend that you're having a baby?\" \"I'm sorry,\" I said quietly. He sighed. \"This is big news and I'm so happy for you,\" he told me with a smile. I glared at him in mock outrage. \"You had me freaking out,\" I cried. FDR laughed and I knew he hadn't been mad. I'm sure Tuck had told him as soon as possible. \"You know I love you Rayne,\" he teased hugging me. I rolled my eyes but smiled and hugged him back. \"I love you to FDR,\" I told him exasperated. Tuck came in and smiled. \"So, how's it going to feel to be a daddy…again?\" FDR asked. Tuck laughed lightly and kissed me. \"Like I just won the lottery,\" he replied.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three I chuckled and rolled my eyes. Suddenly Collins walked in. \"There's been a sighting,\" she told us. I jumped from my seat. \"Where?\" I demanded. \"Down on Brookes street,\" she replied. I reached for my bag but Tuck grabbed my wrist. \"Maybe you shouldn't go,\" he murmured. I stared at him. \"This man destroyed my life and you don't want me to go after him?\" I hissed. \"I'm thinking of the baby. You could get hurt,\" he replied looking me steadily in the eyes. \"He has a point Rayne,\" FDR chimed in. I glared at him then turned desperate eyes to Collins. She hesitated then shook her head. \"I have to agree. It would be foolish of you to go when something could happen,\" she stated. I stared at her in frozen disbelief. I thought she would understand. \"I'm sorry,\" she murmured leaving the room. I fell back into my chair and watched as they packed up their gear. \"I promise I'll stop him,\" Tuck told me leaning in for a kiss. \"I'm not a damsel in distress or some frilly little princess Tuck,\" I replied crossing my arms tightly. \"I know but I have to keep you safe,\" he said pleading with me to understand. And I did understand. I just didn't like it. I finished up my work and decided to go home early. I said goodbye to Collins and headed out. I drove home thinking about the baby. I wondered how I would be as a mother. My mother had done the best she could under the circumstances. She had always warned me if he was a bad mood by tying a ribbon around the door handle whenever she could. She had tried to make things better. But then he had killed her. I gripped my steering wheel with white knuckled grip thinking about that day. I came home and didn't see the ribbon on the door. I still proceeded with caution. I slowly pushed open the door only to reveal a sight that made me scream. My mom was lying on the living room. She was still and her eyes were glassy. Her neck was bent at awkward angle, an angle impossible for anyone to be alive in. \"Mom!\" I screamed tears choking me. A backhand made me fly to one side. \"Don't mention this ever or I'll kill you just like her,\" dad snarled. I nodded tears streaking down my face. A car horn blaring made me jerk. I had stopped with the memory. I quickly jerked into action and drove home as quickly and carefully as I could. I parked in my driveway and let the engine die. I stared through the windshield as tears streamed down my face. I missed my mother so much sometimes. She had been the only light in those dark times. I touched my belly praying that I would be a good mother to my child. I got out of the car and wiped my face. Once I had dried my tears I walked to my door. I dug for my keys in my purse and turned to my knob. My hand froze. My eyes were wide as I stared at the curving gold colored door handle. Slowly I began to tremble and my entire body went cold. A dark blue ribbon was tied to the handle. Sorry you had to wait so long for such a short chapter. Sorry sorry sorry![Chapter 4] Chapter Four My entire body was trembling as I tugged the ribbon off the handle. It was soft in my hand. It shook with the quivering of my fingers. I took a deep breath and opened my door. My house was dark and silent just as I had left it. I moved into it slowly pulling my gun from the holster under my arm. I was tenser than a bowstring as I crept towards the living room. The lights suddenly flicked on. I froze my eyes flicking around wildly as a figure sat up from the couch and stretched. It was female with long blonde hair. Her back was to me. My hands were damp and I felt sweat on my forehead. She stood stretching. She was slightly overweight and a little shorter than me. \"Don't move,\" I ordered in a low voice. She froze her hands instantly coming up. \"Now, slowly turn around,\" I told her. She did until she faced me. I almost dropped my gun. She was the exact replica of my mother. She had the same high cheekbones, the same thin too red lips, the same pale blue eyes. My hands trembled slightly but I stilled them. \"Who are you?\" I snapped, \"And why are you in my house?\" \"I-I'm sorry. I'm looking for someone and the door was unlocked…\" \"I don't leave my house unlocked,\" I growled. Tears began to stream down the girl's face. \"I'm sorry,\" she sobbed, \"I'm looking for someone and it's really important.\" I hesitated before lowering the gun slightly. \"Who is she?\" I asked a bit gentler than before. \"M-My sister. The phone book said she lived here and I just wanted to find her. \"What's her name?\" I asked patiently but alarms were ringing in my head. I had moved here a year ago. I didn't know who had lived here before me but surely the phone book wouldn't be that outdated. \"Her name is Rayne, Rayne Blake. I'm her sister Lyssa Blake.\" Twenty minutes later I had her calmed down and she was at my kitchen table with a mug of coffee. I was staring at her still unable to believe what I was seeing. \"So…what happened to you?\" I asked hesitantly. I wasn't sure how to react to this child. She was younger than me, obviously from a rich family judging by her name brand clothes and expensive jewelry. \"Well, a year ago I found out that I was adopted. I went out to find my birth family but I found out that my mother had died and that my father had pretty much vanished. But I did find you. I started looking for you but you were hard to track down. \"Yeah, I travel for my job,\" I explained. She nodded and took a sip of her coffee. \"So what was your adopted family like?\" I asked before I could help myself. I wanted to know if her life had been every bit as hellish as mine. \"My parents are very rich and they love me dearly. They still treat me like a princess,\" she told me. My hands clenched into fists and I stared down at the table. Her life had been great while mine had been worse than hell. My door opened and Tuck came in looking tired. Forgetting my sister I went to him eager to find out if they had caught him. \"I'm sorry Rayne. He got away again,\" Tuck told me. I smoothed the crinkles from his forehead. \"It's alright,\" I murmured leaning in to kiss him. When we pulled apart he noticed Lyssa. \"Who's this?\" he asked with a polite smile. I hesitated wondering how to explain this to him. \"I'm Lyssa Blake, Rayne's sister,\" she said standing up and jutting out her hand. Tuck blinked at her. \"Apparently my parents had another child that my mom gave up for adoption,\" I told him quietly. Lyssa nodded and he slowly shook her hand. \"Well, that's…unexpected,\" he said. I nodded and rubbed at my temples. I was getting a headache and I felt nauseas again. Tuck rubbed my back. \"Lyssa,\" I started glancing at the clock. It was only six. I sighed and shook my head. \"What?\" she asked. \"Never mind, why don't I get something for us to eat?\" I offered trying to be friendly. \"No love, sit and rest. I'll make something alright?\" Tuck supplied kissing my forehead. I smiled softly and sat down. Normally I would protest but I just didn't feel like it. Tuck went into the kitchen and Lyssa sat down again. \"He seems really sweet,\" she told me. \"He is,\" I replied tiredly. \"Are you alright?\" she asked looking worried. I gave her a reassuring smile. \"Yes, it's just been a long day is all,\" I replied. I urged Lyssa to tell me about her life. I didn't really feel like talking and Lyssa provided all the conversation. Thirty minutes later Tuck came out with hamburgers, chips, soda and some salad. I smiled at him gratefully as he set the table. \"Dig in,\" he announced. We served ourselves. \"So where are you staying Lyssa?\" Tuck asked once we had settled in. \"Well, I was planning on going to a hotel,\" she told him. Tuck glanced at me and I hesitated before grumpily nodding. \"Why don't you just stay here with us?\" he asked. Lyssa brightened. \"Oh that'd be wonderful,\" she announced clapping excitedly. I bit back a groan as my headache got worse. Two chapters in one hour. I feel accomplished.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five That night after we got Lyssa settled Tuck and I went to bed. I stripped to my underwear and then pulled on my comfiest tank top. \"What's wrong?\" Tuck asked. I turned to him as I pulled out my hair. \"What do you mean?\" I asked in return. He arched an eyebrow at me. \"I can tell something's wrong,\" he told me. I sighed. Sometimes I hated that he could read me so easily. I plopped down on my bed and brought my knees to my chest. \"She's had a normal life, in fact a great one. Her family is rich and she always had everything she wanted. If our birthdates had been reversed, I would have had Lyssa's life. I wouldn't have been abused or hurt or raped,\" I said softly. Tuck came over and sat beside me. \"Rayne, then I wouldn't have met you. And life without you is unimaginable,\" he murmured leaning in to kiss my shoulder. I couldn't help the small smile that curved my lips. \"True, I probably wouldn't have become a spy. I'm glad for that part. I got to meet you and FDR.\" He smiled and kissed me deeply. I chuckled and kissed him back. \"Good, now no more thoughts like that,\" he said when we had pulled apart. I smiled and ran my fingers through his hair. \"No more thoughts like that,\" I agreed. The next morning I got a surprise visit from FDR and Lauren. Lauren squealed and hugged me as soon as she saw me. I laughed and hugged her back. \"Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Do you want a boy or a girl?\" she asked clapping. I laughed and calmed her down. \"I don't know. I don't really care. I'm just happy I have a child,\" I told her my fingers going to my belly. Lauren squealed again and I rolled my eyes. I went into the kitchen and kissed Tuck good morning. Lyssa came down the stairs in too short pajama shorts and a bra. Tuck and FDR quickly averted their eyes like the good boys they were. \"Who's this?\" Lauren asked struggling to be polite. \"Lyssa please go put on some clothes,\" I said polite but it was clearly an order. \"But…\" she trailed off when she saw my dangerous look. She pouted and stomped up the stairs. She was like an overgrown child. \"Sorry, that was Lyssa. She's apparently my sister,\" I told FDR and Lauren. \"WHAT!\" they both shrieked. \"I know, that how I reacted,\" Tuck injected. \"I'm going to do a check on her today at work but she says she's my sister and she was adopted. God, she acts like it though,\" I said taking the glass of orange juice Tuck offered me. Lyssa came down the stairs again wearing a tank top and some jeans. \"Better?\" she asked sarcastically. \"Yep,\" I replied shortly. Something felt off about this girl and I refused to trust her. Tuck and FDR hovered over my shoulders as I started my background check on Lyssa. It only took me a few keyboard strokes to find out that Lyssa's story was true. \"Alright, she was adopted at birth by Mr. and Mrs. Gaines. I wonder why she said her last name was Blake then.\" \"To earn your trust?\" Tuck suggested. I shrugged and kept reading. \"Anyway, she grew up there, attended the best schools and was a spoiled child.\" \"It doesn't say that,\" FDR said amused. \"No, but I'm inferring. I mean look at these people. They're super rich and she acts like a spoiled child.\" I moved through the files and found the birth certificate. I clicked it open and stared at the name written on it. \"My mom,\" I whispered, \"My mom was her mom. My dad was hers. She really is my sister.\" Tuck rubbed my back. Underneath it was the adoption papers. This one only had my mother's name on it. \"My dad wouldn't have wanted it. She must have been beaten so badly after she did,\" I commented struggling to keep my expression neutral. Tuck buried his face in my neck and kissed my skin. \"I'm sorry love,\" he whispered. I shrugged feeling unsure and slightly numb. FDR kissed my head and they both went into their desks. I closed the search and dropped my head into my hands. I still had a headache from yesterday. I was sitting at my desk when I felt a cold prickle on the back of my neck. I shivered and turned around in my chair. My desk was in front of a window. I stood and went to the glass. Someone was staring at me. I could feel it. I peered out at the buildings around me. They were looking straight at me, whoever it was. My phone ringing made me jump. I shook myself out and picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hello Rayne,\" came an all too familiar voice. My spine stiffened and my panicked eyes met Tuck's. He looked at me, confused and worried. \"What do you want?\" I asked in a harsh whisper. \"What I've always wanted Rayne, you,\" he replied. \"You're never going to get me. Never again,\" I snapped. Laughter poured over the line and I flinched nearly dropping the phone. \"I will get you little girl. In the end it will be too easy. Play your games now, try and fight, but in the end you will be what you are always meant to be, mine.\" The line went dead and the phone slipped from my fingers. It clattered to the ground and I sank back into my chair. He was watching me and he had a plan. Something was about to happen, something I didn't know if I could stop. Sorry about all the slow chapters. I promise the next chapter will have action.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six I didn't tell Tuck about the phone call. I didn't want him to freak out. I just traced the phone call even though I was sure he wouldn't be there anymore. The phone call came from the building across the street. I didn't bother going over there. My father was too clever for that. Maybe I had been thinking about this all wrong. What if the only way I could stop him was to go in alone. So far he had eluded every group we had sent after him. Maybe it would take just me, one person who understood his crazy mind. I bit my lip trying to figure out a way through this thorny path. That night I was home alone. Tuck and FDR were having guy's night. Lauren was with her parents and Lyssa had gone out. I was on the couch sitting in the quiet still trying to figure out what I was going to do. Suddenly a cold thought entered my head. The ribbon. Who had put it there? Had it been my father? I ran up to my room and dug the ribbon out from the drawer I had shoved it in. It was just like the one mother used to tie around the handle. I thought hard. Maybe this could give me some clues. I tucked it into my pocket and grabbed my keys. Twenty minutes later I was back at work. I ran to the labs and met Reggie. \"Reggie I need you to scan this for fingerprints,\" I told him. \"Sure thing Rayne,\" he replied. I was so thankful that I had high enough status that people didn't ask questions. It took a few minutes and I fidgeted the whole time. \"Alright, here we go,\" he said pulling a screen up. I examined it. The first page showed that my fingerprints had been on it. I clicked to the next one. I shivered as I saw my father's face. He had touched the ribbon. There was another page. Someone else had touched the ribbon. I clicked over to it and sucked in a breath. Lyssa had touched it. But that was explainable right? I mean she might have touched it when she got to my house wondering why it was there. However my brain couldn't figure out how her fingerprints had gotten all over it, not in streaks but in deliberate places. My whole body was cold. I bolted from the room and raced back to my car. I drove like hell to get back home. I had to get back before she did. I ran inside as soon as I got to my house. \"Lyssa,\" I yelled bursting through the door. She was waiting for me. \"I was wondering when you'd figure it out,\" she said dryly. \"Who are you really?\" I demanded my gun in my hands. She laughed tossing her hair back. \"Oh, I am really your sister. I really did have an amazing life but then this stranger came to my house and told me that he was my birth father. Oh Rayne, he promised me so many things. All I had to do was help him get you and I must say I like the power he gave me,\" she explained in a feral voice. \"Power?\" I kept my voice steady. \"Every night some helpless man would be delivered to my door so I could have my way with him. It was…intoxicating.\" She sounded worshipful. \"You became him,\" I stated shortly. She grinned at me. \"What can I say? I like having power over people,\" she told me. I shook my head in disgust. \"So what happens now?\" I asked. Her grin grew wider. \"Now, I uphold my end of the deal,\" she told me. I was about to ask what she meant when something cracked against my skull. I toppled forward and hit the ground hard. Her laughter was the last thing I heard. Sorry it so short. I will try to make the next chapter longer.[Chapter 7] Hey everyone, I've been seeing all your lovely reviews and it makes me feel bad that I have written anything for a while. I just want you all to know that I haven't given up. I got a new computer and the writing software on it doesn't allow me to work on my previous stories so unfortunately we have to wait until I get the new software. So, thank you all once again for liking this story so much. To be honest I never thought it was any good so thanks a bunch and hopefully I'll be updating soon.[Chapter 8] Chapter Seven I woke up feeling sick. My head was throbbing violently. I swallowed thickly and sat up weakly. The room spun around me and I closed my eyes taking deep breaths. When my head settled I blinked rapidly. I was in a room, an ordinary bedroom. I slipped off the bed carefully and went to the door. It was locked, big shock. I rubbed my temples and tried to focus. The window. I walked over to it. It was barred and I gave a frustrated sigh. I looked around but the room was bare except for a bed and a dresser. \"Trying to escape?\" a voice echoed around the room. The voice was distorted and strange. \"What do you want?\" I asked firmly. The door opened. \"What I've always wanted Rayne,\" my dad told me. I stumbled away. \"Stay back,\" my voice was thin and afraid. He kept moving towards me. My back hit the wall and he was suddenly right there. His hands were on the wall on either side of my head. His arms had caged me in. \"No,\" I whispered feeling frozen with childhood fear. \"Did you like my ribbon?\" he asked. \"Get away from me,\" I snapped. He smirked and his fist connected with my stomach. I gasped and curled up. My arms wrapped around my stomach instinctively and everything cried out about my unborn child. My dad shoved me back against the wall but I kept my arms wrapped tightly around my stomach. He stared at me for a long moment then started laughing. \"You're pregnant aren't you?\" It wasn't a question. I remained silent as he started laughing again. He let me go backing away and I slipped down the wall weakly. My eyes darted around. I had to get out of here. Tuck and FDR had no idea where I was or how to find me. It was up to me to get out of this. Suddenly I was up against the wall again. \"You never should have run away from me Rayne,\" he hissed. I struggled to keep my face neutral. His fist connected with my jaw and my head snapped to the side. I hissed in pain as he shoved me aside. I slammed into the bed post and grabbed onto it to steady myself. Before I could he threw a vase at me. It connected with my face and I tumbled backwards. I felt the shards cut into my skin and hit the ground. Sharp pain flooded my palms and arms. \"I think that's enough for now,\" I heard him say as I cleared my head. He slammed the door shut as he walked out and I picked myself up. I was bleeding and bruised and aching.[Chapter 9] Hey everyone I'm really sorry but I'm shutting this story down. I haven't seen the movie in forever so I've lost all my inspiration for it.

Chinese skyscrapers of dark purple, gold, and pale green seem to sparkle brighter than the stars themselves. A pale bluish green binocular like lock comes over the tactical screen. Two pictures of similar looking men with medium very dark brown hair come off to the side of the lock. At a C.I.A. headquarters... A woman among many guys and women is at the computers, facing this particular screen among many. She has fairly short black hair, a yellow beady necklace, and a dark brown overcoat. Her name is Collins. Collins reports, \"all eyes are up. Sat cams are good. Target is inbound. ETA is five minutes.\" On top of a silvery lined skyscraper with a mostly dark blue helicopter pad... There stand two field agents in black suits and ties. One of them has medium frontless very dark brown hair, faint stubble around his face, and no mustache. Off the field, he goes by the nickname FDR. The second field agent has somewhat more clean shaven frontless black hair, faint stubble around his face, and a faint mustache. Off the field, he goes by the nickname TBN or just simply Tuck. There's a fancy party going on. Most everyone is wearing black and mingling with drinks. Over FDR's and TBN's comlinks... Collins tells them, \"your first mission is a go. Repeat, you are green to go. Intercept and apprehend the Heinrich brothers. Secure the device. And remember spy cadets, this mission is covert. You mess this up, you'll be hoping for King Kong himself to break through your bars.\" The transmission cuts off. They both shake their heads, looking annoyed. They head inside. The walls are mostly light red. Gold banners make up the pillars and sections of the ceiling. A almost sun like ball hangs from the center of the ceiling, illuminating most of the floor with light. Abstract paintings of black splotches, mostly green, and angelic clouds mostly line the walls. The chiming dance music is kind of loud. FDR and TBN faintly smile, catching sight of some girls close to the bar. One has a metal studded very dark blue vest, red lipstick, and has long dyed orangish red hair with a straight trim in front. The other girl with her has her dark brown hair tied in a bun, wears a black sleeveless dress, and holds a black cell phone and pager. With a soft spoken voice a little rough on the edges... FDR confidently says, \"I've got some action.\" With some natural thickness in his voice... TBN kind of confidently comments, \"yeah. Better not the giant sized kind.\" FDR very faintly chuckles. He adds, \"yep.\" They head to the bar area, right between most of the doors in and out. Right away... The woman with the metal studded very dark vest introduces herself to them, \"hi. My name is Xenia.\" TBN says, \"pleased to meet you. I'm Dean.\" FDR says, \"Frank Castol.\" TBN first shakes Xenia's hand. Then, FDR shakes her hand. Xenia adds, \"this is my public relations agent. But, don't mind her. She just mostly takes notes.\" FDR very faintly laughs. He figures, \"noted.\" He kisses Xenia's hand before he lets go. Xenia very faintly chuckles. She then brings up, \"so what brings you to Hong Kong? Business or pleasure?\" FDR quickly says, \"pleasure.\" TBN quickly says, \"business.\" With a slight turn to TBN... FDR adds, \"a little of both.\" Xenia asks, \"what kind then, if you don't mind my asking?\" FDR answers, \"not even slightly. I am a cruise ship captain of a very large vessel. I have a kick ass agent of my own: Only in travel.\" He briefly turns back to him on the last part. TBN just smiles. Xenia supposes, \"permission to come aboard, captain?\" Her PR agent then whispers something to her. Xenia realizes, \"oh right. I still got that business meeting tomorrow. Maybe we can go easy on the drinks?\" Then, from the corner of his eye... TBN notices the helicopter starting to land on the helicopter pad. TBN concludes, \"on that note... Will you excuse us for now ladies? Because I just realized our accountant is coming back out any minute, and going over the tickets before the ship takes off tomorrow would be good for work.\" He puts a light but firm hand on FDR's shoulder as a hint. FDR kind of loudly whispers, \"no we don't.\" TBN kind of loudly whispers back, \"if we want to keep jobs, yes we do.\" Not looking phased at all... Xenia firmly nods, \"okay. Be back soon?\" FDR adds, \"count on it.\" TBN and FDR walk toward the helicopter. Men in black suits and ties are already coming in, heading for a private room. Among them, one of the Heinrich brothers is carrying a large silver briefcase. TBN and FDR walk into a left empty side hall, not far from the room. They draw out pistols, keeping them by their sides as they load them. With halves of a gold medallion... The dark red private room door is shut closed. From the side... The guard by the door is suddenly knocked out with a gun hilt. FDR is standing with his back to him, using his body to shield TBN from view. TBN acts like he just stumbled and fell. And, the crowd barely even notices. Soon as the coast is clear... TBN and FDR fast walk through the door. Around then... Chinese, Japanese, and American men in black suits and ties are all there and accounted for. Among them are three black suitcases: Each carrying hundreds of millions in cash. With noticeable disdain... One of them comments, \"I see you brought your baby brother to protect you.\" Karl Heinrich is holding the open silvery briefcase. He has medium frontless hair and stubble, whereas his brother standing behind him has kind of spike tipped hair in front and no stubble. Over the black felt inside, there's a green capped gold capsule: With stuffed papers with schematics and codes for a missile system that can be invisible to all known devices and the naked eye. The prototype's indent is also in the black felt: It's just invisible. Karl glares. He concludes, \"you know, I was thinking of putting this up to sell to the high bidder. But, now, you've made me unhappy.\" The businessman was about to pull out his pistol...when Karl's brother pulls out his. He shoots the businessman in the chest. He falls dead. In the confusion... Karl angrily shoots his pistol at the other businessmen. Most of them fall dead on the floor. Some of them retreat through the back, clutching their sides. Some dark red liquid drips from behind them. Just then... FDR and TBN barge in, pistols out and ready. Still glaring... Karl whirls around...firing shots at them too in seconds. Bullets make holes in the door. FDR and TBN duck by a black couch. The shots barely miss them. On the other side of the door... Security men are busy rushing everyone else out. Karl calls out, \"come on Jonas!\" Jonas is grabbing two of the black briefcases. Karl is already fast walking through a second backway, heading for a helicopter pad down some gold tinted back stairs. A unpiloted black helicopter is already waiting for them. TBN tumble slides into Jonas, tackling him. The briefcases go flying. But... Some of Karl's men come back...punching TBN down hard. He reactively lets go, barely tumbling back to his feet with a hard groan. Jonas and Karl run for it. FDR spin punches around at one of Karl's men with the hilt of his pistol. He falls knocked out on the ground. FDR then runs after Jonas and Karl. TBN is pinned down by two men. But...TBN tumble kicks one of them off. The man crashes through the splintered table, groaning violently. In a second... TBN tumble slams the other guy to the floor. Even though he's coughing violently and with a bloody nose... He reaches for a knife. TBN though easily shoots him several times from the floor. He falls dead. FDR gets out on the helicopter pad. As Karl and Jonas start to get in... FDR shoots up the navigation pad. Karl shoves his brother out of the helicopter in time. But, Jonas is clutching his bruised side on the helicopter pad. Karl then whirls around, shooting back at FDR. FDR runs around the helicopter pad, coming for Jonas. The shots all miss. Jonas shoots at FDR. But, he side steps in time. Soon, FDR and Jonas are wrestling over their guns. Their guns shoot off aimlessly at the sky and the helicopter. Karl is about to shoot FDR...when TBN side kicks him violently down. Karl doubles over, violently groaning. He's clutching his side. TBN is about ready to shoot him...when Karl from the ground suddenly violently kicks him away. TBN slides all the way to the edge of the pad. Looking all too satisfied... Karl turns back to FDR: Thinking TBN fell off. TBN barely grabs on in time...coughing violently and struggling to hang on the edge. FDR punches Jonas off...right off the pad. He screams. And, with a loud crash... He lands into the shattering glass of a speeding brown car. He falls dead instantly. The car crashes into another car, causing a massive pileup. Karl stands there, fairly stunned. TBN is pulling himself onto the pad and back on his feet. But, he starts to slip. FDR is about to shoot Karl right there. But...he notices TBN slipping. FDR lowers his gun. He fast walks over to help up TBN. As he's helping him up... Karl gets on a parachute backpack. He calls back angrily, \"this is not over!\" FDR and TBN come back to fire at him. But...Karl is already halfway down by parachute. He's too far away. TBN comments under his breath, \"Heinrich is not happy.\" Sounding more casual than he looked... FDR figures, \"I'm more concerned about the boss. This was our first mission out of spy academy, and he just got away. I couldn't let you fall. But...\" He faintly sniffles, a little teary eyed. With a assuring hand on his shoulder... TBN says, \"definitely.\" FDR firmly nods. He adds, \"thanks.\" They both walk over to the open helicopter to get the silvery briefcase. FDR clears away some of the fallen glass with his sleeve covered arm. As TBN gets the slivery briefcase... FDR wonders, \"you think those girls are still here?\" TBN very faintly laughs. He figures, \"I doubt it. Come on. I'll buy you a drink soon as we get back.\" Sounding a little better... FDR comments offhandedly, \"yep. Least that's something there.\" The next day, in a big city somewhere in California... FDR and TBN are in a mostly aqua blue office. They're both in black buttoned overshirts. FDR is in a light blue buttoned shirt, while TBN is in a black T-shirt. But, as they look down nervously... Collins is addressing them, and she does not look happy. She puts down a copy of a Chinese newspaper on a very dark blue desk. It shows on the front page the pile up from last night, with a lot of calling out people. But, right next to the picture is a kind of zoomed in picture taken by a Chinese helicopter...of FDR and TBN getting the silvery briefcase out of the helicopter. Collins cuttingly says, \"the Heinrich mission was supposed to be covert. Thanks to you two \"geniuses\", the MSS and most of China are threatening to declare the five men who died in the pile up a terrorist act and start a world war. They look for most any excuse these days. But, Karl Henrich is out seeking revenge for his brother. And, because we can't take any chances with him... You're grounded until I say otherwise.\" At the same time... FDR and TBN murmurs nervously, \"grounded.\" Not long after... They're in their shared CIA accommodated room complex, sitting by their very dark blue desks. Their desks are directly facing each other on opposite ends of the wide living room area. The pool view for their pool above has been shuttered close with metal shutters. The windows on the white walls are shuttered. The black TV set, the silvery gray boombox, the video game consoles under the TV set... Everything electric but the ceiling lights and the kitchen appliances is turned off. The paintings of evergreens and Italian streets are just a slimmer of the outside world. FDR and TBN groan in frustration, tapping their fingers on the empty desks and bored out of their minds. Around then, over in a corporate skyscraper building... The morning light looks over the city block the mostly white marble like building looks over. It's for SCG Inc: Also known as Smart Consumer Grounds Inc. Inside of the SCG building... There's a office with bright white testing worktables and yellow warning signs on all the metallic testing equipment. The box patterns on the walls go from dark red to light yellow. Many women and men in white lab coats, safety goggles, and yellow safety gloves are there testing products. One certain woman with long sunny champagne blond hair tied back in a bun is testing flame resistance on some pans with a old fashioned flamethrower. Unlike the others there, she wears a buttoned up black lab coat that blends with her black pants. With a almost southern yet cooled off voice... Lauren says to herself, \"here we go.\" After burning the not already burnt pan before her... She turns off the flamethrower and gets out a fire extinguisher to ensure the flames die down. She then takes out a notepad from her lab coat and begins to jot down notes. On the pad, she writes down: So the Coretex has minimal damage. There's some calcining around the edges. However, the Tempolite has damage and there's rusting around 300 degrees. So that means the Coretex gets the recommend. At the end of the notes though, she frustratedly sighs. And, she can't help but think: The best product always win. I like my job. But...even my friend Em who works here gets to skip out a bit early for the holiday weekend to go out on a date with Jerry to a alpaca farm. Shit, I even had a boyfriend all the way through high school. When do I really get to win big? That late afternoon, in a supermarket... Lauren is now in a dark purple sleeveless top. Her long hair is let down, and she has a dark brown leather handbag over her shoulder with a long strap. She's shopping around with her best friend Trish: Rolling around a shopping cart with several green glass bottles of booze kind of clinking together next to a wrapped up batch of toilet paper rolls. Trish wears a striped blue and white T-shirt. She has her blond hair tied back in a drawn up ponytail, silvery hoop earrings, and has a dark blue handbag with a somewhat long strap over her shoulder. Lauren sighs out loud. She goes, \"ugh!\" With a kind of deep southern accent... Trish wonders, \"what? Can't think of anything but Steve again?\" They both pause between aisles. Most people walking by with their carts just roll by, rushing to buy more stuff for this holiday weekend. After a bit... Lauren blushes nervously a little. She says, \"it's just... I felt so stupid. Through high school, I left my friends and family behind to spend all my time with him. We were so happy. I day dream we're still together when no one else is around. Then I wake up.\" With a uneasy look... Trish comments, \"you know how many times you've told me this, Lauren?\" Awkwardly... Lauren guesses, \"over 2000?\" Trish explains outright, \"I'm happy to be your friend, Lauren. But...that's what I still don't get with your love life. You estimate good. You can make charts. You can tell me what detergent is good to use without looking at the label. You like your job and shit. So, why can't you be as good with getting a man if that's what you really want?\" Lauren paces nervously down the mostly vacant aisle of greeting cards. Half of them are gone from the vertical shelves. Trish catches up, rolling the cart not far behind her. Lauren then stops at a light blue Valentine's Day card. But, instead of picking it up... She turns back to face Trish. Sounding kind of desperate... Lauren says lowly, \"I'm going out! Dating...meeting guys like Ken.\" Trish rolls her eyes in disbelief. She exclaims lowly, \"oh please Lauren: He's the sushi guy you see every Tuesday to get takeout! And, I don't mean making out either.\" Looking down... Lauren heavily sighs. She says under her breath, \"you're right. It's just... Being with someone for mostly four years before he dumped me... Heavy sigh. It's hard, Trish. It's really hard.\" Trish very faintly smiles. She tries to be assuring, \"but at least you're now admitting it. That's a start.\" Lauren very faintly smiles back. After a bit... Trish suggests, \"that's why you should take my suggestion and start online dating. They have lots of charts and balls to test out.\" Lauren very faintly chuckles at a certain word, and it wasn't charts. Then though... She comments annoyedly, \"for the 2000th time, not that again. I watch Dateline and the creeps on there for my drama shows: It doesn't mean I want to live it. I could end up in a trunk...or in a skin suit.\" She looks very nervous now. Trish moderately sighs. She says, \"okay, okay. That's a little dramatic to me. The girls that go up on Dateline are like one in a hundred girls. Besides, if someone tried to kill you, I still have some contacts for some big guys that can get them to back away. Just please...at least think about it over the holidays. I know we're living together. But, do you really have anything else better to do?\" She gets out a folded up printout of a advertisement from her handbag, handing it to Lauren. Lauren reluctantly unfolds it for a bit before putting it away in her handbag. It says ItsFate dot net across it in polished white letters: Bordered around by yellow and purple confetti and light blue over them. Lauren very faintly nods. Trish very faintly smiles. That night, in FDR's and TBN's room... Several dark green bottles of spilled half drunk booze are on the wooden floor. Bullet holes are in some broken off pieces of wood. Their pistols are still spinning on the floor for who knows what reason. TBN's very dark green griffon tattoos are showing on his upper arms. And, under a shared white sheet... FDR and TBN are lying topless in front of each other, groaning kind of dizzily. FDR murmurs, \"god, I love drinking. But... Hiccup! How much did we have?\" TBN moderately sighs uncomfortably, \"too much. Hiccup! Did we just...do it with each other?\" FDR comments offhandedly, \"I don't know. I was too drunk to remember. Hiccup! But...did we?\" TBN wonders, \"I don't know. But, you know...\" FDR kind of groggily asks, \"what?\" TBN reasons, \"we're bisexual and grounded. The electricity is off: Even for the bugs the CIA might have placed. You checked yourself this morning. Does it matter? We don't have the same families.\" FDR looks nervous at him. He argues, \"are you kidding me? You're my best friend: We might as well be. I don't know about you sometimes. But, my nana would never forgive me for screwing a man.\" In near disbelief... TBN remarks, \"I don't believe you sometimes. We're secret agents, and you know she'd have strong words to say about killing for the . How is bisexuality any different here?\" FDR faintly laughs. After a bit... He brings up, \"that's true. But...I don't really know if I want to date you. We might have grown up in different families. But, we're family. Sorry. I... I'm just not sure I can really answer that question for you.\" TBN puts a assuring hand on his. He concludes, \"I think it's different here. But, okay man. Just let me know when you can.\" FDR uncomfortably nods. He just says, \"okay.\" There's some awkward silence for who knows how long. After that though... FDR more casually recalls, \"remember that family gathering at my Nana's when you said that kind of thing is lovely?\" TBN faintly smiles. He figures, \"the way your nana and grandfather looked into each other's eyes?\" With a faint smile... FDR lightly goes, \"yeah. That kind of thing. I'd like to hear it again right now.\" TBN faintly nods. He recalls, \"I trust you. I know you'd do anything for me. You would take a bullet for me. I would for you as well, you know that. But... Can you imagine all of that? Can you imagine what that would be like to share with a woman?\" FDR bluntly just says, \"no.\" TBN laughs at that. FDR comments annoyedly, \"okay. I'm lost: What's not serious about this?\" TBN slightly sighs. Then... TBN concludes, \"sorry man. It's just... Faint laugh. When has that stopped you from going after women?\" FDR very faintly smiles at that. Kind of annoyedly... He concludes, \"yeah: Except I never got far. They always end up leaving on the first date. I'd like to see you do better: Maybe give me some pointers.\" TBN suddenly looks down. He gets teary eyed. FDR asks in concern, \"you want to talk about something else, Mr. Deep in Thought?\" TBN reasons solemnly, \"several months ago...my ex-wife had a restraining order put on me after the karate incident. Maybe it's time we both really got back into dating with women.\" They both very faintly smile. FDR lightly remarks, \"I'd toast to that. But...you know.\" They both suddenly remember the spilled bottles on the floor. TBN kind of awkwardly goes, \"ohh yeah. We got to clean this up before the boss comes down.\" FDR nods. He adds, \"yeah. You're faster than me with this. So...good luck while I keep watch for you.\" As TBN starts to get up... He comments back annoyedly, \"yep. I'm so lucky.\" As he puts his hand behind his head to relax more, FDR just laughs. A week later, in Trish's and Lauren's house... It's early dawn. The walls are pale white. Reddish brown and gray patterned curtains are by the window. The dining room table is metallic black with some flowers and a rectangle striped mostly red tablecloth. The lamp is still on behind the dining room table. A set of polished wood like stairs head up. Trish's kid is sleeping upstairs. And, sitting at the dining room table is Lauren with her purplish black cell phone out. She looks kind of tired. She is yawing quite a bit. She's wearing a very dark purple sleeveless top under a gray sweatshirt and has pearl like earrings. She keeps frustratedly looking at a online profile for ItsFate dot net: With her picture on it and a header of \"come and get me boys\". In the gallery, photoshopped pictures of her feeling up women and men in some swimsuits and some workout clothes are there. There's also a picture showing her doing a handstand and enjoying herself while several guys are stripping her. Lauren sighs heavily, \"oh crap.\" Then... Trish comes down in a pale pink bathrobe. Her wet hair is just starting to dry. She says, \"hi. You're up early. What's...?\" With a sharp glare... Lauren gets up. She annoyedly turns the cell phone screen to face her. Lauren shot back lowly, \"bisexual?! Skinny-dipping?! Rollerblading 1994 much? I mean, what is this? I'm going to kill you Trish!\" Caught up in the moment... She looks about ready to just throw the cell phone at her. Trish puts up her hands like she's got a gun. She nervously calls out, \"Lauren, I'll change it back after the weekend! You didn't know what to fill out and you came to me. Guys are easy to get. After then, there's no harm done. Anyone at SCG would think it was just a internet prank. Okay?! Please just calm down.\" They just stand there for a few long minutes, very nervously breathing in and out. After a bit... Trish says with some relief, \"thank you.\" Lauren blushes. Embarrassed sounding... Lauren checks, \"you sure that's all they'll think at Smart Consumer Grounds?\" Trish puts a assuring hand on hers. She insists, \"yes. Besides, you look adorable in all of them. I did good photoshop.\" Lauren very faintly chuckles. She replies, \"yes you have. But, I was thinking of putting the stripping one up anyway. Freshman year. Those were good days.\" Trish concludes, \"I bet they were.\" She then notices Lauren looking at her cell phone again. Lauren seems stunned. Sounding joyful all of a sudden... Lauren says out loud, \"oh my god. Wait a second.\" With a faint smile... Trish lightly comments, \"you already picked a guy? I'm proud of you. Give it.\" Trish faintly smiles back as she hands her the cell phone to look. Trish adds, \"not my kind of guy. But, he looks nice.\" Lauren says, \"I think he's cute.\" And, on the cell phone screen... There's TBN's own profile on ItsFate dot net.[Chapter 2] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Chapter 2: Later that morning, in a historically preserved western saloon... TBN is getting ready to shoot some pool with FDR. They're by themselves. The pool table is all set up. They're both wearing blue jeans. FDR is wearing a white polo like T-shirt. TBN is wearing a very gray green polo like T-shirt: With some weird tattooed gibberish with O's showing over his chest and a thin metal chain around his neck. FDR comments with some concern, \"let me get this straight. You put your personal private details on a very public website? I thought you weren't risking your cover.\" TBN very faintly laughs. He figures, \"yes and no. I went with most of the truth: A ex-soldier named Tuck who went through post traumatic stress and checked into a mental hospital for several months. That's all.\" Candidly... FDR suggests, \"you sure that's not taking it too far though?\" TBN asks kind of nervously, \"what do you mean?\" FDR figures, \"you have your mental health put on that website. What? You think that won't bring all sorts of crazy women? Half of them are likely to get on the C.I.A. watch list.\" TBN shakes his head dismissively. He insists, \"yeah. That's nothing to worry about. We're not stones you just trample on. We're spies, right?\" FDR faintly laughs. He says solemnly, \"well, you're right about that. But, we've never really gone out looking for girls since the academy. Besides, Karl Heinrich is still looking for us. Just take care while I check out girls at the rental store. Okay?\" TBN faintly laughs. He points out, \"I thought you were looking for me to get first in line to date so you can get some pointers before getting back in.\" FDR laughs lightly. He faintly sighs. He remarks, \"I said maybe, cheeseball. Besides, with jukebox music and a lot of DVDs to break the ice, who knows? I could get lucky.\" TBN faintly smiles. He adds, \"okay, man. You'll need it.\" FDR kind of sarcastically mutters, \"yeah, thanks.\" More seriously... TBN says, \"you're welcome. But...I'm kind of scared for you. You sure you don't need me on ringtone just before it's time for my date?\" FDR deduces casually, \"not really. I can at least get a rental while I'm there. But...thanks Tuck.\" TBN says, \"anytime, FDR. Anytime. Now...are we going to just talk or play pool?\" FDR faintly laughs. He adds lightly, \"I'm going to kick your ass.\" He grabs up a cue stick. TBN lightly shakes his head. He goes, \"no. I'm not sold on it yet.\" FDR challenges, \"I can get you sold on it.\" TBN adds, \"give me your best shot.\" FDR hits two solid colored balls into a pocket with one shot. TBN then starts to make his shot. As the sun was setting, at a Irish pub not so subtly just called the Blarney Stone... The neon sign above the mostly red brick laid pub is a shamrock: Because of course it is. TBN is sitting in a black wooden chair before a outside wooden table. A matching open seat is across from him. He's kind of lying back in his seat, wearing gold rimmed black sunglasses. He also is wearing a plaid red buttoned overshirt over his very gray green polo like shirt. Then... A familiar looking woman in a light blue sleeveless dress with white flowery patterns comes walking his way. She has very slightly curled long sunny champagne blond hair. She's wearing Hollywood styled black sunglasses and carrying a dark brown handbag. She asks, \"Tuck: Are you Tuck?\" Tuck wonders kind of suspiciously, \"maybe I am. Who wants to know?\" Lauren very faintly chuckles. She puts down her sunglasses, still holding them in one hand. She gladly introduces herself, \"hi. I'm Lauren.\" Tuck puts down his sunglasses on the table. He gets up. Looking somewhat stunned... Tuck goes, \"oh my gosh. Hello. How are you?\" They shake hands before they both sit down at the table. Kind of awkwardly... Lauren adds, \"I'm ok. It's very nice to meet you.\" She's finding it hard to look right at him though. But then again, so is Tuck. A little awkwardly... Tuck says, \"you too. Um...wow. I saw your pictures. But, it's like...\" Lauren smiles, looking right at him now. She comments, \"...not like seeing the real \"product\"? Faint chuckle. You don't know how glad I am you think so.\" Tuck compliments, \"you are also really, really beautiful.\" Lauren blushes a little. She wonders, \"could you say that a few more times? Because you're even cuter when you talk.\" They both chuckle and laugh at that, kind of grinning. Then they both lightly sigh. Before Tuck can add something though... Lauren admits, \"although...I feel like I need to apologize for that bizarre profile.\" She throws her hands up a little. Completely unphased... Tuck starts insisting, \"no, no, no.\" Lauren insists back, \"please let me.\" Tuck just says, \"ok.\" Lauren figures, \"thank you. My friend Trish is... Heavy sigh. She means well. But, I was thinking of killing her this morning.\" Tuck reasons, \"oh, no. I get it. Everybody should have a cover: Case someone is watching you. Besides, you said she means well.\" Lauren says, \"true.\" After a bit... Lauren very awkwardly says, \"well... I don't usually admit this so soon. But...I don't always mind being watched or watching.\" Tuck faintly laughs. Lauren faintly chuckles. After a bit... Tuck assumes, \"wait. You're a spy?\" With a playful grin... Lauren questions, \"could I be?\" There's a suspicious glare forming on Tuck's face. But... Lauren assures him, \"I'm kidding! God. I meant sexually.\" They laugh and chuckle loudly. After they have some drinks... Lauren suggests, \"so tell me one thing that's not on your profile.\" Tuck recollects kind of nervously, \"um... I had a son and a wife. But...you really want to know?\" Lauren puts a sympathetic hand on his. She brings up, \"I know from your profile you went through some post traumatic stress. But, if you don't want to tell me...\" Tuck gets teary eyed. He admits, \"it's not that I don't want to. But...another time?\" Lauren solemnly says, \"sure. I'm sure there's things you don't know about me either.\" She pulls her hand away. But, she isn't going anywhere. Lauren adds, \"but...I have a very important question to ask. One you could answer.\" Sounding a little better... Tuck figures, \"good. Go on.\" His eyes start to dry up. Lauren questions, \"have you ever been or do you ever plan on being a serial killer?\" Kind of all too casually... Tuck supposes, \"well, I mean...you gotta keep your options open. But, I'd rather be a spy that kills killers before they do.\" Mostly unphased... Lauren says, \"okay. Fairly good answer.\" They both faintly grin. Tuck tells her, \"Lauren, you're incredible.\" Lauren tells him, \"you're not so bad yourself Tuck.\" Fifteen minutes later, at a one floor rental store called Vick's DVDs... Lauren is standing on a moving escalator, heading below ground level into the mostly dark blue walled rental store. Interestingly, she's got her sunglasses back on. But, she's grinning all the way down. The eight super wide mostly black aisles are marked with two way plugged in plug styled signs over bright green: Going from Family to Collectors Editions to Drama. DVDs and Blu-Rays line the aisles. Lauren looks through some DVDs. But, she faintly sighs with faint frustration. She puts them back. Then, as she's reaching for something in the Spy section... She almost bumps her hand into FDR's hand, who's also reaching for it. Soon as they realize it... They both kind of awkwardly pull back their hands. Lauren apologizes, \"oh, I'm sorry.\" Brushing it off casually... FDR insists, \"no, it's okay. You take it. I was about to change my mind anyway.\" He's wearing a open sleek gray black jacket over his white polo like shirt. Lauren checks, \"okay. You sure?\" FDR figures firmly, \"you're not gonna like it. Twist ending you'll see coming a mile away.\" With her head kind of tilted up... Lauren wonders, \"and how would you know what I like?\" FDR confidently answers, \"I know movies and women.\" Lauren faintly grins in amusement. She says, \"really? I'm not like most women you might know. You could get disappointed with me.\" FDR faintly smiles back. He faintly laughs. Lauren faintly chuckles. FDR then says, \"mm. Is that a challenge?\" Lauren casually shrugs. She faintly smiles. Lauren figures, \"you found me in a good mood. Why not? Why don't you tell me what I want?\" She walks by him. FDR smiles to himself just before walking by to catch up. After a bit... They're both standing in front of some DVDs on shelves at the end part of a aisle. Lauren questions, \"The Lady Vanishes? Why is that?\" She's holding a DVD copy of it as she asks. FDR concludes, \"well firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock: Ever. It's got comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. It's classy but not stuffy. A little obscure. So, if you haven't seen it, you'll thank me for introducing you to it. If you have, you'll know what a good choice it was.\" After a bit... Lauren recalls, \"well, I have seen it.\" FDR adds, \"mm-hm.\" Lauren faintly smiles. She states, \"and it is a really good choice.\" FDR smiles back. He goes, \"mm.\" Then... Lauren considers, \"however, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo, Topaz, or pretty much other movies outside of Hitchcock's films I like. In fact, it's sort of a second tier title in my book. Sorry to kind of disappoint you.\" Looking incredulous... FDR murmurs in near disbelief, \"second tier?\" With a serious tone... Lauren says, \"I don't mean to hurt your feelings. But, I see you surveying girls like they're DVDs to buy. The two problems are no one looks like a clean getaway, and girls don't like it when a womanizer comes in looking for easy targets.\" FDR faintly nervously laughs, trying to still seem casual in front of her. FDR asks, \"what? Are you arresting me now?\" Lauren highlights, \"no. You seem harmless. I'm perfectly capable of choosing my own movies. But, when you stop trying to look for easy targets and begin to really look at girls as girls, you'll find a lucky someone. Or, you'll find drama, one rental romance, and thrill on DVDs instead.\" Lauren then puts back the DVD on the shelf. She starts to walk away. FDR is left speechless. He shakes his head in frustration. As he starts to walk away though... Lauren suddenly turns back. She stands facing him, making sure he catches her from the corner of his eye. Catching the hint, FDR turns back to her. Sounding very unsure now... FDR wonders, \"what? You know where I can find her?\" Lauren faintly chuckles. Lauren considers lightly, \"well...you're cute. And, you're starting to sound like you're not trying too hard. I'll tell you what. I'll give you my number, and we'll see if you change your mind about trying to look for easy targets. Because to get me dear, you got to try harder.\" FDR smiles. Lauren very faintly smiles back. FDR concludes, \"seems like a challenge. But, that's not all. You already seem to be the most interesting and thrilling woman in the room.\" Lauren blushes a little. She says, \"thank you.\" FDR politely says, \"you're welcome.\" Lauren gets out her notepad from her handbag, ripping off a empty corner of it. She gets out a pen. And over a empty part of a shelf, she writes her cell phone number on it. Lauren then hands it to FDR. He pockets it in his open jacket. After putting her notepad and pen back into her handbag, Lauren heads for the check out line. On the way, she waves back to FDR. They faintly smile to each other. Before disappearing from sight, Lauren gets a copy of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. On his way up the escalator up... FDR keeps smiling. With a clenched hand in a ka-ching like motion down... He goes, \"yes!\" Late that night, in C.I.A. headquarters in California... On a mostly rustic DVD menu styled gray screen... Data Channels 1 and 2 windows are open: One dark blue and one gray. A Hash Table Length-Extension Attack window is open. At the computer screen... There's a technical guy with medium black hair and glasses. The technical guy asks, \"so sir, you want me to hack into a rental store database?\" Sounding somewhat nervous... FDR contemplates out loud, \"I think it could very well be a drop site for a unidentified spy. It could be for the Heinrich case. I'm not sure. That's why I'm asking.\" Sounding kind of nervous himself... The technical guy says, \"okay. Searching database.\" FDR says, \"all right, keep on scrolling.\" Shipping records and DVD orders for stocking up come up on the Data Channel windows. A Hit List Cross-Reference Attack window is also up. But, it comes up blank. The technical guy points out, \"I'm looking at the shipping records. But, there's no suspicious activity: Off or on the record.\" FDR faintly sighs. He holds up his head contemplatively over the chair with a arm. FDR figures, \"okay. The possibly unidentified spy gave me a number before she left. Can we trace it back to who it is?\" A little nervously... The technical guy says, \"we can.\" FDR stands upright, taking his arm off the chair. He firmly nods. FDR tells him, \"I'll give you the number.\" After reading off the number from the scrap of paper... The technical guy starts a search. A dark blue bordered Internal Gov Database Cross-Reference window comes up. Names and pictures of California residents speed down in blurs. After a bit, it stops at a certain name and picture: Lauren's. A address is right under her name: 6226 Placido Drive Pasadena, CA 91105 USA. FDR points a finger at the screen. He realizes, \"that's her.\" The technical guy pauses, tilting up in his chair to turn to him. The technical guy checks, \"sir...you sure Collins authorized this? I want to still keep my job.\" Not so casually... FDR admits, \"so do I. I want to fully check this out before filing in a report to the boss.\" The technical guy drops it, \"okay then.\" He scrolls through her driver's license, resume, cell phone contacts... Then, he stops at the house mortgage. The technical guy concludes, \"now this is odd.\" FDR wonders, \"what is odd?\" The technical guy points out, \"well, look at the mortgage payments.\" On the screen is one big mortgage payment of over 10,000 dollars in June 18 2010. But, the business lawyer that oversaw the deal has a message window in red letters next to it: Company folded. Reason pending. Investigation open, June 18 2010. Investigation closed, June 20 2010. Somewhat nervously... FDR realizes, \"there's only one big payment from two years ago. It was under a front company that folded. No explanation.\" The technical guy adds, \"exactly.\" The next day in the early morning, in FDR and TBN's shared room... The private pool and windows no longer have shutters over the glass. The electricity for the TV and the boombox is back up. The room is clean. Silver rimmed black laptops are now on their desks. Some pens, CIA ID badges, some sizable stacks of dusty CIA reports and manila folders, and their pistols are also on their desks. FDR and TBN are sitting at their desks. FDR wears a mostly light blue buttoned shirt with dark tan blue stripes down it. TBN wears a dark gray T-shirt. TBN casually inquires, \"what were you doing on the computer last night?\" With some nervousness... FDR says, \"I have a photo of my girl.\" TBN firmly smiles. He comments, \"that fast? Good for you.\" FDR faintly smiles. FDR figures, \"Thank you. What about you?\" Sounding a bit amused... TBN figures, \"man, I was doing the same thing. My woman said I could save a copy.\" With some mixed feelings... FDR admits, \"sure. For me...it's not that easy.\" TBN brings up, \"what do you mean?\" FDR says, \"I think she could very well be a spy, TBN. I had to do a background check to try to be sure. But...I'm still not.\" TBN looks off put some. He comments, \"I don't know if that's really creepy or romantic.\" FDR supposes, \"\"spymantic\". She was wearing sunglasses the whole time we were talking. But, she never said her name: She just gave me her number. I found out she had one big mortage payment for her house with a business lawyer. The company folded. No explanation. The investigation was quietly buried. But, I'll be sure to file a report to the boss as soon as I know for sure what the story is.\" TBN concludes, \"yeah. That does sound like she could be.\" Sounding more casual all a sudden... FDR figures, \"yeah. But, hey: Maybe she's for the good guys.\" TBN firmly smiles. He says, \"yeah. Hopefully.\" FDR adds, \"thank you.\" TBN adds, \"you're welcome.\" FDR wonders, \"wanna see?\" TBN goes, \"yeah sure. Wanna see her?\" They both smile. FDR says, \"yeah. I'd like to: Even though yours is probably from space.\" TBN remarks, \"I bet your spy woman has got claws under her gloves and howls at the moon.\" FDR jokes, \"she does. But she's still incredibly attractive without gloves.\" TBN faintly laughs. He then adds, \"she's a 10.\" FDR eagerly suggests, \"go on three. I'll sound off.\" TBN says, \"one, two, three and go? All right.\" FDR confirms, \"okay.\" FDR starts counting, \"One...\" TBN starts counting, \"one...\" FDR goes, \"...two, three.\" TBN goes, \"...two, three.\" They turn around their laptops at the same time, facing the opposite desk so they can see the photos on them. But, as they each look at the opposite laptop screen... They look stunned. For on both laptop screens...it's the same exact close up of Lauren's face: Slightly turning to a camera and grinning. TBN kind of nervously realizes, \"that's, uh...\" FDR is quicker on the last part of his thought, \"...Lauren?\" He's pointing at the laptop screen opposite him with his elbow on the desk. TBN asks, \"that's your spy woman?\" FDR recalls, \"right around the corner from the pub. I met her at the DVD store.\" Kind of nervously... FDR tries to be assuring, \"oh wow. I...I had no idea.\" A little awkwardly... TBN reasons, \"of course. How could you know that?\" FDR lies back in his chair, looking down nervously. After a bit... FDR looks up. He figures, \"you know what? I'm gonna make this really easy. I'm gonna bow out. You date her.\" TBN looks at him kind of funny, with his arm kind of out over the desk. He asks, \"hang on. Didn't she say she wanted to go out with you?\" FDR nervously gulps. He insists though, \"it doesn't matter. You're my best friend, and I don't want to make it unfair to you by getting in the picture.\" TBN looks right at him. He argues, \"yeah. But, you're my best friend too.\" Firm sounding... FDR says, \"yeah. But, you go date her.\" TBN looks at him a little confused. He says, \"well, I'm sorry. What does that mean?\" FDR implies, \"come on Tuck: What else could I mean?\" TBN gets teary eyed. He moderately sighs. After a bit... TBN thinks out loud, \"I mean...yeah: I screwed up with Katie and my son Joe. But, that doesn't matter now. We haven't really been back out dating since spy academy. And, like anything...\" FDR adds, \"... practice makes perfect, pal. Kind of yeah. But..\" TBN insists back, \"you don't have to bow out because of me.\" FDR looks kind of surprised. He straightens up in his chair. He checks, \"I don't? TBN bluntly remarks, \"I'm not concerned that she's gonna fall in love with you, pal. She works in product testing. You're still looking for werewolves. Spy, no spy, she'll roast you really bad. I'd be concerned for your dignity.\" Kind of glaringly... FDR sarcastically comments, \"yeah. How \"very\" nice of you. Thank you.\" Kind of grinning... TBN adds, \"you're welcome.\" FDR casually goes, \"sure. So, you do your thing: Whatever that is. And, um...\" TBN finishes the thought, \"...just let her decide.\" FDR kind of nervously adds, \"yeah.\" TBN kind of nervously adds, \"yeah.\" FDR, \"while we're at it, why don't we put some ground rules in?\" More serious sounding... TBN concludes, \"yep. We should. One, I think we should tell her we know each other.\" FDR firmly nods. He says, \"right. Good idea.\" TBN then adds, \"two, we stay out of each other's way with dating.\" FDR goes, \"all right. And three: No hanky-panky.\" TBN faintly laughs. He comments, \"god. What are you, five?\" FDR briefly puts up his hands like TBN is pointing a gun at him. He says, \"hey. I could maybe still use some pointers. Cut me some slack, pal.\" TBN says, \"all right. And if this ever starts to affect our friendship or seriously compromise our spy work...\" FDR is quick to say, \"which it won't.\" TBN repeats, \"...which it won't...\" FDR finishes the thought, \"...then we walk away.\" TBN adds, \"done.\" FDR concludes, \"so then, we...we have a gentleman's agreement.\" TBN confirms, \"yes. We do.\" FDR lightly says, \"may the best man win.\" TBN adds, \"the best man for Lauren.\" FDR figures nervously, \"right. For the lady, for her, the best man for Lauren.\" There's a awkward silence. FDR moderately sighs. TBN asks, \"what's wrong?\" FDR realizes, \"I can't ask you for pointers now, can I?\" TBN laughs. Sounding a little amused... He points out, \"sorry man. But, we just agreed. Too late now.\" FDR mutters kind of annoyedly, \"damn.\"[Chapter 3] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Chapter 3: Into the late afternoon, at a carnival by the docks... Festive music is playing: From the light red concession stands to the very light blue midways. Crowds of little children and their parents are going on the two mostly dark red tilt-a-whirls, the Ferris wheel, and several other rides lining the open dock area. Lauren is grinning wide as she's walking hand in hand with Tuck. Lauren is wearing a dark red detective like jacket with black buttoned pockets over her concealed top and blue jeans. Tuck is wearing a open buttoned dark blue army jacket. Lauren says, \"oh my god, I love these places.\" Tuck faintly laughs. He says, \"I thought you might like it. And, we're not gonna leave until we've spent quite some tokens.\" Lauren pauses. Before Tuck can say something though... She says something. With her free hand playfully tracing over his army jacket sleeve... Lauren wonders, \"I'm not against just quite a bit. But, why not a lot? Why not until it gets dark?\" Tuck faintly laughs. Lauren faintly chuckles. After a bit... Tuck considers, \"I have something else I'd like to show you. And, because you're dating me and my best friend until you decide, I don't want to leave him out in the cold.\" Lauren smiles. She concludes, \"ohh. How considerate of you.\" Lauren and Tuck continue walking to the midways. Yet, over Tuck's black cell phone's screen... There's two unanswered messages. There's no ringtone. It's just vibrating in his pockets. Meanwhile, not far off from . headquarters... There's a answering machine: Hello. Sorry. I'm not in. Please leave a message after the tone. I'll get back to you as soon as possible. A beep goes off. On the other end... FDR is nervously sitting back at his desk, impatiently tapping his fingers on the desk. He's holding his cell phone with his other hand. FDR leaves another message, \"yeah, Tuck? Tuck?! Damnit. Where are you man? We have a mission!\" Just then... Collins comes in: Shutting the door to FDR's and Tuck's shared room from behind. Collins presses tensely, \"FDR. What the hell are you still doing in your office space?\" FDR puts down his silvery rimmed mostly black cell phone, almost slamming it. He frustratedly comments, \"apparently nothing. I thought Tuck would pick up.\" Collins moderately sighs. She states, \"sorry. I'd pick you out a partner if there was one available. But, we're near out of time to keep a GPS lock on international smuggler Ivan Sokolov before he gets out of range and flies out of L.A. I'll be sure to brief you about Tuck. But, you got to get out there on your own for this mission.\" Looking fairly stunned... FDR goes, \"wow. Um...yeah. I hope he's ok. I'll get going.\" Collins adds, \"good.\" On his way out the door though... FDR turns back to her briefly. He suggests, \"not even agent Dive Chair?\" Collins very faintly smirks. She answers, \"she's away on Operation Red Bikini. Sorry.\" FDR mutters, \"figures.\" He then walks out, closing the door behind him. Meanwhile... Lauren and Tuck are taking turns throwing darts at light colored balloons for popping. Lauren gets five. Tuck gets six. Lauren misses a few. But, they're both faintly smiling to each other most all the while. Around then, in a nightclub in L.A... Ivan is sitting in a backroom at a black table. He's with his poker buddies, mostly all muscular and all wearing open dark blue jackets. He has medium dark brown hair, gold studded earrings, and \"LIVE\" tattooed in blue ink across the knuckles of one of his hand. He wears a black jacket and a white undershirt reeking of sweatshops. By the back way... FDR is walking to it. He has a kind of old fashioned silvery watch on. But, the center has a light up red arrow pointing the way to Ivan: Coordinated with C.I.A. GPS triangulation. It changes direction accordingly, turning to directly face the backdoor. Around then, in a corporate building somewhere... The sun is setting through the large windows. The walls are mostly pale tan. The light gray tiled halls are mostly vacant for the weekend. But, some C.I.A. guys in black suits are guarding the perimeter around a certain office. Still walking hand in hand... Lauren and Tuck are walking in. In Tuck's red car in the parking lot... A inflatable light and dark swirled pink dog from the midways is in the back. Lauren nervously wonders, \"okay. Where are we going?\" Tuck faintly smiles. He kind of jokingly says, \"I train lions here. You're safe with me.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She comments, \"no. I don't see or smell any lions.\" Tuck faintly smiles. He adds, \"not now, no.\" Lauren chuckles. Tuck faintly laughs. With no questions asked, one of them opens the light blue office door for Tuck. Tuck just says to him, \"thank you.\" He leads Lauren in. The man at the door closes it behind them. It's pitch black. But, a light switch is barely visible to the right. Lauren wonders, \"are you serious?\" Tuck tells her, \"close your eyes.\" Lauren kind of reluctantly puts her hands over her eyes. Tuck flips the light switch. The light is bright for a bit. Then... Tuck says, \"okay. You can open them.\" Lauren pulls her hands away and opens her eyes. Before them is a set of stairs going down to basement level...where there's a towering rope jungle gym held up by metal poles in a spider web like hourglass shape. Dark blue lights line the metal plated circus like pentagon of a arena. Rope trapezes on cables and pulleys automatically run up and down the metal poles in sloped circuits. Dark blue mats cover the floor. Black tarps are over dark gray government issue crates with C.I.A. logoed locks on them. They're filled with rifles, grenades, and spy watches. Lauren tears up a little. But, she's also grinning. She expresses, \"wow. It's so beautiful. Thank you.\" Tuck wraps a arm around her, pulling her in close by his side. He kisses her cheek. Lauren blushes a little, smiling back at him. Tuck adds, \"you're welcome.\" Lauren wonders, \"I have just one question. Why is there a giant corporate testing facility down here for focus testing?\" Tuck faintly shrugs. He comments, \"what else? Maybe rope nets. I don't really ask. FDR has good connections.\" Around then, back at the nightclub... Past the strippers by the gold pole putting on a show... Past the wooden round tables, glass bottles of wine and beer bottles, and the crowd of betters and onlookers... The song It Ain't Over by Southpaw Swagger is in the middle of playing. A bouncer in a black suit and tie is forcibly escorting FDR out. Sounding drunk all a sudden... FDR murmurs, \"I just wanted a drink an...to the queen...king...whoever...\" The bouncer mutters with contempt, \"yeah yeah. Go bother someone else, drunk.\" Just before they get to the front door though... FDR punches him down easy under his belt. The bouncer crouches down on his side, clutching over and crying out in indescribable pain. The kind of sharp yellow lights over by the front door make it hard for the crowd to see much of FDR's face or the bouncer. But, most all of them are getting up: Fairly shocked. FDR fires off a warning shot from his pistol. Acting angry... He calls out to the crowd, \"you get one warning!\" The crowd runs like hell, screaming. Several other bouncers are struggling to usher everyone out and themselves. FDR then punches out the bouncer still on the floor. He falls unconscious. Then... Ivan and his poker buddies come out from the backroom. They all get out rifles. And, they all fire. FDR tumble slides out of range. Many bullets make holes in the walls and gold tinted railing. On his side on the floor... FDR kind of spins back around with his pistol. He shoots one of Ivan's men in the leg. He stumbles down, groaning violently. He cries out, \"bollocks!\" He drops his rifle, clutching his dark red liquid dripping leg. FDR very faintly smiles. He adds, \"ouch.\" Around then, back in the C.I.A. facility... Lauren faintly chuckles. She observes, \"yeah. Some focus testing.\" After a bit... Tuck suggests, \"come on.\" Lauren figures, \"we get to go up there? That's awesome.\" Tuck faintly smiles. Tuck adds, \"yeah.\" Soon, they're racing each other to the rope jungle gym. They've taken off their jackets, leaving them on the mats. They're climbing up higher and higher for the upper rope web. Halfway up, Lauren stops to take some heavy breaths. She keeps a kind of shaky grip on the ropes. She's a little sweaty, and so is her light blue sleeveless top. Tuck pauses, turning to her right by him. He checks kind of nervously, \"you all right?\" Lauren questions nervously, \"you're gonna catch me if I fall, right?\" Tuck mostly assures, \"yeah. Absolutely.\" Lauren faintly nods. She faintly smiles. She adds, \"okay.\" After some more heavy breathing... She and Tuck keep climbing up. Tuck barely pulls himself up to the center of the rope webs, ready to take a breather against the upper rope web. He's somewhat sweaty all over. Then... Lauren's now sweaty hand slips. She struggles to pull herself up over to the center of the rope webs with one hand and two legs. But, her other hand is quickly slipping. She screams...as she starts to fall fast. Tuck calls out worriedly, \"Lauren!\" He jumps down after her. In a blur... He pulls her close to him in midair. And, from the corner of his eye... He keeps a eye on where the nearest automatic trapeze is. With his other arm, he grabs the automatic trapeze. The momentum and combined weight almost shakes Tuck off. But, he keeps his grip. The momentum steadies more and more. The automatic trapeze keeps climbing up around the center of the rope web. Lauren opens her eyes. She's faintly teary eyed. She sighs in great relief. She very faintly chuckles. She goes, \"oh my gosh. That was scary.\" Tuck apologizes, \"I'm sorry. Just now...I thought you were going to the hospital.\" He's getting teary eyed. He faintly sniffles. Lauren tries to assure, \"no, it's ok. You didn't let me fall. That's what's important. Besides...sometimes almost falling is the best part.\" Tuck very faintly smiles. Tuck tells her, \"okay. Keep holding on to me.\" As the automatic trapeze comes over the upper rope web... Tuck suddenly swings off. Lauren lightly screams as they both come down fast. They both land in the rope web. But, with both arms behind him... Tuck makes sure to shield her with his body against it. Lauren gets off of him, holding onto some rope herself. Tuck groans violently a little. His arms have rope burns along them. Just as quickly, he reorients himself: With one arm still holding a firm grip on the ropes and his legs against some ropes. Lauren checks worriedly, \"oh my god. Are you ok?\" She reaches out a sympathetic hand to Tuck's arm. But, Tuck puts a sympathetic hand on hers instead. Tuck concludes, \"oh that? They're okay. I've seen worse in Afghanistan.\" He finds it hard to look at her though. Some silent tears fall from his face. Lauren points out solemnly, \"I didn't mean your arms, Tuck. What's really tormenting you?\" Realizing first though both their arms are getting tired... They climb down to the bottom of the upper rope web. They lie down over it, breathing a little easier. Then... Tuck finally answers, \"I was thinking...about the karate incident.\" Lauren puts a sympathetic hand on his. Awkwardly... Lauren thinks out loud, \"what was that? I... Moderate sigh. I'm sorry. I don't know about it. But...yeah. I'd like it if you could tell me. That's what I'm trying to say.\" Tuck looks a little confused at her at first. But, he very faintly nods at the last part. Tuck solemnly says, \"okay.\" In his head... Blurry flashes go by of a mostly pale white tiled martial arts arena, with a medium black haired guy with a beard and mustache on a stretcher. He's severely bruised in multiple places. He's coughing up dark red liquid and falling unconscious fast. Paramedics try to stabilize his condition with surgery then and there. The kids at the karate class are running scared to their parents, who are waiting out in the grass surrounded parking lot. Among them is a teary eyed mother named Katie. She has long very dark brown curly hair and a pale tan business coat. Her very shaken son named Joe has medium dark blond hair and his karate gi still on. And, off to the corner of the martial arts arena... Tuck is silently sobbing, clutching his hands with faint dark red liquid around them. Presently... Nervously... Tuck reveals, \"after my time in Afghanistan...there were images. I came back to my wife and four year old son. But, those images... They can't be shaken easy. Several months ago, there was a father with his kid. Full of it... Faint sniffle. ...but not a killer. We had a little karate competition with our sons. My son lost. But, no one was...like I was then.\" Tuck takes a heavy breath. He then reveals, \"he... Faint sniffle! He playfully punched me. He said pain is just weakness leaving the body and that it makes you stronger. But...then the images came back. All I heard were bombings, screaming kids... Faint sniffle! I thought I was being interrogated by the Taliban. Next thing I remember...was the ambulance coming with a stretcher. He almost didn't make it. But, he never forgot. My wife divorced me and filed a restraining order. Weeks ago, I got out of the mental hospital okay. But... Faint sniffle! I don't think I'll get to see Joe again. I can't really blame them though.\" Lauren looks stunned. Some tears fall from her face. She murmurs nervously, \"wow. Faint sniffle. I'm...I'm really sorry, Tuck.\" After a bit... Tuck reflects, \"thank you. It's been hard after the war. But... Faint sniffle. If you also want to walk away...I can't really blame you.\" There's a nervous silence. But... Lauren doesn't let go of his hand. She wipes away most of the teariness in her eyes with her other hand. Solemnly... Lauren assures, \"you don't seem like a serial killer to me. Maybe you kind of were close to it once, Tuck. But... Faint sniffle. ...you seem so better now. Even when we first met, I could see it.\" Tuck says, \"thank you Lauren. For me...it means a lot.\" Lauren adds, \"you're welcome.\" She suddenly admits, \"besides... Faint sniffle! I've seen some things I can't forget.\" Tuck asks, \"wait. You mean you really are a spy?\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She asks back, \"what? You really think I could be?\" With nervousness... Tuck just answers, \"I don't know. It's a big city.\" With some mixed feelings... Lauren adds, \"yeah. It can be.\" Then... They just lie there against the rope web for who knows how long. Around then, back at the nightclub... Ivan's men suddenly pause. Before he can react... FDR is grabbed up by one of Ivan's men from behind. At the same time, he calls out angrily, \"you little bugger! Get up!\" FDR tries to swing his pistol at him. But, he just tightens his grip around FDR. FDR groans violently a little. His pistol goes flying. In the struggle... FDR kind of back jumps against the railing behind them...crashing them both through it. They fall on the vacant wood dance floor below. The guy by FDR has fallen unconscious. His head is heavily bruised. FDR stumbles back to his feet, clutching his aching bruised side. But, just as he does... Ivan backhands him. FDR falls unconscious on the floor. Ivan laughs. He mutters, \"I love when the agents get sloppy. Gotta be C.I.A. or some crap. Leave him.\" Some of his men smirk to themselves. Soon, they're heading out the door...leaving FDR's body handcuffed against the gold pole. That night, at C.I.A. headquarters... FDR is storming out of a silvery elevator. Concrete bunker walls line the hall. The handcuffs are gone. But, FDR is clutching the faint purplish bruise over his forehead: Still groaning violently a little from his injuries. TBN steps out of the elevator just before it closes behind him. TBN calls out, \"FDR! Wait. It's not what...\" FDR whirls around, glaring angrily at him. He shouts back, \"well damn you! I cannot believe you stood me up on a mission!\" He clenches his fists with his arms up over his chest briefly. He then starts storming off again. TBN mutters, \"hey. I thought if it was that important, Collins would call.\" FDR mutters back, \"I don't believe you. Your phone was on vibrate. Or, was it you mixed up my call with what's under your pants? That was a date, and you know it!\" FDR is already halfway to the metallic gray door to their room. TBN pauses. He heavily sighs. FDR is about to open the door. But, he pauses. He cuttingly remarks, \"I'm calling to tell Lauren I'm taking a cold shower first. I'm not cancelling. Faint laugh. Oh right: I already took one. Now I got to get another. Don't wait up.\" He opens the door. Very nervously... Tuck calls back, \"FDR.\" FDR whirls around. With a sharp glare... He mutters lowly, \"what?!\" TBN gets teary eyed. He brings up, \"you can be angry at me. But... Heavy sigh. You're really going out to see her with all those bruises?\" FDR lowly mutters, \"yes!\" With that... He slams the door shut behind him. TBN shakes his head. He looks down, sighing heavily. And, as he walks away... He mutters nervously under his breath, \"don't get yourself killed, pal.\"[Chapter 4] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Chapter 4: Forty or so minutes later... FDR is driving down the street in a silvery dark blue car, looking like a mini-rocket ship with the exhausts back there. He wears a formal gray business suit, all ironed out with a fancy collared purplish pink shirt under it. And, in the co-pilot seat is Lauren. She's wearing a sleek gray black jacket and a dark purple sleeveless dress under it. She also has her handbag over her shoulder. FDR wonders kind of nervously, \"what's wrong? You seem restless.\" Lauren moderately sighs. She points out, \"I'm getting worried. You have a bruise on your head. So, I get it if you didn't want to show. You sure you're okay?\" Trying to be all casual... FDR insists, \"thank you. But, really: It's nothing.\" Lauren kind of defeatedly says, \"if you think so. But, don't blame me if people come and ask you.\" FDR concludes determinedly, \"not where we're going. I'm in good with a nightclub. I called in. We can go around the back: No questions asked.\" Lauren very faintly chuckles. She comments, \"you really have thought of that spot on your head. I'm kind of surprised.\" FDR faintly smiles. He adds, \"you're welcome. It's the Shakalongo. You're going to love this place, I swear.\" Lauren very faintly smiles. She says, \"we'll see.\" But already, her eyes are nervously drifting elsewhere. Not long after, at the Shakalongo nightclub... There's disco tinfoil like walls with little glare. The seats and booths have pale yellow cushioning with light green lines down them. The staff is wearing sleek very dark green suits and pants. Lots of young people are dancing and swaying their asses to the song Look Sharp by Joe Jackson. There's a dark green wall section with several bronze statues of figures holding up globes behind the bar. A backdoor is right by the bar. FDR and Lauren have a private table in front of the bar. Some empty wine glasses are there. After talking some to the bar attendant and the DJ... FDR has brought over a then opened glass bottle of wine. He politely says, \"would you like some, my lady?\" Lauren very faintly smiles. She politely says, \"sorry FDR. I'm not thirsty now. Maybe a little later.\" FDR adds, \"sure. Sure. I'm going to have some though.\" He pours some wine into his glass. He puts down the glass bottle of wine. FDR wonders, \"are you okay? Because you seem more uptight now than I thought you were.\" With some mixed feelings, Lauren moderately sighs. She gets teary eyed. She brings up, \"please don't tell me that spot on your head is nothing.\" FDR asks nervously, \"okay. What do you want me to tell you?\" Lauren starts to say, \"FDR...\" She moderately sighs again. She gets teary eyed. After a bit... Lauren kind of nervously confesses, \"I need to be honest. I know you mean well. I know you're probably trying to protect me. But, if Tuck wasn't your best friend, I would just think you have the emotional intelligence of a fifteen year old boy.\" Thinking back to recent events... FDR gets teary eyed. His fists are clenched under the table. But, he thinks twice before raising them. He murmurs nervously, \"and what does that mean you think of me now?\" Lauren figures, \"I'm trying to say I know better. But, what I'm also trying to say is...\" Sounding a little better... FDR asks solemnly, \"yeah?\" He's unclenched his fists, letting his arms up over the table. Lauren heavily sighs. She puts a sympathetic hand on his. And... She says, \"let me make this easy for you to understand FDR: I worry a lot. Faint sniffle. Also for people I care about. If you can't even tell me something about why you got hurt...can you really imagine any chance of going out with me? I can't.\" FDR heavily sighs. He says, \"I'm going to get some air.\" He gets up, walking out the back door. It slams shut. Lauren leaves some money on the table. She opens the door, trying to catch up to FDR. FDR is already getting into his car. He's fighting the urge to cry. But, as he starts the engine... Lauren stands in front of the car. Still teary eyed... Lauren asks in concern, \"where are you going?\" After a bit... FDR looks up. He faintly sniffles. FDR admits, \"there's a lot I want to tell you. But... Faint sniffle. You could get killed if you know. I don't think you can handle it.\" Then... Lauren goes wide eyed. She realizes, \"oh my god, I know why now. Faint sniffle! The testing facility, your bruise... You're spies.\" There's a nervous silence. Some tears fall from Lauren's face. She sniffles hard. Some tears fall from FDR's face. But, he's trying very hard to ignore them. After a bit... FDR says, \"um... Okay. Faint sniffle. I know you have questions. I know I have questions. But, could we call it a night?\" Sounding a little better... Lauren says, \"yeah. It's okay.\" FDR very faintly smiles. Teariness starts to dry up from his eyes. As Lauren is turning to get back in FDR's car though... She sees from across the street someone she knows...or at least knew. It's her ex-boyfriend Steve, walking hand in hand with a woman with long black curly hair. He has medium kind of clean shaven black hair and stubble and a mustache. A engagement ring is glistening on the woman's finger. And, Lauren knows they're very likely in love. Lauren gets in the car. FDR starts to drive away. But, as he does... He sees from the corner of his eye Lauren is looking down very nervously and shakily. Lauren is sitting on her hands, struggling to control herself in the seat. FDR asks in concern, \"what's wrong?\" Lauren suddenly whispers, \"Steve... I mean... Moderate sigh. Pull over.\" Not sure what else to say right now... FDR just says, \"okay.\" He pulls over by a available spot down a street. Lauren unbuckles her seatbelt and unbuckles his. All of a sudden... She's wrapping her arms around him and puckering up her lips. FDR reactively restrains her arms with his arms around her arms. Her hands are still reaching for him like crazy. Looking very confused... FDR asks, \"why are y... Are you bipolar?\" After a bit... Lauren sighs heavily. Her hands relax a little. Lauren starts to say very nervously, \"no. I'm sorry. Just...\" She moderately sighs. After a bit... Lauren admits, \"I know this is weird and the last thing you could be thinking of now. But... Hard sniffle! I'll feel better if you just kiss me right now.\" FDR lets go of her arms. FDR very faintly chuckles. He kind of nervously comments, \"yeah. I can see that. But, are you crazy?\" Lauren faintly rolls her eyes kind of annoyedly. She whispers in his ear, \"just kiss me, you sentimental fool.\" FDR can't help but faintly chuckle at that. Soon... They're wrapping their arms around each other. They pull each other into a kiss. They're making out quite a bit in the car. They're about to start taking off their clothes. Then...they suddenly remember how they got there. They pull away. FDR awkwardly clears his throat. FDR adds, \"I think I'm adding to my questions you owe me a explanation for what just happened.\" Lauren comments awkwardly, \"yeah. I owe you a lot of explanation. But...thank you.\" She blushes a little, despite the lingering teariness in her eyes from everything else. They both straighten up and buckle up. With some amusement... FDR concludes, \"sure. Maybe you're crazy. But...you don't seem too crazy. Coming from me, that's plenty.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She then kind of repeats herself, \"I owe you and Tuck a lot of explanation. But...thank you.\" FDR very faintly nods. FDR drives away with Lauren, heading to her house. The rest of the way is silent. But, what they don't see...is a C.I.A. issue white painted drone: High up in the night sky, silently following them. The next morning, at C.I.A. headquarters... Looking somewhat better... FDR is wearing a black suit and tie. He's walking past grids of spy surveillance monitors. Some private surveillance camera control rooms are off to the sides. Technical guys are closing the doors behind them as they go in. FDR very faintly smiles, seeing a bald and bulky looking C.I.A. operative in a black cushioned wheeled chair. He politely says, \"good morning.\" The operative faintly smiles back. He says, \"good morning sir. You look better than last night when you were going to the nightclub. We're just glad you're okay.\" FDR's face suddenly hardens. He gets teary eyed. The operative asks in concern, \"FDR, is something...?\" FDR doesn't answer. He storms off for the nearest elevator, not looking back. He mutters back, \"shut up, Bothwick.\" The operative sighs heavily into his hand. He doesn't know what more he can say. Shortly after, in FDR's and Tuck's shared room... FDR slams the door shut on his way in. He glares in TBN's direction. He's still teary eyed. TBN gets up from his desk. He's wearing a kind of open dark blue collared shirt. Concerned... He starts to ask, \"FDR? What...?\" Before he can react... FDR slams him against the wall. One of the paintings falls down. TBN doubles over, coughing a little. FDR pinpoints, \"you reconned my date!\" TBN gets back up, facing him. He sighs heavily. He tries to explain, \"I...I'm sorry. But FDR, I was worried about you. If she took you out as a spy, wouldn't that be worse for the C.I.A?\" FDR heavily sighs. He begrudgingly thinks out loud, \"damn. I think you're right.\" TBN very faintly smiles. He adds, \"thank you.\" Sounding a little better... FDR kind of nervously says, \"thank you for being ready to go into action to save my ass.\" TBN faintly chuckles. He adds, \"you're welcome.\" FDR and TBN hug each other. When they pull away, they both faintly smile. TBN kind of nervously questions, \"so...are we going to be okay?\" FDR concludes, \"yeah. We're best friends. Just be sure to leave your phone on ringtone from now on, and you can both be annoyed for me calling you 24/7. Deal?\" TBN faintly nods. He faintly chuckles. He adds, \"deal.\" They shake on it. FDR sits back down at his desk, ready to get back to work. FDR is walking out the door. Just before he does though... He turns back to face TBN. TBN questions casually, \"was there something else you wanted to tell me?\" Sounding suspicious... FDR is quick to ask, \"um, yeah. Who else knows about our...?\" TBN mostly assures, \"just me, man. I only told the guys about the nightclub: Not Lauren.\" FDR adds kind of nervously, \"good. That's good. But...\" TBN asks, \"what?\" FDR brings up, \"were you really not spying the whole time we were kissing?\" Kind of nervously... TBN is quick to say, \"what? No, no...\" Somewhat coldly... FDR concludes, \"you did.\" FDR starts to glare. TBN very faintly chuckles. FDR asks lowly, \"what's funny about this? This is serious!\" Casually all of a sudden... TBN brings up, \"hey man. She said she doesn't always mind being watched. Her words.\" He taps down by the open laptop's keyboard several times for some reason. FDR sighs heavily. He clenches his fists by his side. FDR exclaims lowly, \"Jesus!\" He mutters, \"I don't believe this. What else are you not telling me, TBN?\" TBN tries to be assuring, \"that's the only other thing. I never expected you to get much anywhere that night with all those bruises. So...\" Somewhat coldly... FDR voices, \"you know what? Maybe we're still spy partners. But, this means war pal.\" He storms out, slamming the door shut behind him. TBN moderately sighs. He tries to do some work on the laptop. But, he can't concentrate much. After a bit... TBN gets out his cell phone. He leaves a text message on FDR's cell phone. It says: I know what we can do to settle this. See me in surveillance control room 3A, 12:30 P.M. 12:30 P.M., in surveillance control room 3A... FDR concludes, \"let me get this straight. You bugged her house and you didn't tell me?\" FDR and TBN are sitting by the main computer in the room, surrounded by monitors. They're both in black cushioned wheeled chairs. The C.I.A. logo is behind them. Strips of red lights go across the beams between walls. The tiled floor is pale yellow. TBN explains, \"no. The C.I.A. sent a team in to bug the house because we were not sure if she's a spy or not. This was late last night. With several international operations going on outside of Los Angeles, we're kind of short on agents. Collins didn't ask any questions. She just said to sort it out on our own and give her the report.\" FDR faintly chuckles. He figures, \"great. We even get the whole room for a week.\" TBN concludes, \"yeah. And, since she won't really mind being watched by us...\" FDR finishes the thought, \"...she won't be too upset about this if she ever does finds out.\" TBN adds, \"yeah.\" They both faintly smile. TBN concludes, \"we'll see about her decision soon enough.\" FDR confidently figures, \"yeah. We'll see.\" He lies further back some in his chair. TBN starts pressing control keys. Voice print matches in light blue, infrared, satellite map grid feed, implanted mini-camera feed windows in full color... They're all slowly loading: With a mostly dark blue tinted loading bar on the screen at 5 percent so far. FDR confidently says, \"I think Lauren likes me more. Girls like someone who has a sensitive side.\" TBN faintly sighs. He turns to him. He comments kind of cuttingly, \"they also don't like it when you worry them sick. Sorry. But, I don't think she does like you that much.\" FDR solemnly concludes, \"look. She surprised me too. But, she seemed incredibly capable of handling herself. She stood out in front of my car and didn't even hesitate. Faint chuckle. Yeah. I really...\" With his finger over his mouth... TBN suddenly goes, \"shh.\" FDR asks kind of tensely, \"what?\" TBN points out, \"the feed. It's up.\" FDR realizes, \"oh. Oh, good.\" The loading bar gets to 99 percent. Then... It all comes in: Including the mini-cameras feed. On the other end of the mini-camera feed... Lauren is standing behind the metallic kitchen counter, drinking some from a glass of wine. She has her hair straightened. She wears a grayish blue jeans like buttoned shirt, with hints of a white bra peeking out. The metallic refrigerator is right behind her. A view of the stairs heading up and the dining room is easy to see in front of her. Two different colored bottles of wines are on the kitchen counter: One with yellowish wine and one with greenish wine. Trish is sitting on the other side of the kitchen counter. She has her shoulder length slightly curly hair down. She's wearing a silvery watch and a mostly browned over honeycomb like sleeveless dress with black straps over her shoulders. Lauren puts down her wine glass. She moderately sighs. Lauren nervously says, \"this is really serious. I...I can't believe this. Heavy sigh. Last month, I was single and day dreaming I'm still together with Steve a lot. Now I'm dating two gorgeous guys. I'm still trying to get over Steve...and I don't know if I'm going to be stuck single with nine cats, playing Boggle...and knitting out of shit.\" Trish faintly chuckles. She comments, \"Lauren, you're not going to knit out of shit.\" Lauren wonders nervously, \"you sure?\" Trish remarks, \"I do dirty deeds and shit with many guys on my nights out while you stay and babysit. Even if you grow old here, you're still going to be much cleaner.\" Lauren chuckles. Trish faintly laughs. Lauren adds, \"thank you. I needed that.\" Trish adds, \"you're welcome.\" She drinks some of her wine. Then, she sets it back down. In the surveillance room... FDR looks fairly stunned. TBN is moderately groaning into his hand over mention of dirty deeds. In Trish's and Lauren's kitchen... Trish wonders, \"I still don't know if you chose one for dirty man stink: You know, the good stuff. Have you?\" Lauren very awkwardly admits, \"no. I know it can't be for witness protection or taking down a no good corporate CEO. Or, either of them would have told me. But, I don't even know who they work for. Yeah: I have a good idea of the kind of people they are. But, we haven't even dated a week. How can I really choose?\" Trish moderately sighs. She solemnly reflects, \"oh my god. Maybe I don't think it's a big deal. But...I guess not everyone can be like me and get dirty man stink from a spy after knowing him for just a few days. But, hey: I had good times with my really fat husband Bob...before he died on a undercover job for the FBI.\" And, off of the mini-camera feed in the surveillance room... TBN zooms in the screen on a badge on Trish's lap. It's a F.B.I. badge: With the name Bob in gold. FDR and TBN look stunned. TBN murmurs, \"oh god.\" FDR chuckles in near disbelief. He thinks out loud, \"it was never Lauren, was it? It was her best friend's husband, and he's not even in the C.I.A. database.\" Back in the kitchen... Lauren solemnly adds, \"oh yeah. Right.\" She heavily sighs again. She then supposes, \"okay. You know more about dating spies. What do you think I should do?\" Trish suddenly smirks. She figures, \"well, I have some ideas.\" Lauren smiles. She concludes more cheerfully, \"really? Sure. Let's hear them.\" Trish concludes, \"well, if you want me to get this to be really easy for you... I can get FDR, and you can still go for Tuck. I think he's hot.\" Back in the surveillance room... FDR moderately groans into his hands. FDR murmurs, \"no. God no.\" TBN is kind of doubled over, laughing. Back in the kitchen... Lauren shakes her head kind of annoyedly. She concludes, \"sorry. But, I'm not that not sure. I really like them.\" Trish moderately sighs. She reluctantly concludes, \"fine.\" After a bit... Trish offers, \"still... I'm available as a friend. If you want me to have sex with both of those guys...just to test out stuff, find out who they work for, and see who comes back a winner and who doesn't... They wouldn't know. I'd get a rubber mask and wig and pretend I was you.\" Suddenly... Lauren nervously asks, \"umm...Trish?\" Back in the surveillance room... FDR and TBN suspiciously glare in the direction of Trish in the mini-camera feeds. TBN comments, \"well, we now know better.\" FDR agrees, \"yeah man. That's true. Good thing for that.\" Back in the kitchen... Trish wonders kind of cluelessly, \"what is it?\" Suddenly... Lauren very faintly smiles. And, she says, \"did you just forget we're on their bugs?\" Sounding a little embarrassed... Trish mutters, \"well, shit.\" Back in the surveillance room... FDR and TBN are speechless, looking back in shock. Lauren even waves to one of the mini-camera feeds. After a bit, Lauren puts her hand back down. She turns back to Trish. Lauren apologizes, \"sorry.\" Sounding a little better already... Trish insists, \"it's okay Lauren. It's just me and my dirty deeds. But...why don't we give them something good to focus on before they might cut the feed all upset?\" Lauren faintly smiles. She adds, \"that's actually a good idea. Thank you.\" After a bit... Lauren deduces awkwardly, \"oh my god. It's really hard to pick good things about them right now. Could I pick flaws?\" Trish faintly laughs. She concludes, \"okay. One of them probably would think so. Even if that is what's going on with them, that makes it really easy for you.\" Lauren figures, \"possibly. Okay. Flaws.\" In Lauren's and Trish's kitchen and the surveillance room... There's a kind of nervous silence among all of them. After a minute... Lauren thinks out loud, \"FDR... He comes off like he only cares about himself to protect himself and anyone else he cares about. He really means well. But... Heavy sigh. It's like he has this protective ice shield in a flamethrower test.\" Looking stunned... Trish murmurs, \"shit. So he's close to melting ice.\" Lauren gets teary eyed. Lauren very awkwardly says, \"well... Heavy sigh. It's possibly the most incredible protective shield I ever could see in a guy. But...yeah. Faint sniffle! I'm still really worried for him.\" In the surveillance room... FDR moderately sighs in his hands. TBN faintly laughs. He comments, \"hey, I tried to tell you she was going to roast you. You did it to yourself.\" After a bit... FDR looks up, somewhat coldly glaring his way. TBN nervously gulps. Back in the kitchen... Lauren figures more casually, \"and Tuck? Yeah. He's fun. But...he also seems stuffy. Like maybe kind of too much British stuffy.\" Trish makes a face. She goes, \"ohh. Yeah. That's not so good after a while.\" In the surveillance room... FDR doubles over, laughing hard. TBN sharply glares at him. TBN comments annoyedly, \"I'm not British!\" FDR slightly sighs, catching his breath. Pointing off to the mini-camera feed... FDR cuttingly remarks, \"well, they sure think so. And, Lauren always gives you \"good grilling\" to work with. Right?\" TBN gets up, shaking his head. He then storms off, slamming the door shut behind him. But, caught up in the moment... FDR keeps laughing to himself: Not even hearing the door slam.[Chapter 5] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Chapter 5: The next day, at a military outpost modeled playfield... It's going into the late afternoon. Camo nets are hung over thick tree branches. Piles of rubber tires are here and there on wooden planks. Down on the ground, there are eight one level watchtowers out of wood and plenty of tire piles. Plenty of kids and adults are getting on mostly black military style gear, gray pouches of paintball capsules, and mostly silver lined yellow lensed ski like goggles. They're carrying black paintball guns. Behind some of the camo nets... Lauren and TBN are getting their gear and paintball guns ready. Lauren is wearing a gray long sleeved shirt and blue jeans. TBN is wearing a light red T-shirt and ripped blue jeans. Lauren concludes, \"okay. I'm think I'm ready.\" She gets her goggles on. TBN checks, \"I think I'm ready too. You ever carried a weapon before?\" Lauren glances at her loaded paintball gun. She faintly chuckles. She admits kind of awkwardly, \"no, just water balloons at parties. I wasn't really good. I kept getting wet. So...yeah: Any ideas for me?\" TBN faintly laughs. Lauren faintly chuckles with a awkward grin. TBN faintly nods. He figures, \"okay. Just keep close to me and keep that end of the weapon well in the other direction from me. I'll cover you and you'll cover me.\" Lauren says nervously, \"um...okay.\" TBN asks in concern, \"what's wrong?\" Lauren faintly smiles. At a near whisper all of a sudden... She points out, \"not much. Just... You sure you don't need goggles? People could see right away you're a spy.\" TBN faintly laughs. TBN firmly reasons, \"if anyone asks, I'm a ex-soldier. I think I'm covered. But...thank you Lauren.\" He loads his paintball gun. Lauren adds sincerely, \"you're welcome Tuck.\" She loads her paintball gun. She walks over to some tires to test it out with a shot. But, nothing's coming out. TBN puts down his paintball gun. He walks over. He checks, \"you need some help?\" Lauren concludes, \"yeah. Maybe. I think my triggering mechanism is stuck.\" She keeps banging it kind of loudly against the tires as springs ache from the paintball gun. She sighs frustratedly. She glares at the paintball gun. Meanwhile... FDR is hiding by a camo net, wearing camo military gear and a matching military helmet. He's loading a small pea shooter with a little dart. He's faintly smiling to himself as he does. Kind of tensely... TBN goes, \"okay. Just... Just please stop hitting it! You're only...\" TBN is struggling to safely take the paintball gun away from Lauren. Her hands are clenched around it tightly as she's getting ready to determinedly try to bang it again. Just as Lauren tries to fire the paintball gun though... FDR fires. The little dart bounces off the safety button on Lauren's paintball gun...while it's unintentionally aimed between TBN's legs in the struggle. FDR runs for it. He tumble jumps off the end of some wooden planks, disappearing from sight. A yellow paintball hits TBN between his legs. His paintball gun falls on the wood. He doubles over forward, coughing violently some. A lot of spit comes out of his mouth. Lauren gets wide eyed and teary eyed. She drops the paintball gun. It kind of splinters on the wood. Lauren worriedly cries out, \"oh my god! Are you okay?\" She puts two sympathetic hands on his shoulder, ready to try to help him up. After half a minute... TBN catches his breath. He straightens up. He kind of firmly nods. Lauren somberly says, \"I shouldn't have tried to fight you. I'm really sorry. Faint sniffle. I just...\" Some tears fall from her face. But... TBN insists somewhat casually, \"no, I'm good. You're okay.\" As he says it...he catches from the corner of his eye the little dart on the wood floor. Lauren voices, \"no, I'm sorry. I really don't like it when I can't get a product to work, and... Heavy sigh. I just feel so bad.\" She steps back a little as TBN picks up the kind of splintered gun. He holds it up. Kind of lying... He says, \"I was keeping watch on it before it fell. It's just a bad gun. It's not you.\" Lauren very faintly smiles. Lauren concludes, \"I still feel bad. But...you sure?\" TBN puts a sympathetic hand on her shoulder. He kind of confidently says, \"yeah. We'll go and get a new one with no stuck safety. I'll cover you.\" The teariness in Lauren's eyes start drying up. Lauren adds more cheerfully, \"thank you. I needed that.\" TBN adds, \"you're welcome.\" They fast walk down some wooden steps. They get to the paintball gun bin. Lauren is picking one out. Paintball guns fire off. Several people go down in colorful paint bursts by some tires. A kid laughs at the yellow paint still on TBN's pants. Some people fire paintballs at TBN. But, TBN side tumbles easy past the incoming paintballs. He fires paintballs at two of them as he does, taking them down. The kid is about to fire a paintball at TBN. As Lauren is testing out her latest paintball gun... It fires a paintball. The kid goes down in a colorful paint burst of blue. Lauren chuckles in relief. She goes lightly, \"oh my god.\" TBN calls back, \"that was good!\" Lauren adds, \"yeah.\" Soon, they're standing on top of a watchtower. They're faintly smiling. They're back to back, firing paintballs. More people go down left and right. And now, no one is laughing at the yellow paint still on TBN's pants. They're just enjoying themselves. Early that night, at a certain house... The garage walls are mostly cobblestone. The roof is dark gray with some windows from the attic. The support beams between the walls are darkish blue. A white lined mostly light gray stable and a white lined mostly light gray shed is in the back. There's a wide grassy field. Off in the center, some white painted tables and wooden chairs are between some trees. A kid with a blue pail is whirling around back there, making rocket noises. FDR is pulling up in the driveway in his car. And, Lauren is in the co-pilot seat. What neither of them notice though...is a familiar C.I.A. spy drone hovering over a mostly light yellow house just across the street. FDR is wearing a formal black suit and white undershirt. His bruises seem mostly gone. Lauren is wearing a white laced sleeveless dress and her sleek gray black jacket. Lauren has her hair looking all polished and slightly more curly. She has on faint purplish red lipstick. In surveillance room 3A... Tuck is sitting there, faintly smiling to himself for some reason. He's got a ice pack for around his legs. But, he's wearing another pair of blue jeans. Back at a certain house... FDR wonders, \"where is Tuck? He was supposed to be here for the special occasion.\" He's acting absentminded as he says it. Somewhat awkwardly... Lauren starts to go, \"umm...\" Turning to her... FDR wonders, \"what's wrong?\" Lauren blushes a little. She explains, \"he had to get his pants cleaned...because of a bad paintball gun. Kind of a long story. But, his... Moderate sigh. Well, he said to tell your nana he had to go into overtime at that desk clerk job. But, to be honest with you...he's still kind of sore down there.\" FDR makes a uneasy face. He figures, \"ouch. Like the Bangladesh incident.\" Lauren nervously questions, \"what incident?\" FDR is quick to say, \"long story.\" Lauren suggests, \"maybe you should tell me later. I mean, if it's not too classified.\" FDR tries to assure, \"no. Not for you.\" Lauren faintly smiles. FDR faintly smiles back. FDR gets out a recently bought apple pie from the back of the car. Lauren and FDR walk up to the dark blue lined white door, holding hands. Once they get there, FDR pulls his hand away so he can have a free hand to ring the doorbell. The door opens. From inside, the house's walls are diagonally stripped mostly dark blue and white. FDR's nana appears in the doorway. She has her blondish gray hair tied in a bun. She's wearing a open long sleeved light green woven sweater over a white long sleeved shirt. She also wears a short black shrouded pink and purple floral gown. Nana greets, \"oh, hello.\" A little awkwardly... FDR introduces, \"uh, Nana, this is Lauren. Lauren, this is my grandmother, Nana.\" Nana kind of quickly comments, \"so you're the girl who's been putting up with Franklin and Tuck.\" Lauren kind of confidently smiles. She just says, \"mm-hm.\" Nana adds, \"it's nice to meet you, Lauren. I've heard quite a bit about you from my grandson.\" Lauren adds, \"well, thank you. It's nice to meet you too.\" They shake hands. FDR is still standing there next to Lauren, awkwardly so. Nana courteously concludes, \"you're welcome. So, where is Tuck?\" Lauren gives her a explanation, \"he's sorry he couldn't make it. He tried to get out of work tonight so he could do it tomorrow. But, he had to work overtime.\" Nana nods approvingly. She figures, \"I see. He always was so dedicated.\" Just then... FDR holds up the pie still in his hand. With a polite smile... He tells, \"I brought pie.\" Nana kind of bluntly deduces, \"yeah, well, you know where the kitchen is. Lauren and I have a lot to talk about.\" FDR kind of awkwardly nods as he starts his way for the kitchen. Nana is courteously escorting Lauren in with her hand. Lauren just smiles as she lets her lead the way towards some white double doors. FDR lays down the pie on the polished cobblestone like kitchen counter. Suddenly... Nana turns back to FDR, \"oh, Franklin?\" FDR pauses. He asks, \"yes, nana?\" Nana brings up, \"there was a big package at the door. It's addressed to you.\" Sounding a little confused... FDR automatically assumes, \"where can I...? Oh right. In the back?\" Nana faintly chuckles. She concludes, \"no. Just by the kitchen counter. I didn't want the government seal to draw attention. Oh, how the neighbors do like to gossip.\" Lauren and FDR look quite nervous for a bit. But, just as quickly, they politely smile. FDR adds, \"thank you.\" Nana adds, \"you're welcome.\" Nana opens the double doors, leading Lauren outside. As she closes the double doors behind her... Lauren can't help but ask, \"what package?\" With some mixed feelings all a sudden... Nana says, \"oh, I don't know. I never liked opening government packages. In all my years, I've never seen anything good in them.\" She gets a little teary eyed. Lauren gets very quiet as Nana leads her to the stable. Soon after... Nana is showing Lauren the horses, the collection of old fashioned fur saddles, and the gallery of pinned up photos on the wooden wall above the saddles. Lauren smiles. Lauren says, \"oh, the horses are beautiful. These baby pictures are beautiful too.\" Nana smiles. She concludes, \"thank you. I thought you would.\" Lauren wonders, \"did he tell you I grew up on a farm in Georgia when I was a kid?\" Nana faintly chuckles. She tells, \"oh yes.\" Lauren chuckles kind of nervously. Then, Lauren wonders, \"is this FDR?\" She's looking at a picture of a toddler with his mouth open, a faint unibrow, and very dark brown hair. Nana answers, \"yes.\" Lauren grins. She comments, \"he's cute even with that unibrow.\" Nana adds, \"I know. He was so cute.\" Lauren then asks, \"and who are these people?\" She's briefly pointing to a family picture by a purple ribbon. It's of a certain laughing six year old kid wearing a dark green cap, a black T-shirt, black and white striped gloves, and gray pants. A grinning woman with long very dark red hair is hugging him, wearing a mostly tan gray long sleeved shirt and gray pants. A faintly grinning man with a light blue and dark blue striped T-shirt and gray pants is also in the picture. He has a arm around the woman. Behind them is a wooden lined screen fence and hints of a garden. Nana explains somberly, \"oh. Those are his parents. They died when he was 9.\" Lauren gets teary eyed. She concludes, \"I'm so sorry. He never told me that.\" Nana says, \"yeah. In a car crash. Or so the cover story was. Faint sniffle.\" Lauren asks, \"what happened?\" Nana finds it hard to look up. She's getting teary eyed. After a bit... Nana says, \"ten years later, the C.I.A. files were declassified.\" Lauren gulps kind of nervously. She questions, \"C.I.A?\" Nana reveals, \"his father was in the military. The C.I.A. gave him and several others a mission in Russia to stop corruption at the highest levels. They gave them that cover story. He agreed to go under the condition she came with him. But, umm... Faint sniffle. They didn't come back. No one did. Moderate sigh. I never forgave the government since. But, Franklin and Tuck still want to trust them.\" Lauren looks nervous and very awkward all at once. She says, \"I'm really sorry.\" But, kind of quick to try to lighten the mood... Lauren points to another picture. She wonders, \"who's this?\" Nana faintly smiles. Nana faintly chuckles. She comments, \"you don't miss a thing.\" Lauren faintly grins. Nana recalls, \"he wore that Superman costume everywhere. You wouldn't believe the smell.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. Meanwhile, through the kitchen window... The familiar C.I.A. spy drone is watching. FDR breathes a nervous sigh of relief, thinking he's by himself. He walks over to the other side of the kitchen counter. A large cardboard box is lying on its side on the wooden floor. It has a C.I.A. logo on it...and it's now starting ticking. FDR quickly tears it open, bent over the package. He tears it open...to find a analog timer attached to a spherical see through bomb. It's filled with red and blue paintballs. The countdown is already at 0:01. And... A little piece of paper taped to the bomb says \"from Tuck\". FDR mutters, \"shit!\" The bomb explodes in a burst of red and blue paint. He reactively covers his face with his arms. But...the rest of his upper body is covered in drippy red and blue paint. He mutters under his breath, \"shit, shit...shit! God, I need a extraction!\" He throws off his paint covered shirt and suit, letting them fall onto the paint stained spots on the floor. He runs up to the bathroom, locking it behind him. And meanwhile, in surveillance room 3A... Tuck is kind of doubled over, laughing. In the bathroom... FDR is desperately trying to wash out the paint from his hair and hands before it dries with soap and water. But, by then, it's already hardening. He gets teary eyed. And, as he keeps trying to wash out the paint from his hair and hands... He mutters out loud angrily, \"it was Savile Row's finest!\" Around then, out by the stable... Lauren wonders, \"you have a hard time trusting people?\" Nana solemnly remarks, \"doesn't everyone at different points?\" Lauren realizes, \"that's true. Sometimes I do.\" The teariness in their eyes start to dry up. With some mixed feelings... Nana reveals, \"you know... When Franklin heard of the car crash...he's never been quite the same. He worries himself sick. He blames himself because he feels he could've saved them, even after the truth came out. But, you didn't hear it from me.\" Lauren faintly chuckles at the last part. She assures, \"I won't tell, nana.\" Nana adds, \"good.\" They both faintly smile. Then... Lauren's cell phone rings from her jacket. She says, \"I'll be right back.\" She walks over to the opposite corner of the stable. She picks up her cell phone. Lauren answers, \"hello? FDR, what's...?\" She gets teary eyed. She faintly sniffles. Lauren voices, \"oh my god, I'm really sorry. Yeah, I... Please just calm down! I'll tell her for you. Okay? Hard sniffle. Really FDR, it's ok. I'm a woman. I understand these things. Okay? Okay.\" Lauren hangs up, putting the cell phone away. From behind her... Nana asks nervously, \"was that just...?\" Lauren turns back to her. She nervously gives FDR's explanation, \"yeah. The box was a paint bomb. Probably some kid thought it was a good prank. But...he has paint in his hair and hands, and his suit is ruined.\" Nana moderately sighs. She says, \"oh dear. He really loved that suit.\" Lauren figures, \"yeah. As soon as he's finished in the bathroom, I'm going to take him back to his apartment. I'm sorry to cut our visit short. But...\" Nana insists assuringly, \"no, I understand. I have a spare bathrobe if you...\" Lauren adds, \"yeah, that would be helpful. Thank you.\" Nana puts a comforting hand on her shoulder. Nana concludes, \"you're welcome. He's very lucky to have you.\" Lauren faintly smiles. She adds, \"thank you.\" She starts her way back to the house. Nana concludes bittersweetly, \"and next time, I'll check the box first.\" Lauren turns back, facing her from just outside the stable. Lauren adds, \"that would be a good idea. Thank you.\" She then fast walks back through the double doors to go find that spare bathrobe. Two days later, in FDR's and TBN's shared room... FDR is by himself, swimming underwater in the kind of big light blue tiled private pool. His bruises are gone. His hair is back to normal, and so are his hands. He faintly smiles with closed eyes. He's wearing light blue swimming trunks. After most of a minute... He swims up. He comes up for air. By his dark gray towels off by the edge of the private pool... His cell phone rings. FDR hurries over to his towels. Soon as he dries off... He scrolls through a wall of text messages from Lauren. They say: Are you okay? Please get back to me soon. I'm worried. Are you okay? Please get back to... The call goes missed. But... FDR already knows well who probably did. He calls Lauren. After a bit of ringing... Lauren answers kind of nervously, \"FDR.\" She's walking back to her and Trish's house, carrying her cell phone. She's wearing a dark brown dress with a low cut neckline. She doesn't have faint purplish red lipstick on her lips anymore. She also has her hair mostly tied back in a bun. It's late afternoon and she just got back from work. FDR responds, \"hey. I just saw your texts.\" Over the phone... Lauren says solemnly, \"hey. I've been really worried about you. But... Very faint chuckle. Well, I guess we both really worry.\" She pauses on some stone steps. She's at the red brown front door. FDR faintly chuckles. He reflects, \"yeah. Guess we do.\" There's a brief awkward silence. Lauren asks, \"how are you?\" FDR responds, \"better now. How are you?\" Lauren faintly smiles. With some mixed feelings... Lauren concludes, \"okay. I went on my date with Tuck yesterday. Faint chuckle. We raced spy cars on the test track. It was amazing. But...I missed you. We both do.\" Seeming completely unphased... FDR says, \"yeah. I missed you too.\" But... He thinks to himself: Yeah. This is not over, Tuck. Faint laugh. You're thinking I'm going to come crying to you in defeat like a little kid. Good try man. But, I'm still not backing off from our war. The next day, in the late afternoon... On FDR's next date... He holds up his C.I.A. badge and says it's \"a matter of international security\" to get some museum curators to let him and Lauren into a museum artifacts warehouse without question. Lauren nervously looks to him as they go in. But, FDR and Lauren soon just faintly chuckle and laugh. Lauren has her hair straightened and down. She's wearing a kind of dark red dress reminiscent of couch cushioning. She also has a curved bar gold bracelet on her right wrist. FDR is wearing very dark blue dress pants and a dark blue army like shirt. There's a lot of crates and packaging paper. Australian art posters are everywhere. Stunned... Lauren suddenly realizes, \"oh my... Is this what I think it is?\" FDR confidently goes, \"mm-hm. Gustav Klimt. I know he's your favorite artist. So...\" Lauren concludes excitedly, \"oh my god. This surprise is incredible! Thank you.\" She kisses him. She then hugs him tight around his side. FDR hugs her back. Her head is resting over his shoulder, admiring The Kiss painting before them. FDR smiles. He says, \"you're welcome.\" Back in the surveillance room... Tuck moderately sighs in his seat. With some keys at the computer... Tuck faxes in to the F.B.I. a fake criminal record for FDR. Soon as Lauren and FDR leave the warehouse arm in arm... They hear police sirens. Very nervously... Lauren wonders, \"FDR? Did we just get found out?\" FDR gets a ring on his cell phone. He picks up his phone to find a text message from Tuck: Did you just try to smuggle knock offs, man? Don't tell me I didn't warn you. ;) Then, some police cars pull up in the parking lot. As he looks up from his cell phone... FDR sees them. He mutters under his breath, \"son of a bitch.\" The next night... On Tuck's next date... He takes Lauren to his dad's loft all the way out in Texas: With help from a C.I.A. private jet on the grounds of \"a matter of national security\". His very rude brutish muscular military dad has gone out for drinks with his drinking buddies. Tuck and him only tolerate each other anyway. So, he was happy with letting Tuck crash there for the night...long as they don't meet each other in person or shoot up his place. The floor is half covered in brown animal skins and half metal. Walls are mostly pale green. Black and white photos memorabilia of are hung up over them: From veterans posing in front of a old missile base to rolling in tanks firing cannons in a World War II war field. A spare jagged edged mostly jet black motorcycle is in the corner. Cage like spheres encasing white lights are hung over the ceiling. Some black railing and matching stairs go up to the bedroom part, where there's a easy to see dark yellow sheeted bed right by some railing. A very dark blue desk and file cabinet is in another corner. A stack of military documentary and war movie DVDs on top of the desk and several big alcohol stains around. Some candles, a green glass bottle of wine, and some wine glasses are by the wood table and very dark yellow couch. They're both in the center of the main area. Lauren is wearing a silky black sleeved dress. Tuck is wearing a buttoned up tan brown overshirt and blue jeans. As they come in hand in hand... Tuck somewhat casually goes, \"yeah. This is his house.\" Looking stunned... Lauren concludes, \"wow. This is your shit dad's house. But, this is amazing.\" Tuck faintly smiles. He adds, \"yeah. Indeed.\" Lauren is looking around at all the memorabilia on the walls. Nervous and thrilled all at once... Lauren concludes, \"how really fantastic.\" Tuck pulls her in close. They make out some. Then... Tuck brings up, \"do you know why I knew you would? Lauren wonders, \"no. Why?\" With their arms still wrapped around each other... She starts to fast walk backs over toward the couch, nearly pulling Tuck off his feet by surprise. Tuck though quickly picks up on this, following her to the couch. Soon, they're faintly chuckling and laughing. Lauren is lying on the couch. Tuck is on top of her. Lauren kisses him. Then... Tuck states, \"because I thought it would be a nice reminder of your uncle. I could be wrong. But, before he passed on, I think he used to be stationed at a missile silo in World War II.\" Lauren gets wide eyed. She starts to sit up. Tuck reactively gets off, sitting by her. Lauren thinks out loud, \"oh my... Wow. I didn't even think of that. But...you're right. I didn't even tell you about him. You are disturbingly good at knowing what I'm thinking.\" Tuck faintly chuckles. He suggests, \"maybe that's because we've completely fallen in love.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She figures awkwardly, \"well...maybe. Sorry. I'm still trying to decide.\" Tuck puts a sympathetic hand on hers. Tuck insists, \"it's okay.\" Lauren smiles. She breathes a nervous sigh of relief. She adds, \"oh good.\" Tuck pulls his hand away. There's a brief nervous silence. Then... Lauren kind of playfully grins. Lauren challenges, \"okay. When I was young, my uncle wanted me to be in the military like him. Do you know what I thought?\" Tuck admits, \"actually... Faint laugh. No. Not really.\" Lauren reveals, \"I liked my uncle. But, I thought product testing would be more fun and still involve helping people.\" Tuck adds, \"that's incredible.\" Lauren blushes. She says, \"thank you. I love my job.\" Tuck says, \"you're welcome Lauren.\" Before she can say anything else... Tuck kind of points to the lit candles. He asks kind of nervously, \"do you think the candles are a bit cheesy?\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She puts a sympathetic hand on his. Lauren assures, \"no Tuck. I think they're wonderful. This is getting to be the perfect night.\" Lauren and Tuck smile. They start making out on the couch, pulling each other close. In surveillance room 3A... FDR is kind of lying back in his chair, ready with a toy like red button on a plastic cord filled with wires. He faintly laughs to himself as he presses it. In Tuck's dad's loft... The sprinkler system suddenly turns on. Cold sprinkler water rains down. The thin stemmed glasses of wine shatter. Tuck and Lauren kind of pull away, shivering and soaked. They look up. They gasp in great confusion. But, as they very awkwardly look at each other... They both realize, \"FDR.\" In surveillance room 3A... FDR moderately groans into his hands. The next day, in FDR's and Tuck's shared room... Out through the windows... The sun is setting. FDR leads Lauren in. FDR is wearing a very dark blue sweater over a pale pink collared shirt and blue jeans. Lauren is wearing a sleeveless dark red dress and black high heels. Lauren very faintly smiles, \"it's great, FDR. But...\" FDR wonders, \"yeah?\" With a warning glare... Lauren insists, \"but we still need to talk.\" They both sit on the black couch right by the kitchen area. Kind of lying... FDR tries to assure, \"I told you on the phone: It was just a prank.\" Lauren moderately sighs. She kind of nervously argues, \"well, it sure didn't feel like that. Not for him.\" FDR suddenly gets a little teary eyed, finding it hard to look up at her. FDR awkwardly says, \"I'm sorry. I could even pay him back for the damages with my own money.\" Kind of reluctant sounding... Lauren says, \"well...okay. But, you should talk to him soon.\" FDR concludes, \"okay.\" Lauren concludes, \"maybe we could still have a date. But...I want to think about it a little. Okay?\" She puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder at the last part. Still finding it hard to look up... FDR awkwardly answers, \"okay.\" Lauren adds, \"I'll be right back.\" She heads up some winding concrete stairs to the pool. Soon as she's out of sight... FDR sighs heavily into his hands. And, he mutters somberly to himself, \"what have I done?\" Just then... He hears the door slowly open. FDR ahems. He wipes the teariness from his eyes. He goes to answer the door, kind of shoving it all the way open. No one seems to be there. FDR pulls out his pistol. He cautiously looks ahead to the concrete bunker walled hall. Suddenly... He feels a sharp prick and sting on his neck. Tuck drops down from a part of ceiling ahead in a all black stealth suit, making a run for it. FDR quickly pulls out a tranquilzer dart. In very mixed feelings... He mutters under his breath, \"son of a...!\" FDR falls unconscious in seconds, still holding the pistol. By then... Lauren comes back down. She calls out in confusion, \"FDR?\" She then sees FDR on the floor. Lauren gasps, rushing to him. Lauren murmurs worriedly, \"oh my god. FDR?!\" She gets teary eyed. She checks his pulse. Lauren moderately sighs with some relief, knowing he's still alive. Then... She notices the tranquilizer dart that fell from FDR's other hand. Lauren quickly checks out the windows. She catches sight of Tuck driving away fast in his car, still in his stealth suit. She goes back to the tranquilizer dart. She carefully examines it herself by the kitchen sink, with some paper towels over the sharp end. Realizing what it is... She very nervously gulps. Soon, she sharply glares. And, as she puts down the tranquilizer dart and paper towels... Lauren realizes, \"Tuck.\" Late that night... FDR wakes up, still in the room. He groans, pulling himself up. He gets up...to find the whole complex torn apart. Smashed kitchen appliances, TV set screen glass shards, couch pillows, fallen seats, and two open laptops with cracked screens are on the floor. FDR mutters in shock, \"damn.\" Tuck is just coming back in...when he sees the complex. He's shocked, standing speechless. Fearing the worst... They both quickly check their cell phones. And, as they look at recent text messages on their phones... They very nervously gulp. Both text messages say this: I found out you're secretly at war over me. I got angry. I'm really sorry for breaking your things. :( But...we need to talk. 12:30 tomorrow, Trucco's Pizza. I want to try to make peace with both of you. But, I'll walk if I think I should. And...one more thing. Please don't come with a tranquilizer or try to make war. Or, Trish's friends in the F.B.I. are going to bring you both in for questioning. I really don't want that to happen. Just... Just please don't keep testing me like this.[Chapter 6] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Chapter 6: The next morning, in Trish's and Lauren's house... Trish is sitting on a wide dark green couch: With a bunch of stuffed animal toys and a hand sized stuffed Noah's Ark across it. The couch is in the back of the living room, with double window screen double doors off to the left. The dining room is just past a little hall in the right corner. Lauren is standing very nervously by the couch, breathing heavily. She's also teary eyed. Trish is wearing Cheetos stained blue jeans and a white lace dress with matching straps over her shoulders. She's also wearing pineapple slices like very pale gray earrings. Lauren has her hair mostly tied back in a bun. She's wearing a black sleeveless top and worn out blue jeans. She keeps murmuring under her breath, \"I feel like I'm going crazy. But, I'm not waking up.\" Not taking it anymore... Trish calls out, \"oh my god: I know! Just... Heavy sigh. Just breathe in and out. And, come sit down. Please. You're getting me worried, Lauren.\" She's a little teary eyed herself. Lauren nervously sighs as she finally sits down. She faintly smiles: Faintly physically relieved at finally sitting down. After a bit... Lauren turns to her. She somberly wonders, \"what do I do, Trish?! I loved dates with these guys. Then... Hard sniffle! I find out they were secretly at war over me.\" Trish very faintly smiles. She tries to be assuring, \"you know, some girls would think of it as the greatest form of flattery. Maybe you could just pick and...\" Lauren mutters back, \"well, not everyone wants to go to a strip club. It's not that easy with these guys!\" Some silent tears fall from her face. She sniffles hard. Trish puts her comforting hands on hers. She supposes, \"I know it isn't. But... What if it soon gets to be?\" Looking very nervous and confused all at once... Lauren says, \"what?\" Trish very faintly chuckles. She figures, \"I already called my friends in the F.B.I. like you told me. They'll be there to protect you. Even if both of those guys try something, I'm sure the worst is over.\" Lauren wipes some teariness from her eyes. She very faintly smiles. She concludes, \"okay. Maybe that's true. But...I'm still worried.\" Trish comments, \"that's okay. I know you do. But...why don't we get into decision-making mode?\" Lauren brings up nervously, \"you mean for choosing a guy? You sure?\" Trish points out, \"I know you're not sure now if you should. But...what if you walk in and find out they're still both good guys? Then what? You're going to not stay out there and get flexible? I want you to be happy.\" Lauren realizes kind of awkwardly, \"wow. You're right. Faint chuckle. Maybe it'll be helpful too: For what ever happens at Trucco's Pizza.\" Trish more lightly says, \"that's the spirit. So...who are you choosing?\" After a bit of thinking it over though... Lauren suddenly seems nervous all over again. Trish's four year old son Linus comes over to Trish. He has medium dark brown hair. He's wearing a mostly light blue T-shirt with a AT-ST on it and carrying a kind of torn up baseball mitt. Trish faintly smiles. She says, \"hey, buddy.\" Linus asks, \"mom, can you fix this?\" Trish pats him lightly on the head. She mostly assures, \"in a few minutes. You can get the chocolate bar in your room.\" Linus smiles. He says, \"all right mom.\" He leaves them be, excitedly running up to his room. Lauren very faintly smiles, watching him go. Trish puts down the baseball mitt to the side as he heads up. Then... Lauren wonders, \"do you think it's possible to love two people equally?\" Trish tilts her head to the side a little as she faces her. She figures, \"love? Yes. Be in love with two people and they love you back? Moderate sigh. Sorry. I'd like it to be that easy for women everywhere. But... Spy or no spy, that's never a easy coupling.\" Lauren faintly nods. She sighs nervously though. Trish adds, \"I know what I think you should do to choose.\" Lauren openly concludes, \"all right. Go ahead.\" Trish faintly smiles. She adds, \"you're welcome.\" Lauren very faintly chuckles. Then... Trish reflects, \"I'd think: Don't choose the better guy. Choose the guy that'll make you go on as the better couple. Very faint chuckle. I mean, I know Bob was fat and ridiculous. But, he was my fat and my ridiculous. And, I liked the way that I was with him: Spying, tartar sauce, balls, and the birds and bees. Just please promise me something.\" Lauren faintly smiles. Sounding a little better... Lauren kind of nervously asks, \"okay. What?\" Trish gets teary eyed again. She puts a sympathetic hand on hers. Trish more solemnly says, \"who ever you choose...please make sure he's not gonna die on the job. I don't want you to go through that.\" Very nervously... Lauren murmurs, \"oh my god Trish. Heavy sigh. Hard sniffle. I know you mean well. But, that's not helpful now.\" Trish awkwardly apologizes, \"I'm sorry.\" Lauren insists, \"it's okay.\" Then... Lauren concludes, \"I mean... I hope so, Trish.\" Trish adds, \"so do I.\" Trish gets up, going up the stairs with the baseball mitt. They both very faintly smile to each other as she goes up. As 12:30 P.M. draws near... FDR and Tuck are wearing black suits and matching silvery spy watches. Tuck is wearing a dark blue collared shirt. FDR is wearing a light blue collared shirt. The sun kind of glares in their eyes as they walk down a corner of sidewalk. Tuck sighs heavily. He wonders offhandedly, \"should you explain first, or...?\" FDR very faintly laughs. He comments kind of nervously, \"you tranquilized me just before I was about to call you and call it off. You tell me.\" Tuck just shakes his head annoyedly and keeps walking. Kind of annoyedly... FDR asks lowly, \"what?!\" Tuck adds kind of coldly, \"forget it, Franklin.\" Soon, they both come up to a glass door. Some government agents wearing black are sitting on a bench across the street, pretending to read books with white THs on the black covers. Through the glass door, there's a neon sign with Trucco's Pizza in red over a white blocky wall. FDR and Tuck nervously walk through the door. Tuck goes first. A cobblestone fireplace is in back. The counter and cashier are silvery, reminiscent of a popcorn popper. The semi-casual lounge like area has black chairs around black and white swirled tablecloths on tables. Most of them are vacant with most people having just finished lunch. But, some government agents without black sunglasses are all sharing a table: Eating a large pizza together to try to not arouse suspicion. And, sitting in a reserved table for three by herself...is Lauren. She's wearing her black sunglasses and has her hair down. She brought her handbag with her. She seems to be kind of sweaty from just how nervous she is. But, she keeps sitting up: Not looking away much at all from a certain direction. FDR nervously gulps. Tuck start to says, \"um...hello. Could we...?\" Lauren is quick to say, \"yes. Please.\" FDR and Tuck nervously sit down in the two chairs. Then... Lauren checks worriedly, \"you sure you are not going to try to kill each other?\" Trying to sound casual... FDR says, \"it's a crying shame you don't trust us. But... Heavy sigh. I guess we deserve it.\" Lauren somberly mutters, \"you sure do.\" There's a very nervous silence between the three of them. After a few long minutes though... Lauren sighs in some relief. She takes off her sunglasses, revealing her teary eyes under them. Almost at the same time... FDR and Tuck ask, \"are you okay?\" Lauren very faintly chuckles. She comments, \"good grief. We came to talk about your war over me, and that's all you can say to me?\" FDR and Tuck nervously tap their fingers on the table, looking down. After a bit... Lauren says, \"okay. I got a notepad and pen. It might help.\" As she gets out her notepad though... FDR suddenly gets up. Some F.B.I. agents from the other table kind of frantically try to clean up their hands with hand sanitizer. But... FDR calls back, \"it's okay, men. I'm not trying to get a gun or something.\" He puts his hands out as he says it. Looking fairly confused... Lauren asks, \"FDR? What are you...?\" FDR heavily sighs. He gets teary eyed. He says, \"it's all my fault. Faint sniffle. Tuck and I agreed that if I let dating compromise me, he'd take me out. I should go hand in my resignation.\" Lauren stares at him, wide eyed and shocked. Tuck starts to argue, \"FDR? What are you...?!\" FDR somberly concludes, \"I'm really sorry. I should have never gotten into the picture. Faint sniffle. Good luck, Tuck. She deserves you more than I ever could.\" He leaves his pistol on its side on the table. He starts to walk away, fighting the urge to cry. Lauren starts to say, \"Tuck? Is this...?\" Tuck gets teary eyed. Just then... He says kind of loudly, \"no. It's both our faults.\" Just then, in a jet black van... Karl Heinrich is driving down the street. In his rearview mirror... He sees Trucco's Pizza...and FDR starting to walk away. Karl Heinrich smirks to himself. Over a mostly gray Chinese walkie talkie... He says, \"we got them now. You know the plan.\" He drives around the back of Trucco's Pizza...while fourteen more jet black vans are parking around the place. Back with Lauren... FDR pauses. He sighs heavily. He reluctantly turns back to Tuck and Lauren. And, he mutters, \"shit. I was just trying to...\" Lauren finishes the thought, \"...protect Tuck.\" FDR sits back down. He admits very nervously, \"yeah. But...I hit the safety button with a dart. That means I started the whole thing. Faint sniffle. I took reconning me with you too seriously.\" Lauren sighs heavily into her hand. After a bit... She realizes, \"okay. Okay. Now it's all getting to be kind of rational to me.\" She puts away the notepad. Turning to Tuck... Lauren brings up, \"you sent a paintball surprise of your own to FDR, didn't you?\" Tuck faintly nods. He says, \"yeah. Yeah, I did.\" There's a nervous silence. Suddenly... Lauren wonders nervously, \"you know why I still called you?\" Tuck and FDR both say no. Lauren somberly admits, \"well... When I first found out what Bob does for a living... Heavy sigh. It was my senior year in high school. I started worrying more: About a lot. I started constantly calling Steve, constantly stalking him. And then, a few weeks later...he left me. Hard sniffle! Through high school, I already left my friends and family behind to spend all my time with him. Trish was a new friend. But, she... She's the only one who didn't leave me. Hard sniffle! I never thought I'd meet another guy to really love. But, now...where are we? Two otherwise amazing guys walk into my life, and I was about to leave you. I'd hate myself if I didn't at least try to make peace with you.\" Almost at the same time... FDR and Tuck say, \"oh god.\" They're both shaken, teary eyed. Some silent tears fall on the table. The teariness in Lauren's eyes start to dry. Lauren kind of assures, \"that's okay. I think I'm mostly over him now...now that I really know why he left me: Now that I know better than to make a really big mistake by walking away from you.\" FDR very faintly smiles. He kind of casually points out, \"well...we aren't at war now.\" Tuck very faintly smiles. He adds kind of casually, \"yeah. We're really not.\" Lauren puts sympathetic hands on both of theirs. Lauren very faintly smiles. And, she says, \"and I'm glad.\" There's a calm silence. After a bit... Lauren wonders more casually, \"so...do you guys want to know my decision?\" FDR says, \"yeah. Whoever you pick, I can take it like a gentleman.\" Tuck asks, \"are you kidding? Trick question. We really do.\" Lauren faintly grins. She starts to tell, \"well...\" Then, suddenly... Shots are fired. Tuck calls out, \"get down!\" At the same time, Tuck kicks the table down on its side. Glass windows, the glass door, Lauren's sunglasses... They shatter from the bullets. Some people run frantically for the back door. Bullets make holes through the fallen table. But, none of them hit Tuck. Tuck, Lauren, and FDR duck behind it. Tuck and FDR get out their pistols. Ten guys with sleek gray jackets fire their assault rifles at the F.B.I. agents. Most of the F.B.I. agents left and right fire their pistols at them. Two on both sides fall dead. Three guys with sleek gray jackets are about to fire more bullets from their assault rifles. But, just as quickly... FDR and Tuck fire pistols. All three of Heinrich's men bend down, clutching their dark red liquid dripping legs and dropping their rifles. FDR checks, \"are you okay, Lauren?\" Kind of loudly over the bullets... Lauren concludes lightly, \"yeah. I got two incredible spies to protect me from harm.\" FDR and Tuck faintly smile back to her. Then... Their smiles fade. Caught off guard in the moment... They're both punched down violently by some of Heinrich's men. Lauren cries out, \"no! ! !\" She gets teary eyed. She rushes over to look for a fork, a knife... Anything to stab with. FDR and Tuck groan violently on their sides, struggling to get up. FDR violently punches away two of Heinrich's men. One of them crashes into the crashing down neon sign. He falls unconscious, with heavy bruises and burns on his head. Tuck violently kicks up one of Heinrich's men into another. They both crash into the counter. They both fall unconscious, with heavy bruises all over. Twenty more men with sleek gray jackets walk in...firing assault rifles at the F.B.I. agents, Tuck, and FDR. Frustratedly... FDR calls out, \"shit! Where are all these guys coming from?!\" Tuck calls back, \"I'm not going out and asking them! You want to?!\" FDR and Tuck duck tumble behind the counter...seconds before more bullets make little holes in it. The F.B.I. agents are all groaning violently on their sides. Some of them fall dead in seconds. A little out of breath... Tuck suddenly asks, \"Franklin?\" A little out of breath... FDR says, \"yeah Tuck?\" Tuck realizes, \"where's Lauren?\" FDR and Tuck look at each other very nervously. Around then... In the back of the building... Lauren screams, \"let go of me!\" She's being dragged away by three of Heinrich's men. Karl Heinrich and another of his men open up the back of his van. Karl coldly figures, \"that's where you're wrong. I don't want you: I want FDR and Tuck.\" Even as Heinrich's men put Lauren down in the back... Lauren very faintly chuckles. Karl asks, \"something funny about this to you?\" He gets back into the van, taking the wheel. Lauren confidently says, \"I don't know you. But, I know they're going to save me. I believe in them.\" Karl faintly laughs. He mutters bitterly, \"they can try.\" Soon, most of Heinrich's men are falling back: Getting back into the vans to follow his van for the highways. Not long after... Soon as they see a clear path to the backdoor... FDR and Tuck run out the back. But, by then... All that's left there is Lauren's tossed aside handbag. They run back inside. But...they quickly realize Heinrich's men are gone. FDR clenches his fists. He mutters under his breath, \"damn!\" Tuck puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. He says, \"it's okay man. It's okay: I...\" Then... Both their cell phones ring. They quickly pick up. Almost at the same time... They both say, \"hi?\" On the other end... Karl says, \"FDR, Tuck. Hello.\" FDR and Tuck both realize, \"Heinrich.\" Karl concludes, \"yes. I was busy taking over the Asian underground. Some turned up moles, some dirtied tailored suits... The spy world can be murder. But, I'm still angry for you killing my brother Jonas. He was more than my brother: He was my best friend. Faint laugh. I'll kill Lauren. Girlfriend, sister... It does not matter. She'll fall on a speeding car...just like my brother. I'll kill everyone else you care about and then take back that invisible missile! Then you'll know how it feels to have no best friends in the world. That's how I want you.\" He then hangs up. After a bit... FDR turns back to Tuck, \"so...what were you just about to tell me?\" Tuck faintly smiles. He raises his arm with his spy watch. The center light up red arrow on the watch's face is already mostly pointing northeast.[Chapter 7] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Chapter 7: Tuck explains, \"it's okay man: I bugged her earrings with a sat tracker. After asking, of course.\" FDR faintly smiles. He faintly laughs. FDR adds, \"no way. I also bugged her.\" Seeming kind of amused... Tuck asks, \"really?\" Then... FDR realizes he has subconsciously moved his hand very near a awkward place by tuck's side. FDR goes ahem. He pulls his hand away. To FDR's chagrin, Tuck just faintly laughs. Then... Trish comes in, carrying Lauren's recently dusted off handbag. She questions nervously, \"where's Lauren?\" Tuck kind of nervously explains, \"Karl Heinrich kidnapped her to try to kill her. But, we got sat trackers on her.\" Without hesitance... FDR adds, \"yeah.\" Completely unphased... Trish starts to suggest, \"yeah, sure. I have my car in back if you...\" Trish kind of points to the back. FDR is quick to add, \"all right. Let's go.\" FDR, Tuck, and Trish fast walk through the back door. Trish thinks to herself: Slight sigh. Shit. It's time I call the F.B.I. for a better wire for Lauren to reach me. Only not in sunglasses. Police sirens are heard as police cars are driving up outside. Out back... Trish gets into the driver's seat of her tan buggy. The pale red roof is retracted in the back. Tuck's nose cringes. FDR waves a hand over his nose. FDR comments, \"god, that smells. Did Heinrich toss a gas grenade?\" They both start to get into the car. Tuck is about to get into the co-pilot seat. A little awkwardly... Trish says, \"I'm sorry. That's me.\" He and FDR suddenly both get into the back of the car, buckling up. Tuck concludes, \"wow. What did you drink?\" Trish buckles up and starts the car. Trish admits, \"um...I shower once a week and on special occasions. I really like my man stink.\" She faintly smiles on the last part. Almost at the same time... FDR and Tuck goes, \"oh god.\" They look like they're about to hurl. Trish starts driving, speed turning past some cars going another way. Trish mostly assures, \"it's okay. I know that turns away most people.\" FDR comments offhandedly, \"yeah, no kidding.\" Soon... In the back of Trish's car... FDR recalls, \"yeah. I bugged her while we were making out.\" Tuck turns to him in near disbelief. He says, \"wait. You mean with tongue?\" FDR faintly smiles. He figures casually, \"hey. We were in a F.B.I. cell before my \"criminal past\" came up fake. I assured her it would. We got bored.\" Tuck faintly laughs, kind of shaking his head. He lightly remarks, \"god. You're a animal.\" FDR faintly laughs. Trish is driving her car down several blocks. Some cars honk noisily as she speeds past them. A sloping up ramp for the highways is getting closer. Tuck asks, \"did you at least give her that one that...?\" FDR casually reasons, \"the one that comes out the other end? Yeah. Of course I did.\" Tuck calmly adds, \"okay, good.\" FDR concludes, \"actually, she seemed to also really like it. Faint awkward laugh. We kept making out on the way back. Even I was exhausted when we got out of the police car.\" Looking stunned... Tuck figures, \"wow. You know, she kept trying to feel me up when I bugged her earrings.\" FDR faintly laughs. Suddenly... Trish suddenly shouts enthusiastically, \"yes! You found her secret fetish!\" Her arms are out high and off the wheel. Tuck nervously calls out, \"Trish!\" FDR nervously looks ahead. He has a hand on the side car door, ready to tumble out. Several cars honk noisily behind Trish's car. The car starts to grind against the side of the ramp. It's about to crash. Just then... Trish quickly puts her hands back on the wheel. She drives hard right, barely avoiding the side of the ramp. Trish nervously breathes in and out. She blushes. Embarrassed... Trish says, \"sorry. I'm just so proud of her...and you guys.\" FDR and Tuck faintly smile at the thought. Trish turns back for a second, faintly smiling back. Trish though keeps driving hard right, coming up to the highways. They're over a bent pipe shaped concrete bridge, along with rows of cars. FDR comments, \"you should've let her, man.\" Tuck adds, \"if Lauren decides to stay with me...maybe I will.\" FDR just firmly nods, still faintly smiling. Trish checks, \"where do we go now?\" Tuck and FDR check the turning light red arrows on their spy watches. Tuck is quick to answer, \"just keep going up to the exit to Pres Choice 9.\" Trish acknowledges, \"okay.\" After coming back down from the bridge... Trish drives her car past a fancy office building's outside pool. On the nearest highway past the pool... Fifteen black vans are opening their side windows. They fire some of their assault rifles at several passing cars. Bullet holes cover the back of the cars. Drivers scream...as flaming pieces of their cars's gas tanks explode off into the air. A massive pile up is forming. Several cars crash into each other, knocked off their wheels. The black vans speed past no problem. FDR and Tuck are quick to catch the exploding pieces of gas tanks in the air. FDR mutters, \"shit!\" Trish nervously breathes in and out some. But, she keeps driving for the next exit. She makes some hard turns past the pileup and flaming car parts. FDR can't help but ask, \"have you done this before?\" Trish faintly chuckles. She recalls, \"I've done this with Bob. I got ways with spies.\" FDR and Tuck faintly laugh. They start catching up to the black vans. But then... Two of them open up in the back. From the same two vans... Some of Heinrich's men fire assault rifles. Looking very nervous now... Trish calls out, \"shit!\" She left hard turns the car away from the incoming storm of bullets. The back tires are hit. Some residing flames run down the back. FDR and Tuck jump for it. Trish jump slides out over the car door. The car flips over some...before crashing into the side of the highway. FDR and Tuck tumble kind of easily to their feet. Trish groans violently some, clutching her legs. FDR and Tuck start to rush over to her. But... Trish insists, \"it's okay. Violent groan. I'll get the F.B.I to get me: Go!\" She's already pulling out her cell phone. FDR and Tuck pause. They get teary eyed, looking torn. But, with some nervous gulps... They run for a salvageable red jeep. FDR very faintly smiles Trish's way. Tuck gets into the driver's seat. FDR gets into the co-pilot seat. Tuck is speed driving the jeep, continuing up the highway. Not long after... Tuck's commandeered jeep is catching up to the black vans. Police and ambulance sirens are going off a ways back down the highway. FDR fires the last bullets from his pistol...right at Heinrich's men in the two open backs of the vans. They fall dead. FDR jumps over to one of the open backs of the vans. He takes some of their mags to reload his pistol. Then, with a carefully aimed shot... He shoots the driver. He falls dead. Some dark red liquid hits the windshield. Soon, with another lift from Tuck... FDR makes it to the driver's seat. FDR helps him in to the co-pilot seat. They let the jeep speed crash into another van up ahead. Several of the black vans crash into each other in a pile up. Thinking they're double crossing each other... Most of Heinrich's men from Japan and China come storming out of most all of the vans, pulling out their assault rifles. They're firing at each other, forgetting all about Karl Heinrich. Soon, FDR is driving the commandeered van up to Karl's: The only one left. The red arrows on his and Tuck's spy watches point right to it. In his rearview mirror... Karl Heinrich sees them. He gets a assault rifle out, rolling down his side window. His man in the co-pilot seat takes the wheel. In the commandeered van... Tuck tells, \"I'm going to do a reverse Harrison.\" FDR asks nervously, \"what? Are you crazy? You could get killed trying!\" Tuck moderately sighs. He insists determinedly, \"just...just trust me.\" FDR doesn't argue. He just firmly nods. FDR opens Tuck's side window. Tuck gets out one of the assault rifles. FDR drives the commandeered van up to the side facing Karl's co-driver. He slams it hard into the van...knocking the several men in the back off their feet. They groan violently some, clutching their heads. Their assault rifles go flying. Lauren faintly smiles knowingly. She starts to get up. Both vans are coming up on a stretch of the 310 Freeway. Orange construction cones and equipment are everywhere. But, past that stretch of freeway...is Karl Heinrich's planned stop all along for Lauren: A gap in the high up freeway yet to be constructed, looking over a busy highway. Tuck smash hurls the assault rifle through the side window...knocking out Karl's co-driver. Glass shatters. Tuck calls out, \"hey, Heinrich! Miss me?\" Karl Heinrich glares angrily. He takes the wheel with one hand. He steer slams the van hard into FDR's commandeered van. FDR struggles to steer it clear of some construction equipment. But...the commandeered van speed crashes into a crane arm. Glass shatters across the van instantly. FDR and Tuck jump tumble out through the side doors. The impact alone rattles the gas tank loose...exploding in flames behind them. As FDR and Tuck struggle to their feet... Karl Heinrich gets ready to fire the assault rifle. He viciously smirks. He comments, \"not what I planned. But...I'm flexible.\" Then though, from behind... Lauren remarks, \"you should've got your money back. This rifle has a defect.\" In another second... She fires away the exploding off assault rifle. She grabbed one of the other men's assault rifles to fire into Heinrich's assault rifle in mid-fire. The assault rifle explodes into the windshield. The explosion shines brightly. Glass rains down in flaming shards. Karl Heinrich groans, reactively covering his eyes. The van is speeding out of control. And, without looking back... Lauren opens the back of the van. She runs out, running to catch up to FDR and Tuck. They're all kind of out of breath. But, they're all faintly smiling. Tuck starts to ask, \"wait. Did you just take care of...?\" FDR faintly laughs. He goes, \"wow. You're incredible.\" Lauren blushes a little. She adds somewhat nervously, \"thank you.\" Just then... They hear a explosion. The van crashes into some construction equipment. And, in the explosion... It's tumbling down the freeway...right in their direction. Lauren gasps. She's about to try to run under it in time. But, just as she's about to... Reality kicks in: Realizing she's not really as athletic as a spy. Teary eyed... She mutters under her breath, \"shit!\" She's standing kind of frozen in fear in the middle of the freeway: Not sure of what to do now in time to not get crushed by the tumbling van. Suddenly... She hears FDR and Tuck both calling out to her. They've taken sides of the wide section of freeway. They're both motioning to her with their hands. In several seconds... The van tumbles off the gap of freeway...falling into the highway below. Hints of dark red liquid splatter cover the hood of the van. Everyone inside dies from the impact alone...as several cars crash into the smoking wreckage in a massive pileup. Meanwhile, back up on the 310 Freeway... Lauren closes her eyes...reaching out to both of them. Not stopping to ask right now... FDR and Tuck both take her by the hand. They tumble together off the gap of freeway...before FDR and Tuck pull on their very flat emergency parachutes built into their suits. Two black emergency parachutes come out with big dark green C.I.A. logos, slowing their descent. They all breathe a heavy sigh of relief...as their feet touch down on a rectangular based walled edge of highway. They hug each other. They just stay like that for several long minutes, faintly chuckling and laughing in relief. Soon... They're all sitting down next to each other. FDR and Tuck are looking out to the police cars and ambulances. Lauren is trying hard not to, looking down nervously. Tuck checks something on his cell phone. He then faintly smiles. FDR checks, \"are you okay?\" Lauren looks up. More cheerfully... She says, \"yeah. I am now. How is Trish?\" Tuck mostly assures, \"her car was shot by Heinrich's men. The F.B.I. is making sure she gets good care in the hospital. But, she doesn't need surgery. I just texted her to be sure. She's going to be all right, Lauren.\" Lauren sighs in relief. She says, \"oh, that's good. Thank you.\" Tuck firmly nods. He adds, \"you're welcome.\" There's a awkward silence. Then... FDR highlights, \"sure. That's good. And, even though we all just barely lived through taking down Heinrich... Were you just about to tell us your decision? There might not be a better time than now.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She faintly smiles. She concludes, \"yes.\" FDR kind of annoyedly rolls his eyes. But, he faintly smiles. He starts to say, \"so...?\" Very nervously... Lauren voices, \"well... Moderate sigh. I know this is weird. I don't know if it's possible for this not to turn out to be \"oh my god, I'm Yoko\". But... Faint chuckle. You're both incredible in your own ways. And...I don't want to have to choose. But, if you still feel I should... Faint sniffle. Please just tell me: Because I'll be okay with you choosing for me...because I love you equally.\" FDR and Tuck look stunned. Lauren blushes. After a bit... FDR starts to say nervously, \"umm...\" Lauren suddenly gets a little teary eyed. She puts a sympathetic hand on his. And, she says, \"FDR... Moderate sigh. I know what you might be thinking. You're so caring and incredibly protective. But, before you do something you might regret...please listen to me.\" FDR just says, \"okay.\" Lauren adds solemnly, \"thank you.\" Lauren brings up, \"I know you care a lot for your nana. I know you care for me. But... Faint sniffle. I understand if that would be too much for you. I mean... Faint sniffle. Can you really imagine your nana accepting me that way? Can you imagine your family accepting me that way? As polyamorous? I don't think I can.\" FDR gets a little teary eyed. After a bit... FDR solemnly says, \"Lauren...I really appreciate what you're saying. I do. But... Faint laugh.\" Looking confused... Lauren asks, \"what?\" FDR explains, \"she doesn't know we're spies. This wouldn't be much different. I'm not sure if I can speak for Tuck. But, at least...I don't think it would be much different.\" The teariness in FDR's and Lauren's eyes start drying up. They very faintly smile. Tuck faintly laughs. Tuck concludes, \"yeah. It would be kind of weird. But... Faint laugh. ...so is the idea of being together with FDR.\" Lauren can't help but laugh, kind of doubling over. Kind of sarcastic... FDR shoots back, \"yeah man. \"Thank you\".\" Tuck faintly smiles. He just adds, \"anytime, pal.\" Just then noticing FDR's glare... Lauren moderately sighs. She kind of annoyedly rolls her eyes. Lauren remarks cuttingly, \"good grief. Am I going to have to keep moderating you two?\" Kind of making a face... FDR goes, \"ouch.\" Tuck adds, \"she's got a point, man.\" They all faintly laugh and chuckle over that. After a bit... FDR figures kind of casually, \"yeah. So...here's another: What about our apartment?\" Lauren scoots over, sitting between FDR and Tuck. She casually insists, \"oh, that? Please don't worry about it. I'll have the F.B.I. pay for it. Moderate sigh. That was my fault anyway.\" She puts sympathetic hands on both of theirs. Kind of jokingly... FDR wonders, \"are we going to have to keep moderating you?\" Lauren playfully punches him. Tuck faintly laughs. Lauren kind of warningly glares. She concludes, \"I just stopped Heinrich from shooting you. Don't moderate me, or I'll really start testing you two.\" There's a brief awkward silence. But... Lauren starts feeling up both their arms. She faintly smiles. She assures them, \"I'm kidding.\" They all faintly chuckle and laugh. They just sit there for who knows how long...looking out to the mostly clear sky. A few days later... FDR and Tuck are kind of nervously standing in Collins's office. They're back to wearing the same collared shirts and suits as a few days ago. Collins says, \"that was a interesting report, FDR.\" FDR uncertainly says, \"um...thank you boss.\" Collins solemnly concludes, \"no: Thank you. You stopped Heinrich and others in the C.I.A's most wanted in Asia while we were busy looking for them. You stopped them before they could do serious harm to national security. We're even considering opening a sister spy academy in Japan. The F.B.I. and the C.I.A. wanted to thank you.\" FDR and Tuck faintly smile. Almost at the same time... FDR and Tuck add, \"thank you.\" Collins adds, \"you're welcome.\" She then faintly smirks. She comments, \"it figures it would take a woman to really get you two out of the office.\" FDR and Tuck both faintly laugh nervously. They both start thinking to themselves: Oh my... Does she really know what happened two days ago? Better not to know. No, we shouldn't. There's a brief awkward silence. Dropping the matter... Collins figures, \"still... If there's anything we or the F.B.I. can do for you, please let us know. You deserve it, boys.\" There's a brief awkward silence. Tuck says, \"thank you. But...I think we're good.\" They start to leave. But... FDR pauses, faintly smiling. He considers, \"actually boss...there is one thing.\" Several weeks later, by Trish's and Lauren's house... The sun is setting. Construction vehicles with highly paid construction workers are around the house, digging deep under it. The cover for the digging operation was some rusted pipelines had to be replaced. The new basement is mostly done. It's still mostly dirt walls. But, metal planks are holding it up. Technical guys are also down there, building some surveillance control consoles from the ground up. Layout for a indoor pool is also down here: Marked with wood planks and some light blue floor tiles. Inside the house... FDR's and Tuck's TV set, video games, and video game consoles are in front of the couch in the living room. Their boombox is by the kitchen counter on a wood nighttable. Up in Lauren's room with very light blue walls... There's a kind of recently gotten king sized bed, with mini-Camaros decorated on the dark blue sheets. FDR and Tuck's laptops and spy watches are on two wood nighttables by the white closet doors. FDR is downstairs, wiring the very dark white Xbox to the TV set. He faintly smiles. Linus is rushing downstairs, looking excited. Out in the front of the house... Tuck is standing in the open doorway, wearing black jeans and a red, blue, and white checkered collared buttoned overshirt. Lauren is wearing a tan brown top with a loose cut down her exposed left shoulder, a brown leather bracelet with a gold buckle around her left wrist, and black jeans. Her hair is slightly curly. She's standing in front of Tuck, her arms wrapped around his sides. Tuck faintly smiles. A dark blue lined tan buggy styled car is pulled up, with Trish in the co-pilot seat. The retractable roof is down. Trish is wearing a grayish blue jeans like buttoned jacket and a light red strapped sleeveless dress under it. Lauren adds, \"I love you.\" Tuck says, \"I love you too. You two have a good time.\" Lauren grins. She says, \"we will.\" They pull each other close. They make out some, with some low groans of pleasure. Then... Tuck and Lauren pull away. Lauren waves goodbye to him as she walks to the car. She gets into the driver's seat, buckling up. Trish is already buckled. Trish calls back, \"and don't let Linus play Ghost Recon! He's not really a guy now: He's four.\" Kind of annoyedly... Tuck says, \"yeah. All right, Trish.\" Trish waves, faintly smiling. Tuck waves goodbye to both of them. He closes the door behind him as he goes back into the house. Lauren starts driving the car down the street. They're heading for the highways, coming around for the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. As they're driving... Trish smiles. She reflects, \"all right. I'm liking these nights out: Living vicariously through your guys and not having to think about Linus every second.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She adds, \"I just knew you would admit it one of these days.\" Trish concludes, \"okay. I know it's more my speed. But...it's more my speed. You sure you're not going to regret getting engaged to FDR?\" Lauren grins. She briefly holds up her sparkly silvery Superman logo like engagement ring on her left hand. Lauren reflects, \"being with FDR and Tuck... Faint chuckle. It's like a wet dream I'm never waking up from. I never felt so thrilled and loved.\" Trish faintly chuckles. She says, \"well, I'm impressed and proud of you.\" Lauren blushes a little. She adds, \"ohh. Thank you.\" Trish faintly smiles. She remarks, \"I'll even buy you more boxes of wet wipes to blot the dripping.\" Lauren chuckles hard, almost having to pull over to catch her breath. But, on their girl's night out...they keep driving no problem over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. A few days later... A double propeller C.I.A. issue helicopter is flying over the oceans on a very cloudy day. In the metallic back of the helicopter... FDR and Tuck are in all black stealth clothes, getting their parachutes on. And, standing near them is Lauren: In all black stealth clothes. Her hair is mostly tied back in a bun. Lauren wonders, \"you sure I shouldn't test the vector chutes?\" Kind of annoyedly... FDR comments lowly, \"oh god! You've said that a hundred times.\" Lauren faintly chuckles nervously. She says, \"sorry. I just worry about you two.\" Tuck concludes, \"and we'd never try to change that.\" FDR figures, \"yeah. We wouldn't try to change you.\" Lauren smiles. She says, \"ohh. Thank you. You're both so sweet.\" FDR and Tuck smile back. Then... The kind of long metal ramp starts to open. Rushing in air gusts come and go. With a arm around her side... FDR kisses Lauren just before walking to the end of the ramp. Tuck kisses Lauren just before walking to the end of the ramp. They both high jump off for the ocean, holding each other close. They briefly kiss...before activating their parachutes. Two black parachutes come out, making the descent down into the ocean nice and easy. A night later, in Trish's and Lauren's house... FDR is sitting on the couch by himself. He's wearing a black T-shirt and blue jeans. A retro techno disco instrumental is playing over the TV. Then... He hears footsteps. He turns around. Just then... He gets hit with a gust of water. FDR gets up, spitting out some water. His shirt is dripping wet. To his surprise... He sees Lauren down in her white laced lingerie and bra. She has her hair straightened and down. She's also holding a dark green water nozzle shaped toy water gun. Lauren faintly chuckles. She's playfully grinning. FDR's glare quickly turns to a amused faint smile when he fully sees her. He says, \"hey Lauren. What's going...?\" Lauren supposes suggestively, \"I got to bring some toy guns from Smart Consumer Grounds home to test out...kind of off the books. Do you know what I mean?\" FDR laughs, kind of doubling over. He then catches his breath. He smiles. FDR steps very close to her. Lauren wraps her arms around his sides. FDR concludes, \"I love it when you talk dirty. But, what about the CHiPs marathon?\" Lauren kind of annoyedly rolls her eyes. She whispers in his ear, \"CHiPs is being recorded. Just come to our room, baby.\" Lauren feels up one of his sides. She makes sure to keep holding the water nozzle shaped water gun in the other. FDR faintly chuckles. After a bit... FDR is following Lauren up to their bedroom, hand in hand. They close the bedroom door behind them. The whole room is plastered ahead of time with waterproofing. Soon, FDR, Tuck, and Lauren are topless in the room. They're firing nozzle shaped water guns at each other, laughing and chuckling like crazy. The waterproofed walls are dripping wet. After around a half hour... They're kind of slip slipping on the waterproofing over the bed as they try to lie down on it. They're all feeling each other's sides and making out, kind of tumbling over themselves across the waterproofing. And, through the night... Faint laughing, faint chuckling, and low moans and groans of pleasure come from the room. The End…Or The Start of More Little Spy Wars? Please Feel Free To Comment On Or Continue This Storyline[Chapter 8] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Special Feature/Alternate Ending 1: Hey, Superslick Just after Heinrich's van crash tumble falls into the highway below... Faint clouds of smoke come from the burning wreckage of construction equipment. The sun is kind of glaring in Tuck's eyes. Tuck slightly groans. He rubs his eyes, closing them. He opens them, looking across the section of freeway. And, across the freeway... He sees Lauren in FDR's arms. They've pulled each other close, with their arms wrapped around each other's sides. FDR checks, \"are you okay?\" More cheerfully... She says, \"yeah. I am now. But...please. Don't let go.\" FDR faintly smiles. He comments, \"I won't. Faint laugh. Guess you've made your decision.\" He moves his arms up, lightly putting his hands over her cheeks. Lauren faintly chuckles. She faintly smiles. She starts feeling up his sides. Lauren reflects, \"yeah. Maybe I am crazy. But, even when we were about to burn...you have the most incredible protective shield I could ever find in a guy. Very faint chuckle. That's not the only thing I love about you. But, it is the most incredible thing. I wanna just melt into you.\" FDR faintly awkwardly chuckles. He smiles. Lauren moves her arms, lightly putting her hands over his neck. They start to pull each other into a kiss. Then... Tuck kind of loudly goes ahem. Tuck faintly smiles. He comments, \"hey man. Get a room.\" Lauren kind of annoyedly rolls her eyes. FDR kind of annoyedly glares back at Tuck. Lauren slightly turns to Tuck. She comments back, \"oh my god, Tuck! You two have the same room.\" FDR laughs, almost doubling over. Tuck faintly laughs, raising his hands defeatedly. He says casually, \"okay, okay. You deserve each other. I'm just going to go check my cell phone.\" FDR adds, \"yeah. Okay.\" FDR and Lauren faintly smile to him. Tuck faintly smiles back. Tuck walks over to the other side of the freeway, taking out his cell phone. Some certain recent text messages from Trish appear on his cell phone's screen. Police cars and ambulances are coming down the highway below. The distant sound of sirens can be heard. A mostly red and white news helicopter is flying over the highway. A blue number 8 is on its side. FDR wonders, \"so...where were we?\" Lauren playfully grins. She reminds him, \"I think we were about to kiss. Could we be?\" FDR and Lauren faintly laugh and chuckle. They pull each other into a kiss. Soon, they're making out against the walled side of the freeway: Forgetting everything else in the moment. FDR pulls off her top, leaving her down to her white laced bra. As they keep making out... Lauren undoes his buttoned shirt. She pulls off his suit. Only the sound of the helicopter passing over the highway keeps them from impulsively taking off all their clothes. FDR pulls her close by the walled side of freeway, shielding her from any news cameras. Lauren blushes nervously the whole time. But, only a little. And, as the sound of the helicopter fades away... They both awkwardly smile. A few days later... Collins figures, \"still... If there's anything we or the F.B.I. can do for you, please let us know. You deserve it, boys.\" There's a brief awkward silence. Tuck says, \"thank you. But...I think we're good.\" They start to leave. But, after Tuck leaves... FDR stays in the office. He turns back to Collins, faintly smiling. He considers, \"actually boss, there is one thing.\" A few days later, by a certain martial arts arena... Tuck is passing by it: The Nakakuma West Side Dojo, with its grayish black roof, light tan Japanese screens, and mostly wooden outside walls. He's getting teary eyed. He takes a heavy breath. It's early night. Tuck is wearing black jeans and a red, blue, and white checkered collared buttoned overshirt. Then... A dark blue car pulls up in front. Some bodyguards in black suits are in back. They stay in the car. Tuck is quick to put a hand on his pistol in his pocket. But, just as quickly... He takes his empty hand out. Once he sees who's getting out of the car... He looks quite stunned. With a firm but very soft toned voice... Katie solemnly says, \"hey. So...I found out you have a clean bill of mental health.\" She's wearing a gray sweater bunched up and hanging over her white sleeveless top, dark blue jeans, and a brown belt with a gold buckle. She has a hand in her pocket where her dark purple cell phone is. She has silver hoop earrings, with small computer mouse like silver hanging in the middle of both of them. She also has a tan pink handbag over her shoulder with a long strap. Kind of suspiciously... Tuck asks, \"yeah. Who told you?\" Despite being teary eyed... Katie very faintly smiles. She solemnly points out, \"just a friend you've known for a long time. You know him.\" Then... Tuck faintly remembers FDR's text. It said: Come alone to the Nakakuma West Side Dojo, 7:00 P.M. You'll thank me later, I swear. Tuck faintly laughs. He mutters, \"god. We both know him.\" Katie smirks a little. She adds, \"mm-hmm.\" She then offers her hand. Tuck looks at her confused. Katie faintly laughs. She says, \"hi, um...I'm Katie.\" Tuck faintly smiles. Tuck reintroduces himself, \"hello. I'm Tuck. Pleased to meet you.\" They shake hands. With mixed feelings... Katie concludes, \"it's nice to meet you. Hopefully with no agents sooner than later. But...you can understand?\" She faintly sniffles. Tuck firmly nods. He concludes, \"yeah. Yeah, I do. That's more than fair.\" Katie adds, \"okay, good.\" There's a nervous silence. After a bit... Tuck nervously brings up, \"well...you wanna get some dinner? As a family?\" Katie points out, \"I would. But...I think Joe needs more time.\" Tuck solemnly just says, \"okay.\" Katie suggests, \"but we can get some dinner. Franklin and Lauren offered to babysit if I couldn't get anyone else.\" Tuck realizes, \"ohh. Okay.\" They both faintly laugh. Tuck then concludes, \"but really: We can do that.\" Katie very faintly smiles. She figures, \"okay. Then it's time to go.\" They both walk to the car. Katie gets into the driver's seat. Tuck gets in the co-pilot seat. Soon as they buckle up... Katie is driving them to a kitchen bar hybrid restaurant for their little reunion. A hour and a half later... It's dark out. Katie's car pulls up in front of the Nakakuma West Side Dojo. Tuck get out of the car, closing the door behind him. He pats it a little before walking away. But, he's faintly smiling. Katie waves. She's faintly smiling back. Tuck waves back. Then, Katie's car drives away. Tuck faintly laughs to himself. Then, as he's walking back to his car in the parking lot... He pauses. He catches FDR standing by the entrance. He's in black sunglasses and black stealth clothes. FDR faintly smiles. He says, \"hey, man. Nice to happen to see you here.\" Looking suspicious all a sudden... Tuck asks, \"FDR, what did you do?\" He's pointing to him as he says it. FDR faintly laughs. He tries to casually argue, \"come on. Can't I just stop by and say hello to my bro?\" He has his arms out as he says it. Tuck is still looking at him suspiciously. He asks again, \"FDR?\" FDR answers, \"okay. I had the C.I.A. pay for Joe's future.\" Looking fairly stunned... Tuck questions, \"what?\" FDR starts saying outright, \"I'm not kidding. College tuition, insurance K to adult, one of the best doctors in the country, money saved in advance for a good lawyer... It's all paid now, pal. Then...well...\" Tensely... Tuck says lowly, \"you did more?!\" FDR tries to assure him, \"hey, I just visited her. I showed my name on all the payments. I said I knew people in the top that would take care of you if you beat someone to death.\" Tuck puts him in a stranglehold by the neck. Tuck glares. He says, \"wait. You don't trust me now? I thought we were family!\" Under his stranglehold... FDR struggles to say, \"I... I wasn't trying to... I...can't breathe, Tuck.\" Tuck lets him go. Tuck kind of annoyedly shakes his head. FDR is catching his breath. They both nervously sigh. FDR explains, \"what I didn't tell her was that we look out for each other: In spy work and off the field. I doubt you'll really go there again. But, even if you do, I have your back.\" Tuck faintly nervously laughs. He shakes his head annoyedly at him again. But, he's faintly smiling. Tuck concludes, \"I'm not sure if that's completely immoral or considerate.\" FDR kind of lightly remarks, \"yeah. Well, I call it \"spymantic\".\" Tuck adds, \"still... Thank you, Franklin.\" FDR faintly smiles. He adds, \"you're welcome, Tuck.\" They hug each other, lightly patting each other on the back. They then walk together to Tuck's car, ready to turn in for the night. Several weeks later, in Trish's and Lauren's house... Lauren and FDR are coming in through the double window screen double doors, hand in hand. After they take their shoes and socks off... They come into the kitchen. Lauren is wearing a dark red sleeveless dress. She has her hair slightly curly. She also has musical triangle shaped gold heart earrings. FDR is wearing a black suit, a dark blue collared shirt, and blue jeans. Lauren smiles. She says, \"I had a really good time tonight.\" FDR smiles. He adds, \"me too.\" They pull each other close, about to kiss. But, then... FDR suddenly says awkwardly, \"umm...right. Sorry. I almost forgot.\" They pull away. Lauren gives him a funny look. She sighs nervously. FDR looks nervously back to her. Lauren points out, \"okay. You wouldn't tell me now if it wasn't important. What did you almost forget, FDR?\" FDR then faintly smiles. He pulls out a little gold rimmed black box from his pockets. FDR says confidently, \"I got you something.\" Lauren smiles. She asks, \"really?\" FDR says, \"yeah.\" Lauren figures, \"I'm sure I'd like to see it.\" FDR says, \"all right.\" He opens up the little box, holding it up in one hand. And, inside...there's a sparkly silvery Superman logo like engagement ring surrounded by light red. Lauren blushes a little. She gasps. She smiles. She gets wide eyed. She goes, \"oh my god! Oh my god, you're really asking me?\" FDR says, \"I am. I love you, Lauren.\" Lauren concludes, \"I love you so much, Franklin. Of course I want to.\" She takes the ring. FDR puts the little box down on the kitchen counter. But, as Lauren is starting to put on the ring on her left hand... She pauses, deep in thought. FDR asks nervously, \"what? What's wrong?\" Lauren keeps holding the ring in her hand. After a bit... Lauren kind of nervously admits, \"it's not too soon to me. But...you sure this isn't too soon for your nana to accept?\" FDR very faintly laughs. He faintly smiles. He puts a sympathetic hand on her free hand. FDR assures her, \"Ms. Worries-A-Lot... My nana says there are no mistakes: Only reasons good and bad. My nana also really likes you.\" Lauren faintly grins. She adds, \"thank you. I needed that.\" Sounding a little better... FDR adds, \"you're welcome.\" Lauren then puts on his Superman logo like engagement ring. She lets it sparkle a little in the kitchen light, admiring it. Lauren offhandedly says, \"you know...\" FDR wonders, \"yeah?\" Lauren adds, \"that's kind of a very convenient philosophy.\" FDR concludes, \"yeah. I believe it too.\" Lauren smiles. She says, \"well, I can crunch the numbers and add it up into top ten reasons why I love you.\" FDR faintly laughs. Lauren faintly chuckles. Before FDR can say something... She's starting to pull off his suit. FDR puts his hands on hers. He heavily sighs. FDR kind of nervously says, \"Lauren... I'd love to. But, Trish can come back soon. I should be a gentleman.\" Lauren kind of annoyedly rolls her eyes. But, she's playfully grinning. She remarks, \"good thing I'm not always a lady. Besides... You are my protective shield, and I want so bad to melt into you now.\" FDR faintly smiles awkwardly. He remarks back, \"well, you're right about that. But...it's kind of hard to be without clothes.\" Lauren pulls off his suit anyway. FDR can't help but faintly laugh. Lauren starts pulling off her own dress. Soon, she's down to her white laced lingerie and bra. Then... Lauren whispers in his ear, \"we challenge each other, FDR. You sure you're not up to the challenge?\" She's feeling up both his sides as she does. FDR slightly sighs, looking very amused. FDR goes, \"all right. But, can we turn off the lights?\" Lauren briefly kisses him. She smiles. She says, \"I knew you would say that. Please don't worry about it.\" FDR smiles back. He just says, \"okay.\" Lauren then goes over to turn off the kitchen lights. FDR is already pulling off his shirt. Lauren clears off the kitchen counter. She's carefully putting all the things there on the dining room table: Unplugged plugs and all. Soon, they're lying topless on the kitchen counter...with Lauren on top of FDR. They're making out as Lauren feels up his arms and shoulders. The next minute, she's unzipping his pants. And, as Trish's and Lauren's car is pulling up... Faint laughing, faint chuckling, and low moans and groans of pleasure come from the kitchen.[Chapter 9] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Special Feature/Alternate Ending 2: Not So Easy Couplings? Just after Heinrich's van crash tumble falls into the highway below... Faint clouds of smoke come from the burning wreckage of construction equipment. The sun is kind of glaring in FDR's eyes. FDR slightly groans. He rubs his eyes, closing them. He opens them, looking across the section of freeway. And, across the freeway... He sees Lauren in Tuck's arms. They've pulled each other close, with their arms wrapped around each other's sides. They make out some. Then... FDR checks, \"are you okay?\" Lauren and Tuck pull away some. But, they still have their arms wrapped around each other. More cheerfully... Lauren says, \"yeah. Yeah, I am now.\" But, noticing FDR looks uncomfortable... They both slightly turn to FDR. Tuck checks in concern, \"forget how we are right now. Are you okay, man?\" FDR kinds of waves it off with his hand in the air. He insists, \"it's nothing. Really. You're the best man I know. You're very lucky to be with Lauren.\" He's starting to get teary eyed though. Lauren kind of nervously says, \"thank you. But...you sure you're okay?\" FDR figures, \"yeah. I just... Faint laugh. I just am going to go back to our room. I kind of want some time alone, thinking. But, if you need a cleaner or a extraction, feel free to call.\" Lauren nervously says, \"hopefully not a cleaner to dispose a body. But, all right.\" Tuck mostly assures, \"it's okay: Usually, we don't need one.\" Lauren faintly smiles. She adds, \"ohh. Oh good.\" Tuck adds, \"well...all right. Take care of yourself.\" He and FDR kind of awkwardly shake hands. FDR firmly nods. He says, \"thank you. Take care.\" Then... He run jumps off the gap of freeway. He activates his parachute. Soon, he's touching down on a rectangular walled edge of highway. Lauren and Tuck turn back to each other. Police cars and ambulances are coming down the highway below. The distant sound of sirens can be heard. A mostly red and white news helicopter is flying over the highway. A blue number 8 is on its side. Tuck figures, \"I think it would be good to go ourselves.\" Lauren very faintly smiles. She asks, \"where are you thinking?\" Tuck offers, \"maybe back to the training facility while it's closed?\" Lauren keeps very faintly smiling. She says, \"all right. I could really go for going again.\" Tuck says, \"good. I'll pick you up at 8.\" They briefly kiss. Then, they pull away. They stand there, hand in hand. Some police cars are coming up the 310 Freeway to check things out. Tuck is already getting out his C.I.A. badge to show the police. Nervously... Lauren considers, \"yeah. That's good. But...\" Tuck asks kind of nervously, \"what's wrong, Lauren?\" Lauren admits, \"I'm...I'm just worried about FDR. I think he's starting to feel depressed because I didn't choose him.\" Tuck solemnly admits, \"yeah. I'm worried for him as well. He's like my brother. But... Moderate sigh. When he wants to be alone, he means it. On the other hand...if he really is still troubled, he'll tell us.\" Lauren asks, \"you sure?\" Tuck mostly assures, \"I'm sure.\" Lauren faintly smiles. She adds, \"okay.\" Meanwhile... Some certain recent text messages from Trish appear on Tuck's cell phone's screen. After a police car ride to Trish's and Lauren's house... Lauren starts to go in through the front door. She then turns back to Tuck, pausing at the door. She says, \"thank you for coming back with me.\" Tuck faintly smiles. He mostly assures, \"anytime, Lauren.\" Lauren solemnly says, \"thank you. But, with Trish in the hospital... Moderate sigh. I'm glad she's going to be okay. But, I want to be there for her. She'd do it for me.\" Looking confused... Tuck says, \"wait. I still kind of don't understand. Why did we come back just to...?\" Lauren points out awkwardly, \"I wanted to check the home phone and get some things for Trish. You're welcome to stay if you want. Really. But, I don't know how long I'll be in the hospital with Trish. And, you haven't even met Linus. So...\" Completely unphased... Tuck concludes, \"I understand now. It's okay.\" Lauren faintly smiles. She says, \"okay. I love you.\" Tuck says, \"I love you too.\" They briefly kiss. That night, in FDR's and Tuck's shared room... Tuck is coming back from his date, standing out by the door. Most everything reinsured hasn't come in yet, and FDR is restlessly trying to sleep under the sheets. So, Tuck thought it was good to stay outside of the room as much as possible. Soon, Tuck and Lauren are on their cell phones. Lauren is in her bedroom with the lights out, getting ready to go to sleep. Mostly under the sheets and in the dark, she's wearing her white laced lingerie and bra. Over the phone... Tuck figures, \"I was thinking of also getting out more spy gadgets and bugs to not officially test out at your place. But, maybe next week.\" Lauren goes wide eyed. She playfully grins. Over the phone... She says, \"I already love it. Do you know about...?\" Tuck replies, \"yes, I know you love being bugged. Why else do you think I'd bring bugs to your place?\" Lauren blushes a little. She concludes, \"ohh. You're so good at really knowing and caring for people: Specially me.\" Tuck faintly smiles. He says, \"you're welcome. Sleep well, Lauren.\" Lauren concludes, \"thank you. I think I will.\" She moderately sighs. She yawns. Nervously... Lauren tries to assure, \"try to sleep well, Tuck. I know it's not easy right now. But, your things will come back.\" Tuck adds solemnly, \"I know. But...thank you.\" Lauren tells him, \"you're welcome.\" They hang up. But, because of their worries... All of them soon find it hard to sleep. A few days later... Collins figures, \"still... If there's anything we or the F.B.I. can do for you, please let us know. You deserve it, boys.\" There's a brief awkward silence. Tuck says, \"thank you. But...I think we're good.\" They start to leave. But, after Tuck leaves... FDR stays in the office. He kind of nervously turns back to Collins. He considers, \"actually boss, there is one thing. But...\" Collin is quick to assume, \"sorry FDR. But, agent Dive Chair does not like you that way.\" FDR moderately sighs. He kind of clenches his fists. He mutters under his breath, \"that's not what I...! Moderate sigh. Just forget it, boss. I should know better than to ask spies for pointers on dating.\" Collins looks kind of shaken. Kind of nervously... She tries to say, \"FDR...\" FDR doesn't turn back to her. He just storms out the door, slamming it shut behind him. Collins heavily sighs. She's kind of quickly going back to looking through intelligence reports on her desk. But, only because she's very good at her job. A few weeks later, at Lauren's and Trish's house... Out in the front... Tuck is standing in the open doorway, wearing black jeans and a red, blue, and white checkered collared buttoned overshirt. Lauren is wearing a tan brown top with a loose cut down her exposed left shoulder, a brown leather bracelet with a gold buckle around her left wrist, and black jeans. Her hair is slightly curly. She's also wearing silvery cross earrings Tuck bought for her. She's standing in front of Tuck, her arms wrapped around his sides. Tuck faintly smiles. A dark blue lined tan buggy styled car is pulled up, with Trish in the co-pilot seat. The retractable roof is down. Trish is wearing a grayish blue jeans like buttoned jacket and a light red strapped sleeveless dress under it. Lauren adds, \"I love you.\" Tuck says, \"I love you too. You two have a good time.\" Lauren grins. She says, \"we will.\" They pull each other close. They make out some, with some low groans of pleasure. Then... Tuck and Lauren pull away. Lauren waves goodbye to him as she walks to the car. She gets into the driver's seat, buckling up. Trish is already buckled. Trish calls back, \"and don't let Linus play Ghost Recon! He's not really a guy now: He's four.\" Kind of annoyedly... Tuck says, \"yeah. All right, Trish.\" Trish waves, faintly smiling. Tuck waves goodbye to both of them. He closes the door behind him as he goes back into the house. Lauren starts driving the car down the street. They're heading for the highways, coming around for the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. As they're driving... Trish smiles. She reflects, \"all right. I'm liking these nights out: Living vicariously through him and not having to think about Linus every second.\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She adds, \"I just knew you would admit it one of these days.\" Trish faintly chuckles. She says, \"well, I'm impressed and proud of you.\" Lauren blushes a little. Lauren grins. She adds, \"ohh. Thank you.\" After a bit... Lauren reflects, \"being with Tuck... Faint chuckle. It's like a wet dream I'm never waking up from. I never felt so thrilled with a guy in my entire life. He's so driven and kind. He's like nice cool bottled water you wanna never get enough of.\" Trish faintly smiles. She remarks, \"I'll even buy you more boxes of wet wipes to blot the dripping.\" Lauren chuckles hard, almost having to pull over to catch her breath. But, on their girl's night out...they keep driving no problem over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. A few nights later, in FDR's and Tuck's shared room... FDR is by himself on the couch, with his arms over the back cushioning. He's wearing a black T-shirt and blue jeans. He's nervously tapping his fingers over the couch. He looks a little sleepy and pale. A few mostly empty glass bottles of spilled booze are on the wooden floor. The reinsured TV and boombox are turned off. The TV remote is banged up, lying near one of the glass bottles. Then... FDR hears a knock on the door. FDR heavily sighs into his hands. After feeling more feeling in his kind of numb arms... He hears a knock again. FDR heavily sighs. He walks over to the door anyway. He answers it, kind of shoving it all the way open. Once he sees who's at the door... He looks stunned. He sees Lauren in a mostly dark blue air hostess outfit, nervously stepping in. She has her hair down, slightly curly, and in a kind of dripping wet mess. She closes the door behind her. FDR asks incredulously, \"Lauren?! What... What the hell is this? You could've at least called for...\" Lauren gulps nervously. She somberly says, \"I'm... I'm sorry. Hard sniffle. But, I lost my cell phone. And... Heavy sigh. I don't know who else to...\" Very nervously... FDR quickly says, \"it's going to be okay. Just... Moderate sigh. Please sit down.\" Lauren very faintly smiles. She nods. She sits down on the couch. She sighs in relief at sitting down. FDR sits next to her. Very nervously... Lauren asks him, \"could you check for bugs? I think I got mites or something.\" FDR gulps nervously. He knew immediately what that was code for. He checks her over for any spy bugs. As he does... Lauren whispers, \"thank you.\" FDR doesn't find any spy bugs. But, from the corner of his eye...he catches something: Hints of a sewn seam for a wig. A cold glare starts appearing on FDR's face. Lauren asks, \"FDR, what's...?\" FDR shouts, \"get out of my room, Trish! Get out!\" The fake Lauren sighs heavily. Tears start falling from her face. With her real voice... She murmurs, \"shit, I'm sorry. I...\" She then breaks down on the floor, crying. FDR very nervously stands there, speechless. After a long minute... FDR apologizes, \"Trish... Faint sniffle. I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have shouted.\" The fake Lauren kind of slowly looks up at him. She rolls down the rubber face mask over her face...to reveal Trish's kind of sweaty face under it. She holds the rubber mask in one hand. But, she puts her hands up. She's breathing nervously in and out as some more tears fall. After another long minute... Trish nervously admits, \"thank you. But...I wasn't trying to hurt you. Faint sniffle! I thought you'd find out who I was quicker...because of your spy bugs. I already knew it. But... Heavy nervous sigh. This isn't a good time, and there probably isn't. Faint sniffle. I understand and I'm sorry.\" Trish starts fast walking out the door, teary eyed still. But... FDR can't help but wonder, \"why did you come knowing I'd know? Maybe you should still get out. But... Moderate sigh. I have to be honest: I'd like to at least know why.\" Trish pauses at the door, turning back to face him. She very faintly chuckles. The tears stop falling, despite the teariness in her eyes. Trish admits, \"I'd never break up Lauren's coupling with any guy. But... Faint sniffle! I came because I thought if you saw me pretending to be Lauren, it would help you feel better. Came pretending to be her... Faint sniffle! ...knowing you'd know... ...to see if I could be as good as her for you.\" FDR goes wide eyed. With mixed feelings... FDR mutters under his breath, \"shit, shit, shit... Oh, god. Um...how can I say this without you being hurt again? Heavy sigh. Oh god!\" He kind of falls back on the couch. He groans. He sighs heavily into his hands. Trish sits next to him. There's a very nervous silence. After a few long minutes... Trish concludes nervously, \"umm... I don't know if this will be helpful. I only know a few things about you from Lauren. But... Faint sniffle. You look to be my kind of guy. So, if there is anything beside my man stink that you'd like me to change...I'd least think it with you.\" FDR moderately sighs. Somewhat coldly... He figures, \"sorry. Maybe I really appreciate going to all this trouble for me. But...my family wouldn't approve. I respect how you live your life. But, it has a lot of health risks. I worry myself sick anyway. And, well...what's left to really think about?\" Then, surprisingly... Trish faintly chuckles. Sounding a little better... She pinpoints, \"well FDR...here's what I think: Lauren doesn't let me touch her anywhere else but her hands except after I've showered. I haven't to you. But... Faint chuckle. Guys usually get in and shower after dirty deeds. I don't have to because I'm a woman who does whatever shit she wants and no one tells it to my face on the streets. I shower for special occasions. Visiting a family is one. Give me a nice looking Q and A, and I can pass off as pretend clean for you. Faint chuckle. I'd try. But, I can't promise to be completely clean. I get tested before every night I maybe go out. But, I rarely see alarming shit with rubber between and shit. Please tell me if I missed probable alarming shit with me here. Or, if it makes it really easy for you...just tell me to go and I will. Okay?\" FDR sits nervously there, finding it hard to look up. He then rubs his eyes with one hand, checking if he's going to wake up soon. But, as he opens them... He realizes he's not dreaming. After a bit... He asks nervously, \"Trish?\" Trish wonders, \"yes?\" FDR very faintly chuckles. Sounding a little better... He figures, \"oh god, you're crazy. Maybe I'm going crazy. Maybe it's the alcohol. But... Very faint chuckle. You showered? Because now you have me thinking of a incredible dirty deed we could do.\" With her arms out... Trish goes, \"yes! I have dirty deeds with you. Oh my god, that's awesome!\" She faintly chuckles. FDR faintly laughs. Before FDR can say anything... Trish quickly adds, \"yes: I showered.\" FDR looks kind of uncomfortable as he faintly smiles, still wrapping his head around it all. Trish is smiling wide as she goes over to the kitchen with the mask. She starts running water and liquid soap over the inner part of the mask. Kind of casually... She calls out lowly, \"I'll clean the mask up so you don't worry, my superhorniness! Okay?\" FDR laughs, doubling over. After a bit, he catches his breath. He calls back, \"okay!\" Soon... Trish is standing by the wall, wearing the Lauren rubber mask over her face. She's topless, down to her black lingerie and bra. FDR is pulling his T-shirt off. Trish starts feeling up his sides and arms. FDR start pulling her in closer. Trish pulls him in close, lightly putting her hands around his neck. They kiss. They start making out. On impulse... Trish unexpectedly kind of jumps up, wrapping her legs around his waist. FDR wraps his arms around her lower body, only a little heavy to someone in the spy field. He brings her to the sheeted bed, lying down on his side. Trish kind of tumbles alongside him, letting go of his waist. She chuckles. FDR faintly laughs. They lie down together more flat faced, with FDR on top of her. They're making out again. Trish is feeling up his arms and legs like crazy. Soon, FDR is starting to pull off his pants. Trish helps him pull it off quicker off the bed. And, through the night... Faint laughing, faint chuckling, and kind of loud moans and groans of pleasure come from the room. A few months or so later, in Trish's and Lauren's house... It's early morning. The sun is just fully coming up. And, up in Lauren's bedroom... Hints of movement are under the sheets of the king sized bed. It's kind of dim up here. Hints of familiar faces are on the white pillows. Ten spilled empty bottles of booze, some glass shards, some empty bags of Cheetos, and little Cheetos crumbs are on the floor. FDR wakes up, sitting up in the bed. He's topless, with Cheetos crumbs lined over his face and neck. His hands have some too. They're a little red and feeling a little sore. His arms and sides are kind of bruised. He groans, rubbing his eyes with the clean back part of his hands. Then... He faintly grins, slightly turning to his right. A little groggy... He says, \"hey.\" Trish is already sitting up in the bed. Her hair is only kind of a mess. And, she's not wearing a mask. She's topless, with Cheetos crumbs lined over her face and neck. Her hands have some too. They're red and feeling sore. Her arms are kind of red all over. Trish faintly smiles. She faintly chuckles. She says, \"hello. How are you feeling?\" FDR concludes, \"all right. You're my incredible werewolf. But...\" Trish smiles wide. She wonders, \"what is it, my superhorniness?\" She puts a comforting hand on his. FDR asks, \"how much did we drink?\" Trish looks kind of amused. She tries to be assuring, \"we're not sitting in a jail cell or being interrogated by the C.I.A. We're not in the hospital and we could probably walk. Does it matter?\" FDR nervously brings up, \"well...it kind of does when we're getting up in Lauren's bed. I don't remember that.\" Trish is lightly feeling up his arms, not caring how sore her hands are. She insists, \"it doesn't matter, FDR. We'll get out and get through it: Even if I have to drive you out there myself, get arrested, and then you smuggle in some blindfolds for dirty deeds so I could extract myself with a horny guard and leave him out for the guards.\" FDR laughs, kind of doubling over. He faintly smiles. He adds, \"thank you.\" Trish smiles back. She faintly chuckles. Then... Lauren wakes up with a startle in the bed. Looking kind of startled herself... Trish stops feeling up FDR's arms. Tuck starts to get up in the bed. He moderately sighs nervously. Both him and Lauren are topless. Tuck has Cheetos crumbs mostly lined around his face and hands. Lauren only has some around her hands and side. FDR looks very nervous and wide eyed. So does Lauren. Tuck hiccups a little. Lauren murmurs, \"whew. Ah. Oh my god! This is crazy.\" She's very nervously breathing in and out. Looking pale... Tuck wonders, \"did we just...\" FDR nervously finishes the thought, \"...do it with each other?\" There's a very awkward silence. After a bit... Trish smiles wide. Everyone else in the bed looks at her funny. Completely unphased... Trish concludes, \"you know...we could live our lives like this: If it's what we're all okay with. Same time every Saturday?\" There's a brief awkward silence. Then... FDR, Tuck, and Lauren faintly smile. They're laughing and chuckling, almost doubling over. After catching their breaths though... They all say yes.[Chapter 10] In Spying, Love, and War: A This Means War Fanfiction Story Special Feature/Alternate Ending 3: I Love You, Man After 12:30 draws near... FDR very faintly smiles. He kind of casually points out, \"well...we aren't at war now.\" Tuck very faintly smiles. He adds kind of casually, \"yeah. We're really not.\" Lauren puts sympathetic hands on both of theirs. FDR and Tuck put sympathetic hands on both of theirs. Lauren very faintly smiles. And, she says, \"and I'm glad.\" There's a calm silence. After a bit... Lauren wonders more casually, \"so...do you guys want to know my decision?\" FDR and Tuck look nervous all a sudden. Tuck says, \"Lauren... Moderate sigh. We should tell you something first.\" Lauren gets nervous. She starts to ask, \"okay. What do you...?\" Then, suddenly... Shots are fired. Tuck calls out, \"get down!\" At the same time, Tuck kicks the table down on its side. Glass windows, the glass door, Lauren's sunglasses... They shatter from the bullets. Some people run frantically for the back door. Bullets make holes through the fallen table. But, none of them hit Tuck. Tuck, Lauren, and FDR duck behind it. Tuck and FDR get out their pistols. After Tuck, FDR, and Lauren touch down on a walled edge of highway... Very nervously... Lauren voices, \"well... Moderate sigh. I know this is weird. I don't know if it's possible for this not to turn out to be \"oh my god, I'm Yoko\". But... Faint chuckle. You're both incredible in your own ways. And...I don't want to have to choose. But, if you still feel I should... Faint sniffle. Please just tell me: Because I'll be okay with you choosing for me...because I love you equally.\" FDR and Tuck look stunned. Lauren blushes. After a bit... FDR starts to say nervously, \"umm...\" Tuck starts to say, \"well...\" Lauren suddenly gets teary eyed. She glares. She asks, \"what? I'm too much for both of you? This was all just another sort of game?!\" Almost at the same time... FDR and Tuck say, \"Lauren, we were trying to explain. But...\" Lauren moderately sighs. Her glare mostly fades. She realizes, \"you mean back at Trucco's Pizza?\" Tuck adds nervously, \"yeah. We're not trying to hurt you. Moderate sigh. Just let us explain. Please.\" Sounding a little better... Lauren solemnly says, \"okay. What did you two want to tell me?\" FDR reflects nervously, \"yeah. Well... We still love you. But...we found we can't really handle dating drama.\" Lauren very faintly smiles. The teariness in her eyes starts to dry up. She says, \"ohh. I think I understand now. It's because of your war over me that you've realized it. That's kind of sweet.\" FDR and Tuck very faintly smile. Tuck brings up, \"yeah. But...that's not the only thing.\" FDR and Tuck are now kind of awkwardly holding hands. Lauren wonders, \"are you about to tell me you're bisexual? Because I'm not going to judge if you are.\" FDR suggests kind of nervously, \"thank you. But... Well... You want to explain, Tuck? I think you can explain it better than I could.\" Tuck concludes kind of reluctantly, \"well, okay. If you're sure.\" FDR insists, \"I am.\" Lauren turns to tuck. She asks, \"Tuck, what is it you're both trying to tell me?\" Tuck explains, \"before we even met you...we've done anything with and for each other. We went to the same C.I.A. entrance exam in Bangladesh. We had to fight each other to see who makes it to the spy academy. And, even though he did kick me in the balls... We've been best friends ever since.\" Lauren kind of nervously chuckles a little. She goes, \"oh my god. I'm glad you're both okay. But...I can't imagine.\" Sounding a little embarrassed... Tuck concludes, \"maybe it's better you can't.\" FDR figures, \"yeah. But, maybe it's better if you can. Faint chuckle. You should've seen his face when he...\" Tuck and Lauren warningly glare at him. Kind of cluelessly... FDR asks, \"what?\" Tuck kind of shakes his head. Lauren kind of annoyedly rolls her eyes. Quick to change the subject... Lauren concludes, \"yeah. You're best friends. But, why are you...?\" FDR admits, \"we've...been starting to think we should go out. Nervous sigh. We got drunk one night. But...yeah.\" With mixed feelings... Lauren realizes, \"oh. Now it's getting to be rational to me. It's much less drama with you two so close. Isn't it?\" Tuck adds casually, \"yeah. It does seem that way.\" FDR and Tuck very faintly smile. Lauren concludes, \"all right. That's good for you two. But...I still don't understand something.\" FDR asks in concern, \"what is it?\" Lauren voices, \"you're going to start seeing each other. But, at Trucco's Pizza...why did you keep telling yourselves about who deserves me more? Why didn't you make it clearer with me that you were talking about just being best friends if that's what you really meant?\" FDR faintly chuckles. He comments, \"you don't miss things much.\" Lauren faintly smiles. She presses, \"no. I don't. So...why didn't you?\" Very nervously... FDR thinks out loud, \"well...we were thinking sexually. But...you like Hitchcock and relationships. We weren't really sure if you'd go for it.\" Lauren chuckles, kind of doubling over. Looking amused... She wonders, \"oh, that was all that was?\" There's a awkward silence. After a bit... Lauren puts sympathetic hands on both of theirs. She admits, \"you're right. I am that kind of girl. But, for you two...I'll think about it. Okay?\" FDR just says, \"okay.\" Tuck says, \"yeah. That's more than fair.\" Lauren tells them, \"thank you.\" They just sit there for who knows how long...looking out to the mostly clear sky. A few days later, at Collin's office... Collins figures, \"still... If there's anything we or the F.B.I. can do for you, please let us know. You deserve it, boys.\" There's a brief awkward silence. Tuck says, \"thank you. But...I think we're good.\" They leave. A few weeks later, in FDR's and Tuck's shared room... It's dark. Smooth Operator by Sade is playing on their reinsured boombox. A few mostly empty glass bottles of booze are on the floor. And, mostly under the sheets... FDR and Tuck are topless and making out. As more songs by Sade keep playing... They lowly groan and moan with pleasure. A few weeks later, in Trish's and Lauren's house... It's early night out. The mostly jet black radio behind the kitchen counter is playing Me So Horny by 2Live Crew. Lauren is wearing a dark red sleeveless dress. She has her hair slightly curly. She also is carrying her handbag over her shoulder. Trish is wearing a black sleeveless dress with a loose cut by the neckline. She has silver hoop earrings. She also has her hair mostly tied back in a bun: Still a little wet from showering. Some of Trish's F.B.I. agent friends are standing out around the house. Lauren concludes nervously, \"Trish... You sure this is a good idea?\" Trish figures, \"yes. One of them is a parent, and I trust him. Besides, I thought we wanted to try double dating together.\" Lauren moderately sighs. She admits, \"I do. I just... Moderate sigh. Am I going to ever find a guy that isn't a spy or too much drama? Because usually, they turn out to not work.\" Trish faintly chuckles. Trish hugs her. Lauren hugs her back. After a bit... They pull away, very faintly smiling to each other. Looking amused... Trish comments, \"Lauren, you already have two guys: I'd be so proud if I was in your dresses. When are you ever going to tuck away the regrets, wake up from getting drunk off your ass, and be more like man stink loving me?\" Lauren blushes a little. After a bit... She points out kind of nervously, \"I really like you as my best friend. But, I just can't be like you Trish. I like holding hands, being taken out to dinner, smelling nice... Maybe it feels too short lived and tragic to me to go find guys just sexually. Moderate sigh. I still don't really know if I can even be just sexually with FDR and Tuck: We had so much fun on dates...until their war over me came to light, and they pretty much signed off on dating.\" Trish puts a sympathetic hand on hers. She concludes, \"that's okay. Still...why are we double dating if you don't want to be more like man stink loving me?\" Lauren faintly chuckles. She comments lightly, \"hey! I thought I question and worry a lot.\" Trish interestingly smiles. She figures, \"you still do. I just wanted you to remember for yourself so you don't rush or worry too much into more regrets tonight.\" Lauren looks stunned. She says, \"wow. That's disturbingly good of you. Thank you.\" Trish adds, \"you're welcome. I'm proud to be your wing woman before I go off into my dirty deeds.\" Lauren very faintly chuckles. She grins. Soon... They're walking out through the double window screen double doors hand in hand...heading into their car and driving out for their girl's night out.

He sat back in his chair, listening to her move closer. Peering his eyes open, he watched her move in front of him. He couldn't help but let out a small smirk as she held his slippers. \"Thank you Eliza. You see? I've taught you remarkably well, one could-.\" He stopped talking as she leant down slightly. Eliza did not remove her eyes from his. They entranced him, they broke him. She removed his shoes and placed them to the side. He couldn't help but notice how delicately her hands moved. Now where did a cabbage leaf learn such natural grace! They did not look so utterly dirty as when he had first noticed them. She slid his slippers on with so much effortless intimacy that he couldn't help but feel a sudden surge of feeling from within. But then it was all over. She simply got up with a smile and left the room. Damn that insufferable woman! He thought. Who was she to entice a man and just leave him? Surely he had taught her about conduct with gentlemen. Well, perhaps not. Blast it, she wouldn't listen anyway. Higgins wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, he adjusted and tried to compose himself, feeling highly embarrassed. \"Are you quite alright Higgins?\" Cornel Pickering was stood at the door. \"Alright? Of course I'm alright, why the devil wouldn't I be alright?\" He stuffed his handkerchief away. \"Simply tired Pickering, tired.\" \"Well, Miss Eliza has returned to us! You can stop worrying now old chap!\" Pickering gave a large smile. \"Ah yes. I thought I saw her come in.\" \"She talked about meeting your mother again later. I suppose we will be having two for tea hmm? Things back to how they should be Higgins. I'll tell Mrs. Pearce to put the dinner on!\" With that Pickering almost bounced out the room. It was clear the day's excitement had got to him. Silly old fool he thought. Acting like she is some sort of angel returned to earth. More like the devil thrust back to us from Heaven. This made him smirk. I won't be a part of her prudish games. I'll simply go about my life as before. It was dinner time. Henry and Pickering were seated at the table. \"Why on earth is she not down here yet? It's not Buckingham Palace, it's our evening meal. Women take so disgustingly long to prepare their faces.\" Henry fiddled with his napkin, tucking it into his shirt. \"Oh Higgins, don't be so negative. I haven't seen her leave her room since she came back. I'm sure you won't complain when the girl comes down here looking all done up.\" Pickering gave a look to Henry. \"Don't be so absurd Pickering. 'All done up' she looks like those wretched pompous women from town-.\" He was cut short by Eliza once again. She had entered the room. Eliza stood by the door wearing a light evening gown, holding her bag between her fingers. Henry tried not to show reaction to her beauty, he sat up straight. \"And where do you think you are going all dressed up like that? We are dining here. Now sit down before I start eating the silverware.\" Henry pointed a commanding finger to the empty chair. A servant entered. \"Miss Eliza? Mrs. Higgins has arrived; she is waiting in the car. Will you be along shortly?\" \"Yes. Thank you.\" She nodded to the man, he left. Henry chimed in \"Mother? In the car? Not coming in? What in gods name is going on? What are you two up to? I want to have my dinner, enough of this farce!\" \"She invited me to dine and then go to the theatre tonight. We are going with two other young women and two young men. She said it would be good for me\" Eliza smiled, studying Henry's face. \"Good for-.. Good for you? Who on earth are these young women...men?\" Henry tapped his knife onto his plate slightly. \"No no no. We agreed dinner; we were all going to.-\" \"Don't be a tyrant Higgins. Let the girl go enjoy herself.\" Pickering smiled between the two. \"I really must go. See you gentlemen later.\" She nodded slightly to them before leaving. Henry stared open mouthed at the door. \"Well have you ever...such imprudence. How terribly rude. The food is wasted...\" He trailed off, yanking the napkin from his shirt. \"It will be good for her! Maybe meet a nice young man or two-.\" Henry slammed his fist onto the table. \"It's damn foolish is what it is!\" He stood out his seat, shoving the chair back in. \" I didn't teach her these slum manners. These impulsions!' Henry exited the room with a bang. He went straight up to his room. Loosening his tie he stood by the window. What is she playing at? Going out with young men... young men with their idiotic fancies and simple minds. It made him sick. He would stay up; stay up all night by the window until she returned. If she returned tonight. He felt himself shudder.[Chapter 2] Henry did not wait by the window all evening. He found it boring and lonesome. Instead, he enjoyed a game of house with Pickering and retired early to bed. He felt the feelings from the previous night emerge again on seeing Eliza at the breakfast table. \"Miss Eliza! Do tell us about your evening?\" Pickering smiled over to her. Henry resisted glancing at Eliza and instead played nonchalantly with his fork. Eliza however, gave a small look across the table to Henry before she began. \"It was a highly enjoyable evening. Mrs. Higgins introduced me to some very nice young people. I hope to see them again.\" She gave Pickering a reassuring smile. \"We are glad to hear of it! I think-.\" He was cut off by Henry. \"You went to the theatre, am I correct?\" Henry looked at her for the first time. \"Yes, it was-.\" He cut in again \"Your first time at the theatre?\" She could see his look change. \"Were you able to keep up Eliza? Plays are for the more complex of minds.\" She sent him an icy glare. \"I kept up quite easily. I also had the help of my new friends.\" \"Ah! Do enlighten us about these 'new friends'. They have known each other one evening and already friends! How about that Pickering! They really do not hesitate nowadays!\" Pickering gave a small laugh, he did not want to get involved and instead carried on eating. Henry sniffed and peered across the table to Eliza. She avoided his glance, shifting her eyes to the plate. \"Your mother will be visiting this afternoon.\" She spoke whilst adjusting the shoulder of her gown. Henry watched her movements; he saw a glimpse of pale skin beneath the satin material of the dress. This distracted him briefly; the others stared at him awaiting an answer. He quickly darted his eyes around the room. \"Mother? I see, I see.\" \"I need to go freshen up. I'll tell Mrs. Pearce to put your coffees in the library.\" Eliza smiled as she rose from the chair. Henry watched her leave the room, his eyes lingered on the door. \"Well Higgins, I think our creation is going to go far, very far indeed! I'm sure your mother has plans and the right suitors lined out for her. Ah think about it! Think about how far she has come!\" Henry moved his eyes from the door way and smiled to Pickering \"Far. If she does marry, Pickering, she'll be even further away from us.\" This statement made Pickering raise his eyebrows \"Come now Higgins! We can't keep the girl here forever; she's got her own life to live.\" \"Yes, you are right.\" He hesitated for a split second \"I am just concerned about who will sort my appointments. Think about it Pickering, a lot of nonsense happens with young people and courting. I don't want to have to hear a sobbing guttersnipe once a week.\" Pickering laughed as they rose out the chairs. \"Henry do not dawdle, where is Eliza?\" Mrs. Pickering was walking behind him into the hallway. \"She is in the library mother. First, I would like to speak to you about a pressing matter.\" \"Pressing matter? What could be so pressing from you?\" Henry was overtaken by her, he paced behind. \"Well, it's about Eliza and her new friends.\" She stopped in her tracks, throwing an unimpressed look at Henry. \"What about them? Before you object, it's good for her. Much healthier than her spending time cooped up in the library with you.\" \"There's nothing wrong with learning, there's still more she could learn.\" \"Henry she must also learn about life, people, socializing. Things you will not find on your shelves.\" \"People! Bah! I wouldn't call those young drones 'people'. It won't do her any good turning into them.\" \"She isn't turning into anyone. She is a young woman; it's the right thing to do. Our discussion is over now, stop acting like a child.\" She adjusted a button on his suit jacket before briskly entering the library. Henry followed her in; she was greeting Eliza like an old friend. \"The day after tomorrow I will be holding a social dinner. It will be a great opportunity for the young people. I do hope to see you three attend?\" Mrs. Higgins looked at them expectantly. Eliza smiled over to Henry. \"We would be more than happy to. I'm sure Colonel Pickering can keep Professor Higgins company.\" Henry stuck his hands into his pockets and began to slowly pace around the room as they spoke. \"Yes, well. I didn't have the luxury of this sort of business with Henry. He completely refused any opportunities.\" \"I'm sure you could invite women of Professor Higgins' age?\" Eliza gave Mrs. Higgins a small grin. Henry stopped briefly, watching them from behind his desk. \"Don't be absurd! I do not wish to be part of your playground plotting.\" \"Anyway, it's settled then. Henry you are attending, you haven't objected.\" She linked her arm with Eliza's, walking to the doorway. \"Come now Eliza, I wish to discuss that young man...\" Her voice faded away as they left the room. Henry almost staggered over his desk in an attempt to hear a name. There ' s a specific young man already? He thought as he watched them walk into the garden. With a social gathering looming Henry took refuge in his books. The dinner party would soon prove to be more than Higgins had expected.[Chapter 3] The reception room of Mrs. Higgins' house was buzzing with conversation and energy. Henry observed familiar faces, but also the fresh new ones. The young men and women stood in small circles admiring each other's dress or exchanging familiarities. Eliza was amongst a group of very fashionable young women; Henry observed how well she blended with them. He also observed however, that she was still different to them, she had a light in her eyes that they did not. Henry could make out the women complementing Eliza on her gown; he noticed how much of her skin he could see. A young man approached the group, greeting them politely. He immediately cut between to start conversation with Eliza. Henry watched as they removed themselves from the group, she seemed to lighten up listening to his words. There were a few minutes of smiles and laughing, they were then interrupted by a young woman with fair hair. The man then left the two women alone, it was clear that they then began to talk about him. The young girl spotted Henry watching them and turned to Eliza. At this point Henry spun himself around and instead began to pace the room. He began a dreary conversation with one of his mother's friends. \"I often hear them arguing late at night. One can only wonder what the children must think. I begged my husband to go to them but he insisted...\" The woman droned on. Henry then zoned out as he noticed Eliza and her friend approach. They waited politely for the conversation to end and made their way to him. \"Professor Higgins, I'd like you to meet my new friend Miss Judy Hutton.\" Henry bowed to Eliza's friend, watching her closely. \"Miss Eliza has spoken of you as a genius! She tells me you have read nearly every book in your library.\" He couldn't help but smile. \"Well, I do enjoy reading. As for being a genius, yes, that's correct.\" \"Oh! He's modest as well!\" Judy chortled, gently tapping Eliza on the arm. Henry stood straight, surveying the room once again. He admitted to himself that he liked the attention; he also admitted that he wasn't foolish enough to bask in it. \"Have you ladies seen Pickering?\" \"You won't stay and talk with us?\" Judy seemed thrown by Higgins' bluntness. \"As tempting as a conversation with you would be, I'd rather have a vaguely intelligent one with the Colonel.\" He bowed to the women and walked off further into the room. Eliza stood, feeling slightly embarrassed by his behaviour. \"That means he is fond of you!\" \"What a strange man, Eliza! Now do tell me, how old is he?\" Miss Hutton's eyes sparkled slightly. \"To be perfectly honest, I do not know exactly, middle aged I should think.\" Eliza wanted to evade this subject. \"That's not old. He still has a chance to marry. He is awfully rich. Maybe a nice young girl.\" She giggled to herself. Dinner was served. The table was laid out, ready for the guests. It certainly was a fancy affair; silverware gleamed throughout the length of it. As Henry took his seat next to Pickering he watched Judy drag Eliza, rather immodestly, over to the seats opposite. Pickering stood up as Eliza sat opposite, Henry made a half hearted attempt as Judy sat. The first course arrived and was presented to them. Henry began to eat, but found himself interrupted. \"Your mother's house is so very lovely! I suppose not as nice as your own. She is an exceedingly lucky woman.\" \"I agree.\" He smiled, bowing his head slightly. They ate in silence for a while; Henry glanced to both of the women occasionally. The Judy creature talked too much but she wasn't bad to look at. Of course she was no Eliza but he was aware of the small smiles she gave him during the meal. Pickering attempted small talk which the women received politely. Henry observed the young man from earlier giving Eliza a variety of smiles and funny faces. He strained himself to see what he was up to. \"Does your mother have a library?\" Judy interrupted his line of thought. \"Yes she does. Not that she reads many books.\" Henry smiled to the girl. Her tone then became much quieter. \"I should like to see it after dinner. I quite like reading.\" Who the devil was this creature? What was her game? He could see she was quite the seductress! Her eyes lingered on his for an answer; he was unaware of Eliza listening in. \"Certainly\" Henry found himself saying before he could object. He zoned back into reality as Eliza dropped her fork rather loudly on her plate. The rest of dinner went by quite slowly. Miss Judy Hutton kept on vying for Henry's attention; he eventually gave in after witnessing Eliza smiling to the other man at least four times. He counted that it was four times too many. After dinner had ended Henry watched Eliza engage in conversation with the young man again. This prompted him to once more engage in conversation with Miss Hutton. He didn't really take notice of what she was saying but he could see her clear flirtatious advantages. Henry met Eliza's eyes across the busy room; she held this for a moment before looking away. \"May I see the library now?\" Judy chimed in. Henry began to walk off, murmuring back. \"This way.\" Once they had entered the room Henry was startled by her shriek of excitement. \"Oh how splendid!\" She hurried to the shelves, eagerly placing her hands along the spines. \"Edith Wharton! I know of her! American?\" \"Ah yes, I recommended her to Eliza also.\" The mention of Eliza did not sway Judy. \"Euripides! These surely are not your mother's now are they?\" \"I do let some of my books fill up her shelves from time to time. I have copies of his other works at home. Thinking of it now, Eliza also enjoys his plays...\" Henry contemplated on how things had begun to remind him of Eliza. Henry remained at a distance, watching her movements closely. She stopped on noticing him observing. \"Are you pleased?\" She inquired with an impish smile. \"Pleased? What do you mean, 'pleased'?\" \"With what you see?\" She made her way slowly over to Henry. He suddenly realised what an awfully stupid situation he had got himself into. What on earth am I doing in here with this girl? He thought. She is clearly not the sort of girl he should be found alone with. He felt as if he had broken a marriage vow, discussing books with another woman? The door crept open, sure enough it was Eliza. It was enough to startle Judy from her prey. Feeling embarrassed Judy gave a knowing smile and left without a word. Damn. He really had not thought this one out very well. In a nervous manner he replaced some of the books back into their correction positions. \"Well Eliza you do seem to have some interesting friends.\" He avoided looking at her, he felt guilty. \"They won't replace you though.\" This made Henry stop his action. He looked to the side at her as she leant back against the shelf slightly. \"Ah of course they won't. We'll always be friends Eliza; you know that, I know that.\" \"Friends?\" He felt her presence close to him as she spoke; he continued to fiddle with the books. \"I hardly think we are enemies. I mean I do annoy you sometimes and you in turn annoy me. That is life I am afraid, we are people after all.\" \"Yes, people. People with feelings and emotions-.\" \"Don't start with that sort of talk.\" \"I don't believe you have any. I don't think you even got feelings.\" She placed a hand on top of his as he pushed a book back in. \"Damn you woman, it's 'get feelings'. Or I 'have', not got.\" He snatched his hand back, stepping in front of her. \"You talk of feelings. Feelings, feelings, feelings! You fail to see these feelings you give me.\" \"Feelings of a friend?\" She looked up at him with those dark eyes. Henry hated it when she did this. He gave a small sigh of defeat. Henry leant his arms on the bookshelf; his body was towering over hers slightly. He began to feel her breath against his chin. \"Eliza...\"[Chapter 4] Taken me a while, hope you enjoy. Read and review. I apologise for any errors, I just wanted to get this one out there. Maybe Henry Higgins had too many brandies, maybe he did have human feelings afterall or maybe he had just gone mad. Knock. Knock. Henry staggered himself back on hearing the door. \"Miss Eliza? Are you in here?\" The young man poked his head around, entering the library. Eliza simply pretended she was preoccupied with the spines of various books; she turned and gave a smile. Henry on the other hand remained facing away from the door, seemingly fixated on one of the wall hangings. \"Mr. Lismore, I was just coming to fetch you, Professor Higgins was showing me some of the new books.\" The young man looked towards the back of Henry, stuttering \"Good evening Professor Higgins...sir\" He bowed. Eliza smiled widely at this; Henry merely turned his head as acknowledgement. \"Your mother has a splendid home.\" The man attempted to exchange pleasantries. \"It serves the purpose of a home. She fills it with nonsense.\" Eliza then briskly crossed the room, linking arms with Lismore. \"Mr. Lismore, I do believe you owe me a dance.\" They then exited the library together. Henry turned, running a hand through his hair. Immediately he began thinking up excuses as to what occurred. Firstly, he blamed it on drink, not admitting to himself any emotion. Secondly, he blamed Eliza , no other woman had ever caused him to act the way he did with her. The young men and women shared many dances that evening. Henry stood in the corner with his brandy, not partaking. He could see the glances between Eliza and the young gentleman. He also took the liberty in tallying they had danced four dances together. After some days of avoidance Eliza entered the study. \"Would you mind taking a walk with me Professor?\" Henry merely met her gaze, taking in her appearance for a brief moment. \"Fresh air? How horrible...\" Eliza took this answer as a yes and proceeded out of the room to prepare herself. Henry shortly followed, assisted on with his heavy winter coat. He pressed his head for his hat, searching the hall for it. \"Blast it..\" Henry then saw Eliza ready by the door, holding onto his hat. She was dressed up warm, as it was a cold time of year. He then proceeded to her, nodding once for thanks as he placed the hat onto his head. Once on the street, they walked along the pavement side by side, not saying a word. Henry observed her blowing outwards several times to watch her breath in the cold air. He found this quite amusing. \"When I was younger I used to pretend I was smoking a pipe. Like the distinguished gentlemen of your sort.\" She peered to him with a gleam of mischief in her eyes. \"It's the hot air from your breath, reacting with the cold air around you.\" \"Oh you're full of it.\" \"Full of what Eliza?\" \"Hot air…\" She linked her arm into his as they turned around into the next street. Henry couldn't help but smile \"Ah Eliza, I knew I could not have scientific discussions with you.\" \"I do have something to discuss.\" They walked slowly, passing a small park as they made their way around the block. Eliza then stopped to admire the frosted spider webs. Henry took another opportunity to observe her behavior. \"Isn't it something? So much detail in the little web.\" She peered at it and then looked approvingly to Henry. \"What did you want to discuss Eliza?\" She smiled, turning to face him. \"How do you like Stuart?\" \"I am not sure whom you are speaking of.\" \"Mr. Lismore.\" \"What ever happened to Freddy?\" Henry leant onto a wall as they spoke. \"You didn't approve of Freddy. Stuart is-.\" \"They are all the same.\" He wouldn't look at her, she tried a different approach. \"Well, last night in the library-.\" \"It was a foolish moment. A lapse in my better judgment.\" Henry placed his hands in his pockets, away from the cold. \"I..\" She hesitated \"I wanted to tell you that Mrs. Higgins believes he will make me an offer of marriage soon.\" She held tightly onto her small purse. \"So soon? \" Henry paused for a moment, he appeared to be thinking. \"I suppose it will be good for you. It's what we discussed all those months ago.\" He pushed off the wall, with a smile. \"Eliza, I am in fact happy for you. Even if the young man is…- I offer congratulations if this does take place.\" They stood for a moment, looking at each other. Eliza searched his face, slightly confused by this acceptance. Maybe she had misread their situation. She linked his arm once again as they started to walk home. They did not speak. The vapour from their breath entangled into one before drifting away behind them.[Chapter 5] Ah it's been a long time. I hope you enjoy it. I apologise if there are any mistakes, late night writing eh? Tell me what you think, I know where it is all heading. So it had begun. A gaggle of girls gossiping in his home, his lounge! It made him writhe with anger. \"Pickering! If they don't cease that infernal noise I'll have no choice but to go in there and silence them with a throttle!\" Higgins threw down his pen, pacing the room. \"Higgins, they're just talking, let them be.\" \"I can hear them sniggering, there's no doubt they're laughing about me! Why did we let her come back? Now she's a fully fledged painful woman!\" \"You really ought to calm down Higgins. This sort of stress won't be any good for your health. Sit back down and we'll carry on.\" Pickering offered one of his calming smiles whilst gesturing Henry back to his desk. Henry did not turn back to the desk; instead he headed to the door. \"I will go speak with the ghastly creatures. It's my home, not some coffee house. They can take their natter elsewhere!\" With that he exited the study; Pickering was left alone not knowing how to react. Henry made his way to the door of the room full of women, he stopped before entering as he heard them speaking. \"So do tell me Eliza, has he asked you yet?\" It was the voice of one of her friends, one which he didn't bother to remember a name. \"Not officially, but he has made suggestions at the idea.\" Henry's ears perked up as he heard Eliza. Another girl let out an irritating laugh. \"What good is suggesting? You have to be more forward with him; a man with his wealth must be snatched up!\" Yet another girl piped up, it was her promiscuous friend, there's always one. \"I say you seduce him that will make him pick up the pace!\" \"Don't be so crude!\" A voice answered in response. \"I wouldn't know the first rule of seduction.\" Eliza answered lightly. Henry pressed his head against the door, wanting to hear clearer. Pickering entered the hall and merely observed Henry without a word before heading up the stairs. \"Well, you've got the beauty for it. You just need to make him mad about you.\" Answered the promiscuous one. Henry was becoming more and more enthralled by the conversation. \"Little touches, glances and bare shoulders.\" The girls giggled at this statement. He grimaced. This is exactly what women talk about, useless nonsense. \"You attract all the men Eliza, even poor little Freddy isn't over you yet.\" \"That grumpy professor sometimes can't help but gawp at you! Seems he has some feelings after all!\" They all joined in, having another group giggle. \"Tonight I'll be meeting Stuart again; perhaps he will bring it up?\" The lightness in Eliza's voice contrasted to the piercing noise of the other women. Henry didn't want to hear anymore, he knocked and entered the room. Some of them stared; some of them forced polite smiles. He stood there for a moment before speaking. \"I understand that you hyenas have nothing better to do with your time, but Colonel Pickering and I wish to work. We cannot do so with your hellish noise.\" They had all remained silent. Eliza simply nodded her head; he looked at her for a moment before exiting. Later on in the evening Henry heard Eliza greeting Stuart at the door. \"Good evening Miss Doolittle, may we?\" Stuart bowed his head, gesturing to the lounge. As the pair entered the room Eliza could feel his eyes on her, she had worn a light gown, with some of her shoulder on show. Elegantly, she sat herself down on the chair and to her surprise he seated himself next to her. They exchanged the usual pleasantries; Eliza used this time to observe him in an intimate space. He was not bad to look at, she liked his bright face. He certainly was not as clingy or dependant as Freddy. If she married this man she would be set up for life. Eliza began not to concentrate as he told her about his day, instead she was weighing up these thoughts in her head. Everyone had advised her it was a good match; even Mrs. Higgins had pushed the idea. She wouldn't have to work; she would become a lady of leisure. It would be a wise choice; she couldn't be irrational or picky after how far she has come. \"Eliza, I am aware we have not known each other for that long a time...\" She felt her heart quicken, she could feel the anticipation, this was it. \"I feel however, that I've come to quite enjoy your company. From the moment we first met I fell for you.\" Eliza forced a smile; she wanted to skip this entire part, as she was too confused about her own feelings and didn't want to hear his. \"What I am trying to say is I want to offer you my hand in marriage. I want to make you my wife.\" He searched her face for a response. For a moment Eliza could feel Henry on the other side of the house, she felt his presence. It made her sad to realise that he was her first thought before answering. Stuart hesitated at her silence. \"I am willing to ask your father, or possibly the Professor, for permission?\" \"My father is away in America.\" \"Not a problem! Surely Professor Higgins will be able to provide a blessing on his behalf?\" He was already stood up, a smile beaming on his face. Eliza offered a small smile in return, nodding as she let him exit. The ball was in Henry's court. Henry was interrupted by a knock at the door. \"Who is it? Go away, I'm busy.\" \"Professor, it's Mr. Lismore, may I speak with you a moment?\" \"If you must, but I really don't need any time wasters.\" Stuart entered the study, bowing slightly to Henry in a greeting. Henry just stood waiting to hear what he had to say. \"May we sit down sir?\" Henry merely grunted and shoved himself down onto a sofa. Stuart sat in the opposite one. \"I understand that you are a very important figure in Eliza's life. That is why I have come to ask for your blessing on something.\" \"Yes yes, get to the point will you. I really have things to do.\" Henry had nothing to do; he just didn't want to drag the process out. \"I want your blessing for my marriage proposal to Eliza.\" Hearing the words straight out like that sent a pain down deep into his gut, a pain he wasn't aware that he could ever get. He didn't want to lose her; he didn't think she wanted to leave him. But he knew that he couldn't keep her at the house forever, like a doll, he had made her for better things. \"My blessing? I'm not her father. It's not up to me who she marries. I couldn't care less if she married a street performer.\" \"It would mean a lot to both of us sir.\" \"ELIZA!\" Stuart jumped at Henry's shout, he was not prepared. After a few moments Eliza had entered the room. \"Eliza, you want to marry this boy?\" Henry had created an awkward situation for all of them, Eliza simply nodded. \"Ah there we go! All finished! Congratulations! Now you can all get out of here and leave me to some peace.\" Eliza remained looking at Henry; he had put on his usual manner. She hoped there would be a dramatic rejection and declaration. Nothing. \"Thank you sir, I am much obliged. I will bid you both goodnight.\" When Stuart had left Henry finally spoke once again. \"I thought you were above selling yourself.\" \"Don't start. What else is there in my future?\" He remained sat down, leaning back with his arrogant manner. \"Ah I suppose you are right Eliza, beggars can't be choosers.\" She looked hurt by this statement so he changed the tone. \"I must say, it will be highly inconvenient not having you around this house.\" Eliza slowly moved around the room, coming to terms with her new path in life. She stared at the back of his head as he spoke. \"It's more than that actually; it may even make me sad. I mean you are much better at remembering appointments than Mrs. Pearce. My papers will all be in a mess. I will be a mess.\" He stiffened as he felt her hand run along the side of his head, pushing through his hair. \"I have to.\" Her soft voice made him ache; he didn't pull back from her touch. She crouched down behind his chair, simply leaning her head onto his shoulder. Henry tried his best to maintain composure. \"Yes, it is the most sensible and appropriate choice. I am sure you will do well, a young couple...\" \"I will miss you, Henry.\" His eyes closed for a brief moment as she used his name. Eliza stood up, resting a hand onto his shoulder. Henry patted her hand, holding it only for a moment. \"It will be difficult without you. I can say I will miss you and Colonel Pickering will too.\" She peered down at him realising she couldn't fully break him out of his shell; she had only seen brief glimpses of his being. He just didn't have the courage to break out for her. Neither of them could commit themselves to a declaration of feeling. Neither of them wanted to take the risk. The idea that they wanted each other more than anything in the world seemed to have pushed them furthest apart. Henry sat holding his head in his hands after she had left the room; he knew he had lost her. He would have to watch as his own creation moved into something out of his grasp. The chimes of church bells haunted his mind.[Chapter 6] Hello. It's been long I know. Main reason I'm continuing is thanks to the reviews, otherwise, as you know, there would be no motivation. Here is a little chapter to keep you going..brace yourself because I have a great idea hatched. Do keep reviewing or else I will be lazy. Apologise for errors if there are any, I've uploaded using my phone! R&R; you delicious cabbage leaves. \"I hate weddings.\" Henry was stood peering through a telescope, angling his body rigidly. \"Ah yes we know.. All part of the old bachelor act. Hate weddings, hate women, hate birthdays, hate parties..\" Pickering let out a cloud of smoke as he laughed, he then continued to puff the pipe. Henry spoke back to Pickering, still engrossed in the telescope. \"It is not an act, it is all strictly true. I despise most occasions..\" He finally plucked his face from the lense, smiling to the Colnel. \"I do not hate women.\" \"There's a man with flesh and blood under all that disdain?\" \"Some of them are nice to look at.\" \"What do you think of Eliza's boy?\" Henry lent his elbow on the telescope, thinking up a reply. \"Well, he insists on calling by most days, he has a whole marriage to see her, the boy will become tired of her face.\" \"Ah but it's Eliza, what man would become tired of seeing her face!\" \"Yes, yes, don't start. Maybe you should have married her?\" Pickering laughed once again, their conversation was interrupted by the sound of the door bell. Both men looked towards the clock on the wall. \"It can't be the Stuart? Calling at this hour?\" Pickering glanced to Henry who was waiting to see who had arrived. They became aware of Stuarts voice as he spoke to Mrs. Pearce. Before they knew it, the young man was being presented to their office door, holding a hat nervously between his hands. \"Lismore my boy, what brings you here at this hour?\" Pickering offered a friendly smile to Stuart. \"I thought it would be good to spend a little time with you gentlemen. Call it a nightcap.\" Henry finally chimed in at this point. \"Pre wedding nerves bringing out the drinker?\" Stuart gave an uneasy fake laugh as he looked between the two men. Some silence lingered after which was broken by Pickering pouring out the brandy. \"Are you looking forward to your marriage then?\" The Colnel smiled after his generic question. \"Of course, yes.\" Stuart took a gulp of the drink before continuing. \"Especially the wedding night.\" He looked between the two older men with a grin on his face. \"Now let's not start with vulgarity.\" Henry seated himself into the lounge chair. \"Higgins has issues with any form of intimacy.\" Pickering gave one of his reserved smiles whilst swiftly changing the subject. \"So tell me, is all the organisation going to plan?\" Henry switched off at this point, he did not want to hear any more. The mention of Eliza coupling with this clueless young man made him ache for a moment. He has no issue hiding any true feelings from the world, but late at night those thoughts of regret crept in. Henry looked up towards the ceiling as if trying to see Eliza asleep in her bed. He felt lost of any former control, it seemed things were taking their own path. \"She is indeed a delight to live with!\" Pickering was still nattering away to the young man. Henry stood out of the chair and proceeded towards the door. \"Goodnight gentlemen, I am too tired to listen to your droaning.\" With that, Henry had left the room and was proceeding upstairs to bed. He didn't stop outside Eliza's door. He just glanced at it on his way up. It taunted him. On the other side of the door Eliza was kept awake by nerves and confusing thoughts. She felt comfort in hearing the familiar steps of Higgins retiring to sleep. She knew he would never even walk up to her door. But she noticed time to time, a minuscule delay in one of his steps, as if he had haulted for a moment. A moment in which they were both aware of the others prescense, but are both divided by it.[Chapter 7] Here's another, read and review. Not sure if the rating should be higher so be ware kiddies. There is some hardcore violence and drug abuse. Heh. Heh. Apologies if it's no good. Enjoy anyway. 27A Wimpole street was bursting with activity on the day before the wedding. Eliza's belongings were already being moved into her new residence and her friends marched around the house, ordering servants with last minute gown alterations. Mrs. Higgins joined the ladies in the reception room as they fiddled around with a box of jewlery. Eliza sat there as the other girls pushed rings onto her fingers and chains around her neck. She was like a toy doll, they were playing dress up. \"No no! The ruby!\" One of her friends screeched out loud. This made Eliza pay attention to what was going on. It also made Henry wince in the other room. At least her friends won't be around to make a racket anymore. He had decided he would not attend the wedding. He never went to them and he was not making an exception for Eliza. Henry Higgins sat silently, waiting, just waiting. At around 3.05pm the doorbell rang with a supposed special delivery. A maid was heard opening the door, then heading into the reception room. Eliza was presented with the largest bunch of flowers she had ever seen. Her eyes lit up with delight at the arrangement. Maybe marriage wasn't so bleak after all. \"Oh how romantic!\" Mrs. Higgins exclaimed as she looked on with delight. Eliza flicked off the small note, she unfolded it and began to read it privately. I did not buy them from you..but for you.. Higgins She felt her heart quicken, she folded up the note abruptly before putting on a forced smile for the other women. It made her happy to recieve the flowers but she also read it as an insult. He had reminded her of her past, of what he had taken her from. She was partly glad to be out of that house, they both had grown tired of the games. Higgins finally retired to his room at about midnight. He had not seen or spoken to Eliza since morning. He was also unsure whether or not the flowers had the desired impact. It didn't take him long to prepare for sleep and soon he found himself drifting off. He was awoken by a sudden knock on his door. Higgins sat up sharply in his bed, adjusting his pajamas. Before he could answer the door crept open. He could see Eliza stood in his bedroom doorway. Her small frame was illuminated by the landing lanterns left on. Henry was about to say something but she stepped into the room and quietly closed the door behind herself. By this point Eliza tried to keep herself calm, she could feel her hands shaking nervously at her sides as she walked to his bed. \"What the devil are you doing?\" Henry managed to mummer out in his usual tone. Eliza did not answer him and simply climbed into the bed beside him. \"Eliza? Have you lost any sense? I do not know what you are-.\" He stopped as her hand brushed against his cheek. She was laying on her side, facing him. She had already slotted the bed cover over herself. The moonlight and streep lamps from outside brightened the room slightly. Henry remained sat up straight, his mind was descending into a panick. He moved her hand away from his cheek, but kept a subconscious hold on it. \"Go back to your bed, now Eliza.\" Henry looked away from her, not moving however. Eliza was bored of the righteous facade he wore so often. \"Henry please..\" She shuffled herself up to him, leaning as she began to plant kisses on this neck. Henry Higgins was a man, a man who had resisted advances before, a man who could only admit defeat by giving in. Slowly he sank to lay down next to her. Not another word was spoken, they shortly began embracing, kissing eachother, speaking a thousand words with no sound. Both of them had lost all control and finally were just two people. It did not take long for Henry to take control. Eliza's nerves were calmed by his confidence. There was of course a short fumble of clothing, Henry tried not to stare at what he had dreamed of for too long. He started carefully, shifting above her, attentively working her into a comfortable state until the two began to move in a very passionate union. Both were not startled by the others eagerness. They were lost in eachother. They were equal, they were governed by their bodies, not minds, for once. The emotions driven by the situation brought them both to a united end. After it all had happened, they lay there side by side, holding one another. There was nothing to say as the pair drifted off to sleep. Henry was woken in the morning by a knock of the door. He looked straight to where Eliza had slept, she was no longer there. \"Professor, breakfast is ready\" The maid outside the door spoke. Henry was not listening. Had he dreamed it all? Surely not. There was no time for these thoughts, he got himself presentable for the breakfast table. Pickering was sat, already eating his breakfast whilst reading the newspaper. He watched Henry enter. \"Higgins, you look anxious this morning? I hope you haven't got pre-wedding nerves.\" Henry tried to come across composed, however the whole situation was distressing. \"The wedding. I had almost forget the thing. Damned nuisance if you ask me.\" \"There's an army of women here, getting her ready.\" Henry sat at the head of the table, hardly touching his breakfast. He zoned in and out as Pickering waffled on as usual. \"I say Higgins, are you still not coming today?\" Henry sent a long glance towards the ceiling. \"Perhaps I should.\"[Chapter 8] Well, it's only been about 11 months? Thanks for all of you who reviewed when I was in hiding, it's the reason I've written this. It is the largest of my chapters so far, a treat for you. I hope to hear all the feedback from you, old readers and new, it's the only reason I get back into this. As usual I am too lazy to proofread thorough, because as usual I decide to write chapter at 1am, I don't do things by the book man, I'm so alternative and arty dude. Enjoy! \"I am ever so glad you decided to come today Henry.\" His mother sent across a tight smile. \"I must say however, you are looking ghastly tired.\" Higgins did not reply. The rest of the journey was spent in silence as they rode to the ceremony. Once they arrived outside the church Henry noticed the beaming face of Stuart, dread slumped over him as they were waved over for a greeting. \"Good to see you old chap!\" Stuart patted Henry on the bicep whilst shaking hands. \"This whole charade is a splendid excuse for consumption of brandy.\" Henry couldn't think of anything else to say. \"Are you feeling nervous?\" Pickering inquired with a warm smile. \"Very. I have a lot to be anxious about. We had better be on inside, Eliza will arrive soon.\" The group of men entered the chapel. Henry was filled with distaste as he looked around the interior, he hadn't been in a church in years, he felt the eyes of the saints on him, as if they saw his thrusting last night. \"No.\" He thought. \"I can do this, I have to keep composed, don't smile.\" \"Over here Higgins!\" Pickering was waving a hand to Henry, he was sat at a row near the front of the altar, Henry reluctantly made his way over, lowering himself down next to Pickering. \"Did you have to choose a seat so near the front?\" Henry spoke in a hissed quiet tone, unable to hide his discomfort, this made Pickering frown. \"I say, it was what Eliza had requested, I don't see the harm in it, are you feeling quite alright?\" He studied the face of Henry, not used to this sort of display. The more that Henry began to realise he was not composed the less composed he became, he merely grunted in response to Pickering, adjusting the tight collar of his freshly pressed shirt, glancing left to right, he reached into his pocket, ruining the neatly folded handkerchief to wipe his brow. Soon the chapel began to fill up and Henry could sense it, he didn't like the voices of the various people, squinting at the mix of accents. His eyes drifted onto Stuart who was stood proudly at the front, the light through the church windows settled onto his brow - they were both sweating and nervous - but for the wrong reasons. Stuart was in anticipation, anticipation of consummation, whereas Henry was in anticipation in case of revelation for his own consummation. He shook these thoughts from his head as the church organ began to blare out through the echoed building. The entire congregation stood up, their bodies twisting as the large, impressive doors of the church opened, wanting to eat up the first glimpse of the bride. Mr. Doolittle stood proudly beside his daughter, holding onto her arm, showing her off as his most prized asset. Eliza wore a slim gown, hugging her figure, the sleeves slunk down to her wrists, lace left enough to the imagination, she also wore a removed smile, as if she were somewhere else, her eyes avoided the guests, instead drifting upwards, towards the clouds, towards the heavens. Henry felt a mist set inside his chest as he twisted his head to watch Eliza walking past, he couldn't resist taking all of her in with his eyes, of course she didn't look at him, he watched her pass by, joining hands with her now to be husband, her veil wafted like a hand waving goodbye. The ceremony was torturous for Henry but he had managed to keep himself on form, much easier than earlier, he made it his business to count the number of tiles behind the altar, his brain as always needed to be constantly stimulated. Nobody else realised Henry's lack of attention, as they were fully immersed in the emotional and sentimental moment taking place before them, plucking joy from it in a way Henry would never allow himself to do. What he had not taken into account was that it was not over when the ceremony had ended, it wasn't over when he had to watch Stuart plant a kiss on her lips, no, there was a reception to look forward to. By the time Henry, his mother and Pickering had reached the venue tables were already scarce. The reception was held in a large traditional wedding tent, decorated with great detail and clear expense, Henry wasn't interested in that, he had already spotted the location of a brandy bottle. \"How on earth does Eliza know all of these people?\" He asked whilst sitting with the pair at their table. \"Stuart's family and friends, also Eliza invited her friends, you know?\" Mrs. Higgins began to lay her napkin onto her lap. \"Yes, I know her friends, always round that house. At least we won't have that anymore, eh Pickering?\" He looked to his male companion with a smile asking for verification. \"What a bore it will be without young ladies around the house!\" Pickering returned with a small laugh. The evening drifted fast, just as fast as the brandy disappeared from the bottle, the food was enjoyable, however the two sociable creatures either side of him had engaged in deep conversations with the people they were sat next to. Henry had tried not to watch Eliza the entire evening but it was hard to look anywhere else, she lit up the room, he examined as different guests flocked around her, he saw how Stuart kissed her hand, passing her subtle touches. He slowly blinked, as his eyes were closed the brandy had started to make his head spin, deciding it best to stop, he pushed the glass away, slouching into the chair. Henry turned to listen to Pickering talking to the insufferable Judy Hutton, who was eyeing him up past Pickering's shoulders, like a piece of meat. He was distracted by a sharp tap on his ear. \"What the devil?\" Henry turned his head left, he saw white, saw some hips, moving his eyes up, it was Eliza. \"How many brandies have you had? Your eyes are in two different places!\" She was being playful. Henry hadn't attempted to speak since engulfing the alcohol, he cleared his throat, having his usual face of superiority. \"You see, Eliza, I - have had just enough.\" He threw a smile towards her, but instead she laughed, he couldn't understand why. \"Perhaps you would like some water? I can get some.\" She twisted on her heels, proceeding towards the beverage table. Henry frowned, confused by her statement, he was fine, he is always fine. Patting Pickering on the shoulder he pushed out of his seat, the alcohol misted over his brain suddenly, everything was harder to see and locate. \"This damn grass is very uneven..\" He muttered whilst following the duplicating figure of Eliza to the other side of the tent. Pickering glanced to Mrs. Higgins hoping she had not noticed the state of her son, thankfully she was engaged in thorough gossip and wine. \"I am fine, thank you Eliza..\" Henry had come to a halt directly behind her, his breath dancing on the back of her neck, towards her nose, she squinted at the strength of it. \"Henry, really, I've never seen you have so much brandy.\" She was pouring out a glass, twisting around her body before handing the water to him, he clasped his hand around it, gulping it down, taking her advice, as always. \"I am sorry, I am just making it more bearable, it makes people less tedious..\" His words were slightly slurred but still clear. Without warning from his brain he placed a hand onto her waist, she immediately pushed it away. It took Henry a few moments to process what had occurred, by then she wore a frown. \"Please go sit down Henry, before you embarrass us both.\" Eliza turned from him, he watched her walk back over towards Stuart, using the table for subtle support, he rested a hand there, gathering courage to move. Pickering had been watching, getting out of his seat he went to his friend's side. \"Higgins, the couple are leaving soon, so should we.\" Placing a hand on Henry's shoulder, he twisted the man's torso to view the departing couple. \"What? Already? I do not understand this whole charade, I do not.\" Henry was lead away by Pickering, watching for himself Eliza being lead away by her husband, husband, the thought boiled his brain. Eliza blinked away tears as she looked out of the car window, Stuart, ever attentive, wiped them, eager for her to be in a durable mood for what was to come. \"It's ok darling, you'll see them all soon, it's about us now, enjoying our time together, tonight..\" He tried not to linger on this thought \"And forever.\" Now she had to tackle the wedding night, now she had to consummate.[Chapter 9] A/N: It has been approximately 29,462,400 seconds since my last update. I apologise, mad life and suffering from severe block. I don't know what I think of this chapter, apologies if it is bad, but it's certainly got my ideas flowing again to continue this story on, let me know what you think honestly so I know where to take it. Thank you daydreaming87 for messaging me and making me carry this on. Enjoy. Stuart's hands shook as he opened the door to their new marital home, Eliza stood behind him, reluctant but also wishing he would speed up his actions. Once they were inside the couple were silent, she scanned the very impressive entrance hall. It was certainly much more modern than the Higgins residence. \"Do you like it?\" He took her hand, watching her face for an answer he wanted to hear. \"It is wonderful, Stuart.\" She gave his fingers a light squeeze. \"Would you like a tour?\" Stuarts voice became clearer and more affirmed. \"Actually. I am rather tired, would it be fine if we retired to bed?\" Silence hung in the air for a moment, their reflections in the flooring glanced upwards at them, almost waiting a reply. \"Yes of course, let me show you.\" He continued to grasp her hand, making their way up the overly grand set of stairs towards the hallway which held their marital chamber. The room was bigger than anything Eliza had ever seen for a bedroom before, it smelt a mixture of lavender and paint, the large bed loomed in the middle of the room, it's presence screaming at the couple. \"I will let you change, I will be in my own room, I can show you it tomorrow.\" Stuart withdrew his hand from hers and hastily exited the room. Eliza took a moment to walk around the room, opening the drawers and assessing the space that was all her own. All her own until she had to welcome him nightly into her room. Although it was not the first time she had had such relations, it certainly felt that way as she undressed herself, glad that he had not hired any help yet, another woman would have made the entire situation much more unbearable. She was in her undergarments, Eliza sat on the end of the bed. Unsure whether to call out or just to wait, everything seemed unsettlingly regimental. A nagging thought pricked the back of her mind, diminishing when he knocked on the door. \"Come in.\" Eliza called out, he entered the room, his silk pyjamas glowing. He stood for a moment, taken aback by her beauty, her form, she smiled back towards him. \"You look beautiful.\" Stuart sat his body down next to her on the bed, resting a hand onto her cheek. Eliza was less enthralled by taking the activity at such a slow pace, planting her lips onto his to initiate. Soon enough Stuart was positioned on top of her. The whole affair was not awful at all, he's certainly better than she had imagined. Pleasurable enough. It was not that he didn't know what he was doing, but something was not there, it felt frighteningly biological but not animalistic, satisfying but not fulfilling. Her mind finally drifted to him. Henry. 'I've ruined my married life.' She thought as Stuart rolled off of her, he had been holding himself back for an unsettling amount of time. The man cuddled into her, they slotted together, but there was no click. Meanwhile Henry stayed awake, matching the sick feeling in the stomach by consuming even more brandy, he wouldn't see her for a while, he imagined the couples' days of dances in bed and shadows joining in the night. He imagined his own nights, lacking in anything. Henry was disturbed by his feelings, trying to kill his mind with the brown liquid. That night he didn't make it to his bed, he couldn't lay there alone, his head sunk down on a pile of papers at his desk. Something had to change.[Chapter 10] Apologies once again for taking so long to update, it's your reviews and in some cases messages that make me keep coming back! Accept this long(ish) chapter as a belated Christmas gift. Your New Year gift will follow shortly. Enjoy! \"I'm not quite sure why you dragged me here Pickering. I would rather spend my Sunday doing something else.\" Henry tugged at his tie, staring forward. \"It would be rude to refuse, you haven't been out in weeks.\" Pickering rang the doorbell to the Lismore residence and the pair stood on the steps. The front door handle was a worn brass-face which stared back at Henry, he glanced at the exterior of the house, the paint was dull; and thick Ivy climbed high around the walls, growing seemingly towards the windows, he grimaced. The door was opened and the pair were greeted by a young maid who ushered them into the hallway, it was evidently newly decorated, Henry noticed the smell of purchased furniture, freshly cut flowers and felt the recently laid rugs on his shoes, evidently all making him nauseous. \"They're in the drawing-room.\" The maid smiled back towards the two men, Henry's ears pricked at her obvious London street accent. Once they entered the room they became aware of the various other guests at the dinner party, at that moment Stuart swept towards them, holding his hand out. \"Professor Higgins! Colonel Pickering! Welcome to our home, I am glad you could make it.\" \"Our pleasure indeed.\" Pickering patted the young man on the bicep as they shook hands. \"It's our first large dinner here, Eliza has been worrying all week. She'll be happy to see you both.\" Stuart glanced between the pair, his eyes eagerly tracing their faces. Henry raised a minute smile, bowing his head. \"I look forward to it.\" \"Help yourself to the drinks.\" Stuart gestured towards the trays of cocktails flowing around the room, Henry's eyes were drawn to the decanters of whiskey. As the people started to move out into the dining room Higgins and Pickering quickly took a glass off of the tray. Pickering sniffed his tall glass of liquid. \"What on earth is that?\" Henry pointed towards the bright blue substance in the Colonel's glass. \"I cannot say.\" Pickering gave a small sip as they followed the small group into the dining room. The room was laid out in complete splendor, the chandelier reigned over the table and shone brightly on the centerpiece silver platter. Henry observed the other people in the room and started to feel old. Everyone seemed to know each other and was involved in deep conversations as they sat at their places. He noticed one man his age and a much younger woman he presumed was his wife; Henry drained most of the whiskey in his glass. Eliza was nowhere to be seen. \"I do not think we should have drank those drinks that quickly.\" Pickering placed his glass down onto the place mat. Henry turned around after a pat on the shoulder. \"It's my favourite couple!\" Eliza was standing behind the pair wearing an elegant evening gown, Henry swiveled in the chair to take note of her dress, it was an off-white colour, it rippled and flowed down towards the marble flooring, his eyes drew towards the black part around her chest, he looked away. The gentlemen stood out of their chairs and Eliza revealed her hand towards Henry. He carefully placed his own hand towards hers and brought it up close towards his mouth, lingering for a moment as they locked eyes, she could feel his breath tickle her skin, he laid a small kiss and let go. \"Thank you for having us. I must say, Pickering and I are rather in awe of these boggling drinks you are serving. Are they poisoned?\" Henry stuffed his hands into his pockets. \"They're cocktails. I made sure there was brandy and whisky for you though. I had better sit down as the first course will arrive soon.\" Eliza smiled and slowly drifted away from the two men to a seat at the far end of the table. Henry's observation of her was halted as the food was brought in. He and Pickering initially spoke to one another as the other guests picked at their plates, flirting amongst themselves. After the second course Henry had drained his fourth glass of whisky, he turned to the listen to Stuart as he spoke loudly at the head of the table. \"We are heading for the Golden Age, the next few years will be the greatest for England.\" Stuart raised his glass of wine and a some other guests joined him a toast. Henry scoffed loudly at the end of the table and rolled his eyes, he looked down when heads turned towards him, his fork moved the gravy-drenched beef slice on his plate. \"Professor! You disagree with me?\" Stuart smiled, this man seemed sickeningly optimistic. Eliza stopped talking to a friend at her side when she noticed the exchange across the table. \"I just think that's a risky outlook to take.\" Henry patted his napkin around his mouth before continuing. \"You don't know what is going to happen in the future.\" \"Why would I think otherwise?\" Stuart took a sip of the wine. \"Things are changing my boy. We're constantly at a rift with the Irish, women are throwing themselves under horses, Americans are flooding in and we've got workers striking left, right and center. I'm not quite sure how this is golden.\" There were mummers at the table, Pickering forced a smile. \"What's wrong with Americans?\" A shrill American woman called out, sending a shudder down Henry's spin, she followed it with a piercing laugh. \"Well, you're right about the suffragettes. Nothing but a damned nuisance if you ask me, in the streets when a fellow is trying to get to work, really makes you wonder if there's something not quite right with these women.\" He sent Henry another smile as some men at the table nodded in agreement; he continued to eat to stop the conversation. \"I think it's brave of them, earlier on the girls and I were talking about perhaps going to one of their rallies.\" Eliza chimed in. Stuart laughed, almost choking on his food. \"Don't be absurd dear! Why on earth would you do that?\" \"Never discuss politics at the dinner table!\" Pickering laughed whilst drinking some more of the newly discovered cocktail. \"Why shouldn't we have the same rights as men?\" Eliza was staring at Stuart. \"It's not natural\", Stuart's voice raised uncomfortably, \"Now, we were saying..\" He placed a hand on Eliza's as she looked down towards her plate. \"Actually, as much of a bachelor that I am, I rather think that women are most interesting creatures, just not to marry. My point was that it's an awful shame they need to kill themselves to prove a point to us. On the contrary, Eliza would make an impressive public speaker.\" Henry smiled towards her. The other guests at the table had fallen silent, some were concentrating hard on their food whilst the less tactful were watching the back and forth between the men. \"If I let her go to these meetings and protests, she'd start to think all those ridiculous ideas, it's just not correct for wives. Besides, she knows hardly anything about politics.\" Stuart pointed his fork towards her whilst speaking as if she was not there. \"Eliza! Tell him how we discussed the build up to the Boer War all those months ago!\" Henry lent back into his seat, having finished his meal. Stuart cast his eyes towards Eliza as she went to open her mouth, she shut it again as his brow tightened to throw her a silent warning. The table was awkwardly silent. \"She doesn't know a thing, that pretty little head is full of fashion and gossip.\" Stuart rubbed Eliza's hand with a smile. \"If you let her speak then perhaps you would know.\" Henry felt his face grow warm. The smile from Stuart's waxy face shrunk. \"I think in my house I should be the one to say when my wife speaks.\" \"Henry, it's alright.\" Eliza quickly spoke out. \"I don't think it is damned alright, frankly I think your views are uncomfortably awful.\" He untucked the napkin from his shirt. Pickering murmured a warning into Henry's ear. \"You have no right to comment. What do you know about women anyway? You've never been married and at your age.\" It was evident on Stuart's face that he regretted his statement straight after it had left his mouth. The other guests were wide-eyed. Henry stood up out of the chair. \"I can tell you this, Eliza is not like other women; in which you cast such blanket opinions. She probably knows more about the world than you do my dear boy, with your private school childhood and parents that put you up in this house you didn't even earn. I am only speaking for her because you won't let her. I've had enough of this disaster of a discussion, I don't need to waste my time talking to morons.\" He left the room. Pickering watched in horror. \"He's not been feeling too well these past weeks, do forgive him.\" As he walked into the empty drawing room Henry was unsure of what had come over him, running a hand through his hair he lent onto the fireplace. He could hear the conversation slowly resume among the other guests and dessert being brought out. Damn, he missed the cake. \"Henry-\" He turned to see Eliza moving towards him. \"Listen, Eliza, if you've come to scold, I will be leaving shortly after Pickering has enjoyed his desert.\" She placed a hand onto his arm. \"Thank you for standing up for me.\" His face displayed his surprise. \"I did not realise he was this awful Eliza. He's not a wet blanket like that other fellow you almost chose.\" \"He means well, he just holds different beliefs to you. I want to talk to..I've wanted to, about,\" She could not help but lower her voice, \"What happened between us.\" \"You know what happened.\" Henry swallowed. \"No use discussing it in your marital home, Eliza.\" \"I know. I just - miss you.\" Her hand limply dropped from his arm. Henry tried his best to remain composed. \"Don't get like that. Please, it's rather off-putting.\" \"Won't you tell me how you feel?\" Eliza peered up at him, her eyes almost tugging words out of his mouth. Henry looked at the door. \"I do not think this is the right time for that now.\" \"For once will you just stop. Let me know and I will leave you to your own life.\" \"No.\" He let out a sigh, raising a her chin with his hand. \"I can't seem to allow that to happen, it seems I quite like inflicting agony on myself.\" She turned her cheek, gently beginning to kiss his finger tips. Henry managed to mutter her name. She moved closer to him, enthralling him in a kiss, his facade melting away. \"I want you again.\" Henry surprised himself with this exclamation that seemed to spring from somewhere deep inside, perhaps his liver. Eliza broke away as he began to kiss her neck. \"Later on, when everyone is drinking, we can go upstairs, pretend I am showing you the books?\" She sounded nervous. Henry straightened up, composing himself, he rested his hands together at the front of his trousers, slightly embarrassed. \"That sounds like an awful excuse.\" \"Just - just come back and apologise, for me? I'll think of something later.\" He watched her swan away in a hurry, her unfounded paranoia made him proud, what a wily, smart young woman. An ordinary man would have left the dinner party then and there, making a morally right choice, but in these past months Henry Higgins had certainly discovered that when it came to Eliza, he was not in any way an ordinary man.[Chapter 11] Here's your New Year's gift. The party continues.. Maybe a bit NSFW? Just saying that in case. Hope you enjoy, let me know, if you don't let me know that too. Henry and Stuart had made amends swiftly as trays upon trays of drinks were brought out for the guests, as the alcohol loosened inhibitions, Pickering and Higgins found themselves of interest to the others, although Miss Judy Hutton swiftly avoided them. \"You're a professor, my my, that's impressive, what of?\" A young lady piped up in the group gathered with the two. \"Phonetics.\" Henry pretended to show interest in the conversation with the young people but his eyes could not help but drift over to Eliza at the other side of the room. \"What's that?\" \"It's the study of speech.\" \"Let me tell you, Higgins is one of the best around!\" Pickering smiled at the others as they sipped their drinks, music gently swung in the background. \"You do flatter me Pickering, it's probably why I still keep you around.\" He started to watch the other men in the room, noticing that they too would often glance at Eliza, he could have sworn she returned their glances. He mumbled. \"Pardon?\" A blonde haired young man looked at Henry. \"Nothing, nothing. What is it that you do?\" He welcomed the man's long job description, watching a tall gentlemen with glasses approach Eliza. \"...I run all the accounts in that department and often take over two or three at once, it's very taxing one might say!\" The group laughed at the man's joke, Pickering very loudly. Henry watched the four-eyed man talk quietly into Eliza's ear, he watched her giggle and pat his chest. \"I need another drink.\" Henry rudely interrupted the ongoing conversation, they all looked at him as he went off to grab a glass off a tray. \"I can show you the books now.\" Eliza appeared once again after some time, he jolted and spilt a bit of his drink. \"You need to stop creeping up on me like that.\" Henry forced a smile. Eliza looked around the room to see that no one else was fussed about what they were doing. \"We don't have much time, let's go before I change my mind.\" Henry gestured for her to go first, watching from behind as she led him through the hallway and up the staircase. The dress she was wearing just flowed over the newly laid red carpet on the steps, he felt that if he stepped back enough perhaps it would tickle his nose. The library was sparsely furnished, only a desk and some shelves but they covered one of the walls, nearly almost full with books, he was taken for a moment, strolling over to see what they had in their collection. Henry picked up one of the books, still deciding whether or not this was a wise idea. \"Voltaire? Is this yours?\" He sent across a smirk to her as she walked over to him. \"I went and bought these days ago, I haven't read them yet obviously, but I did choose them.\" Eliza plucked the book from his hand and lent back on the shelf, she ran her other hand on his tie. \"I can lend you some more..\" Henry was dragged towards her, \"Are you sure about this Eliza?\" His eyes set on her face. \"Yes.\" She slid the book back into place. The two began to kiss against the bookshelf, Eliza's hands quickly began to move towards his trousers. \"Sit on the desk.\" Henry muttered to her. The two broke apart and fumbled their way towards the old wooden desk, Eliza moved some pens and sat on the edge, they continued to kiss once again. Henry moved the silk waves of the dress up her thighs. She, after a small struggle, had eliminated the barrier of his trouser's fly. \"Quickly Henry..\" Eliza spoke through the kiss. \"Alright, alright, don't start.\" The two began their long awaited union, Henry struggled to keep his breath under control and at a low volume, resting his chin over her shoulder, pulling her closer and closer with each of their movements. He puffed out suddenly. \"Am I the only one?\" His hot breath and speech tickled Eliza's ear, startling her. \"Wha- what do you mean?\" \"The only one..other than him.\" Henry could not bring himself to say Stuart's name in his current compromising position. Eliza slowed herself in disbelief, trying to lean back to see his face. \"Of course, I don't understand -\" He struggled to talk coherently, clasping her hips closer at this point. \"I see them look at you, talk to you..\" \"I'm yours, Henry.\" Eliza could say no more after this as he moved with more urgency and impact than before. The two were lost once again in each other, eventually coming to a joint finale after 10 minutes. Henry lingered for a moment, catching his breath whilst leaning on her shoulder, he buried his head into her hair as she planted a few kisses on the back of his neck. \"We need to go back down.\" She gently moved him away, trying to get down off of the desk. He politely took a few steps back, quickly doing his trousers back up with shaky hands, she walked towards him; sorting his hair out as he stood watching her in silence. \"Is everything alright?\" She studied his face and rested her hand on his cheek. \"This situation. You realise you cannot jeopardise what you have now?\" \"What do you mean?\" She moved her hand away from him. \"I mean, you are married, neither of us can afford a scandal.\" \"Let's not get into that now. It's a our own secret.\" Eliza fixed her dress, looking rather like she did before she entered the room. Henry watched her chew on her bottom lip, suppressing her anxiety. \"Madness, madness.\" Henry moved towards her; they reunited once again in a longing departure kiss. Unfortunately they did not notice the gentle knock on the library door, by the time they did, the door was opened.[Chapter 12] Sorry I disappeared again. Apologies if it's no good. Your reviews keep me coming back and keep the blood of this story pumping. \"Eliza - my sweet 'art!\" Eliza's father was stood in the doorway, he was sporting a creased suit and dusty dress shoes, his smile soon dropped from his face once he had clocked on to the pair. Henry quickly pulled away from her, his wide eyes darting towards the opened door. There was an excruciating silence, Eliza felt as if the whole world had been muted, the sounds of the gathering below had diminished through the door. She watched as Henry suddenly excused himself to hurry away, she glanced across to her father. \"You surprised me.\" She couldn't muster up anything else to say. Mr. Doolittle removed his sunken hat from his head, scrunching it up in his hand. \"I heard that you and your husband was having a party, I thought I would pop by, since I'm around.\" \"Help yourself to the free champagne?\" Eliza tried to edge her way over to the door. \"Say, what was that going on with the Professor there?\" She hoped he didn't see. Henry found himself stood next to Pickering, he glanced around the room, he was sure everyone knew, he discreetly tried to smell his shoulder, could they smell her on him? \"Ah! There you are Higgins! I've got a scotch for you, I was wandering around like a drunkard with two drinks!\" Pickering edged the scotch towards Henry's shaking palms. \"Thank you.\" He quickly drained some of the liquid, attempting to wash the taste of her off his tongue. \"Did Mr. Doolittle find you both? He arrived shortly after you went up to see the books, drained a lot of the drink!\" \"Yes, he found us.\" Henry gulped down the rest of the scotch in the glass. He watched as Eliza made her into the room, accompanied by her father, who wore a proud grin on his face. The pair conversed with the other house guests, Mr. Doolittle bowed deeply on meeting each of them, this made Henry grimace. \"I think we ought to go, the alcohol here is pouring too freely.\" Higgins pulled his tie left to right, trying to loosen it, he felt an overwhelming heat lingering in his face. \"My, my Higgins! You're not one to turn down a drink?\" The colonel thrust his glass around Henry's face. \"I know, but I've had too much scotch my friend.\" He consequently left the empty decanter on a nearby side table, he briefly glanced to the photograph of Eliza and Stuart that was already resting for the view of the guests. Henry saw that there was no one waiting on the door, he seized the chance and made his way towards it with a reluctant Higgins in tow. As he was fumbling with his thick coat he felt a hand land on his left shoulder. \"In a rush there Professor?\" Eliza's father was smiling next to Stuart who was holding a glass of champagne. \"I think I have come down with something.\" He replied sheepishly, avoiding their eyes. \"Professor Higgins, Mr. Doolittle here was just talking about hunting? Do you hunt? This weekend a few of us are going to the country, a boys outing so to speak. Would yourself and the Colonel there like to join us?\" Stuart kept his hand on Henry's shoulder. \"That sounds wonderful!\" Pickering chimed up. Henry mustered a small nod whilst trying to rush out of the door, he could feel the leer of Mr. Doolittle on this back. Eliza was sat at her dressing table, one of her fingers fiddled with her sapphire earring as she stared at the mirror, there was a knock at the door. \"Come in!\" She sat up quickly. It was Stuart, he wandered over to her with his robe string trailing on the carpet. \"Did you have a good evening? You looked lovely.\" She could feel his fingers slowly start massaging into her shoulders. \"It was very enjoyable. Thank you.\" Eliza smile up at him. \"All for you.\" Stuart mumbled as he began to kiss along the nape of her neck, she wondered if he felt her stiffen. After a couple of minutes she spoke up. \"I am awfully tired, I think I must have drank too much of the champagne too!\" She tried to move away but he kept his hands on her. \"Well, let's lie down then.\" Stuart took her by the hand but less than gently tugged her towards the bed. \"Stuart - I can't.\" Eliza's feeble shoves seemed not to register to him. He took her firmly by both shoulders. \"I threw you a party, a duty as your husband, now you must perform your duty as my wife.\" Her eyes searched his face and then looked down at the floor. He lifted up her chin. \"It will be quick.\" Stuart eased her down on the bed as she silently submitted. After he had finished and rolled off he pulled his pyjama bottoms back up. \"You know, I want to start a family soon?\" He turned to Eliza who was staring at the ceiling. Eliza forced a smile. \"I know.\" \"It means we have to try, it's work and it's your duty. I don't want to have a situation like earlier.\" Stuart's hand brushed her forehead briefly as he turned out the lamp. \"Goodnight.\" She drifted to sleep on her back as Stuart faced away from her.[Chapter 13] A/N: It has been a while, let me know what you think. It's good to be back. Stuart stood staring at Henry as he slotted the bullets into the shotgun, a smile came over his face. Henry gulped. \"Well, I must say this was a brilliant idea! It has been too long since we have spent time together, just us gents.\" Stuart petted his Curly Coated Retriever who had been growling at Henry for most of the excursion. \"It takes me back, also good to get this old boy out of his room!\" Pickering slapped Henry on the shoulder, bringing him back to life. \"Yes, nothing better.\" Henry smiled, tipping his hunting cap to the other men. There was only the sound of the beaters making their way through the dense woods, the group got their guns ready, Henry was slowest, keeping a peripheral eye on Stuart to his right. Suddenly, there was a shout. The birds soared through the air above them, a flurry of gunfire took over the field, Henry could hear Eliza's father laughing in the distance at the end of the formation. It was over, he had missed. A roar of delight erupted from Stuart, he and Mr. Doolittle were patting each other on the back as the pickers-up and dogs went to retrieve the game. Pickering turned to Henry, \"Are you certain that you are feeling fine?\" \"I am feeling absolutely splendid, a lovely day out, why I -\" Henry's lies were interrupted by Stuart clasping both hands onto his shoulders. \"Did you see that Professor?\" He smiled like a son looking for approval from his father. Henry simply bowed his head in acknowledgment. \"I think hunting is almost like winning a woman? Some of us hit and some of us miss, better luck next time for you.\" Henry was dealt yet another pat on the shoulder, he could also feel the burning stare of Mr. Doolittle on his cheek. The dog came and laid down a bloodied, dead grouse at their feet, Mr. Doolittle scooped it up. \"Look at the one Stuart hit! Ain't she something? All his now! Maybe you can buy it off him though if you're hungry?\" Mr. Doolittle rattled the bird corpse near the faces of Pickering and Higgins, the rest of the group looked on. Eliza sipped the tea whilst smiling around at the other wives and her friends. \"Well it has been over three hours, one would have thought they would have caught something by now!\" one of the women remarked, it was followed by hollow group laughter. \"Oh, you will learn to understand them, dear.\" An older lady replied swiftly whilst pushing her spectacles up her nose. \"Timing is not their forte.\" \"As we are on the topic, Eliza? How are things with Stuart?\" A friend piped up. Eliza was not ready for this question, she shook her head to dismiss thoughts of Henry. \"They are - - going very well.\" She smiled, forcing another a sip of tea that she did not want. The same friend piped up again \"When will we expect the pitter patter of little feet? You are the sweetest newlyweds I have ever seen! Can you imagine?\" Another friend chimed in \"You did choose well! The time you were spending with that musty old professor was becoming alarming.\" The women all nodded in agreement, the clinking of the teacups on the saucers pierced Eliza's eardrums. \"Being a married woman is an adventure!\" Eliza forced yet another smile. The door opened and everyone's heads turned as if for some relief, it was the maid. She scurried her plump frame around the table, replacing the pots of tea. Another servant came in to replenish the cakes and biscuits, everyone sat in silence. Eliza snatched part of a scone and stuffed it in her face, hoping no one saw. \"Oh my! Change in appetite?\" One of her friends announced loudly. The women at the table exchanged glances, there was a low mumble. Before Eliza had a moment to respond another woman joined in, \"Eating for two!\" Once again the door swung open, a servant announced. \"The gentlemen have returned.\" Eliza stopped listening as she felt her breathing quicken, the servant mumbled on about the timings for dinner. It would be the captured game. The spoils of the hunt. Henry liked to feel the pull of his tie, he slid the silk knot to below his neck. He then leaned closer toward the mirror, examining the accuracy. Suddenly he felt his eyes drift close, he accidentally imagined a familiar hand drift slowly down the tie, he felt it tug. Her hands. He slammed a hand down onto the table in front of him, the cologne bottles rattled loudly enough to alert Pickering in the next room. \"Everything alright in there Higgins?\" \"Yes, I dropped my scotch.\" Scotch. Henry poured himself a single shot, letting it linger for a few moments on his tongue, trying to gain courage. He took one last look at himself in the mirror, sliding a hand across the top of his head to pat down any stray hairs. After leaving the room he joined Pickering and the pair made their way down to dinner. Eliza was already sat, she was opposite to Stuart and next to her father, there was a space next to her, he hoped it was not his but hoped it was. There was a calm buzz to the room, married couples and Eliza's single friends seemed to make for an interesting mix, Henry observed the room and swiftly plucked a drink from one of the trays floating around. He was ushered next to Eliza. It had been months since their last encounter. \"Eliza.\" Henry found himself sticking out his hand. There was an awkward handshake as he lowered down into the seat. \"Professor Higgins.\" Throughout most of the dinner, they made little or no conversation with each other, although Stuart kept trying to engage Henry in the dialogue. \"I fancy a smoke rather than dessert, will anyone join me?\" Stuart peered around at the other men, a few nodded. Henry did not care, but then he felt his leg unwillingly brush against Eliza's. Even through the thickness of his trousers, he could feel the silk in her dress. Eliza felt this too, she turned her head away from him. \"I will sit this one out.\" Henry bowed his head to the smoking group as they left the table. The rest of the guest resumed their conversations, talking in excitement about the upcoming pudding. \"Have you been well?\" Her whisper in his ear made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. \"I am never well.\" Henry stared forwards as he muttered this to her. \"Why didn't you write to me?\" He let out a deep sigh. \"Stop being infantile.\" He felt her body stiffen even though they were not touching. Henry turned himself to face her. \"Eliza I -\" Plates of over-frosted sponge cake slices were placed in front of them. Eliza was then engaged in conversation with one of her friends. Henry took the thin fork and stabbed it into the center of his slice, the noise of this on the delicate plate caused stares from across the table. The overwhelming chatter started to hurt his eardrums, her friends' voices were just as loud and just as piercing as he remembered them. They were so unsoundly it was as if they were echoing, he tried to distract himself by fiddling with his watch, his cuffs and finally he loosened his tie slightly. She felt him touch her gently on the shoulder. \"Eliza, may I speak to you for a moment?\" The friend she was talking to gave him a cold glare. They both stood up and made their way into the hallway. He gently led her by her upper arm. \"Yes?\" Eliza stared at him. Henry darted glances up and down the hall. \"Your father, I know he is planning something, we have to solve this immediately.\" \"Why haven't you spoken to me?\" \"Please do not do this again.\" Henry stared at the wall behind her, not in her eyes. He felt her gently brush her hand with his, not holding. His eyes were drawn back to hers. Henry felt his chest tighten. \"Where can we go in this place?\" He felt the words coming out of his mouth but could not believe it. \"Nowhere. Not now.\" Eliza sounded sensible for once to him, this was a welcome shock, he wanted her. \"I would much prefer now.\" Henry pushed his hands into his pockets and lent onto the wall. They stared at each other, only feet apart, their increase in breathing was evident to an outside observer. Eliza ran her hand down his tie. \"This is new.\" She smiled at him. \"Let's meet outside by the stables at ten minutes past midnight.\" Henry had no idea what or why he was saying what he was. \"Professor!\" Stuart and the rest of the group and made their way down the hallway. There was a silence. ","Summary":" Henry felt a familiar warmth inside as he heard her voice. He sat back in his chair, listening to h"},{"Movie":"This Means War","Title":"Secrets","Author":"MandalorianHybrid","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10547657","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello All! This is just a little something that I hope you guys like. Enjoy! Chapter 1 Being grounded was awful, but there was nothing either agent could do about it. With their faces plastered all over the news, they had no choice but to wait until the software finished erasing their likenesses from the internet. Strange little thing it was, and frightening, too. A program had been created a few years ago that could target an individual's face and through facial recognition technology, find it and erase whatever file contained it. The process took a while, though. The gravity of their exposure wasn't entirely known, which meant they could be on desk duty for months as the program searched any and every file contained on the limitless void known as the internet. \"Seriously, it was a stupid idea man.\" FDR said from his desk across the room. Tuck looked up briefly to see his brother typing away at something on his computer. \"You should've known better.\" \"Yeah well, if I hadn't put the ad up, neither of us would've met Lauren.\" He replied indignantly. \"So, shut it.\" FDR chuckled to himself. Collins found out about Tuck's dating ad when she was informed the two had made it to the national news. She told him to immediately shut it down. He obliged. As he logged on, Tuck was met with an inbox full of women –and a couple men- making contact with him. He was flattered and a smirk began to form on his full lips. He scrolled through the messages, but didn't bother opening them. Their contents didn't really matter -he just wanted a count to show FDR that he wasn't as big a loser as his friend thought. After a few seconds -nearly a minute- he reached the bottom. Ninety-four. He'd received ninety-four winks, pokes, heys and various other greetings in the month he'd been away from the site. Granted eight were from men, but hey, he wasn't mad. Chuckling to himself, Tuck went back to the main page so he could begin the process of shutting down his profile. His eyes naturally glanced to the side where 'people he might like' were displayed. One in particular caught his attention. \"Holy shit…\" he mumbled to himself. The words barely made it past his lips when he clicked on the image and was presented with the profile of someone he hadn't seen in years. Tuck suddenly laughed forcing FDR to look at his brother curiously. \"What?\" he asked casually. \"Uh, remember that bird I knew a long time back?\" Tuck asked. He gripped the edge of his laptop and spun it around so his friend could see the picture. FDR shifted in his seat and leaned on his desk's surface so he could look as closely as possible without standing. \"Oh right,\" he nodded. FDR sat back and Tuck turned the screen back to him. \"Amy, or Amanda… what's her name again?\" \"Angela.\" Tuck replied sarcastically. FDR knew her name. Hell, the man had hit on her a handful of times before she disappeared. \"She's back in town.\" He continued. FDR glanced out of the corner of his eye and noticed Tuck writing something down. He smiled to himself and turned his attention back to his work as though he hadn't been spying. He knew what Tuck was doing. Having no choice but to erase the site, Tuck was writing down her email address before deleting his profile. \"Didn't you guys date or something?\" FDR asked leisurely. Tuck didn't speak, but glowered through his lashes at his brother. FDR caught the action and immediately had trouble fighting the smile. \"What?\" he defended. \"I'm just asking.\" \"You're being an ass.\" Tuck said under his breath as he finished deleting the site. FDR chuckled, \"It's not my fault you couldn't close the deal.\" \"We were friends.\" He snapped exhaustedly, as though he'd been repeating the statement a thousand times over instead of saying it only once. \"Let it go.\" \"Whatever you say, man.\" FDR said mostly to himself. \"Whatever you say.\" Tuck grumbled his insults, but didn't speak them out loud. It'd been years since he'd seen or heard from Angela. Many years, in fact. It was a nice surprise seeing her –even if it was in picture form- after so long. Once the site was gone, Tuck opened his email account and began to type a message. It was short and to the point. He didn't know what else to really say and decided the basics were the only important thing. So he asked how she was, how long she'd been in town and if she was interested in grabbing some coffee to catch up. He sat back and eyed the message for a moment or two. It was three lines long and somehow he felt like he'd come on too strong. It was a ridiculous thought, but one he had trouble ignoring. His index finger hovered over the mouse, hesitating to press the send button when he felt something shift behind him. No sooner than Tuck turned to see FDR behind him, his partner reached forward and sent the message. \"Wha… what the hell?\" Tuck snapped. \"Well, you didn't look like you were going to do it.\" FDR replied. He walked back around the desk and towards his to grab his jacket. \"Come on. Time to go home.\" \"What?\" Tuck twisted in his seat to eye the clock. \"Yeah,\" FDR nodded sarcastically. \"You've been staring at that thing for twenty minutes. Jesus, you're just asking for coffee.\" \"Yeah but,\" Tuck stood and threaded his arms through his jacket. \"You think Katie'll be okay with it?\" \"It's coffee.\" FDR replied in a deadpan voice. \"Besides, weren't you two dating when you knew this chick?\" \"Right…\" He nodded to himself before asserting his statement. \"Right.\" FDR shook his head and chuckled to himself as he waited for Tuck to shut off his office computer and grab his laptop. He fought the urge to call the Englishman an idiot and instead kept his mouth closed as they left. In the back of his mind, Tuck kept wanting to check his email during his dinner with Katie and Joe. The two were taking things slow, getting to know one another again, so they were having dinner at her house with their son. But his mind was elsewhere. He kept wondering if one of those little numbers in the corner of the email icon on his phone were from Angela. After tucking his son in and saying farewell to his ex-wife, Tuck walked to his car. Once inside, he pulled his phone out and checked the messages. Sure enough, second from the top, was a response from Angela. He smiled wide and set the phone down in the passenger seat. He didn't want to linger in front of Katie's house to write an email. That just seemed a bit rude. He did, however, revisit the email when he made it home. Tossing his keys onto his island, Tuck reached for his phone and again sifted through the messages to find hers. He ducked into his fridge for a beer and opened her email. \" Tucker! \" was in the opening line and forced him to chuckle. He set the phone down on the island and leaned over it to read as he opened his beer. \"Long time no see. I'd love to go for coffee. Give me a call when you can. 818-555-1342. ~Angela.\" He didn't bother waiting long. After a glance to his clock, Tuck decided he might as well give her a call immediately. Honestly he was just excited. He remembered Angela being funny and someone he liked hanging out with. Granted time can alter memories, so there was a chance he was building the memory up more in his mind than it had been in reality, but he doubted it. The phone rang for a moment before she finally answered. \" Hello?\" a young woman answered in an accent akin his own. \"Angela?\" he asked tentatively. \" Tuck!\" she chimed, the declaration soon followed by a giggle. \" How are you? My god, it's been forever.\" \"I know.\" He chuckled. \"I'm uh, I'm good. You, how are you?\" He fumbled briefly over his words and hated it. Others found it charming and endearing, but he hated it most of the time. \" I'm good.\" She laughed. \" Wow, what are the odds, hm?\" \"I know what you mean.\" He said. Tuck took a sip of his beer and headed into his living room to sit. \"So, what've you been up to?\" \" Nothing really. I've just moved back a month ago.\" \"Here to stay?\" \" For the time, yeah. My wings have been clipped, so I'm seeking alternative employment.\" He chuckled. When he first met her, Angela was a flight attendant -always bouncing around from city to city, country to country. Keeping her pinned down once seemed impossible. \"Must be driving you mad.\" He teased. \" A bit.\" She agreed. \" And you? Still working at the agency?\" He felt a shock of cold and nearly choked on his beer. \"Hm?\" he coughed. \" The agency.\" She repeated unsurely. \"What was that place called again? Flights of Fancy?\" \"Oh,\" he relaxed when he realized she meant travel agency. \"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm still there.\" \" Hope you own it by now.\" She joked. \"Corporate.\" He said after immediately forming a lie. \"They have me working in the big offices now.\" \" Ah, very nice.\" He smiled to himself and decided he might as well ask. \"So, coffee then?\" he blurted unceremoniously. \" Yeah, of course. I'm free tomorrow if you are?\" \"Sure.\" He nodded. \"Ten?\" \" That works.\" He smiled to himself at the small victory, though why he viewed it as one he didn't know. He made plans with her to meet at a little café and ended the call. Still smiling to himself, Tuck drank the rest of his beer and readied himself for bed. The following day, Tuck sat at the outdoor table, tapping his index finger against the worn wood as he waited impatiently for Angela to arrive. He'd been there for nearly twenty minutes already. In his excitement, he'd arrived much earlier than he meant to. Looking down to check his watch again, Tuck didn't realize he'd been spotted. \"Now,\" she said. The new voice forced Tuck to jump internally and look up quickly. \"I know I'm not late.\" A wide smile spread across his lips, one she soon shared. Tuck shoved himself up from his seat and stepped forward, wrapping his arms securely around the young woman who met him in stride. She giggled when he lifted her off the ground briefly before setting her back down. When they parted he gave her a chaste kiss on the cheek, and they slid into their seats across from each other. \"Look at you!\" she beamed. Angela took off her sunglasses and rested them on top of her head so she could see him clearly. \"You look oddly responsible and grown up.\" \"Really?\" Tuck glanced to his wardrobe. He was wearing a blue button up shirt, the sleeves rolled up and a white shirt peeking out from underneath. \"I don't see it.\" He added when he looked back up at her. \"You on the other hand, very grown up.\" She laughed and nodded. \"Yeah, I suppose so.\" He was a little surprised by her outfit, but only because she looked so feminine. Ordinarily, Angela wore loose fitting men's shirts and jeans. While the jeans remained, she now sported a loose fitting, but very feminine, tunic styled top that suited her well. Her ebony hair was tied up in a high ponytail and her crystal blue eyes glittered. He'd forgotten how pretty she was. \"Well, what's it been now,\" she asked softly. \"Six years?\" \"Seven.\" He sighed. \"It's been seven.\" \"Wow,\" Angela muttered. She fell back into her seat and seemed to weigh the time that had passed. It was more than she thought, but when she looked back to Tuck, the smile returned. \"What have you been up to then? How's Katie?\" Tuck took a deep breath and exhaled it loudly. He was about to dole out a long story and had to prepare himself for it. \"So much,\" he replied with a heavy smile. \"Uh, let's see. Last time I saw you, she was pregnant.\" Angela's eyes went wide in happy surprise. \"And his name's Joe. He's amazing.\" \"Awe,\" \"Then three years later we got divorced.\" Her smile immediately fell. \"Oh…\" \"And now we're trying to make it work again.\" He finished. \"Oh,\" She chimed a bit more upbeat than before. \"Well that's good then, isn't it?\" \"We'll see.\" \"Oh, come off it.\" She sighed, kicking his gently in the shin. \"Unless you've turned into a complete wank, it'll be fine.\" He laughed at her statement and shook his head. \"So, how's that rotten little friend of yours, Franklin?\" she asked with a teasing tone. \"Good, he's good.\" Tuck smiled. \"Has a girlfriend now, a proper one.\" She was shocked which he found funny. Before she disappeared, Tuck had known Angela off and on for nearly three years, so she was very well aware of FDR and how he was with women. Hell, she'd been on the receiving end more than once. \"What about you?\" Tuck asked, more than willing to shift the conversation away from himself. \"Married, kids… dog?\" Angela laughed. \"None of the above.\" She said. \"Never been able to find a bloke willing to put up with me.\" \"Oh, come on,\" he sighed. \"You're not so bad.\" The pair shared a laugh and continued to talk. It was like old times, for the most part. While seven years was a long time, Tuck was happy to see she hadn't changed. Angela was still oddly upbeat, smiled consistently and such a sweet person. Perhaps that was why she was a flight attendant for so long. She seemed to have the perfect personality for it. More than an hour had passed, nearly becoming two, before the pair paid for their drinks and left. Tuck walked alongside Angela towards her car. \"How 'bout tonight, then?\" he asked. \"There's a pub not too far from here. We can all meet up, have some drinks, play some pool.\" \"Okay.\" She nodded. \"I'd love to see that lech of a man you call brother.\" Tuck laughed, but couldn't refute her statement. When they turned the corner, they were presented with Angela's car. She turned, gave Tuck a strong hug and said her goodbye. He watched her leave briefly before reaching for his phone and calling FDR so they could set up a time to meet at the Blarney Stone. FDR's phone was ringing from its spot in the kitchen. He darted through the house, struggling not to slip on the slick floor and keep his towel up. \"Yeah?\" he said before the phone reached his ear. \" Sleeping?\" Tuck mocked from the other end of the line. \"Shower.\" FDR corrected. He glanced to the clock and began to smile. \"Are you just leaving the coffee place?\" \" Don't be an ass.\" He said, completely neglecting to answer the question. \" You up for some drinks tonight?\" \"Uh…\" he thought it over for a moment, weighing whether or not he had plans. \"Yeah, sure.\" \" Great. Bring Lauren, okay?\" The cocky grin returned to FDR's lips. \"Is this like… another date?\" he teased. \"Angela going to be there, too?\" \" It's not a bloody date.\" Tuck sighed. He should have known this was how FDR would treat the situation. \"Sure man, whatever you say.\" He laughed. \"You bringing Katie, then?\" \" Nah. It might be a bit much at the moment.\" \"Right,\" FDR stretched the word out for longer than he should have. Tuck grumbled something under his breath. Before FDR could make fun of him, the screen to his phone lit up. FDR checked and sure enough, Tuck had hung up. He kept his smile and felt himself laugh again as Lauren came into the kitchen. \"Hey,\" he smiled, wrapping his arms around her when she hugged him. Her hair was still wet from their shower, but she had put on a robe to come downstairs. Her house, after all, was damn near all glass. \"Tuck?\" \"Yeah,\" he nodded. He made sure his phone was connected to the charger again before giving her his full attention. \"He wants to meet up at the Blarney Stone tonight for some drinks.\" He never had to bother asking Tuck where they were going. It was always the same and ever since the Blarney had remodeled -adding darts and pool tables- FDR was surprised Tuck ever left. \"Yeah, sure.\" She nodded. \"I'd love to. Is Katie coming?\" \"No,\" FDR said before chuckling at an inside joke. He noticed Lauren's confusion. \"But he's bringing an old friend.\" He said it in such a way, Lauren couldn't help but narrow her eyes skeptically. \"Do I even want to know?\" \"I'll explain later.\" He said. \"In the mean time,\" FDR bent down and lifted Lauren into the air. She squeaked, but held tight. Together they disappeared upstairs again to finish what Tuck had interrupted. Tuck and Angela were busy shooting a game of pool by the time FDR and Lauren made it to the bar. Angela was bending over, ready to take a shot when someone landed a sharp blow to her backside. \"There she is!\" a familiar voice bellowed. It was the only thing that kept her from spinning around and breaking the pool cue over the guy's head. She stood and faced a wide-smiling FDR. He seemed to think what he'd done was hilarious while the little blond at his side shook her head. \"Ass, Franklin.\" Angela said, \"You're a right ass.\" \"Well, it's nice to know not everything changes.\" He joked. \"Come here.\" He closed the distance between them and hugged her tightly. Angela smiled and returned the affection. Lauren stayed back and let the old friends reconnect while she said hello to Tuck. FDR had asked if she was alright with the way he planned to greet Angela. She was, but told him if Angela punched him in the nose he deserved it. \"Long time, kid.\" FDR said as he and Angela parted. \"Jesus, it's been almost a decade, right?\" \"Apparently,\" She agreed. \"Oh,\" FDR chimed. He reached for the little blonde's hand and pulled Lauren just a bit forward. \"This is Lauren, my girlfriend.\" \"Hi.\" She smiled, offering Angela her hand. \"Pleasure.\" Angela replied with a kind shake. \"And sorry for your misfortune.\" \"Hey!\" FDR snapped. Tuck, Angela and Lauren laughed at his response. \"Oh, he's not so bad.\" Lauren replied. \"So, you guys have known each other for a really long time, I guess?\" \"Yeah,\" she nodded. Tuck was busy taking his shot and before she could protest, FDR swooped in and snatched her stick away. She grumbled, but didn't put up much of a fight. \"You can say that.\" Lauren shook her head at FDR's behavior, but the environment was light, so she couldn't help but smile. While the guys played, Lauren and Angela sat off to the side criticizing their shots. Well, they were basically attacking FDR. Tuck was immune to their verbal assaults. \"Oi!\" Angela snapped. \"If you're going to confiscate my turns, at least make the shots.\" \"You better knock it off.\" FDR warned as he pointed the stick at her from across the table. Angela openly rolled her eyes. \"So, how do you guys know each other?\" Lauren asked. She knew, partially, but wanted to have something to talk about with Angela, and there was really nothing else. \"A few years back, I ran into Tuck at a bar.\" She said, pointing to the Englishman that glanced up and smiled when he heard his name. \"We just hit it off, I suppose.\" \"FDR said you were a flight attendant or something?\" \"Yeah.\" She nodded. Angela finished off the last of her beer. \"It kept me busy. I was hardly ever home, but when I was, the three of us would generally hang out. It wasn't until I got put on international flights that we started losing touch. It was hard to make schedules align, you know?\" \"I bet.\" Lauren agreed. She didn't know if Angela was aware of the guys' real occupation, so she didn't remark on it, but she could easily see them being gone whenever Angela was in town. \"It's easy to lose touch with people when work keeps them busy.\" Angela nodded. \"But I'm back now, grounded, so to speak.\" Lauren smiled. She liked Angela in the few minutes they'd spent together. She seemed normal, which she knew was good for the guys. Plus, she was someone who knew them even before Tuck's ex-wife. Even though Angela wouldn't be able to give her everything, she knew there had to be a few embarrassing stories in there somewhere and she planned to get them. \"Who wants to double-team?!\" FDR suddenly bellowed. The odd phrase drew both young women's eyes –as well as most of the patrons- to see him standing near the table, obviously referencing a new game. Angela leaned to the side. The eight ball was gone along with the solid colored billiards. \"Hey!\" she snapped. She slid off her seat and closed the distance between her and FDR. \"You were supposed to win.\" \"You left too many balls on the table.\" He defended weakly. \"I leave your balls on the table.\" She growled under his breath. FDR smiled as he moved to the table and took the beer he'd left beside Lauren. The two young women agreed to join the game and play teams. They played men versus women and then 'couples'. It was while they were playing 'couples' that FDR had the chance to show Lauren what he meant when he told her about Tuck and Angela. The pair was standing off to the side talking to one another. It was Lauren's shot, so they didn't bother with the table. Tuck was standing at an angle, his back to the table as he said something to Angela that made her laugh. They were standing less than two feet away from each other and it was obvious to the two spying that something was going on between them. \"Did anything ever happen?\" Lauren asked FDR quietly. \"With Tuck, you kidding?\" he scoffed. FDR took a sip of his beer and set it down. \"That guy has a serious problem with tunnel vision.\" She gave him a curious look. \"If he thinks they're just friends, he ignores any sign. Besides, work and stuff.\" \"Oh, right. So, she doesn't know.\" He shook his head. \"That's kind of sad. They seem to like each other.\" She said, noting how well they got along with one another and how comfortable Tuck looked. \"Yeah well, he started dating Katie like… a year into it. And again, tunnel vision.\" That was the only thing that ever bothered FDR about Tuck. He focused so much on one thing, he never noticed anything else. It was obvious to anyone on the outside that the two had a school-yard crush on each other back in the day, but it never led anywhere. They'd just started working at the agency –something Tuck liked to bring up whenever FDR suggested he ask Angela out- and then a year or so afterward, when he was ready to balance spy life and the real world, he started dating Katie. It was kind of sad the more FDR thought about it.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 A few weeks had passed and since it seemed that Angela truly wasn't going anywhere, Tuck wanted to fold her back into his life again. FDR agreed. He liked the young woman and she made his brother happy, so it worked. Lauren liked her, too, and gladly suggested everyone have dinner together. Ever since she and FDR began dating, she'd wanted to get everyone together so she could introduce him to her best friend Trish. Any tension between her and Tuck had been all but erased when he started dating Katie again, so she wanted them all to get together. Tuck brought the idea to Angela. He wasn't as thrilled at it as Lauren and neither was FDR. It wasn't that anything was necessarily wrong with the idea in theory. It was that they had to spend time with her friend Trish, and neither spy wanted to do that. But, for Lauren, FDR had to agree and for FDR, Tuck had no choice. Katie couldn't make it. She'd been sick with some kind of cold, one she passed to Joe, which left them both housebound. He needed Angela to be able to join him. He didn't want to be the awkward fourth wheel at a dinner with a woman he'd dated, his best friend and Lauren's lush friend. To his relief, Angela agreed. She thought it'd be fun, too, though why she didn't know. In truth, she just wanted to make him feel better. Angela only wanted to spend time with Tuck –even FDR for some strange reason- but she wasn't all that excited about meeting Trish. Just by the way Tuck said her name she knew it'd likely be a trying night. She told them to come by her place if they wanted to, thinking it easier to share a vehicle than take separate ones. FDR agreed and told her they'd be there around six. Angela sat on the vanity in her bathroom putting the finishing touches on her makeup. She'd finished her face, but it came time for the body. That was the part she always hated. A large container of matte concealer rested on the foe marble top near her crossed legs. She took it and twisted off the lid. The color matched her skin perfectly, but not the skin on her face. She grimaced slightly at it. The metallic bottom was showing through, a thin ring of concealer the only thing left behind from so many uses. Sighing softly, Angela dabbed some of the thick mixture on her fingers and turned her attention to the mirror. Marks marred her chest, marks of things that had long since passed and events she'd never be rid of. They were scars left behind from a life she once called her own. With the meticulous precision acquired over time, Angela began to cover the circular scars on her chest. Soon, they began to disappear and when she swept a bit of powder over them, her past was magically wiped away. Her eyes began to burn with the promise of tears as she stared at the marks only she knew about. She could still remember what caused them as easily as if they'd just happened. When a tickle began in her throat, Angela quickly coughed to clear it. Shaking the memories away, Angela slid off the countertop and gathered the jewelry she planned to wear that night from the small metal tin nearby. She had other things to think about, like the night she was going to spend with Tuck. Her stomach fluttered -whether she wanted it to or not- at the thought of being around him again. She shoved it down and focused on what she needed to do to finish getting ready. There was a knock on the door while Angela was in the middle of putting an earring on. She knew if it was either Tuck or FDR they'd likely walk in on their own. Sure enough, a moment later she heard a male voice calling her name. \" Angel, you here, love?\" Tuck called loudly. \"Coming!\" she yelled back, clasping the hoop in her ear before bouncing down the stairs and grabbing her boots along the way. When she made it to the platform and turned to finish walking down the rest of the steps that faced her front door, she noticed Tuck wasn't alone. FDR stood behind him, his hands in his pockets and a stern gaze in his eyes. \"Why do I suddenly feel like I've done somethin' wrong?\" she asked, mostly to herself as the man in the blazer and pale blue shirt stared at her. \"Did you?\" FDR asked, a glint of a smile touching his eyes. It lightened the mood substantially. \"You look good, Foster.\" She told him, eying the nicely pressed blazer and blue button up shirt. The color complimented his eyes, but the grays of his slacks and jacket were dull enough it didn't detract. This time a real smile touched his lips and he nodded to her. \"Thanks.\" He told her kindly. \"Eh-hem.\" Attention shifted to Tuck, the young man holding out his arms as though he were modeling. \"And you too, Tuck.\" Angela laughed, taking her seat on the platform. He exaggerated a victorious nod, his smile widening. And he did look good. She always liked it when he wore a simple button up shirt. This time it was black, the sleeves rolled to his elbows with his leather cuff on one wrist, his watch on the other and the slightest bits of his tattoos peeking out since the top few buttons were undone. She wondered briefly if he was trying to make Lauren jealous too, but she didn't complain. It meant she got to benefit from it in the end. A smile formed on her lips as she pulled the last of her boots on and fixed her jeans inside. With a sigh, she shoved herself up and stood on the platform. \"Well, since we're throwing 'round compliments, how's this?\" She modeled, going so far as to put a hand on her hip and pop it out like a supermodel would causing both men to laugh at her. She'd chosen her favorite outfit for the forced union. It was nothing special only a pair of dark skinny-jeans with a few of the 'weathered' areas that made them look worn and not brand new. She topped it off with loose fitting shirt that some might call a vest, but in reality was barely more than fashionably draped fabric with arm holes, a pale lavender color, and a black camisole underneath. Rather out of character, Angela chose to show some cleavage. She went light on the jewelry, wearing the one necklace she coveted and the hoop earrings she hated. Angela even went so far as to style her hair and wear real makeup on her face, too. She'd changed greatly since the last time the guys had seen her, but neither was complaining. \"You look good.\" FDR told her honestly. She smiled to him thankfully, her eyes shifting to Tuck and the crooked grin on his lips. \"You look beautiful, darling.\" He said. Her smile widened substantially. \"You see, I knew you were my favorite.\" She teased as she walked down the rest of the steps. Tuck turned to FDR smiling smugly. \"Told you, mate.\" He grinned. FDR openly rolled his eyes at the two of them as Angela reached for her leather jacket and threw it on. \"So then, we're to ride together like a big happy family?\" she teased. \"You're a smartass, you know that?\" FDR offered. \"Duh.\" She grinned. With a shake of the head, FDR opened the door and waited for them to follow behind him. Angela made sure to grab her purse and locked up before they made their way downstairs to FDR's car. The trio made their way up the young woman's walkway towards her front door, each of them nervous for their own reasons -though they were all fairly similar. Just before they reached the final step up, FDR turned to face them both. Angela and Tuck jumped from the sudden movement. \"Okay, ground rules.\" He said. Tuck and Angela glanced to one another out of the corner of their eyes before turning their confused expression to FDR. He knew ordinarily nothing would have to be said, but for some reason FDR was nervous. He wasn't even sure why. The only thing he could think was this would be the first time everyone was all together and there were too many variables, so he had to make sure the two he could 'control' wouldn't cause trouble. If he'd been thinking clearly, he would have realized neither intended to do anything to jeopardize the night, but again, he was nervous. \"You joking?\" Tuck asked. \"No.\" FDR replied. \"Okay, Tuck, no flirting.\" \"Wha…\" he scoffed in mock shock. \"I told you I'd back off, mate. I'm out.\" Angela raised a brow at the man to her left and briefly wondered what the hell he was talking about. Neither young man had told her how they'd really met Lauren yet. They knew how she'd take it and didn't want it clouding her opinion of the blonde, especially since it seemed FDR had no plans to leave her. \"Angela,\" Her eyes went wide to feign innocence when FDR called her. \"No sarcasm. No snide comments. No being… yourself.\" \"Oi!\" she snapped. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"Look,\" he said. \"I know you guys get along, but Trish is her best friend and I just don't want you to make her cry or something.\" \"When have I ever made anyone cry?\" He gave her a knowing look, one she felt duplicated by the man next to her. \"That was once.\" She defended causing each of them to roll their eyes at her. \"I'm going to be polite. I promise. I wasn't going to say anything. I swear.\" She finished by holding up her hand in a familiar salute. \"Scout's honor.\" \"You weren't a boy scout.\" FDR mumbled. \"Franklin,\" she planted her hands on his shoulders. \"Calm the hell down.\" FDR took a breath and nodded. \"Right. Thanks.\" She nodded reassuringly to the man, hoping he'd realize she wasn't that big of a bitch as he turned and knocked on the door. She knew deep down he did, but being as nervous as he was, it wasn't hard to see why he was worried about her, too. There was shuffling on the other side of the door before it swung open and Lauren greeted them with a wide smile. \"Hi!\" she beamed, instantly wrapping her arms around FDR. She kissed him sweetly on the cheek. \"Come on in.\" FDR nodded and followed the young woman into the entryway of her house, Tuck and Angela trailing behind. Thankfully, the space was wide open leading directly into the kitchen/dining room area and they weren't relegated to shuffling around one another. \"I hope you guys are hungry.\" She beamed, still smiling as though she'd planned the perfect night. Honestly, she was happy to play the hostess for once. She was treating the night like a proper dinner party with more than just one or two people. \"Can I take your jacket?\" \"Yes, thank you.\" Angela replied, stripping herself of her leather jacket when FDR grabbed it. \"I've got it.\" He replied, taking hers and walking into the front sitting room. He tossed it and his own over the edge of a chair. Before anyone could talk, there was another knock on the door. Lauren seemed to jump. \"Oh,\" she chimed, moving towards the door. \"That's my friend Trish.\" FDR and Tuck instantly groaned. They'd done their best to keep from meeting Trish in person. The only way they knew her was through the surveillance they'd done on Lauren and the way they heard her talk didn't make either of them willing to meet her. Angela was simply apprehensive because of their reactions. \"Great.\" Tuck sighed out loud. None of the trio was enthusiastic about it when another blond woman walked into the room. She was older than Lauren and not as well put together. She didn't seem as nice either, all but ogling the guys and glaring at Angela without reason. The Englishwoman cocked a brow at the stranger's stare. \"Trish, this is Tuck, FDR and Angela.\" Lauren introduced. \"Guys, this is my best friend Trish.\" They waved their hello's to the woman and stood, yet again in the awkwardness that threatened to consume them. \"So, how about some wine?\" Trish offered after a moment of forced silence. \"Good idea.\" Lauren breathed relieved. When the two disappeared into the kitchen, Angela found herself grabbing Tuck's wrist to check the time. He smiled to himself, but wasn't above checking too, each receiving a smack from FDR when they had. FDR joined Trish and Lauren leaving Angela and Tuck alone briefly. They shared a wicked smile. \"I've never seen him so nervous.\" Angela whispered. \"Me neither.\" Tuck smiled. He lightly tugged her arm. \"Come on.\" The two joined the others just as Lauren finished pouring wine into five separate glasses. FDR handed both Tuck and Angela their drinks. \"So,\" Trish chimed again. That seemed to be how she broke tension. \"How do you guys know each other?\" Though the question was aimed at the three newcomers, she mainly looked between FDR and Angela. It made Tuck eye the two of them curiously; wondering briefly if Trish thought there was something there. The same odd expression touched Angela's features as well. She didn't understand the leading glance. \"I met Tuck a few years back.\" Angela answered unsurely. \"Franklin through Tuck.\" \"Oh yeah?\" she asked in a falsely interested voice, her eyes falling to Angela. \"That's nice. What do you do for a living?\" Angela felt her brow slowly rise. There was no segway between anything Trish asked. She simply asked, like she had a list in her head. \"Flight attendant.\" Angela replied in a lackluster voice. \"That must be nice.\" Trish said. She sounded as though she was answering the question on autopilot, like she didn't care what Angela said. It was strange. \"Like it?\" \"I'm retired.\" \"Retired?\" Trish repeated, her face twisting in disbelieving confusion. \"How old are you?\" \"Twenty-nine.\" Angela answered simply. \"And you're already retired.\" Angela nodded, taking a leisurely sip of her wine. \"Why?\" Trish may not have meant for her word to sound so judging, but it did. Then again, if Lauren's reaction was any indication, maybe she did. After all, you don't tend to groan and drink half your glass of wine on one long gulp when someone asks something unexpected. \"Time for a change,\" Angela answered slowly. She began to wonder if she could run for the door. \"I suppose.\" The tension remained and was even more prevalent than before now that Trish didn't seem to want to let up on the young woman. Thankfully, Lauren chimed in and said dinner was ready. With FDR's help, they gathered it up and brought it to the table where Trish, Tuck and Angela already sat refilling their wine glasses. Tuck sat beside Angela near the edge of the table while Trish, for some reason, took the head and FDR and Lauren adjacent the other pair. It was… odd. Lauren sat across from Angela, FDR across from Tuck. Trish had pre-picked her spot at the head of the table, wanting to be between Angela and Lauren and kept her eyes on everyone. It was like she expected a cat-fight or something, which made no sense to anyone. Lauren had told Trish about Angela after meeting her. She'd been happy FDR was introducing her to his friends, but Trish seemed hung up on the fact that this friend was a woman. Even though Lauren repeatedly told her that FDR assured her nothing happened, Trish was unwilling to believe it. She kept asserting that there was no way an admitted player like FDR didn't hook up with the newcomer at least once. It was a statement she began to adamantly repeat after Lauren made the mistake of describing Angela to her. \"So Angela,\" Trish began again when the young woman had a bite of salmon in her mouth. The group slowly turned to look at the blond who seemed determined to make things more uncomfortable. \"You have any kids or anything?\" \" Trish .\" Lauren hissed. Trish ignored her friend completely and kept her eyes glued to the dark-haired woman. \"No,\" Angela answered, swallowing her food quickly. \"Don't plan on any, either.\" \"Why not?\" FDR asked. He was a bit surprised a woman of any kind said she didn't want kids. Every woman he'd ever known wanted kids at some point in their lives. \"I don't think it's fair.\" \"Why not?\" Trish asked, unable to hide her irritation. \"Kids are awesome.\" There was something in her voice that made the others wonder if she really thought that or was kind of annoyed she was the only one with a litter of children. Lauren's eyes lingered on Trish. She felt herself wondering if her friend hadn't started hitting the wine a little early that day. Given Trish's love of the drink, it wouldn't surprise her if there was at least a bottle of alcohol in the blonde's system already. \"Yeah,\" Tuck offered, hoping to take the weirdness out of the conversation. Angela turned to look at the man staring only at her. \"I mean, I love Joe. Best thing in my life.\" She smiled almost sadly to the man. \"You're better adjusted than me, Tuck.\" She said simply. \"Aw, come off it.\" He replied, the two all but talking to themselves with everyone watching. Angela forced a smile, but hardly felt better about the situation. She was being consistently put on the spot and children were a touchy subject to her. While she appreciated Tuck's attempts to make her feel more comfortable, it was hardly having an affect. \"Kids are easy.\" Trish continued. \"Just try not to screw them up as bad as your parents screwed you up.\" \"Lovely sentiment.\" Tuck muttered, rolling his eyes at the older woman. \"Sure,\" FDR said in a falsely kind and jovial voice. \"I mean, your parents did something right, right? They're probably real proud of you.\" Angela fidgeted. \"I wouldn't know.\" She muttered softly before saying something she hadn't said out loud in over a decade. \"They died when I was a child.\" The air around them shifted again. It seemed like every time the tension would begin to wane, it somehow came back and thicker than before. \"Lucky.\" They heard Trish mumbled mostly to herself. Horrified expressions met the woman who didn't seem to notice, too busy in her mission to see the bottom of her wine glass free from liquid. This dinner was becoming worse by the second and the one causing the problems didn't seem to notice she was doing it. Lauren briefly wondered if Trish truly didn't have a 'shut-up' filter, that thing normal people have that tells them not to say something insensitive like 'you're lucky your parents are dead'. Tuck leaned back in his chair, wiping his hand over his face as he put an arm on the back of Angela's chair. He lightly touched her between the shoulder blades, letting his thumb rub her back in the most reassuring way he could. She didn't look up, more than content to swill the rest of her drink in one gulp. Ignorant to the fact the callous word even left her mouth, Trish noticed Tuck's affectionate action when she was in the middle of pouring herself another drink. She raised a brow to it curiously, wondering if anyone else caught it, too. \"So, how long have you two been dating?\" she asked, drastically changing the subject. Tuck and Angela looked up at the lush unsurely, their brows pulled together in a confusion that matched Lauren and FDR. \"We're not.\" Tuck answered, removing his hand from the back of her chair. Lauren stared at Trish wide-eyed. She'd told the blond Tuck was trying to work things out with his ex, but yet again Trish decided to challenge what Lauren told her by blatantly blurting random things. \"Tuck doesn't have the balls to ask her out.\" FDR chuckled, almost delighting in the more lighthearted conversation topic. He should have been more wary. Tuck glared at his friend who seemed more than willing to consistently remind him of his failings a decade prior. Rearing back, he kicked FDR in the shin almost as hard as he could, jostling the silverware on the table when he had. \"Ow, man!\" he growled, hugging his knee under the table. \"As opposed to you?\" Tuck asked in irritation. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" FDR shot back angrily. \"How many times you try?\" Lauren and Trish turned judging glances to FDR. He fidgeted when they had. \"I don't remember.\" He answered quietly. \"Twenty-three.\" Tuck said, leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed triumphantly over his chest. \"You asked her out twenty-three times?\" Lauren asked shocked. \"Yeah, but half the time it was a joke.\" He defended quickly. \"Right, Angie?\" Attention shifted quickly to the chair Angela sat in… once sat in. It was empty. \"Angela?\" FDR asked, looking up in time to see the front door close. \"Shit.\" He sighed as he fell back into his chair. \"Angel!\" Tuck called. He shot up from his seat and quickly followed the young woman out. Silence stretched on for a moment after Tuck left. FDR fought the urge to glare at Trish. Thankfully, Lauren seemed to blame her friend just as much. \"Nice, Trish.\" She said angrily. \"Really nice. Did you have to put her on the spot like that?\" \"What? They were valid questions.\" \"They were rude.\" She snapped. The woman didn't seem truly bothered by it, but FDR was glad Lauren at least stood up to her friend. She stood and began to gather the plates to take into the kitchen. Without speaking to Trish or wanting to truly be near her, FDR stood and followed Lauren. She glanced up to see him on the other side of her island as she put her plates in the sink. \"Look, I'm sorry. I don't know what the hell got into her tonight.\" Lauren said remorsefully. \"She's usually a lot better than that.\" FDR shook his head. \"It's fine.\" He sighed, sounding anything but okay with it. \"But I should probably go see if I can find her.\" \"Yeah, of course. Go ahead.\" FDR nodded. He hugged Lauren when she came around the island and kissed her before grabbing his jacket to try and find Angela. He didn't bother even looking at Trish before closing the door behind him. Lauren, on the other hand, was more than willing to lay into her friend. She stormed into the dining room with her hands on her hips. \"What the hell was that about?\" \"What?\" Trish asked honestly. \"Are you kidding me!?\" Lauren suddenly yelled. \"You just harangued that poor girl for no reason.\" \"No I didn't.\" she scoffed. Trish finished off the rest of her glass and wavered slightly. Lauren took calculated steps forward. She narrowed her eyes on her friend. \"How drunk are you right now?\" \"Really.\" Trish answered simply. Lauren didn't say anything else. She shook her head and walked into the other room. She couldn't believe Trish was drunk… Well, perhaps she could, she'd just hoped Trish would have shown some restraint.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 By the time Tuck caught up with Angela, she was already down at the end of the block. He called to her and eventually she seemed to stop and wait for him. \"Will you wait?\" he sighed as he jogged to her side. Tuck touched her shoulder and forced Angela to turn. \"You alright?\" \"What the hell is wrong with that woman?\" \"We all have our theories.\" He joked. Angela laughed like he'd hoped and a bit of the tension lifted. \"Come on.\" With a kind smile, he took her hand and the two began to walk along the street. \"Sorry about that.\" He said. \"Why? You didn't do anything.\" He shrugged halfheartedly, but still couldn't shake the guilt he had for being part of the reason she was dragged into the situation. When they made it another block, the other half of the reason showed up. \"Hey!\" FDR called from within his car. The pair paused and waited as he pulled over and got out. \"Where are you guys going?\" \"Home.\" Angela answered simply. \"You live like… ten miles away.\" \"And I'm fine with walking it.\" FDR's brows came together. He sighed heavily and his shoulders dropped. \"I'm sorry about that.\" He said. She could tell he was, but it barely helped. Angela was fairly certain she'd be agitated until she was drunk. Still, she softened her angry face and nodded. \"No worries.\" She told him. FDR sighed again. He could tell she was trying to make him feel better about it. Stepping around the front of his car, FDR reached forward and hugged her. He really did feel guilty. \"I'll make it up to you.\" He said as they parted. \"Oh, I know.\" She agreed. \"Flowers. Perhaps booze.\" Tuck and FDR laughed at her response. She gave him a kind smile in return. \"You want a lift?\" he offered. \"Nah, I'm fine. Thanks, though.\" \"Seriously? You're going to make me feel worse by walking home?\" \"Most definitely.\" She said without hesitation. \"Go on, mate,\" Tuck said with a grin. \"I'll take her home.\" FDR seemed to reluctantly nod. Despite wanting to remain and take her home himself, he got back into his car and headed to Lauren's again. \"Well then,\" Angela sighed. She and Tuck began to walk down the sidewalk still holding hands. \"I suppose it's a good thing Joe and Katie didn't come.\" \"Yeah,\" Tuck let out a nervous laugh. He couldn't imagine how bad that would have been. The pair continued to walk leisurely down the block until Angela had no choice but to either sit or call a cab. Truthfully, Tuck was a bit impressed she'd made it so far in heels, but that didn't stop him from teasing her a little because of it. They rode to Angela's house. She offered Tuck a drink, a real drink, which he decided to take. After the awful time he'd had at Lauren's house, Tuck could stand a stiff drink and company he actually enjoyed. When they finally made it into her apartment, Angela didn't miss a beat. By the time Tuck had closed the door behind them, she'd already brought out a half empty bottle of whiskey she'd owned for nearly a year. It was old, triple-stilled and worth every penny. \"The good stuff, hm?\" he teased lightly as he took the bottle and read the label. \"What can I say?\" she shrugged with a grin, placing two glasses on the bar. \"I've got expensive taste. Well… that's not true. I just prefer a good drink.\" He chuckled as she poured them each a bit and slid him his glass. \"Cheers.\" He toasted before taking a sip. The liquid instantly burned his throat, a sensation he wasn't prepared for. It was stronger than what he usually drank and the feeling forced a cough despite the drink being good. Angela looked at him with a sly smile on her lips and a brow raised. \"You alright there?\" she asked mockingly. \"It's good.\" He answered, his voice gruff before he cleared his throat. \"Good stuff.\" \"I can put some water in it if you like?\" Tuck glared lightly which made her laugh. JAWS was on television. It was on a normal channel which meant a lot of the good stuff was taken out, like the cussing, but the movie was a classic regardless. Both had gotten comfortable, Angela gratefully shedding her boots and socks while Tuck only kicked off his shoes. They were comfortable. \"This movie scared the hell out of me when I was a child.\" Angela said. Tuck nodded as he watched the massive shark swim beneath the boat and continue circling the actors on board. \"I was ten. I never wanted to go in the water again.\" She continued. \"Ponds, rivers, swimming pools… nothing I couldn't stand in.\" Tuck chuckled, but nodded again. \"I know what you mean. I swore up and down there was a shark in Nana's pond.\" He said. \"Thing's no more than six feet deep at the middle, but I knew there was a shark in there somewhere.\" They mused lightly over the mildly traumatizing movie and continued to watch it lazily. Eventually, the combination of exhaustion, liquor, and the comfort she felt around Tuck caused Angela to do something she probably shouldn't have. Sliding down a bit further in her seat, Angela leaned over and rested her head against Tuck's shoulder. He glanced to her, surprised by it, but not so much he said anything. In fact, he let his head rest on top of hers and there they sat. \"I'm glad you're back in town.\" He finally said after a decent amount of silence. \"Me too.\" She agreed. Angela reached for his hand again and he let her thread her fingers through his. \"No jokes about being on a dating site, though?\" Tuck smiled to himself. \"Not when that's how I found you.\" He laughed lightly. Angela shifted. Tuck lifted his head giving her the freedom to rest it against the back of the couch. She barely pulled away from him in the process and finally stopped moving when her face was barely more than a foot from his. \"Why were you on a dating site?\" she asked softly with a teasing glower. There wasn't much need to speak loudly with their proximity. \"I thought you're dating Katie again.\" \"I don't know if you can call it dating,\" he replied in the same tone and surprising himself with the lie. \"Just yet.\" He corrected. Tuck didn't know where the words came from, only that they left his mouth before he could stop them. \"I was taking it down when I spotted your profile.\" \"Did you have much luck?\" \"A bit,\" he said. Tuck adjusted himself a bit, sinking lower in the couch so he could be eye level with her. \"You?\" \"A bit.\" She repeated causing Tuck to smile. \"I figured it'd be a good way to find someone normal, but you were the only one to email me without propositioning sex.\" \"Well,\" he muttered. \"I mean, if it'll make you feel more comfortable.\" Angela laughed and shook her head at his obvious joke. Tuck shared the reaction, but the trouble was, he wasn't as sure it was a joke. \"You know what Foster told me when he found out I signed up?\" he asked rhetorically. Angela shook her head regardless. A faint smile began to twitch at the corner of his lips at nothing more than the memory of the comment. \"He warned me that half the women online pee standing up,\" she rolled her eyes and began to smile. \"And the other half was on watch lists.\" \"Good Lord,\" she laughed. Angela placed her palm on her forehead and shook her head at his statement. \"Worst part is,\" she said before meeting his eyes again. \"He's probably right.\" \"Nah, I mean…\" Tuck leaned back and looked over Angela with a skeptical eye. \"You're not a man… are you?\" Angela reared back and slapped his square on the chest. Tuck laughed happily and rubbed the stinging skin left behind. \"Ass.\" \"You're the one who agreed with him.\" Tuck defended weakly. \"You want another smack?\" She asked. Angela leaned back a bit and began to rub her hands together. \"Cause I'll give you another smack.\" Tuck reacted. He lunged forward and wrapped his arms around her, securing hers to her body and making it impossible to hit him. Angela let out a mild scream as they toppled backwards and in turn off the couch. Tuck landed on his back with a groan, but no injury. His arms were still wrapped securely around Angela making it nearly impossible for her to sit up. The best she could do was crane her neck back far enough to look at the man beneath her. \"You alright?\" she asked with a laugh before realizing how close they were. The smile vanished nearly the same time Tuck's did. \"Fine,\" he answered. She nodded as though she agreed with his statement, but that was where the movement ended. They were frozen as they were, staring at the one less than a foot away. Tuck found himself examining Angela. He'd never been so close to her and found it difficult not to. Her skin was fair like most people from the UK, and her hair was ebony black. Her face was delicately heart-shaped, her features rounded to add further innocence to her appearance and her lips lush like his. But it was her eyes that held his attention. He knew they were green, but being so close he was able to see every fleck of gold and every different shade of green they held. It was the perfect medley to give her eyes the fluorescent color they were. Angela found herself facing the same problem. She knew Tuck was an attractive man -you'd have to be an idiot not to see it- but now she could see more. Unlike her, he had a bronzed complexion from years in the states. He had strong features and a mild dimple in his chin. Stubble covered his cheeks and jaw, never quite being shaved off and making him look the few years older he needed to appear his age. He had scars, but nothing that didn't add to his appearance, like the one that sliced through his right eyebrow. His lips were full, his smile crooked and his eyes a beautiful, fathomless sea blue. Seconds ticked by, maybe minutes, and Angela found herself moving. She didn't do it consciously, however. Her neck was beginning to ache from the extreme angle and as a result her face was lowering. Tuck noticed. His grip began to loosen and a hand moved on its own. She felt it glide up her side and soon cup the side of her face. His fingers tensed lightly in her hair and the sensation caused every nerve in her body to tingle. They moved at an agonizingly slow pace towards one another until they were so close their eyes closed on instinct. Angela suddenly felt his lips graze hers. Electricity shot through her veins and just before he kissed her- BOOM! The loud sound shocked both enough they jerked back into reality and turn towards the source. Chunks of Great White shark flew through the air on the television. The beast was dead. Relaxing when they realized it was nothing horrible, Tuck and Angela looked to one another again. The sudden reality made them very aware of what they were doing. At the same millisecond, they moved. Frantically trying to end the situation, Angela shoved herself up and off Tuck the same moment he released his hold on her. Tuck stood abruptly when Angela slid back onto the couch. He moved around nervously, looking about the room as though he'd lost his keys. He cleared his throat, ran his fingers through his hair and scratched the back of his head like it would help undo the near-kiss. After a moment, he reluctantly looked at Angela. She was sitting on the couch with her tunic styled vest wrapped around her body tighter than before, an arm across her chest and her lips in her hand. She noticed him move and looked up at him through her lashes with a pink blush on her cheeks. \"So uh,\" he coughed again to clear his throat. Tuck pointed at the door. \"It's getting late. I should head home, yeah?\" Angela did little more than nod repeatedly. \"Right.\" He clapped his hands together firmly. \"Bye, then.\" Angela waved awkwardly with the hand clamped beneath her arm. Tuck didn't move to hug or touch her like he normally would have and instead left the apartment abruptly. The moment he was gone, Angela let out a long sigh and sank back into the couch. \"Oh my god…\" she mumbled. \"That was close.\" Tuck stood in the hall outside her door waiting for the elevator to reach her floor. His mind raced for obvious reasons and all he could keep repeating was how stupid he'd just been. The elevator dinged and the doors opened. Tuck stepped inside and leaned against the back wall after pressing the button for the ground floor. His head fell back and his eyes traveled to the mirrored ceiling. \"Too close…\" he said to himself. Noises went unnoticed by the young woman who'd had a few more drinks before going to bed. She'd fallen into an alcohol-induced stupor after a long day and even longer night. She was nestled deeply in her bed, warm, comfortable and secure. Ignorant to the world around her, three large shadows stood around the bed. They motioned to each other, giving silent commands for what needed to happen. One pulled out a long plastic object. Pressing a button, the end sparked and cracked with the blue electricity shooting from one prong to the other. Pain. Pain shot through her jolting every cell in her body awake before forcing it into submission. When she went limp, the other two leaned forward and pulled her from the bed. One tossed the unconscious body over his shoulder and together the three figures dressed in black disappeared into the night.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Everything around her was black. Her body ached and everything was black. When she tried to move her body and ebb her aching head, she realized quickly she couldn't. Panic began to set it immediately. A door opened and slammed shut with a tremendous thud. It vibrated through her and made her movements stop. Breathing shallow breaths through her open mouth, she wondered where she was. \"Hello?\" she asked tentatively. No one responded, at least not to her. Before she could speak again, a man started speaking German. \"I-\" she began before being abruptly cut off by another man speaking in the same foreign tongue. She realized quickly they weren't talking to her. Fear began to seep in once again and her body started to tremble. Tears gathered in her eyes. She cried. The talking ended. Heavy footsteps came closer and with a sharp yank, the blindfold was removed from her eyes. The room was so bright it took her a moment to adjust. When she had, she was horrified. \"Oh god…\" she whimpered. Two men of large stature stood a few feet from her, one holding the black cloth that had been wrapped around her head. They stared indifferently at the young woman shaking in the chair she was handcuffed to. The room was void of anything that gave the slightest hint to what it might have been used for and that scared her even more. It was vast, brightly lit… and empty. Nothing good happened in empty rooms with concrete floors. The large man with the shorter hair said something to the one beside him. The second henchman nodded and together they turned. \"Wait!\" she screamed when they opened the door. They glanced briefly at her before walking through the thick metal door and letting it clank shut behind them. The tears came immediately again. She cried uninhibited, scared more than she'd ever been before when she heard it. A soft groan touched her ears, making it through the sniffs and whimpers. She silenced herself and quickly looked around to find the source. There was someone else, someone that looked like they were in the same situation she was, and it was someone she recognized. Sitting in a chair across from her, perhaps ten yards off and handcuffed with her arms behind her back was Angela. \"A… Angela?\" The figure with their head down groaned again, but slowly began to come around. Eventually, she lifted her head. Her eyes traveled around the room until spotting the one who'd spoken to her. \"Lauren?\" she asked unsurely. \"Yeah,\" Lauren's voice quivered as she nodded repeatedly. \"Where are we?\" Angela asked groggily. She continued to look around and soon noticed the same things Lauren had. The state of the room led anyone with half a brain to the rational and frightening conclusion. \"I don't know.\" She replied as she struggled to hold back tears. \"There were these guys and they were talking and then they just…\" She was rambling. Angela looked to the young blond and noticed she was verging on a panic attack. \"Hey,\" she said as reassuringly as she could. Angela forced a weak smile to the woman in her pajamas. \"It's okay. We're alright.\" \"We're handcuffed to a chair in the middle of a dungeon!\" she yelled. Lauren's voice turned shrill and echoed off the walls. Angela winced. She was still nursing a headache and the outburst didn't help. \"Alright,\" she nodded. \"But panicking won't help. You were awake before me, what did you see?\" Lauren's mind traveled a millions miles a second, but couldn't find a point to land on. Angela grumbled to herself. \"You said there were men, what did they look like?\" \"Terrifying.\" She snapped. Angela fought the urge to be rude, but it was difficult. She understood the fear -hell, she was frightened, too- but Angela knew panicking helped nothing. Lauren slowly seemed to come to the same assessment. \"Tall,\" she said drawing Angela's eyes. \"They were tall. One had really short brown hair, the other one had kind of blond hair.\" She sniffed. \"Um… they were speaking another language. German, I think.\" \"That's good.\" \"How does that help?!\" she shot back. Angela didn't respond. She could see the fear in Lauren's eyes and knew it was beginning to shift to anger. \"I'm going to kill those two.\" \"The henchmen?\" Angela asked with a weak smile. \"Well look at you taking initiative.\" \"Not them.\" Lauren corrected. \"Tuck and FDR.\" Angela's brows came together. She tilted her head marginally to the side. \"And why, may I ask, would you do that?\" she tried to keep her voice calm. \"This is there fault.\" She laughed frantically. Her anger was turning to disbelief. \"It has to be. You know this is the second time I've been kidnapped by Germans because of those two?\" Angela's brows rose on her forehead when Lauren hissed to herself, \"Damn spies.\" Angela wasn't sure she'd heard what she did and the only thing she could think to say was, \"Of course they are.\" Lauren looked at her. Angela laughed disbelievingly and shook her head. \"I can't meet one single person that's normal. They've all some kind of malady.\" A weak smile tugged at Lauren's lips a split second before the henchmen returned. They sauntered into the room, one of them carrying something that looked strangely like a room service cart, complete with a white tablecloth and something hidden beneath draped fabric. \"Oh god…\" Lauren mumbled to herself. She was right to be worried. The blond man gripped the edge of the draped cloth and snapped it back with a flick of the wrist, exposing all manner of silver instruments. It didn't take a genius to realize they were torture devices. Lauren began to cry again, but Angela kept her composure. With someone else there too, she had something other than herself to focus on. \"Oi! Hanz, Franz!\" she called. The two men large enough they likely had to turn their shoulders in order to get through a door, turned towards the defiant brunette. \"What are you doing? \" Lauren hissed through her teeth. Angela did little more than wink at her before shifting her attention back to the men. \"How's about you let the Barbie go? One hostage is enough, yeah?\" They didn't speak. She knew they understood her because they glanced to each other, but neither spoke. After a moment, the brunette reached into his jacket pocket and retrieved a phone. He dialed a number and held it to his ear, all the while keeping his eyes trained on the young woman who spoke to him. \"Ya,\" he said in a deep voice. He began telling whoever had answered the other end what she'd done and asked what they should do next. He was talking to the boss and Angela knew it. \"Tell him to come see me then if he's so bloody curious.\" She snapped. The blond and brunette seemed mildly surprised she understood what they were saying, but the shock fled quickly. Realizing she could understand German, they turned and left to finish their conversation. Angela growled loudly when they had. \"You understood that?\" Lauren asked. \"Yeah.\" She nodded. Angela began to twist her wrists around to feel how tightly she was secured. \"You pick up a lot when you travel.\" Lauren could do little more than nod. The blonde looked awful, but Angela understood why. She was petrified. Without warning, the door opened again and the two came back. They walked directly to Angela and to Lauren's horror, lifted her to her feet. Each hooked an arm beneath one of hers and all but dragged the handcuffed young woman out of the room. \"Wait!\" Lauren screamed, but the heavy metal door slammed shut without a response. Angela was led through one winding hallway after another. She tried to commit the layout to memory, do anything that could help her in the end, but there was only so much she could do. This place was a labyrinth -filled with identical halls. As they took another left down another stark hall, she realized it was a dead end. This one had a door at the end and as she suspected, that was where they stopped. The brunette holding Angela up by her right arm beat heavily against the wooden slab. \" Betreten.\" Echoed on the other side. He opened the door and led her inside. Together, the pair set the young woman down in yet another chair with a sloppy drop. She nearly fell out of her seat, but managed to stay. \"Rude.\" She said simply. A man, long in years and heavy around the waist, stood on the other side of the room. He eyed the young woman through half-opened eyes. A cigar smoldered from its place between his fat fingers and his stare remained fixed. \"You are not afraid.\" He said, his accent and jowls weighing down his words. \"Would it help?\" she asked. His thin lips twisted into a smile and something akin to a laugh rumbled in his chest before coming out his mouth as a burst of muffled sound. \"You are very brave girl.\" He said, pointing at her with the fingers that held the cigar. His smile faded and his features turned dark again. \"Or very stupid.\" \"It's a toss up.\" Angela knew that so long as they were busy with her, they'd leave Lauren alone. While frightened for her own safety, Lauren gave her focus. Lauren gave her something else to feel other than fear. Lauren gave her just enough bravery to keep talking. \"Do you know why I bring you here?\" he asked, ignoring her comment entirely and instead pressing into the conversation. \"Not really.\" \"I bring you here because of my sons.\" Angela's brows furrowed. She instinctively looked at the men standing near the door. \"What'd we ever do to them?\" she asked, turning once again to speak to the Alfred Hitchcock look alike. \"No, no. They are not my sons.\" He said as he shook his head. Angela found his jowls a little distracting when he had. \"Karl and Jonas, those were my sons.\" Angela didn't like the passed tense reference. \"I don't know who they are.\" She lied. She'd heard the names before. It was hard not to when the story was barely more than a month old. \"You,\" he said, again pointing at her though this time the cigar hung from his teeth. \"Maybe no, but him,\" he held up a picture. Angela's heart immediately sank. \"And him,\" he held up another and her heart dropped to the floor. Staring back at her were pictures of Tuck and FDR. \"Yes.\" Angela's eyes began to water whether she wanted them to or not. Her jaw trembled and made speaking difficult, but she tried. Swallowing the lump in her throat, Angel muttered, \"Who are you?\" \"I am Tobias,\" he said. He set the photos down on a small table in the corner she hadn't noticed before and removed the cigar from his mouth. \"Heinrick.\" \"Oh god.\" She breathed to herself. \"And you and little blond girl,\" he began to waddle towards her. \"Are important to them, yes?\" \"Would you believe me if I told you no?\" she asked. Blinking, Angela released a tear from each eye. This was worse than she thought and what she thought was pretty bad. He chuckled darkly again. \"Brave, yes.\" He seemed to agree with himself. \"And no. We have been watching you,\" he pointed to the two men behind her. \"And know you are important.\" \"What…\" she cleared her throat again and tried to remove the quiver from her words. \"What do you plan to do with us?\" \"If plan goes good, nothing.\" He replied honestly. \"You are not ones I want, but you are special to ones I want. Now, you see why.\" \"Look, just let the blond go. You don't need her. Use me.\" \"I think no.\" he replied. Again her heart fell. \"But, if you behave and make no trouble, you both go home.\" With the wave of his hand, the goons swooped in again and grabbed Angela. She struggled against them briefly, but they held strong. With a parting glance from her capture, Angela was led out of the room and back towards the dungeon. The only thing that gave her any comfort was now she knew what was happening, but that was also the problem. Angela prayed internally Tuck and FDR wouldn't do anything stupid. She knew everything could go one of three ways. One, they would be rescued and everyone went home. Two, the women could be rescued at the cost of the men Tobias sought. And three, the most likely and most heartbreaking, they would all die. Again Angela's eyes began to tear by the time she was led into the dungeon. Lauren had been crying and seemed to calm the moment she realized Angela hadn't been carted off to be shot and thrown into a ditch, but she noticed the look of defeat quickly. \"What?\" she asked softly. \"What's going on?\" Angela couldn't bring herself to say it.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Tuck and FDR were in the middle of sparring, trying to keep fit while they were forced to remain behind a desk. Tuck had flipped FDR over his body and straight onto his back. He stood over his friend, laughing at what he'd done and the fact FDR was out of breath when his phone beeped. \"Not fair.\" FDR wheezed. \"But funny.\" Tuck smiled. He dug through his gym bag and retrieved his cell phone. He had a new message. Still musing to himself, Tuck opened it and immediately felt the color flee his face at what he saw. \"You alright, man?\" FDR asked as he waddled towards the bench for his water. Tuck's fear-filled eyes shot to his friend the split second before FDR's phone rang, too. Tuck knew in his heart what it might be, but prayed he was wrong. FDR went through the motions of checking his texts and quickly mimicked his friend's expression. With wide eyes, he shifted to show Tuck the message only to see the Englishman holding up his phone first. It was a picture of Angela, her hair a bit messed and her eyes pink from crying. She was staring angrily at the one taking the picture. Slowly, FDR turned his screen around to show Tuck what he was sent. It was Lauren. Her hair was messed up worse than Angela's because most of it had fallen out of her ponytail and it was more obvious she was crying. She looked petrified. Before either could speak on the sobering images they'd received, their phones beeped again. Faster than they thought possible, each young man checked the new text. \" No police. No agents. No Law enforcement of any kind .\" Tuck read. \"Or the woman will be killed.\" \" Sundown.\" FDR continued. \"And there's an address.\" \"Same here.\" They held their phones side by side to ensure they did indeed have the same message. \"Fifty bucks says that address is in the middle of nowhere.\" \"Probably.\" Tuck agreed. \"Who the fuck is this?\" FDR hissed. He tried to hide his rage in the room filled with other agents, but it was difficult. \"I don't know.\" Tuck replied. He was staring at the picture of Angela. \"Enemies.\" \"Do you realize how long that list is?\" \"Miles.\" He answered under his breath. His mind raced. He didn't understand why Angela would have been the one they chose to take. He wasn't in a relationship with her like FDR and Lauren. It didn't make sense. The only thing he could rationalize it with was they must have been spying recently and saw him spending time with her. The guilt he felt at her being dragged into his world was incalculable. \"Hey,\" FDR said, nudging Tuck's arm and jolting him out of his stupor. \"Come on.\" Tuck nodded. It was about all he could manage, and alongside his brother, left the gym. They had preparations to make. \"Do you know what's going on?\" Lauren asked for the hundredth time. Angela had been struggling with the idea of telling her. She didn't want the blond to worry more, but something told her not knowing was making it worse. \"The don't want us.\" She finally said. \"Then why are we here?\" Lauren snapped. Angela looked up. The sadness on her features was hard to ignore. \"We're the bait.\" Understanding washed through Lauren. Her brows furrowed and the tears were renewed. There was nothing either of them could do. They were stuck in a room somewhere unfamiliar with the guards at the door to make sure they wouldn't do anything stupid. They had no choice but to sit and wait and pray the guys could rescue them. Angela wasn't so sure. One way or another, someone was going to get shot. It took more strength then either young man thought to keep from calling up every resource they had in the agency. They wanted nothing more than to call in a full tactical team, but they couldn't. Forgetting the fact that they were suspended and using CIA resources was illegal within the states, the text said no agents and law enforcement. They were on their own. The GPS coordinates they'd been sent led the pair of them to the middle of nowhere like they knew it would. Tuck and FDR didn't speak the entire drive. They had nothing to say to each other that their partner wasn't already aware of or thinking himself. It was a long drive. They pulled off the interstate and onto the dirt road that led them deeper into the desert. The coordinates told them to go nearly two hours outside Los Angeles. They were practically kissing Nevada's border which only made them more nervous. They were being secluded. The GPS dinged, alerting them that they had arrived, so FDR threw the SUV into park. They sat in silence, waiting for any sign from the kidnappers. \"You know this is a trap, right?\" FDR asked after they'd been sitting for nearly ten minutes. \"Mhm.\" Tuck nodded. Even though their common sense was screaming at them that this was a bad idea, neither could make themselves stop. They had to comply. But, that didn't mean their minds weren't racing with scenarios. A few minutes later, the two were greeted by giant clouds of dust in the distance. They perked and watched as a small herd of three black SUVs drove closer. The three behemoths sailed towards the pair head-on, over the rocky terrain with little effort before finally stopping more than twenty yards away. The dust slowly began to settle. They didn't breathe. At the same moment, the doors on all three vehicles suddenly flew open. A man emerged from each and took little more than a step to the side. Each of them quickly brandished an impressive weapon, but was smart enough to remain within diving distance of their respective vehicle. From the passenger side door of the middle SUV emerged a man neither of them knew. He was wide, bulbous and balding. FDR shot Tuck a confused stare which his friend shared. \"Who the fuck's that dude?\" FDR hissed under his breath as though he'd be overheard. \"No clue.\" Tuck replied with a shake of the head. He turned back to the scene in front of them. \"Where are-\" Before the question could be fully formed, it was answered. Two men on either side of the same SUV reached into the passenger side doors and pulled out a pair of young women in their night clothes. Tuck and FDR felt the air flee their lungs. Lauren nearly fell. Her legs seemed to have trouble supporting her small frame as she was led forward, while Angela was simply angry. She scowled and fought her capture as much as she could despite her hands cuffed behind her body. Someone handed the fat man something that looked like the receiver to a CB radio. They watched him curiously before hearing a horrible shriek and the familiar click of a speaker coming on. \"Time to get out.\" The fat man said. His voice echoed around them easily despite the distance. Both men hesitated, but once the guns of the men holding Angela and Lauren were aimed at the young women's heads, the spies all but jumped from their car. Their hands went up on instinct. \"Okay!\" FDR yelled. \"Don't hurt them!\" \"Lift up your shirts.\" Tobias commanded before either of them could take a step forward. \"Not a chance!\" FDR replied. At the same instant, nine out of the eleven people with guns sharpened their aim on the spies. The two holding Lauren and Angela kept theirs firmly pressed to the women's heads instead. FDR growled while Tuck struggled to keep from screaming at the henchmen. \"My men say yes.\" Tobias said easily. \"Fine!\" Tuck yelled. He slowly reached for the hem of his shirt and lifted it. He turned around to show the fat man he didn't have a gun hidden in his waistband and lowered his shirt when he faced them again. FDR mimicked his friend's movements, but did actually have a gun hidden at his back. He didn't bother waiting for them to say anything and instead took it out with his fingertips and tossed it through his open door and onto his seat. He then reached into his pocket and repeated the action with the spare mag he'd hidden before lifting his shirt and turning to show them he was finally unarmed. \"Idiot.\" Tuck hissed loud enough his friend heard. \"Like you didn't think about it.\" FDR shot back. \"Walk forward.\" Tobias demanded over the loud speaker. The pair began to take slow, deliberate steps forward with their hands still in the air. They met at the head of their vehicle and continued side by side. \"I knew they'd check for a bloody gun.\" He said under his breath so they wouldn't be overheard. \"At least tell me you've got a knife.\" \"The hell do you think I am? An amateur?\" Tuck shot a glare to FDR out of the corner of his eye. They said nothing else to each other, but let their gaze shift forward again. The closer they got, the less attention they paid to the men with the guns. FDR's expression turned sad when he looked at Lauren. Tuck couldn't keep the remorse from his when he looked at Angela. When they were within ten or so feet of the procession, men from the SUV's on the side mobilized and soon surrounded the agents. They stopped walking shortly after that while Angela and Lauren were pushed forward. When Tobias sauntered over, he motioned to his men to begin uncuffing the women. He wasn't worried about them or the spies, not when there was so much firepower on his side. \"Everything's going to be fine, babe.\" FDR told Lauren. \"You sure?\" she asked weakly. He smiled as reassuringly as he could. When she was free, he moved towards her and no one stopped him. He wrapped his arms around her immediately while he had the chance before the man who removed Lauren's cuffs grabbed FDR's arms and snapped them onto him. \"I am so sorry, Angel.\" Tuck told her sadly. \"Yeah well…\" she mumbled as she was jostled from side to side until her arms were free. \"I bet you wish that shark hadn't blown up now, don't you?\" Tuck laughed before he could stop himself. The comment was so random, he had no other choice. Lauren and FDR had no idea what they were talking about, but they had other things to worry about than their friends' inside jokes. The Englishman reached forward and hugged Angela tightly. She clung to him the same way and even buried her face in the nape of his neck. Shortly after, Tuck was manhandled just as FDR had been and torn away from her to be handcuffed. \"Now,\" Tobias said. He stepped forward so he could speak to the women only. \"The two of you, go now, before I change my mind.\" They were both hesitant to move, but neither had a choice. Half of the weaponry was quickly trained on them. They were being shoved away from the scene and there was nothing anyone could do about it. With their choice taken away, Lauren and Angela reluctantly seemed to find their footing and began to walk towards the car. A sane person on the outside would wonder why Tobias would let the women go given they knew not only his name, but what he looked like. The truth of the matter was, they weren't a threat to a man with his reach. The most they could do was call the police and there was no way simple cops could lay their hands on a man like Tobias Heinrick. \"We can't just leave them here to die.\" Lauren said desperately as she and Angela approached the vehicle the guys had left behind. Angela shook her head. Her anger was beginning to boil every nerve in her body. \"We won't.\" she answered with a tight jaw. Lauren watched her curiously. They made it to the car quickly enough and turned. Angela was standing at the driver's side while Lauren was at the passenger door. They looked back in time to see both FDR and Tuck's legs swept out from under them. Their knees smashed into the dirt ground and nearly a dozen guns were aimed directly at them. Clearly, Tobias didn't want to risk moving the two anywhere more secluded. Evidently, he planned to kill them in the desert, and likely leave their bodies to the elements. \"Oh god…\" Lauren breathed. Angela shared her sentiment, but noticed something out of the corner of her eye. FDR's gun shined in the dying light from its place in his seat. She felt a single brow slowly rise. Stepping sideways behind the door, Angela reached for the weapon. The sudden movement caught Lauren's attention. She spotted the gun, the extra clip and Angela inspecting it while checking on the scene ahead at the same time. To Lauren's shock, Angela popped out the gun's existing mag, checked the ammo then snapped it back in. She pulled back the slide and made sure there was one in the chamber before grabbing the spare clip and shoving it into the waistband of her shorts. \"The hell are you doing?\" Lauren hissed. \"Something stupid.\" Angela admitted freely before stepping out from behind the door and raising the weapon. Gunfire raged.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 The henchmen weren't paying Lauren or Angela the slightest bit of attention once Tuck and FDR were in their custody. They still surrounded the pair on their knees. Not even Tobias bothered checking if they women had left. Evidently, they were considered too weak to be worth the worry. That was the wrong thought. Angela stepped out from behind the open door of the car and towards the crowd with her weapon aimed high. Everything seemed to move in slow motion. FDR and Tuck looked up and to their horror saw Angela approaching. They were facing the car, trying to get one final look at the two women, before seeing something that chilled their blood. Despite having bare feet, Angela's steps were determined and sure. She hadn't even made it to the grill of the car before she started firing. One went down, then another and another. The shock of what was happening lasted just long enough Angela was able to remove nearly half of the problem before they were smart enough to take cover and return fire. But they were frantic, sloppy, and she was calm. The five remaining henchmen fired aimlessly from behind the open doors of the SUV, trying to both kill the threat and protect their boss. When they had, Angela started to sprint towards them. Her body burned, her muscles hurt and the adrenaline running through her made her feel invincible. The two spies had fallen to their sides to try and remain as low to the ground as they could. Neither could tear their eye from Angela. When the clip was empty, she didn't miss a beat. With an action that was obviously practiced, she released the empty magazine and snapped the new one in place within seconds. Angela's eyes were trained only on the threats. She shot one through a window, another in the gap between the door and the car. One was too far away from his cover and received a shot to the neck because of it. The fourth she shot in the knee beneath the door which took him to the ground where he was met with a bullet to the brain. The fifth was smart. Being the last, he soon left the shelter of the SUV and grabbed one of the guys. The large German hoisted Tuck up from the ground and held him in front as a shield between her and him. Angela immediately stopped. \"Drop the fucking gun!\" he bellowed in Tuck's ear. \"Okay.\" Angela said softly, trying to keep him calm. She slowly began to kneel to set the gun on the ground in front of her. Angela kept her eyes firmly on Tuck. His face was blank, speckled in the slightest bit of blood. She didn't know which henchman it'd come from and neither did he. Angela directed her eyes down when she was nearly to the ground, praying Tuck understood what she was trying to say. The second before she set the weapon down, Tuck let his knees go lax. His bodyweight was more than the henchman expected and he faltered. It was enough. A final gunshot echoed and the German crumbled to the ground. Everything went eerily silent. None of them heard the groaning coming from the other side of the SUV. Tuck and FDR slowly shifted, sitting upright and eventually standing -all the while staring blankly at the woman with the gun. Her eyes danced between the two. She knew they were about to start spouting questions, but they didn't immediately get the chance. Lauren came rushing forward, talking a millions miles a minute and struggling to find the keys to the cuffs. Still, the trio stared at each other. A few minutes had passed before they were free from their cuffs. After hugging the relieved Lauren, FDR and Tuck took small steps towards Angela. \"Explain.\" FDR finally said. \"Explain what?\" she asked, feigning ignorance. That seemed to be the wrong thing to say. Tuck and FDR were suddenly fuming. \"Where did that come from?!\" Tuck demanded angrily. \"How do you know how to shoot a gun?!\" FDR bellowed. \"Who are you?!\" \"Who do you work for?!\" The questions came so fast, Angela had trouble meeting the eyes of the one yelling at her. When they did finally stop however, Angela opened her mouth to speak. She'd never get the chance. A loud pop echoed around them, bouncing off the mountains and meeting their ears with a harsh bang. Angela lurched. Her brows came together. Hesitantly, she glanced down and touched her chest just below her breast. She was bleeding. When her eyes moved up, she saw Tobias struggling to keep his heavy weapon aimed at the young woman. She'd shot him earlier, but only in the hip which made running away impossible. They hadn't given him a second thought when his men were down and she was paying for it. In the confusion, he'd found a weapon and took aim at the young woman who'd killed them all. Without hesitation, Angela raised her gun and fired. Tobias went still the moment the remaining bullets in her gun tore through his chest. Angela felt the burn of the bullet that ripped through her torso and the heat of the blood that was no longer inside her body. It flowed from both the entry and exit wounds. No one moved, still in shock of what happened and unable to until Angela dropped her gun and suddenly dipped. Her stance had wavered, but she hadn't fallen. Not yet. Tuck raced for her and grabbed her before she hit the ground. He guided Angela to the down so she could sit. In the few seconds that had passed since she was shot, her skin had lost a shade of color and the blood had already trailed down to her thighs. \"Angel,\" he said. Tuck adjusted her so she could look at him. \"Hey, I've got you.\" Angela could do little more than nod. She tried to breathe, but she was having trouble. It felt like she was trying to breathe through a towel. The others could hear the gurgle and knew her lung had been pierced because of the upward shot. Everything moved so quickly after that. Tuck lifted her into his arms and took her away from the carnage she'd created. FDR threw open the hatch of their SUV and Tuck didn't hesitate to lay her down inside. FDR rushed for his cell phone and called for a med-vac. They both knew they'd never make it anywhere with her, and that she needed care quickly. A helicopter was their only hope. It didn't take long for Angela to begin losing her battle with consciousness. Fear surged through Tuck as he watched her eyes lose focus. \"Hey, hey, hey,\" he said quickly. Tuck was struggling to keep pressure on both bullet wounds. \"Stay with me. Come on, girl.\" \"I'm sorry.\" She breathed. Tuck all but froze when she finally spoke. \"Why'd you say that?\" he asked calmly, trying not to show how relieved he was she was talking. \"I'm usually a better shot.\" Tuck laughed weakly. She tried to do the same at her stupid joke, but started coughing shortly after. The gurgle was worse and when she coughed, a bit of blood touched her lips. Her eyes began to drift again and her lids grew heavy. Tuck tried to shake her awake, but she was losing the battle. The noises around her turned into nothing more than a soft buzz and everything went black. Angela had been in surgery for two hours already and still none of them had relaxed. FDR and Lauren held each other's hands while Tuck struggled to keep from running his through his hair or touch his face. He was covered in her blood and every time he wanted to revisit a familiar tick like chewing on his nails or something along those lines, he was confronted with her blood. He would have washed it off if the bathroom wasn't so far away. He didn't want to leave in case something happened. She'd already died once in the helicopter… Having used his credentials to get the med-vac team to their location faster, FDR inadvertently alerted their boss to what happened. She sent a cleanup team to deal with everything left behind, but was surprised by what she found in the process. It didn't take her long to find a particular interest in the 'stewardess'. Seven hours, thirteen minutes later, a doctor emerged to tell the three who'd brought in the victim that she was out of surgery, but still in critical condition. They'd moved her to another wing of the hospital, but she couldn't have visitors. At the moment, Tuck, FDR and Lauren were staring at Angela through a plate glass window while she slept a few feet away. Lauren had to excuse herself. She said she had to go to the bathroom, but honestly FDR thought she might be sick more than anything else. Her mortality was just shoved in her face and he knew she likely wanted to vomit. FDR and Tuck understood, but remained behind. They didn't know why they were watching her. Neither could speak to her, touch her, nor be in the same room as her, but they just couldn't leave. The sound of heels clicking against the tiled floor went unnoticed by the two men staring at the young woman connected to at least three different machines. It wasn't until the person approaching stood between them that either of them took notice. FDR and Tuck turned to see their boss standing between them. \"Your friend?\" Collins asked in her typical deadpan voice. They nodded, but didn't truly answer because they knew she was fully aware of their situation. Collins held up a folder. She didn't offer it to either in particular, but FDR was the closest so he took it. \"Your mess has been cleaned. You'll debrief in the morning.\" And without another word, Collins turned and left. She had come simply to give them the folder of what she found and to visually inspect the pair of them. Her curiosity was the only thing that brought out the otherwise 'office dwelling' agent. FDR finally tore his eyes away from the haunting scene and opened the folder he'd been handed. His brows furrowed and his stomach dropped immediately. \"Jesus,\" he muttered as he took in the information. Tuck barely managed a sideways glance. He didn't want to look away from the woman in the bed, but saw enough to know FDR was reading the folder. \"What?\" he asked under his breath. \"Uh,\" FDR continued to read, even going so far as to flip through a few pages before letting his eyes shift once more to the woman in the other room. \"Basically, she's never been a stewardess.\" Tuck slowly turned his head towards his friend who was staring in the window. \"And her name's not Angela Saunders.\" Tuck's gaze sharpened on his friend. Hesitantly, he looked at the ebony haired woman lying in the bed with a respirator jammed down her throat, the one who'd saved their lives only a few hours earlier, and that they'd ' known ' for nearly a decade. FDR had long since taken Lauren home. That day and the previous night had taken a hefty toll on her, so he didn't hesitate. He struggled to get Tuck to do the same. The Englishman didn't want to leave ' Angela' alone in the hospital, but FDR made the argument that he needed to bathe. Tuck couldn't fight that. After showering and scrubbing ' Angela's' blood from beneath his fingernails, Tuck finally emerged from the shower. He saw the folder lying on his coffee table when he emerged and hesitated to step towards it. He stared at the brown paper as though it would spout nothing but lies even though the rational side of his brain doubted it. Eventually, Tuck sat on his couch and with unsteady hands, opened the folder that had dominated FDR's attention the whole time they were at the hospital. \"Jesus,\" he breathed. It was only the cover page and he was having trouble believing his eyes. He was immediately presented with a picture of Angela wearing a military uniform. It was a green he'd seen more than once in the American Army along with the black beret on her head and the insignia it bore. She didn't smile, but even with the uniform and the obvious change in appearance, he'd be able to recognize her anywhere. Below the photo were her stats. Name: Machara Isabel Keagan Born: 14-12-1985 Birthplace: Glasgow, Scotland Enlistment: 22-1-2004 Military Branch: Army Rank: Captain Unit: That part had been redacted, blacked out entirely so no one reading her file would know who she was attached to. It immediately made Tuck suspicious… well, more so than he already had been. He continued through the rest of her personal information. Family: N/A Dependants: None Notes: Expert marksman. Excels in hand to hand combat. Multiple languages. Discharge: 2-2-2013 He stared at the brisk definition of Angela's life. It was short and to the point, an outline of the bare essentials and none of it was anything Tuck knew beforehand. The only thing she'd been honest about was her birthday. Nothing more. It took some convincing before Tuck felt brave enough to flip the page to see what lay in the half of the file beneath her biography, but it did little to explain anything. The three pages that were included in the file were heavily redacted. He assumed they were her specific missions which explained why they said nearly nothing. Growling to himself, Tuck elected to see if the paperwork attached to the other side of the file would be any more helpful. Barely. It was her medical history. It outlined the horrible things she'd gone through, the damage her body had sustained only a few years prior to being discharged. She'd been let go six months before coming back to Los Angeles, med-boarded out because they didn't want to pay for anymore 'repairs'. Having his own extensive medical background considering the work he did, Tuck was more than capable of creating the scenarios in his mind that led up to each injury and they weren't inspiring. The final one, the one that had her kicked out, was the worst by far. Angela had been admitted to a military hospital in Germany –from where they didn't say- with substantial injuries that led her to being there for nearly three months. She'd gone through more than one surgery, had to be medically placed in a coma, and needed months of rehab. According to the list, she was still supposed to be attending it even now as she lay in another hospital bed. It made sense that she'd been hurt before, but only because her records had been blacked out. A normal military career didn't require that, only the dangerous ones. Medical records tended to go hand-in-hand with that. People thought covert operations were like the movies where bullets could fly and the hero remained uninjured. The truth was much worse. The truth was, people not only got hurt -they died. Tuck tossed the open file onto the coffee table again. He propped his elbows on his knees and buried his lips in his hand. He stared at the picture of a woman he thought he knew only to realize there was nothing about her that was true. Everything she'd told him, everything they'd based a nine year friendship on, was nothing more than a cover story. Questions began to surge through his mind. Tuck wondered if he was part of the cover, too -if FDR was. He wondered if she was supposed to blend in and form friendships. He wondered if she even liked them at all or if it was all part of the job. And then, darker thoughts came. Tuck suddenly began to think she was spying on them, that her being undercover meant he and FDR must've been part of her mission. He began to think that she was watching them, trying to learn about their lives so she could report back to the people who blacked out her file and tell them whatever they wanted to know. His concern for Angela , the confusion and fear he'd felt in regards to her in the past few hours was suddenly gone and replaced with betrayal and anger. He couldn't help it. Angela he liked, he cared about and was scared for. Machara? He didn't know who the hell she was. His eyes fell to the photograph that was prominently displayed only a foot away. Tuck was forced to rethink and reconsider everything he thought he knew about Angela . While lying may have been his job, he felt an undeniable betrayal at hers and he couldn't even ask her about it until she woke up. Her body ached more than she thought possible. Every muscle twitch -every breath- radiated through her with horrible agony. It felt like someone had embedded needles into her flesh and every tensing muscle jostled them. Angela slowly pried open her heavy lids. The light burned immediately and forced her to groan. The groan forced her to cough. The cough forced everything else to hurt more. For some reason, Angela felt like she'd been run over by a steam roller. After a few steadying breaths to calm her lungs and give her eyes time to adjust, she opened them once more and took in her surroundings. She was met with stark walls, no artwork, machines that beeped loudly and the smell of disinfectant. It burned her nose as much as breathing in general burned her lungs. Her vision was blurry at first, but slowly began to come back to her the same time a nurse came into the room. The spike in her heart monitor didn't go unnoticed by the staff. \"Well,\" she sang as she walked to Angela's bedside, smiling wide as she did. \"Looks like someone's finally woken up.\" \"Where-\" That was the extent of Angela's range of vocabulary before her throat scratched again and the coughing started all over. She couldn't fight the groan that accompanied the fit. \"Oh,\" the nurse sighed sadly. She quickly poured Angela a glass of water and helped her drink it. Angela coughed into the glass a bit, but the water did help her relax the muscles in her throat and give her lungs a chance to calm. After a few small gulps –because anything more hurt worse than the coughing- Angela nodded her thanks and leaned back into her bed. She knew her throat was hoarse because a breathing tube had been shoved down it. Unfortunately, she had previous circumstances to compare to. \"You're at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles.\" The nurse said kindly as she set the nearly empty cup down again. Angela didn't bother hiding her irritated confusion. \"You've been shot.\" This time the irritation was gone and Angela was simply confused. \"How about I go get the doctor?\" Angela nodded repeatedly. She didn't bother trying to speak again because she didn't want a repeat of what already happened. She waited impatiently for a man in blue scrubs and a white jacket to walk into her room with a smile and a chart. She hated him immediately. \"Good morning, Miss Saunders.\" He greeted. Like with the nurse, he stepped to her side to examine her machines. \"I'm Doctor Watkins. How are you feeling today?\" She raised an angry and irritated brow that he noticed when he turned around to see why she hadn't said anything. \"Understandable.\" He nodded. \"And I'd imagine you're still a bit hoarse.\" She nodded tersely. \"Well, let's see.\" He looked to her chart to refresh his memory. Honestly, it just made her glare. Angela felt like he wasn't a decent doctor if he didn't know who she was. \"Alright, you were brought in a week ago with a gunshot wound to you chest. The bullet entered just below your left breast where it fractured your fourth rib, ruptured the lower lobe of your lung and exited through your shoulder blade.\" He read as easily as if it had been the time. When he looked up, he saw absolute horror on her face. He continued regardless. \"You lost a few pints of blood on your way here, but after surgery, we were able to repair the damage. You had to be kept on a ventilator, of course. That's why your throat is so scratchy.\" Angela's brows had pulled together. The emotional shift on her face had gone from angry to horrified within the expanse of his explanation. Her eyes were tinting pink and tears were starting to gather. \"You're lucky.\" She shot him an angry glare, but it lost a bit of it's power with her near tears. \"The bullet missed your heart by millimeters.\" He explained. She looked down and blinked, sending the tears gliding down her cheeks. She didn't remember it. She didn't remember being shot or what happened afterward. All she could remember was Tuck and FDR on their knees with guns aimed. The doctor left at some point, but Angela didn't know when. She didn't care. The only thing that seemed to make it through her haze was that she ended up in another hospital bed with more scars to add to the list. Angela buried her face in her hands and cried. Even crying hurt… She didn't know she wasn't entirely alone. Tuck had come by to check on her. He didn't know if it was some kind of morbid curiosity or genuine concern that brought him to the hospital, but he was there regardless, standing on the other side of the plate glass window like he had before. As he stared at her, his anger began to diminish. He couldn't help it. For a moment he didn't see Machara in the hospital bed crying because she was hurt and alone, he saw Angela and it broke his heart. Angela continued to silently weep into her hands. The action hurt her chest and now she knew why. She knew why breathing hurt, why moving and crying hurt. She was broken again and it was going to take everything she had to try and heal. The opening door went unnoticed to the woman in the bed. It wasn't until the loud clunk echoed through the room that she looked up. Tuck stood on the other side of the room with his hands in his pockets and a blank expression. She wanted nothing more than to beckon him to her so he could hug her and make her feel better, but he didn't move. She could tell something was wrong. Slowly, Tuck approached until he stood at the base of her bed. Angela didn't attempt to speak or move. She waited for him to do something first. \"Machara.\" He said after a few moments of silence. Angela's face immediately fell and her already sickly pale skin lost a shade of color. She remained silent which he expected. When he said her name, her real name, Tuck had the confirmation he needed to find footing in his anger. Reaching into his back pocket, Tuck pulled out the folder he'd brought with him and tossed it onto her bed. The bent chunk landed on her lap. She hesitated to pick it up, but eventually did. The moment she opened it to see what was inside, her eyes darted to Tuck. His jaw tensed. \"It true?\" he asked. Her eyes moved once more to the folder. She took in everything she already knew and tossed it away from her quickly. Angela wiped her hands down her face before crossing her arms over her chest. She refused to look at Tuck again. \"Where…\" the word was cracked and hoarse. It hurt, but she was determined to speak. \"Did you get that?\" she bit back the cough that threatened to come free. \"Collins, our boss.\" He answered curtly. \"She did some diggin' on the one who killed a handful of German terrorists.\" Her brows came together and the tears gathered again, but she refused to look up. She could hear the anger in his voice and it frightened her. \"It true?\" he asked again. She didn't speak and instead nodded. Tuck felt every muscle in his body jolt with electricity. He'd been able to lie to himself until that point. He'd been able to fool himself just a bit into thinking she was still Angela, but she wasn't. The woman in the bed was Machara Keagan, because Angela never existed. \"There anything about you that's real?\" he asked angrily. The cold tone forced Machara to look up and see him standing at the foot of her bed fuming. \"Everythin' just a fuckin' lie with you?!\" he demanded. Tuck couldn't help but yell. \"Were you working us this whole time? Was there anything you told me that wasn't bullshit?!\" \"Tuck!\" The Englishman spun on his heel to see FDR and Lauren standing in the door behind him. They'd come to check on Machara too, but soon found Tuck in the middle of a tirade, berating the woman in the hospital bed and he had to interject. \"Take a break, man.\" Tuck's jaw flexed and relaxed. He shot Machara a glower before storming out of the room without another word. \"I'll go talk to him.\" Lauren said softly. She turned around and followed after the angry young man. FDR sighed and let the door close quietly behind him. His gaze shifted to the woman in the bed. \"So, your name's not Angela, hm?\" he said without a hint of emotion. Her blood ran cold.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 FDR and Machara sat in silence. The folder she'd tossed away rested at the foot of the bed against her footboard. He reached for it and lazily flipped through the document before discarding it just as she had. New information hadn't magically appeared within it, so it held little of his attention. Eventually, his eyes drifted back to the woman in the bed who wouldn't meet his stare. Lauren jogged after the irate young man. \"Tuck, stop.\" She sighed. She had no choice but to reach out and grab his arm to stop him. Tuck spun on his heel, but tried to ignore her as best he could. He was flustered and she expected it. Lauren looked at him sadly. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. Even though she knew or had her suspicions, she wanted to hear him say it. \"Why were you yelling at Angela?\" Lauren slipped. She knew that wasn't the young woman's name, but it had been the only one she knew for her. At hearing it, Tuck's eyes shot to Lauren with sharp and cold precision. It made her stomach drop. \" That ,\" he said angrily as he pointed down the hall towards Machara's room. \"Is not Angela. Angela doesn't exist. That person in there is nothing more than a liar.\" \"Okay,\" she said softly. She didn't want him to start screaming at her too. \"But… it's still her.\" His jaw was tense and his eyes angry. \"Well it is.\" \"How ya figure that?\" he snapped. \"Well come on, you guys weren't exactly upfront with me.\" She shot back. Tuck fidgeted slightly. \"But that didn't suddenly make you different people when I found out the truth, did it?\" Tuck looked as though he wanted to agree, that he needed to think the woman in the bed was the same person, but he wasn't sure he could. Whether it was pride or mistrust he didn't know, but he didn't believe Lauren. \"It's not the same.\" He said. \"Should I even ask?\" FDR asked skeptically after the silence had become deafening. Machara hadn't bothered looking up and did little more than shrug her good shoulder in response. \"So, okay,\" he sighed. She glanced up through her lashes to see FDR fall into the chair nearest the door. He dropped his head in his hand to hopefully ebb the headache that was forming. \"Army?\" she nodded. \"Right… Scottish?\" she nodded again. \"Right… and it's May-car-uh?\" Machara snorted a soft laugh that ached and shook her head. \"Muh-care-uh.\" She said, emphasizing the right syllables so the American could pronounce her name correctly. \"Mac.\" \"Mac.\" FDR nodded. He was willing to use the abbreviated version. The air in the room calmed and the tension waned, but there were still unanswered questions and Mac knew they were coming. She should have expected it if anything from her life became known. Honestly, she'd planned to tell them at some point, just not now or like this. \"So,\" FDR sighed as he scratched the side of his head. \"Then who's Angela?\" \"Cover.\" She said with a hoarse voice. FDR nodded, but waited for her to continue. \"I did things people weren't s'pose to know 'bout.\" Her accent had shifted to one he didn't recognize and the surprise of it was written across his features. She tried to ignore it. In her drugged and tired state, Mac didn't have the strength or desire to continue playing English. \"An' since I got no fam'ly, they thought it best I stay hidden.\" FDR nodded. It wasn't an uncommon practice in their world. They had to protect the people around them, which was why -until recently- their families didn't know what FDR and Tuck really did. Chances were Angela Saunders was a name given to her on some assignment –complete with IDs and a past- so it was a name she used in renting a place and a 'normal life'. But that didn't explain everything. \"So if you're retired, why not go back to your name? Tuck said he found you on that site under Angela.\" Mac stared picking at her fingernails and avoided his eyes again. The story to explain herself wasn't a good one and made her eyes burn each time she thought about it. If it'd been in her file, she'd gladly let him read it instead of explaining herself. \"Las' year, my unit an' I was in this place doin' some things.\" She said vaguely causing FDR to muse to himself. That phrase was one he'd used often before. Mac paused and scratched her forehead just above her eyebrow nervously. \"Uh, somethin' went wrong and…\" she cleared the knot growing in her throat. \"We was ambushed.\" Her eyes began to burn and her vision blurred. \"They didn' make it and uh… I almost didn't, either.\" FDR could tell she was beginning to weep, but still refused to meet his gaze. \"I was hurt so bad, I had to retire. No good to 'em anymore. And 'cause of the things I'd done, they figured it'd be easier for Machara to die an' Angela be my only name.\" \"They faked your death and wiped your records.\" He muttered. Mac nodded softly. \"No survivors, they said.\" FDR didn't ask another question and Mac didn't offer anything else. They let the room fall silent again and both were a bit thankful for it. The young man in the corner was trying his best to absorb the information he'd been given while Mac tried to push the memories of her ordeal down as deep as they could go. They sat like that for a few minutes until there was a knock on the door. Mac's heart leapt with both fear and hope that the person on the other end was Tuck, but it wasn't. It was only Lauren. Still, Mac smiled as warmly as she could to the newcomer. \"Hey,\" Lauren said softly as she entered the room. She glanced briefly to FDR in the corner, but still advanced on Mac. \"How are you feeling?\" Mac again forced a smile and shrugged. \"I'm fine.\" She lied openly. Lauren knew it, but didn't contradict her statement. \"Good.\" Lauren's smile was just as weak. She turned to FDR when she reached Mac's side. \"He's outside.\" FDR nodded and stood. He gave Mac a nod, but it was clear he still wasn't certain how to proceed with anything in regards to the woman in the bed. Without a word, he left the two alone. Lauren's attention went back to Mac. \"I uh… I wanted to say thanks, for everything.\" She said. Mac nodded heavily. \"Of course.\" \"I mean it. You saved their lives and ours. Thank you.\" Mac could tell Lauren was truly thankful and it made her feel better. A little bit. Lauren didn't seem to be as offended by Mac's deception as the others which was to be expected since they'd only known each other for a short time, but it was also nice. Mac's guilt towards Lauren was less than what she felt towards the guys. \"I'll let you get some rest.\" Lauren said after a few minutes. She started towards the door and turned when she reached it. \"Thanks again.\" Mac nodded and gave the blond a parting smile before she disappeared completely from sight. Left alone again, Mac was forced to focus on her pain, both physical and emotional whether she wanted to or not. Tuck and FDR were at work, still grounded and still bored. Tuck was in the middle of typing something, but was stabbing at his keyboard so hard, FDR wondered if it hurt. \"Seriously dude, calm down.\" He finally snapped when he was certain his brother was going to break the equipment. Tuck looked up, but said nothing. He continued to type and while it wasn't as aggressive as before, it was clear he was still angry. \"Then just talk to her.\" FDR said. Tuck glanced up and seemed to ask a silent question. \"Because it's obvious you want to.\" FDR knew he was about to have a one-sided conversation with the Englishman. \"We've done the same thing before.\" It's not the same. FDR heard Tuck say in his head. \"Yes it is.\" He said out loud. To anyone watching, FDR was talking to himself at Tuck, but he knew his brother so well, he was able to anticipate anything the Brit would say. She could've told us the truth. \"She couldn't say anything and you know it. I already told you what she said at the hospital. Mac Keagan is dead. She is Angela Saunders now.\" Tuck fidgeted and looked back to his computer and FDR could've sworn he heard him mutter, she still should've said something. \"Oh my god,\" he sighed in agitation as he went back to his work. \"You can sit there and act hurt all you want, but we both know it's not really her you're pissed at.\" And that was all FDR had to say. He didn't bother trying to persuade his brother to do anything he knew he was too stubborn to do in the first place. Tuck's face relaxed and he was no longer glaring at FDR. Slowly, he eyes went back to his monitor. With his mouse, he clicked on a window he'd minimized a long time ago, but couldn't exit completely. An article expanded on the screen and he began to read it again despite knowing its contents already. U.S. Soldiers Killed in Mission Gone Awry While the details remain a mystery, seven United States soldiers were killed today in a suspected rescue mission. Sources say the soldiers were in route to rescue members of the international press who were taken hostage six weeks ago. Their convoy was ambushed. There were no survivors. Their names include, That's where Tuck would always stop reading and instead stare at the pictures of the seven soldiers rumored to have died in the ambush. They were the military photos of each soldier wearing their uniforms and berets, no smile and their names beneath each picture. The disturbing part was seeing Mac's photo second in line with large bold letters in red spelling KIA. He knew only portions of the article were correct for other obvious reasons than one of the 'non-survivors' being alive. It was his job to read between the lines and knew there was a slim chance the soldiers were actually there to save journalists. It could've been their objective, but so could assassinations or retrieving intel. The first just sounded better to the major populace. Still, Tuck would stare at her picture. It was nothing special because it wasn't meant to be, but it was her, Angela, wearing the uniform and big red letters under the photo saying she was dead. He couldn't look away and spent the rest of his time at work that day staring at it. Lauren was a sweetheart. She was a genuinely nice person, which made Mac feel guilty about disliking the blond earlier. When she learned what Lauren had done to both Tuck and FDR (dating the two of them at the same time and then having the gall to be angry with them for it) her opinion of the blond was tainted, but in light of recent events, she found herself not caring. Besides, she'd been told the story in passing weeks ago. If it didn't bother the guys, perhaps it shouldn't bother her. The only bouquet of flowers Mac ever had in her room was from Lauren. Not even Lauren and FDR, just Lauren. Lauren was the only one out of the three to learn Mac's secret that didn't seem to hate her for it. It took the doctors far too long to release Mac as far as she was concerned. She felt she should have gone home the moment she woke up. They didn't. Instead, she was in the hospital for nearly three weeks after the fact before they thought she could take care of herself enough not to break her stitches. Mac hated hospitals. She hated them more than any rational person would. Forgetting the fact she'd spent more time in one than any healthy person ever would, that was where she learned she lost the majority of her family. When you do the things she, Tuck and FDR did for a living, you begin to consider your partners –your team- family. That's what her unit was to her and she'd been lying in a hospital bed when her NCO told her they didn't survive. Hospitals held a myriad of bad memories. Mac didn't know if Lauren offered or FDR sent her to 'spy', but the blond was there to help Mac when she left the hospital. It was Lauren who drove Mac to the pharmacy to fill her multiple prescriptions and it was Lauren who took her home. Admittedly, Mac had been relatively out of it since leaving the hospital, but Lauren could tell she was despondent for other reasons. Lauren held the door open as Mac hobbled into her apartment. Mail was piled up on the island and the few plants she owned looked like they were on the brink of death. If she had a life, her apartment might've looked more abandoned, but it didn't. That made it a bit sadder. Mac continued to walk slowly toward her living room. Her feet were heavy, her body felt tingly and her arm hurt. She was on a handful of painkillers which made her a bit woozy and forget about the ridiculous sling on her arm. \"You sure you're okay?\" Lauren asked. She watched Mac skeptically from the kitchen. \"'M fine.\" Mac mumbled. She fell onto her couch with a groan, slumped to the side and began to haphazardly kick her shoes off. \"I mean by yourself.\" Lauren said. She stepped closer to the young woman struggling to stay awake on the couch. \"Are you okay by yourself?\" Mac opened her heavy lids and looked at Lauren's concerned face. She sighed and pushed herself up. Lauren swooped in to help when it was clear the Scot struggled with the simple action. \"Lauren,\" she said simply. \"This idn't the first time I've been shot.\" She admitted to the surprise of the blond. \"Seriously, I'm fine.\" Lauren didn't seem to like the answer, but wasn't surprised by it either. Mac –on the other hand- seemed to be losing her battle with consciousness. Sure enough, in the time it took Lauren to return to the kitchen, Mac had slumped on the couch again and fallen asleep. Lauren didn't wake her and instead left her the things she knew Mac would need when she woke again on the coffee table. Her pills, a bottle of water from the fridge and her cell phone awaited the Scot whenever she woke up. Tuck was in the gym at work. He wasn't in the mood for sparring and honestly, none of the others wanted to spar with him. Ever since he was a part of the annihilation of the last Heinrich –and the strange rumors surrounding it- the others were wary. Rumors were all they had to go on and Tuck's angry, agitated attitude since then didn't help things, so he was relegated to fighting alone with the heavy bag. He was lost in thought, beating the shit out of the weighted bag, when FDR found him. The intense look on his brother's face bothered him. FDR's brows pulled together and he sighed. Dropping his bag on the nearest bench, he stepped over to Tuck. \"What?\" Tuck asked before FDR could speak. \"Seriously man, it's been two and a half weeks since she got released.\" FDR said. \"And?\" he dared. Tuck glanced around the bag briefly to look FDR in the eye. \"You haven't spoken to her, either.\" FDR ground his teeth briefly. His argument lost a little of its weight when Tuck said things like that. \"I've at least text her.\" He defended. It was weak, but he knew it was better than anything Tuck had done. \"What about you?\" Tuck's jabs hesitated briefly. He still bounced his weight from one foot to the next, but it took a moment for the hits to begin again. \"She lied to us.\" Tuck muttered. It was the same tired excuse he'd been using since they found out the truth. The only difference now was Tuck seemed to be growing as tired of saying it as FDR was hearing it. \"Fine,\" he snapped under his breath. \"I'll make you a deal. Shooting range, you and me.\" Tuck stopped hitting the bag and gave his brother his full attention. He looked irritated. \"One clip. You do better than me, I'll leave it alone. I beat you, you have to go see Mac.\" FDR noticed Tuck flinch when he said her name. He still wasn't used to hearing her referred to as anything other than Angela. \"I'm a better shot than you.\" He said simply. \"Then you have nothing to worry about.\" Tuck glowered briefly, but eventually nodded. He just wanted to get FDR off his back. Mac stood in her bathroom doing her best to change her bandages. Pain in the ass didn't seem to encompass the difficulty she was having. Being shot was such an inconvenience. Since being home, Mac had stuck to wearing the bare minimum. She wore night clothes -a pair of cotton shorts, a thinly strapped shirt and her bathrobe. The thinly strapped shirt was the best she could do as far as tops went because a bra was out of the question and this was easier to maneuver than a sea of fabric. She stood in front of the vanity with her shirt pulled down and her face twisted into a grimace as she tugged gently on the bandage. Her wound was tender and red and it wasn't even the worst one. This was just a little bullet hole stitched shut with three little threads. When the soiled bandage was removed, she cleaned the area and slapped a new one on. It wasn't her main concern. The worst was on her back. Slipping the other strap from her shoulder, Mac rolled her shirt as best she could and pushed it out of the way to see her back. A large white gauze pad stretched inches across her back, wrapping around her side as it followed her ribcage. It made her gut turn. Taking the bottom corner, Mac began to peel it off as slowly and gently as she could. It hurt. It hurt more than she could put into words, but she didn't have a choice. She had to maintain the damn thing. She had to take breaks as she went, unable to withstand removing it all at once and incapable with the angel. Eventually, she had the bandage hanging by only an inch or so of tape when there was a loud knock on her door. Mac growled to herself. She didn't want company, but then again, maybe Lauren could help. Reluctantly, Mac did her best to cover the injury again and threw her robe on before heading to the front door. She knew the wound would frighten the blond, if not make her sick, but she didn't know what else to do. When she opened the door however, Lauren wasn't who was on the other side. \"Tuck,\" she muttered in shock. \"Wha' are you doin' here?\" She noticed him shift under the sound of her accent. She'd forgotten he hadn't come back to see her after she gave up the disguise. He left after yelling. FDR and Lauren were the only two who heard her real voice. \"Can I come in?\" He didn't have an answer to her question, so he decided to ignore it completely. Part of him thought she'd tell him no, but to his surprise Mac stepped aside and let him in. He moved pass the woman in her bathrobe. Tuck turned to speak to her –just so he could tell FDR he did- when he noticed the back of her robe. His brows came together in confusion. \"Are you bleeding?\" \"What?\" She tried her best to look over her shoulder, but winced in pain when she had. \"Shit.\" She hissed to herself. \"I's tryin' to change my bandages.\" Tuck felt his insides twist when she moved by him and towards her bathroom again. He didn't want to care. He didn't want to feel bad for her. Tuck wanted to stay mad. He wanted to be angry she'd lied to him for almost ten years, but it was hard. Whether he wanted to or not, Tuck found himself following after her. Granted it was a great deal slower than she moved, but he followed regardless. By the time he made it to the bathroom, Mac had already returned to trying to remove her bandage. She was twisted with her back to the door which kept him from seeing her nude, but Tuck wasn't sure he would have noticed regardless. All he could see was the seven-inch gash that wrapped around her side and ended a couple of inches below the exit wound. \"Jesus,\" he breathed louder than he meant to. Mac jumped and wrapped her arms around her chest to shield herself. She hadn't expected him to follow. Embarrassed and uncomfortable, Mac could do little more than stare at him until he left. But Tuck didn't plan on going anywhere.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Tuck felt his stomach twist –turn and flip as he stared at the nauseating sight. He couldn't put into words what he was seeing. He knew what it was –obviously- but the fact of it seemed just out of reach. While he wasn't prone to being squeamish, the realization that this was someone he cared about, that he was being forced to see their mortality, wasn't lost on him. \"I'll be out in a sec.\" Mac finally said after a lengthy silence. Hearing her voice seemed to shock Tuck back into the moment. His insides jumped and his eyes drifted to the young woman's profile. Even though he could barely see her, he could tell she was embarrassed. As far as he was concerned, she had no reason to be. His feelings for Angela began to resurface, choking out his anger towards Mac. At the moment, this was Angela, and she couldn't do this on her own. \"Let me help you.\" He said under his breath. Mac struggled to form words. She wanted to tell him to go, that she was fine and had everything under control, but it wasn't the truth. Honestly, she wasn't entirely certain she had the strength or mental clarity to bother giving a believable lie, and before she could even try, Tuck was at her side. He took hold of the bandage that barely clung to her skin and began to gently peel it away. Mac slammed her eyes shut, dipped her head forward and tried to push the situation out of her mind. Along with the disgusting new injury she bore, Tuck was going to see everything left behind from before. The tape clung firmly to her skin and pulled at it as he tenderly rolled the bandage away. He wanted to be as gentle as he could, but it was difficult. Still, slowly and inch by inch, the raw, red cut was fully exposed. Tuck's chest tightened. Black threads held the swollen injury closed. It was scabbed, brilliant red compared to her fair skin, and so enflamed it looked painful. He'd seen his fair share of vicious wounds, but this was something different. This was his fault, and that thought seemed to only just begin sinking in. Tuck suddenly felt guilty for the way he'd been treating Mac –especially now confronted with the true depths of what she'd gone through to save him and FDR. Tuck tossed the soiled bandage away and retrieved a damp washcloth. With the clean edged, he began to softly clean her back. Mac wanted to speak. She wanted to say something, but nothing came to mind. So much fought to come out that nothing could. Part of her wanted to explain, wanted to tell him why she chose to be someone else. Another part wanted to beg for him to forgive her because she just couldn't stand the cold way he stared at her. But again, nothing came out. Tuck continued to tend to her with the utmost care and was finally ready to cover it again. With her shirt down around her waist, he didn't have to move it out of the way of the long piece of gauze. The fingers of one hand held it in place with the other reached for the tape. With his teeth, he peeled off a bit of the adhesive strips and pressed them into place. As he did and the wound was finally out of sight, Tuck noticed other tidbits he'd been too distracted to see before. On her right side –the side opposite her newest addition- were burns. His brows came together tightly and whether he meant to or not, Tuck gently touched the long-healed injuries. Mac felt his fingertips and flinched. She immediately realized what he was doing and stepped away as best she could. Her actions snapped Tuck back into reality and he felt himself back away. \"Thanks,\" she mumbled as she tugged her shirt back on. Tuck nodded, but she didn't see it, instead still focused on the task at hand with her back to him. When she was dressed and had her robe back on, Mac wiggled by the frozen man and out of her bathroom. She couldn't be in the small space anymore, not with the very air inside threatening to choke the life from her. Again, it took him a moment to come back to reality, but when he did, Tuck found himself following after her. Mac stood in her kitchen with a glass of water on her island and a bottle of pills in her hand. He watched as she tipped two into her palm and threw them back with a gulp of water. She then repeated it with two more bottles. His brows tensed again. \"How many different pills do they have you on?\" he felt the need to ask. \"Three,\" she answered in the same soft voice she'd been using since he'd arrived. \"Pain killers, antibiotics and muscle relaxers.\" He nodded, though he wasn't sure why. The trifecta made sense, but he was compelled to offer his approval –for some reason. When she'd finished taking her medication and drank nearly half the glass of water, Mac planted her palms on the marble island and let her head fall slightly. She still refused to look at the man beside her. \"Why are ya here, Tuck?\" she asked again. He'd never answered her initially and while she was a bit glad to see him, he'd made the way he felt about her perfectly clear the last time they spoke. It took Tuck a moment or two to make him mouth work, but he eventually managed the simple task. \"I wanted to see how you were doing.\" He lied. Truth was, he'd lost a bet, but now that he was there, now that he'd seen her, Tuck felt compelled to know how she was doing. \"I'm fine,\" she said dejectedly. The tension returned and Mac wanted nothing more than to remove herself from it. She pushed herself away from the island and headed towards her living room, passing Tuck in the process. She barely glanced at him. \"Thanks fer stoppin' by.\" She said as she walked by. Tuck knew it was her way of dismissing him and part of him was overjoyed for the chance. It yelled at him to just go, to leave because he'd fulfilled his obligation, but that voice was nothing compared to the one gradually drowning it out. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" he asked as he turned in his spot. Mac was sitting on the couch with her knees pulled onto her cushion and a blanket draped over her lap. She didn't look at him. \"Why didn't you tell me who you are, what you do?\" he asked more accusingly than he meant to. \"Why didn't you tell me ?\" she snapped back. Tuck was surprised by her sharp words, but not at the same time. Given how he'd treated her since learning the truth, anger on her part was to be expected. He sighed heavily, ran his fingers through his short hair and scratched the back of his head out of nervous habit. Tuck shifted his weight on his feet and chose to look at anything that wasn't Mac. He had no answer for her. He didn't tell her for the same reason he didn't tell anyone –it was against the rules and could put them in danger. Then again, she'd been shoved into said danger regardless of whether or not she knew the truth. \"I'm sorry,\" he finally offered. His eyes gradually drifted to Mac. He noticed her hesitantly meet his gaze while maintaining her own level of uncertainty and confusion. \"And… thanks.\" Her brows pulled together tighter than before. Clarity never touched her features. Mac knew what he was thanking her for –at least she assumed- but she hadn't expected it. Tuck made his feelings towards her very clear as of late, and because of that his gratitude confused her. He could tell and it hurt. It actually physically hurt. \"I uh,\" he stammered briefly and hated himself for it. \"I should go… let you rest.\" Mac felt herself nod, but she had no control over the action. Still wearing her confusion, she watched as Tuck offered her a halfhearted wave and disappeared through her front door. Her heart sank when he was gone. This wasn't supposed to happen. Tuck and Foster were never supposed to learn her secrets and if they had, it wasn't supposed to be so detrimental. Why did everything have to be so hard? Two months had passed since Tuck ventured to Mac's house and that was the last time he spoke to her. He just couldn't bring himself to do it and worse yet –he had no idea why. He still couldn't shake the betrayal he felt. For some reason, he felt truly and deeply affected by Mac's lies, as though she'd personally slighted him. The others didn't share his feelings. Lauren –who had little in ways of a relationship with Mac beforehand- accepted her into the fold easily. As far as she was concerned, it was no different than when she met the guys. Even Foster was no longer affected. He understood it, actually. He understood why Mac wanted a fresh start, why she chose to remain hidden behind a new name, and why she never told them the truth. He just got it, and their relationship rebounded because of it. Tuck didn't. He couldn't. Something was holding him back and he hated that he couldn't identify the reason. That same reason, however, was obvious to everyone else. Tuck loved Mac –as more than a friend- and took her lies personally, like she'd done it to deliberately hurt him when it had nothing to do with the Englishman at all. Easter had finally come and as she tended to, the boys' Nan had a party. There was family as far as the eye could see, kids playing, people talking and everyone dressed in their Sunday's best. Even Joe and Katie came along and while Tuck could plaster a fake smile across his lips and look the part of the involved parent, his mind was divided. It was divided most days, actually, and the reason soon showed herself. Tuck felt his stomach drop and his heart race as Mac appeared alongside his grandmother. Questions surged through his brain, all centralizing on one simple question –why was she here? She looked nothing like she did the last time he'd seen her. Instead of wearing her pajamas, her hair messed and tied into a knot and her body weak from surgery, she was a vision in purple. Mac was wearing a lavender dress with a small cardigan wrapped around her shoulders that kept her injuries hidden. Her dark hair was threaded over her shoulder in a thick braid, the wedged-heels on her feet made her inches taller and she was smiling. She looked so much better than before, healthier. Mac had been apprehensive about accepting the Easter Day invitation. When she'd first met the guys and their friendship grew, she'd met their Nana. She'd met their family because she'd known them for a few years, but it had been seven years since then. Mac hadn't spoken to their grandmother once since being back, she was apprehensive about crashing the party and she knew she'd see Tuck. That didn't stop Foster's berating, though. He told her she had no choice, that his Nana knew she was back and wanted to see her, and he'd kidnap her if it came to it. Mac believed him and against her better judgment, she attended the event. \"I'm disappointed you haven't come to see me before now.\" Nana said with a light smile. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Mac mumbled. Her English lilt twisted her words, disguising her real self from the older woman. She didn't know what –if anything- the guys told her, so she chose to play it safe. \"I've been a bit under the weather.\" \"Franklin told me.\" She said. Mac felt her chest tighten. She wondered just how much he'd said. \"The flu?\" Mac let out an internal breath, \"Yes, ma'am.\" She lied. She felt bad for it, but lies were part of the job, part of her life, so she'd grown used to the taste of them. \"Well,\" Nana sighed with another smile, \"I'm glad you're here, dear.\" \"Thank you for the invitation.\" Nana smiled once more and hugged Mac. Knowing nothing about the previous events, she squeezed the young woman tighter than Mac was able to stand. She winced, but said nothing about it. When they parted, Nana excused herself to speak with some of the grandkids who were busy demanding an Easter egg hunt. When she left, Lauren quickly appeared at Mac's side. The Scotswoman was surprised to see her. \"Hey,\" she greeted. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Better,\" Mac didn't bother changing her accent. \"Though, truthfully, I think I only have the energy for an hour or so.\" Lauren nodded. She didn't like that Mac felt the need to leave early, but understood it –all things considered. Tuck continued to watch the pair from his spot at one of the picnic tables beneath a shading tree. Foster slide up alongside his brother and didn't have to guess what held his attention so completely. \"You talked to her yet?\" he asked as he picked at some fruit he'd brought with him. \"No,\" Tuck replied without bothering to face his friend. Instead, he let his gaze travel outward, as though he'd never been gawking like an idiot. \"Seriously?\" FDR asked with an exasperated tone. \"Come on, man. It's been two months. Just… say hi. Shit. Say anything.\" \"I can't,\" \"Why?\" \"I just can't.\" Tuck practically snapped when he finally met his brother's gaze. \"Okay? I just… I can't. What would I say, anyway?\" \"I don't know,\" Foster didn't bother hiding his sarcasm. \"Start with hi . Maybe follow it up with, sorry I've been such an ass. Want to get lunch? \" Tuck shot him an annoyed, sideways stare. \"Seriously, man, this is ridiculous. You guys have known each other for years-\" \"No,\" Tuck interrupted, \"I've known Angela for years. I've known Machara for less than four months.\" Foster openly rolled his eyes and fell back into his seat with an exaggerated sigh. He'd heard this argument a thousand times and it was old a hell of a long time ago. Even worse, it was a bullshit excuse to begin with, especially in their world. \"Fine,\" he conceded as he leaned forward once again and propped his elbows on the table. Tuck eyed his skeptically. \"Here's what we know about Mac.\" FDR extended his finger as he began to count. \"She was in the same line of work as we are. Two, she chose to change her name like a million other people have before and three,\" he scooted a bit closer so Tuck could see how serious he was, \"she almost died saving our asses.\" Tuck's brow relaxed and began to twitch together. FDR could see his exterior cracking, he could see that even his brother knew how ridiculous his argument was, and that there was no reason to hold onto it as tightly as he was. \"She's the same person she's always been.\" Foster told him. \"You're just scared.\" \"Of what?\" Tuck dared despite fearing he may know. \"Because you almost lost her.\" He replied. \"And it was our fault.\" Tuck's gut turned again and he looked away. He hated that Foster was right, that it was their fault she and Lauren were abducted, and that it was their fault Mac had to defend them and was shot as a result. If they hadn't gone after the Heinrick brothers, if they hadn't plastered their faces all over the internet and if it hadn't been made public who they were, the two would have been safe. \"Look,\" FDR continued, \"it scared the shit out of me, too, but she's here, man. She's alive and she's twenty feet away. So,\" he leaned back, \"pull your head out of your ass and just talk to her.\" Tuck shot his brother a glance and FDR didn't bother hiding his smirk. \"Ass,\" Tuck mumbled under his breath. Foster's grin grew when Tuck actually stood a moment later and approached the young woman in purple. Tuck knew that if he remained at the picnic table, it was unlikely –if not impossible- for FDR to let the subject lie. Confronting his fear –so to speak- was actually the safer option. Lauren and Mac were still talking when Tuck approached. He smiled warmly to the blonde as he slid his hands into his back pocket. Mac shifted and all but refused to meet his eye for too long. It was clear the pair was incredibly uncomfortable around one another, and given how close they were when Lauren first met Mac, she thought it was a bit sad. \"Can I speak with you for a moment?\" he asked her. Mac seemed surprised by the request, but didn't have the chance to reply. Instead, Lauren took it upon herself to leave the pair alone and scampered off to rejoin Foster. \"I suppose so,\" she replied under her breath. Tuck flinched when he heard the English accent –Angela's voice- because he knew it wasn't real and it bothered him. With a wave of his hand, Tuck guided her away from the populace and to the house where they could speak in private. She didn't know why, but Mac found herself following him and came to a stop when they made it just past the double doors and to the kitchen. Both moved awkwardly for a moment or two before Tuck actually spoke. \"You look nice,\" he felt stupid for the ridiculous compliment almost immediately, but the silence was choking them both and he needed something to break it. \"Thank you,\" she replied. She looked over his attire –a white button-up shirt and dark wash jeans. \"You, too.\" Tuck nodded hesitantly. He chewed on the inside of his cheek and the longer he was forced to dwell in the uncomfortable environment, the more he realized Foster was right. As his eyes danced over the woman before him, Tuck felt the familiar and he both welcomed and lamented it. \"I've missed you.\" He admitted whether he wanted to or not. There was so much struggling to come out that those few words slipped passed his lips before he could pull them back. Mac looked up at him sadly. He wanted to hug her. \"I've missed you, too.\" She replied. He noticed her eyes tinting pink and glassing over. Tuck felt his gut twist. She was on the verge of tears –something he'd never seen before- and he didn't like it. \"I'm sorry,\" she muttered. When her voice hitched, he felt retched because it was his doing. \"If I'd known what the two of you do, I'd have said something, but I didn't. I couldn't tell you the truth. I wanted to, but I couldn't say anything.\" She was rambling and he felt guilty because –like with every horrible thing that had happened thus far- he assumed it was his fault. Unable to take it any longer, Tuck reached forward and hugged her tightly. He wrapped her in his arms, enclosing her completely, and buried his face in the nape of her neck. He felt better almost instantly. \"I don't care about that.\" He mumbled into her skin. He felt her grip his shirt tightly when he spoke. \"I just…\" He found words lacking and just decided to hold her. He felt guilty for the way he'd been treating her, for the cold, silent treatment. As though hoping to make it up to her, he squeezed her tighter than before. It was too much. Mac let out a whimpered cry when his fingers dug into her back. Tuck immediately released her and took wide steps away as though he was afraid she'd break. Mac's head swam, her breathing was shallow and her body ached. Even though the stitches had been removed some time ago, she was still in pain from the surgery. \"I… I didn't mean to.\" He told her honestly. \"I'm sorry.\" \"No,\" Mac waved her hand gently to dismiss his apology. \"No, it's fine.\" She met his eye and forced a smile. It lost all reassuring power when Tuck saw tears on her lashes and her cheeks glowing pink. \"I'm still a bit sensitive, that's all.\" He stared at her sadly and let his body react like it used to when it came to Angela. Stepping forward, Tuck tenderly ran the back of his index finger across her heated skin. She forced another soft smile which he barely reciprocated. The longer he stared at her, the more he realized just how much he'd missed her and how much he didn't care about the lies. Apart, he could hold onto his anger, but not when she was so close, while she was looking at him with those eyes. Tuck reached forward and hugged her again, softer than before but with the same intensity. He tenderly ran his hand up and down the length of her back, hopefully reassuring her as best he could. Mac sank into the sensation. She really did miss him, more than she thought possible. But the endearing scene hadn't gone unnoticed. Katie stood only a few yards away. She could see clearly into the kitchen and watched as Tuck sweetly touched Mac's cheek before hugging her. Katie's stomach turned with anger and jealousy. She didn't know who the dark-haired young woman was, but she was more than capable of seeing how Tuck looked at her.[Chapter 9] AN: I don't know if you guys are still reading, but I hope so. Sorry it's been so long, but I'll be finishing the story in the next couple of days. I hope you enjoy it, and let me know what you think. Chapter Nine People don't realize just how long it takes for certain parts of the body to heal. Bones and muscle and skin all have their own timelines. Mac's lung was actually the first to heal completely, to recover from being dissected. She still felt short of breath sometimes, but honestly didn't know if it was because of her injury, or because of the knowledge that the doctors had removed a portion of the lower lobe. The rib that was shattered by the bullet was unsalvageable, so the doctors cleaned up the sharp edges, and left it alone. Her shoulder blade still had a small hole left behind from the large caliber projectile, and the muscles on her back were almost entirely repaired. In truth, the surgery had done more widespread damage than the bullet, if one took the time to think about it. The true problem came with her skin. By now, the internal stitches had dissolved, and the ones on her back had been removed, but her surgical scar was angry. It was raised –a keloid, they call it- and long. It tightened her skin, pulled at it with its unyielding shape. Pressure against it was almost impossible to withstand, something she was forced to remember when Tuck squeezed her so tightly. White had flashed in her eyes, followed shortly by stars. It left her dazed, lightheaded, and short of breath. The day was warm enough that after the shock to her system, Mac remained inside to cool down and gather her wits again. \"You sure you're alright?\" Tuck asked as he slid a glass of ice-cold water across the island to where Mac sat. \"Yeah, fine.\" She nodded. Mac took hold of it, let the frigid temperature encompass her hand briefly before she pressed her palm to the back of her neck. \"Just… just a bit dizzy, is all.\" When she looked up, she saw him leaning against the island across from her, his hands planted against the surface, and worry marring his features. His brows were pulled so tightly together that she wondered briefly if it hurt. \"I'm fine.\" She repeated, this time forcing a smile. Tuck did the same, but his face barely relaxed. \"Dad!\" The joyful, loud, sound of Joe's voice filled the kitchen, jolting the pair back into reality. Their attention shifted to the open double-doors. Joe raced in with a wide smile. Mac recognized him easily. Tuck had shown her a dozen pictures. \"Hey, buddy.\" Tuck chuckled, leaning down and lifting up his son, plopping him onto the island. \"What's that?\" he asked, pointing to the wad of crushed bills in his son's hand. \"I found it in some of the eggs.\" Joe replied happily. \"Apparently,\" A beautiful dark-haired woman stepped in with a smile. \"Your Nan put money in some of the plastic eggs this year.\" The dark-haired young woman glided to the island, standing against the edge that separated Tuck from Mac. She looked familiar to the Scot, but she couldn't place her, not even when their gazes met. What she was able to discern, however, was that the dark-haired young woman didn't seem to like her. There was a skeptical glint in her brown eyes that made Mac uncomfortable. She didn't understand why the stranger already seemed to dislike her, so she diverted her attention to the others in the room. Mac smiled while Tuck groaned, laughing a little in the process. \"Of course she did.\" He replied. \"I found eleven dollars.\" Joe said, still giddy with his prize. \"That's pretty awesome, man.\" Tuck replied. Mac liked seeing Tuck interact with his son. It was a part of him she'd never seen before, yet somehow expected. Tuck was nothing but nurturing, so it made sense that he'd be an amazing father, too. \"Hey,\" he said after catching Mac's eye briefly. \"I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. Joe, this is…\" he hesitated briefly, and Mac noticed. She met his stare, praying he didn't call her Mac. She wasn't that person anymore, and even if she was, his family only knew her as Angela. Thankfully, Tuck seemed to realize the same. \"Angela.\" Joe turned to look at the young woman behind him and smiled. \"Hi,\" he said with a slight wave. \"Hello, there.\" Mac replied kindly. \"And this,\" Tuck shifted attention to the stranger. He moved closer to her and even put his arm around her, but something looked off. He didn't seem as comfortable as one should, which Mac thought was odd. \"Is Katie.\" \"Ah,\" Mac chimed. She did her best to appear in the moment, even if the moment was fraught with imagined tension. \"Joe's mum.\" Mac extended a hand to the surprised and still distrustful Katie. \"I've heard a lot of wonderful things about you.\" She lied. \"Angela.\" \"Hi,\" Katie said in a tone that matched her expression as she shook Mac's hand. \"I haven't heard a thing about you.\" Mac saw Tuck's face fall and his gaze shoot to her out of the corner of her eye. Poor thing. He looked like he was about to burst, too filled with anxiety to properly lie like they'd all been trained to do. Either that, or he was embarrassed Katie admitted he hadn't told her about Mac at all. \"I'm not entirely surprised.\" Mac said, recovering from her twinge of hurt that the second circumstance was the most likely. \"I've only recently returned to Los Angeles. Until a few weeks ago, the last time I'd spoken to Tuck was when he told me that the two of you were expecting this one.\" She said with a wide, innocent smile that seemed to help put Katie a little at ease. \"So, it makes sense he never mentioned me.\" Mac turned her attention back to Tuck. He looked stuck somewhere between relieved and still wound so tightly he might rupture a blood vessel. \"I'm going to go find Lauren and Foster, perhaps get a bite to eat. I think that might help with the dizziness.\" She took hold of her water and stood. \"Thanks again for the water.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" He nodded repeatedly. \"It was a pleasure to meet both of you.\" Mac was sure to say to Katie and Joe before leaving the kitchen. She felt better the moment she was out of that small space. Mac was a little annoyed with the whole thing. Not only did she not recognize Katie, but she was fairly certain the ex-wife was giving her the stink eye the whole time. The only time she'd ever seen Katie before was through a picture. Life being what it was when Mac was still living in Los Angeles, and all three of them apparently working for the government, Mac was never sad that she hadn't met Katie. But Tuck, being so proud and in love as he was at the time, showed her a picture. Back then, Katie's hair was much shorter and blonde. Add to that the fact that she was ten years younger, and it was a bit of a change. Still, Mac didn't really like her. She was rude and a bit cold. Not really a great first impression. True to her word, Mac said goodbye to everyone little more than an hour after arriving. She hadn't quite recovered properly and needed to take a pain killer, her first in more than a week, apparently. Tuck felt terrible for it, especially since they'd only just started making their way back across the giant chasm that had formed between them when the truth came out. She told him repeatedly that she was fine, but he still felt bad. He and Foster were sitting at Foster's apartment, the game on in the background, though neither of them were paying much attention to it. Foster wasn't a fan of soccer, but Tuck was. Still, Man U wasn't playing, so he barely watched. He just liked to keep up. \"So, how'd it go?\" Foster asked. Tuck was amazed he lasted so long. They'd been sitting together watching the DVR'd game for more than ten minutes before Foster finally dove into it. \"How'd what go?\" Tuck asked, feigning ignorance. Instead of verbally replying, Foster elbowed his brother, hard, causing Tuck to nearly drop his beer. \"Watch it.\" He chastised lazily. \"It went fine, alright?\" \"Just fine?\" Tuck let out a heavy sigh as he looked at the man to his left. Foster had a brow raised and a smirk on his lips. \"It went really well, okay?\" he said. \"So you apologized.\" Tuck nodded as he took a sip from his longneck, \"Yeah.\" He could see Foster staring at him intently, waiting for him to continue, but he had no desire to. As a result, Foster grew impatient. \"And?\" he pressed. \"And what?\" Tuck asked with a hint of a chuckle. \"We're friends again, I guess.\" Foster let out an exasperated sigh as he fall back into his couch. Tuck glanced to him briefly. \"It's amazing.\" Foster mumbled. \"What is?\" Tuck asked as he sipped his beer again. \"You're the smartest moron I've ever met.\" Tuck shot his brother a confused, and slightly annoyed glare, but Foster couldn't seem bothered to notice. Instead, he watched the football match he had no interest in. Tuck went back to the game as well, but kept thinking about what Foster could've meant. Why was he a moron? Because it took so long for him to apologize? Tuck couldn't argue with that. He knew he should have much sooner, but still. That was a bit rude. His mind drifted back to a few hours prior while they were all at Nana's house. It felt good talking to Mac again, even if she was using Angela's voice. He liked seeing her, speaking to her, and feeling her in his arms again. It would've been perfect if he wasn't so overzealous and accidently hurt her. And then Katie emerged, adding more guilt to the situation. He wished to hell she hadn't told Mac that Tuck never mentioned her, but it wasn't a lie. He didn't tell Katie about her. What would he have said? When he and Katie started dating, he was consumed by her, and the thought of mentioning that he had a close female friend didn't even don on him. Then, when he was prepared to introduce them, Foster scared the shit out of him by saying Katie would never believe it. He quoted When Harry Met Sally, of all things, that speech about how men and women can't be friends. Somehow, by the end of it, Tuck was so scared that Katie would think something was going on between him and \"Angela\" that he didn't want to risk it. Katie, at the time, was the best thing that ever happened to him, and he didn't want something stupid to mess it up. After a while, he just got used to saying, \"my friend\" without ever offering a pronoun. Looking back, he could see how ridiculous it was, but at the time it made total sense. \"Hey,\" Foster said after a few moments of nothing. Tuck jolted back into reality. \"You hear anything more about that job coming up?\" \"The one in Ukraine?\" \"Yeah,\" \"Nah,\" he shook his head. \"Just that we'll be dropped in and have to do the jump at night, mate. Still don't know when yet. Sometime in the next couple of weeks, though.\" Foster gave a lazy nod. They had a job coming up in Eastern Europe, but the details were still classified. They wouldn't know until a day or two beforehand. A lot of moving parts, apparently. No \"men of leisure\" this time. It was rumored to be a black-bag operation, or something else equally sinister. A week later, the date of the mission was finally put into writing. In three days, Tuck and Foster would be on their way overseas. Both had things to do before they left. Tuck was speaking to Mac more freely than before, partially out of wanting to and partially forcing himself to. Some stupid, childish part in the back of his brain still thought he should be insulted and offended, but the larger part –thankfully, the logical part- recognized it and chose not to listen. He was glad, too, especially since that childish bit shut the hell up the moment he saw her again. \"Come on, then.\" He said, still trying to goad her into working out despite how badly he didn't wish to proceed. \"You need the exercise.\" She put her hands on her hips as she arched a delicate brow at him. \"You callin' me fat, Tucker?\" Tuck opened his mouth to speak, but words wouldn't come out. The longer he stood there, gaping at her, the more annoyed her expression became. \"I…\" he stammered. Without warning, Mac smiled wide. She let loose a string of giggles at his expense causing him to glare at her as his heart rate returned to normal. \"I'm jus' takin' the piss, Tuck.\" She smiled. \"I know my ass is smaller than yours.\" His gaze instantly drifted down, taking in her profile. He smirked, arching a brow of his own as he met her gaze again. Tuck gave a shrug. \"If you say so.\" He teased. She glowered playfully and flipped him off. Tuck chuckled. \"Come on. You're the one who wanted to do this.\" \"I know, I know.\" She groaned. A couple of days ago, while still struggling to complete her rehab, Mac approached Tuck with a proposition. She wasn't a fan of the weight lifting aspect to re-strengthen her shoulder, and wanted, instead, to spar. Tuck was, understandably, horrified that she wanted to fight when she was so clearly sensitive, but she rationalized that she needed to get through the pain as quickly as possible. She said she wanted to fight, to get the feel of what being hurt with her healing wounds would feel like so she knew what to expect. She told him that she needed to know and pussyfooting around it wouldn't help her at all. He wondered why she didn't ask Foster. Mac laughed and jokingly said she needed a challenge. Tuck couldn't help but let out a loud, boisterous laugh at that, too. \"Alright,\" Mac said as she tucked her baggy shirt into her yoga pants. It was bulky and looked ridiculous. \"Why are you wearing that?\" he asked. To Tuck, it looked uncomfortable, and unnecessary. Beneath the worn and stretched neck of the band t-shirt she was wearing, he could see the wide black straps of a sports bra. The baggy shirt didn't seem to make sense. Mac shifted uncomfortably as he strapped on a pair of fingerless gloves. \"I uh… I'm covered in scars.\" She said before tentatively meeting his gaze. \"I don' like people seein' 'em.\" His heart sank, but he nodded. He wasn't going to press her. He remembered how embarrassed she was when he noticed the marks on her side, the ones that were much older than the injury he was tending to. The pair squared themselves off on one another, knelt low, and ready. Their actions were slow at first, not tentative, but measured. They moved that way for a few minutes before their speed increased. Gradually, each thrown punch grew in intensity and precision. Soon, they were genuinely fighting one another, though Tuck still held back. He was afraid he'd hurt her. Images of the pain in her eyes at nothing more than a hug flashed in his mind every time he lunged for her, but Mac was clearly doing her best. And she was getting frustrated. Suddenly, Mac dropped to the floor. She kicked forward, sweeping Tuck's legs out from under him. His back hit the floor of his apartment with a hard thud, stunning him briefly. Mac was on him in an instant, straddling his lower stomach and pressing all of her body weight down on his shoulders, pinning him in place. \"Yer not takin' this seriously.\" she told him angrily. She shoved at his shoulder again before sitting upright. \"I need to know what I'm in for.\" She said. \"Holdin' back idn't gonna help me.\" Tuck took a deep breath and sighed. He didn't think she was ready for this, and decided that he should probably prove it to her. Without warning, he sat up, wrapping his arms around her body and pinning them in place. He spun the pair of them, smashing her back into the mat. She let out a cry from the sudden impact. Tuck quickly grabbed her wrists and pinned them down, too, sure to keep his body pressed firmly to hers. He could see her pain without her speaking it. Her face was suddenly flushed, her cheeks bright pink. Her eyes had lost focus and her brows pulled together tightly. It was obvious she was struggling to come back from it, to push past the ache he knew was radiating through her body. Even though he hadn't thrown her down hard, he was well aware of how sore her body had to be. He'd been shot before, hurt for weeks, and he hadn't needed intense surgery for it. \"Okay,\" she said, her voice strained and heavy, and her eyes slammed shut. Tuck released her wrists, but stayed where he was, propping himself above her by his elbow and leaning a little to the side, one hand tenderly wrapped around her waist as though it'd help assuage the ache she felt. \"Okay,\" she nodded. \"You win, mate. You win.\" Finally, she managed to open her eyes and looked up at him. \"I'm not ready.\" \"I'm sorry.\" He told her sadly. \"But, ya know, I just… I wanted to show you.\" \"Yeah,\" she nodded. \"Could've shown me a bit gentler,\" she said with a hint of teasing that made him smile. \"But I got yer point.\" \"Gentler?\" he countered. \"You're so bloody stubborn, there is no gentler .\" \"Fair enough.\" She smiled. Tuck did the same, staring down at her sweetly. He couldn't help himself, it was just a byproduct of the moment. His gaze danced over her face, taking in every bit it could. He was still pressed against her, his chest firmly on hers while her legs remained wrapped around his hips and her hands clutching the back of his shirt. He didn't know when it began, but when his mind finally returned to the moment, Tuck realized he was caressing her side. His thumb was tenderly drifting back and forth in a loving action, and it was then the rest of the compromising situation came to him. The second he found clarity, Tuck knew he had to move. Clearing his throat, he pushed himself to his feet. He offered Mac a hand, which she took, and stood herself. He was flustered, but did his best to hide it. That was the second time he'd slipped into something too familiar with Mac, something too comfortable for people who are just friends. He had to remind himself of that simple fact more than he should. They were just friends, and he was dating Katie again. Whatever little crush he clearly had was just that: a crush. In an effort not to show how uncomfortable he'd made himself during their brief sparring match, Tuck didn't suggest that she leave or insinuate he had plans to tend to as much as he wanted to. Instead, he decided to act as though nothing had happened, because, in the end, nothing had happened. With a bottle of water each, the pair retired to the couch to relax. Even out of the corner of his eye, Tuck could see how disappointed Mac was that she was still so sore. He pitied her, a bit. \"You're only human.\" He felt the need to say. He saw her roll her head towards him and did the same to meet her eye. Tuck gave her a small smile. \"It's alright that you can't do it all right now.\" \"It's really not.\" She grumbled in response. \"I feel so… useless, and weak, an'… I should be better by now.\" His brows furrowed. \"You serious?\" he asked, pushing himself up and shifting enough he could look at her incredulously. \"You died, Angel. Died.\" He noticed her flinch and wondered briefly if she was even aware of the fact. \"In the helicopter, your heart stopped. It was only for a moment, but,\" he shook his head as he slipped back into that moment. It still chilled his blood. \"Stop being so bloody hard-headed, alright?\" Tuck fell back into the couch, shaking his head to himself as he sipped on his water. He was actually a little annoyed that she seemed unable to accept what happened to her. Mac was irritated, of all things, that she couldn't throw a proper punch or what-have-you, not relieved to be alive like he felt she should be. \"Sorry,\" she mumbled. Tuck rolled his head to look at her. Mac suddenly appeared to him like a child who'd been scolded. In a way, she was. Reaching over, he grabbed her hand and held it. The action was second-nature, something he'd done a thousand times before without thinking. \"It's alright.\" He sighed. \"It's not your fault your Scottish.\" \"Oi!\" Tuck laughed when she reared back and slapped his arm for the fake insult he'd paid her. He laughed happily, in fact, and was grateful for it. It felt like a long time since he'd done so. \"You're lucky I even like you, ya ass.\" \"I know.\" He grinned. The two fell silent for a moment, watching the TV before Mac spoke again. \"Ya called me Angel.\" She said softly. He didn't move as she fell against his side, resting her head on his shoulder. Tuck felt his heart race in slight panic at the slip. He hadn't even realized he said it. \"Haven't called me that in a while.\" \"Yeah, well…\" was his only response before he changed the subject entirely. \"Franklin and I have a job in the next couple of days.\" \"Have to do a thing somewhere?\" He smirked to himself, grateful she wasn't pressing for details, \"Yeah.\" Mac reached for his hand again, threading her fingers through his and holding it tightly. \"Be careful, both of you.\" Surprisingly himself, Tuck kissed the top of her head. It was chaste and nothing near indecent, but something he hadn't done since before Tobias Heinrick. \"We will.\" He said before letting his head rest against hers.[Chapter 10] AN: Yay! Glad you're still enjoying it. I'm going to do my best to upload every Friday, Saturday at the latest until the story's done, which won't be too long. Let me know what you think of the new chapter, and enjoy! Chapter Ten The guys left in the middle of the night. Tuck didn't tell her much, but it was clear they would be wherever they were going by the time the sun went down and would likely get to work. Mac could do little more than text them both and wish them luck, and to be careful. She was worried, for obvious reasons. Tuck replied that they would, he promised. Foster, on the other hand, replied with a very simple, okay, mom. It made her smile, though. Without a job for the first time in her life, Mac had an inordinate amount of free time that she didn't know what to do with. Her only two friends were out of town and while she and Lauren got along fairly well, she didn't feel comfortable enough texting her out of the blue to see what she wanted to do. Still, she was going stir crazy, and may do so regardless. Her phone began to ring. Mac quickly ran for it and was surprised to see Lauren's name flashing back at her. \"Hello,\" she greeted. \" Mac, hi.\" Lauren said. Mac could practically hear her smile. A person's voice has a very different sound when they're smiling. \" Hey, um, are you doing anything this afternoon?\" \"No, why?\" she couldn't help but be a bit skeptical. The fact that she was just thinking about calling Lauren only to have the blonde call her was a bit strange. \" I was wondering if you wanted to grab some lunch with me,\" Mac smiled and was prepared to answer in the positive, until Lauren completed her statement. \" And Trish.\" Lauren had been a bit apprehensive about adding the last bit for obvious reasons. Mac's first instinct was to say no, HELL no, in fact, but she thought about it for a moment. Foster was one of her best friends, her only friends, and he was with Lauren. Lauren's best friend was the lush. It bore to reason that they'd have to meet more than once, so perhaps she should be the bigger person? \" Look,\" Lauren said when Mac didn't offer an answer. \" I promise she'll behave.\" Mac let out a soft sigh. She didn't want to see the other blonde, but knew she had to be an adult about it. Besides, she felt a little bad for Lauren being stuck in the middle. It was probably a full time job trying to reign Trish in, a task made even more difficult by the woman's affection towards wine. And, Mac felt a bit sorry for Lauren. It was fairly easy to see her embarrassment when it came to Trish. \"Sure.\" She finally replied. \"When?\" They went through making plans. Mac was glad to hear Trish knew nothing about her, and little about the guys. After their exposure on TV, Lauren told Trish that they worked for the government, but nothing else. The letters C.I.A. weren't involved in whatever explanation given. As a result, she said nothing of Mac's job, either. There was no natural Segway into it, so she didn't bother. Mac was grateful. Lunch went surprisingly well. Trish seemed as sober as Mac assumed she could be, and kept her opinions primarily to herself. She was grateful for it because, in all honesty, Mac wasn't entirely certain she wouldn't actually punch Trish if she mouthed off like she had before. Telling one they're lucky for the deaths of their parents, and berating them with rude, probing questions is more than most can stomach once, let alone twice. By the time she made it home later that afternoon, Mac glanced to the clock. If things were going well, Tuck and FDR should be getting ready for their mission. Her heart clenched. Having done similar work, she was worried for them as anyone would be. She hoped they were alright. Somewhere Over Eastern Europe: Tuck stood dumbfounded. His brain had physical trouble comprehending what Foster told him. In the most casual of ways, Foster dropped a bombshell: he'd had sex with Katie. \"I never slept with Lauren!\" he yelled loudly enough Foster could hear him over the plane's engines. \"What?\" \"I never slept with Lauren!\" He yelled louder than before. \"I only let you think that to make you jealous!\" Foster's face fell. \"You never slept with Lauren…\" Tuck's face twisted with rage. \"You slept with my wife!\" He raced for his brother and tackled him, sending the two of them toppling out of the back of the plane and into the pitch blackness of the world outside. The mission was finally over eight hours later, and both were exhausted. They'd been awake for the better part of two days, barely sleeping in the plane on either leg of the trip. After the announcement came over intercom, Tuck reached for his phone. He highlighted a familiar name and sent a very simple text: wheels down in an hour. \"Texting Katie?\" Foster asked tentatively. Tuck glanced up at him through his lashes, sending as much anger in FDR's direction as he could. His phone beeped in his hand, so he glanced down. Angel: I'm glad you're back. Tuck felt himself smile at the simple message. It made him feel better, relaxed after such a heavy job, and it was nothing more than four words. As he slid his phone back into his pocket, Foster spoke again. \"Come on, man.\" FDR whined. \"It's been ten years.\" \"Exactly.\" Tuck replied, pointing a stern finger at his brother. \"Ten years for you to tell me. Ten .\" \"I'm sorry.\" He said for the hundredth time. Tuck grumbled to himself. The only thing that made him feel a little better was the healing cut on his brother's bottom lip. Before they pulled their chutes, he'd managed to land a sharp blow, punching Foster right in the face. Unfortunately, now Tuck had a lot to think about, things he didn't want to. As horrible as it sounded to admit, he expected that sort of behavior from Foster. The man never thought beyond his one-night-stands before Lauren came along. Actually, the fact that they'd slept together bothered him, but not as much as neither of them telling him. That was what made him so angry. Neither of them, for ten years, told him they'd had sex. And he had a child with Katie! But what the hell is he supposed to do with the information now? Should he confront Katie? Should he break up with her for lying to him, or let it go? It was ten years ago, but still, he felt as though someone should have said something. For the moment, everything was simply too new. It'd been maybe twelve hours since Foster off-handedly remarked on the dalliance, so perhaps he just needed time to make it through the anger stage. Tuck had gone to see Katie and Joe as soon as the hour was reasonable. Actually, the way he felt, he'd gone to simply see his son, but Katie was a byproduct. The two of them were in the living room playing video games while Katie watched on from the open kitchen behind them. She smiled a little, glad to see her son so happy his father was there. As she sipped on her coffee, she heard a beep and glanced down. Tuck's cell phone was resting on the table not far from her and he'd received a message from FDR. \"Tuck,\" she called out just loud enough for him to hear. \"Yeah?\" he replied, not taking his eyes off the screen while he and Joe raced one another. \"Franklin just text you.\" \"What's it say?\" Katie reached for the phone and opened the message. \"He said, the final headcount for Nana's tonight is us, him and Lauren, and Mac. Who's Mac?\" \"What?\" Tuck shot up from his seat, giving his race car just enough freedom to slam into a wall and burst into flames. Joe let out a triumphant laugh when it happened, but Katie's attention was solely on Tuck. She watched him shift nervously on his feet, run his fingers through his hair and practically refuse to look at her as he thought. \"Uh,\" he said, stepping away from the couch and heading towards her with a fake smile plastered on his lips. \"Mac's Angela.\" He replied. Katie's face fell and took on a serious, borderline angry tone. \"You met her, remember?\" \"Why does he call her Mac if her name's Angela, then?\" she asked in a tone that matched her expression. \"Just a nickname.\" He replied. Tuck snatched his phone out of her hand, still offering his nervous chuckle. \"I'll just give him a call, then.\" And with that, he scampered away to call his brother back. Katie kept her eyes on him for the journey, her mind racing with angry thoughts. Despite his appearance and the way he acted sometimes, Tuck wasn't entirely smooth. He would get flustered and jittery when put on the spot. She'd never seen him work before so she couldn't attest to whether or not he was better at it there, but at home, Katie knew Tuck wasn't very good at hiding things, at least not from people who knew him well. This was the second time Tuck had acted so strangely at the mention of Angela. While Katie didn't think he'd ever cheat on her, it was clear there was something going on between the two, and she didn't appreciate it. Elsewhere in the house, Tuck was on the phone with Foster. \"Why the hell is Angel coming?\" Tuck asked, sounding crueler than he meant to. \" Because it's my engagement party, and Lauren and I want her there.\" Foster replied in a deadpan tone. \"Don't act like you don't want to hang out with her, too.\" Tuck grumbled insults to himself, but didn't speak them out loud. \" Look, \" Foster said with an exaggerated sigh. \" You're just gonna have to keep it in your pants tonight.\" Tuck opened his mouth to speak, but FDR must have sensed it and spoke quickly as a result. \" Remember, six.\" And then hung up. Tuck growled his frustration. While yes, he wanted to see Mac again and tell her about their mission in Ukraine, he couldn't do that with Katie around. In truth, he couldn't do that with anyone other than FDR in the vicinity, but that wasn't the point. Tuck felt anxious when Katie and Mac met the first time, and that was only for a few brief moments. He didn't want to know what an entire evening would be like. Everyone slowly arrived at Nan's house. Mac was technically the last, but only a few steps behind Tuck, Katie and Joe. As a result, they all congregated around the front of the house where Nana, FDR and Lauren met them. Hellos were spoken and hugs given. Tuck watched Mac out of the corner of his eye as she wove through everyone, giving warm, deep hugs to his family before finally making her way to him. His internal monologue was a ridiculous one, and he hated himself for it. On the one hand, he didn't want to hug her in an overly familiar way in case Katie became jealous. On the other, he couldn't not hug her at all, because they were friends. The end result was something a little stale and cold, awkward even, and she noticed. When Tuck wrapped his arms around Mac, but didn't return the affection as normal, he felt her stiffen in his grasp. When she drew back, she eyed him curiously. \"Come along, now.\" Nana told them all. \"Apparently, there's some news to be had.\" Tuck smirked to himself, a look both Lauren and Foster shared. They were the only three on this side of the family who knew what the gathering was really about. They made their way inside, grabbed glasses of champagne that Foster poured them all, and waited for the coming news. With beaming smiles, and Lauren unable to stop vibrating in place, they officially announced their engagement. Joyful cries filled the air. Even though Tuck already knew, he was swept up in the happiness of the moment again. More hugs, more smiles, and so many fawning glimpses of the ring adorning Lauren's finger. The night progressed with more of the same. The happy mood never shifted. Instead, it clung to everyone there, unwilling to let their smiles fade. But, not everyone was entirely comfortable. Nan was a stickler for living in the moment and forbade her family from keeping their cell phones on them while everyone was seated around the table. She felt they distracted people, and she was right. So, to counter it, it'd become Nana's Law some years ago that any cell phone must be put in a small basket and set off to the side, away from arm's reach. She had a hell of a time getting some of her kin to obey, but no one ever remained defiant for long. That woman's will was ironclad. All sitting around the kitchen table, talking about the coming wedding, asking about how the proposal was made, and telling more embarrassing stories about Foster, all cell phones rested in their little basket near the front door. \"If you'll excuse me.\" Katie said after a little while. She stood and left the table, presumably to head to the bathroom. The family paid her little attention as she disappeared down the hall to the powder room, passing right by the entryway. She reached into the basket for a phone, but it wasn't her, and promptly locked herself in the bathroom. For the last few hours, she'd been watching Tuck and his interaction with Angela. They may have been sitting on opposite sides of the table, but she saw the way Tuck stared at the dark-haired young woman, the way his eyes would twinkle just a little, and linger a second longer than they should. She didn't know if anyone else noticed, but she did. It stood out to Katie like a blinding searchlight in the darkness. Sitting on the toilet, Katie opened Tuck's phone and instantly went to his messages. She wasn't entirely proud of her behavior, but she had to know. She had to know if her assumptions were right. The top conversation, meaning the most recent, was to someone called \"Angel\". It wouldn't take a genius to know who it was, and she opened it as a result. Katie flipped up, loading the oldest conversations before finding a random spot to stop. When she had, she began to read down. A couple of days ago, before Tuck had left for work, he spoke to her. I don't want to hurt you, he said. You won't. I need to do this. I have to see what I'm capable of. You're still healing. Don't push it. Are you going to help me or not? It's just a spar. Fine. Just remember this was YOUR idea. A few hours later, the conversation began again with him saying, How are you feeling? Better, she replied. I took half another pain killer. You were right. Too much too fast. I'm sorry, what was that? UGH! You. Were. Right. Theeeere it is. He replied, even sending a smiley face emoji that made Katie scowl. Pressing her thumb to the screen, she swiped up and sent another flurry of possibly pointless messages out of the screen's view so she could read the more recent. Katie didn't have enough time to sit there and read everything. Just be careful, \"Angel\" said. We will, you know we will. No, I know you'll try, but the two of you are so bloody stupid sometimes, god knows what'll happen. Ha. Ha. Ha. We know what we're doing. Yeah… well… you better come home. And tell Foster that if anything happens to you, I'll kill you both. I will. See you soon. Be careful. We will. The next bit was only a few lines sent that morning around one AM. Wheels down in an hour, Tuck sent her. I'm glad you're home, she said before a second message about an hour later read, Missed you. To Katie's growing anger, Tuck replied with, Missed you, too, Angel, not long before they had to leave for Nana's. That was the end of their conversations, nothing left after that, so Katie closed the phone. She stood, flushed the toilet so anyone listening would've been fooled, and exited the bathroom, fuming about what she'd read. While the conversation could easily be considered benign and nothing friends wouldn't say to one another anyway, especially people who'd known each other so long, she didn't think it was. There was more under the surface, she was certain. Katie slipped the phone back with the others before rejoining the little party without anyone noticing her absence. She plastered a fake smile on her face and participated, all the while eying her ex-husband, and current boyfriend out of the corner of her eye. She was going to have to talk to him later. Tuck was exhausted by the end of the day, but the good kind. It was the sort of exhausted that happened when you laughed too much, smiled too much, and just enjoyed your day to the fullest. Although, he wasn't so foolish as to think some of it wasn't due to his lack of sleep over the last couple of days. Katie let Tuck come in and put Joe to bed. When he emerged from the bedroom a little while later with a heavy smile on his face, she spoke. \"What's the deal with you and Angela?\" she asked bluntly. Tuck's brows pulled together and his head tilted lazily to the side at her accusatory words. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You and Angela.\" She said, crossing her arms over her chest and leveling her stare firmly on him. \"There's something going on with you two. What is it?\" Tuck let out a long sigh, and with it fled all of the good will he'd soaked up throughout the day. The only thing left behind now was the pure exhaustion from the job overseas. \"Nothing,\" he told her. \"There's nothing goin' on between me and Angela.\" \"You're lying.\" Katie's words were growing sharper. \"I've seen the way you look at her. There's something there.\" Tuck shook his head. He wasn't in the mood. \"You don't want to be doing this.\" \"Doing what?\" she challenged. \"Look, I'm going home, okay? Goodnight, Katie.\" He said, with every intention of letting the conversation lie. He turned to leave and nearly made it to the door before Katie said something that made him stop in his tracks. \"You slept with her, didn't you.\" He froze. Slowly, stiffly, he turned around to face her again. Katie's eyes remained cold and distant, her stance angry. She looked like she truly believed what she said, and worse yet, she looked like she thought she held the high ground because of it. Tuck's tired brain was sluggishly trying to catch up. Was this really the situation he found himself in? Unfortunately, Katie took his silence as confirmation. She let out a loud, angry scoff, and shook her head. \"How can you still be friends with someone you slept with? How can you just bring her around like nothing happened when we're trying again? I thought you wanted your family back.\" That snapped his mind into focus, which didn't bode well for Katie. \"I never slept with Angela.\" He hissed under his breath, doing his best to keep from yelling because their son was asleep only a few yards away. \"I've never even kissed her, but you wanna talk about actin' like nothing happened, hm?\" he took measured steps forward, closing the distance between him and Katie. \"Then how 'bout we talk about you fucking Franklin?\" Katie's face fell and she lost a shade of color. It was all the confirmation Tuck needed to know for certain that Foster was telling the truth, even though he knew his brother would never lie about something so serious. In her reaction, he found his footing in that rage again, the rage he felt on the plane that caused him to throw his best friend out of the cargo bay. \"Yeah,\" he growled. \"Never thought I'd find out about that, did you?\" \"That…\" her voice shook a little as she stammered. \"That's not the point. It happened before you and I even started dating.\" His brows rose high. \"Not the point.\" He repeated sternly, angrily. \"You jump up my ass accusing me of fuckin' one of my oldest friends, acting high and mighty with it, but that's not the point?\" he adjusted his footing, struggling to keep his body from reacting because, like before, he wanted to hit something. Katie flinched. He knew she could feel the rage billowing off him. Hell, it was enough to choke him, too. \"You had sex with my brother, my brother, and lied to me about it for a decade. You ever plan on telling me?\" \"It was before we even met.\" She repeated. Her voice had lost all of its previous edge now that she knew he knew the truth. \"You could've told me when we started dating.\" He began, doing his best to reign in what was sure to be an explosive tirade. \"You could've said something when we got engaged, when Joe was born. You could've told me when we got married, or hell, after we got divorced. Christ, you two acted like you'd never met when I introduced you, but you have the balls to accuse me of keeping some kind of secret from you?\" Tuck shook his head disappointedly. He stepped away from Katie and ran his fingers through his short, pale brown hair again. A realization struck him, one he knew was always on the horizon, but never really wanted to acknowledge until now. This was too hard, and it always would be. When he turned, his arms dropped heavily to his side. Tuck's eyes danced over Katie, a woman he once thought was the most beautiful in the world, and who he used to love, with indifference. In reality, part of Tuck felt like he was seeing Katie for the first time, his vision finally untainted by love or desire. \"I can't do this anymore.\" He told her honestly. \"What are you talking about?\" \"This,\" he motioned between them. \"I'm the same person as before, that guy you said was boring and safe. I haven't changed. I still like to sit and watch telly, or go to the pub, and I still care about you, but…\" he shook his head again, \"You're a totally different person to me.\" He took steps back, away from her and towards the door. \"I'll do anything and everything for Joe, but you and me, it can't work, not anymore.\" He gave her a halfhearted wave and gave the front door his attention. Somehow, he didn't feel as bad about breaking it off with Katie as he thought he would. In fact, a weight had been lifted from his shoulders, a weight he hadn't realized was there. \"The thing between you and Angela is different than me and Franklin, though, even if you haven't slept with her.\" Katie said, forcing Tuck to stop before he could reach for the door knob. He turned to her with his face twisted in a scowl. \"What are you talkin' about?\" \"I wasn't in love with Franklin.\" Tuck's brows pulled together, but Katie said nothing else. With the conversation officially dead, Tuck left the house and headed for his car. What Katie said didn't make sense. So she wasn't in love with his brother when they had sex, but how was that different than what Tuck had with Mac? The way she spoke made it sound like he and Mac were a thousand times worse, which was stupid. Like he'd told her, he never even kissed Mac. Did she think Tuck was in love with Mac or something? That was even more daft than everything else. Of course he wasn't in love with her. That was just… of course he wasn't.[Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven It'd been nearly a month since Tuck had ended his relationship with Katie. He still went over to her house to see Joe, have dinner with them and send his son to bed, but little else. His relationship with Katie was more platonic than before, nicer in some ways, but anything romantic had ended at some point during their argument that night. Surprisingly, Tuck was alright with it. He felt like there was proper closure with it this time. Before, she'd left with Joe without a word, really. It was abrupt and it left him with too many unresolved feelings for her. Now, it'd come to its natural conclusion. Sometimes, Tuck's mind would still drift to that random statement Katie left him with that night. It swirled around in his head no matter how much he tried to ignore it. It still didn't make sense to him, really. What did she mean by it? The triumphant shout from Foster brought Tuck out of his thoughts. His eyes shot to the pool table. Two more of Foster's billiard balls were gone. Tuck scowled. He was falling further and further behind in the game. Thankfully, when Foster shot again, he scratched, the cue ball following his nine into the pocket. Tuck did his best to concentrate on the game, but it was more difficult than he'd have liked. Foster noticed. He noticed how his brother's focus waned, how it was clearly somewhere else. He knew what happened between Tuck and Katie, his brother had told him, so he wasn't entirely surprised to see him divided, but Foster also knew something else. After hearing the news, he called Katie to hear the other half of what happened. It wasn't that Tuck hadn't told him as much as possible, it was more that he knew Tuck hadn't said everything. For all his strengths, Tuck had trouble seeing finer details when it came to his own life. Foster knew there were likely a few things he missed. When he spoke to Katie, she was livid that he'd told Tuck the truth. Foster explained it was an off-handed comment meant to smooth things over, but had the opposite effect. Still, he was sure to tell her he wasn't sorry. The only thing he regretted was never saying anything sooner. Katie filled him in on what the entire conversation had been, and how it ended. After venting for roughly ten minutes, bombarding him with questions about \"Angela\" and Tuck's relationship, she finally told him something he already knew about the pair. Foster had been around them much more frequently than Katie, so of course he knew there were feelings there. He wasn't an idiot, but now that things were possibly clearer than before, that the way had been opened, Tuck might see it, too. Tuck's stick made a grating, high-pitched clank as it glanced the edge of the cue balls, sending the white orbs barely more than a foot away at an odd angle. Tuck instantly scowled while Foster winced. Grumbling something, Tuck stood and backed away from the table. He reached for his beer and took a long pull, still scowling at the table. With a sigh, Foster set his stick aside. He stepped towards his brother, Tuck slowly meeting his gaze. \"What?\" he asked a bit tersely. Foster was fairly certain he hadn't realized he'd spoken that way in the first place. Foster arched a brow. \"What's with you?\" he asked, despite being fairly certain he knew the reason. \"Nothing.\" He replied, doing his best to remain casual. FDR didn't believe him and the look he gave said as much. \"What?\" his voice was higher than before, but not without it'd increasingly familiar tone. \"Just… stop.\" FDR sighed. He leveled his gaze on his best friend, a man he'd known more than half his life. \"Tell me what's going on.\" Tuck didn't speak for a moment. Instead, he slipped into the chair nearest him, letting his pool stick rest against the table as he did. His mind still raced, but it never seemed to be with new thoughts. Instead, it was the same over and over again, nearing the point it'd drive him insane. He knew he was overthinking everything, but for some reason couldn't move past any of it. He lingered without resolution in sight. \"I don't know.\" He finally said in a defeated tone. Tuck gradually looked up, his eyes tinted with a level of sadness Foster had seen before. \"It's not supposed to be this hard.\" Foster took a seat beside him. He didn't have to bother asking what Tuck was referring to. There was only ever one thing his brother wanted above all else: a Norman Rockwell family. Tuck was at his happiest when he was part of a couple. FDR knew he had a fear of abandonment, of being alone. It was always there, in the back of his mind, and only visible to those who knew the Englishman best. That sort of thing was a problem with kids torn from an already broken home, they needed to belong. Nana and the rest of FDR's family did their best to make him feel welcomed, and for the most part succeeded, but Foster knew the truth. Sometimes, when Tuck probably thought no one was looking or paying attention, that deep yearning for a family of his own would rise. He'd fall in love easily and deeply. When they were younger it was a problem. Tuck was an attractive man, with an accent women threw themselves at, so he had his pick. Trouble was with who he picked. Some of them were okay, but more were horrible. They were either rude to the family, rude to him, or had an attitude that clashed completely with Tuck's. When \"Angela\" came along, FDR had some hoped that Tuck finally found that someone he needed. They clicked on an important level, that level that showed the world they were actually friends as well as a couple, but it never happened. Then, for a while, Katie was that woman. But it ended, too. Then there was Lauren and the disaster that turned out to be. Tuck was forever searching for that Happily Ever After, so Foster was well aware that the recent end of his second attempt with Katie was what weighed him down. \"You know what I'll say.\" FDR said as he took a long sip of his beer. \"Do I?\" Foster brandished a wide smile, bordering on arrogant. \"Get back on the horse, man.\" Whether he wanted to or not, Tuck let a small scoff of a laugh leave his lips. It made him feel better, a little bit, and that was Foster's point. He just wanted his brother to chuckle. The atmosphere lightened a bit, but Foster knew it wouldn't completely. It was a heavy subject, and one important to the young man, so it wouldn't completely dissipate no matter how many jokes they threw at one another. Foster wanted to broach the obvious subject, but he wouldn't. He'd been repeating it over and over through the years, so what would once more accomplish? He'd have thought that beating Tuck over the head with the obvious connection between him and Mac would make him act, but no such luck. At some point, however, he knew he'd have to spell it out for the idiot. The wedding was set to happen not long after the initial engagement. Neither Foster nor Lauren wanted to wait for the standard year or more, even though they'd only been together for about that long. They wanted to start their forever-lives. It was sweet, in a way. No one ever thought Foster would want to get married in the first place, let alone be so excited to do so as quickly as possible. It was adorable. Preparations for such an event were surprisingly time consuming. Foster was grateful the groom's part wasn't as in depth as the bride's, but he was still a part of it. He'd initially thought that having the ceremony and reception on Nan's picturesque property would save both time and money, and while it did, it didn't seem to remove any steps. Again grateful, Foster only had to offer his sparse opinion on things Lauren brought to him, and deal with tux fittings. He didn't even have to wrangle a lot of groomsmen. In fact, there was only Tuck who would stand on his side, and Trish on Lauren's, with thirty-five guests. It was a very small affair. FDR and Tuck were in the middle of getting their tuxes fitted for the second and final time. FDR was stood on the small platform surrounded by four mirrors so he could have every possible view, and he enjoyed them all. He hadn't removed the smile from his lips as he turned one way and then the other repeatedly. His tuxedo was the very basic of models. It was a Calvin Klein, navy blue ensemble cut perfectly to his frame. He liked it. He liked it a lot. \"Not bad.\" He crooned at his own reflection. \"Not bad at all.\" \"Sure you shouldn't be marrying yourself, mate?\" Tuck teased. He was standing a few feet away with the tailor tending to him. The jacket needed a touch more work, the sleeves being too long for him. \"I am tempted.\" He chuckled. With a final approving glance, he spun to look at his best man. Foster nodded nonchalantly. \"So, who are you bringing?\" he asked, stepping down from the platform with a flourished step. Tuck shot him an annoyed glance just briefly before replying, \"No one.\" \"Why not?\" Foster asked before he could stop himself. He'd forgotten, if even just a moment, that Tuck was no longer taking Katie. \"How about Mac?\" he offered quickly, trying to overshadow his previous question. \"What about her?\" he asked. There is was again, that edge. Foster had to fight the urge to roll his eyes when he heard it. \"Ask her.\" He said a bit sarcastically. He could see Tuck weighing the pros and cons of it, which he thought was stupid. They were both going to be attending the wedding in the first place, both close friends, and they both got along well with one another. Since they were single, why not go together? But Tuck continued to hesitate and for some reason, this time, FDR had had enough. \"Okay, listen here, dumbass,\" he said briskly. Tuck flinched and his eyes went wide. \"Enough, okay? Enough. You love Mac, she loves you. Take her to the damn wedding.\" Tuck continued to stare at him, blinking in silence. Foster knew he'd thrown a lot at him all at once, and it was probably taking a second to absorb, but when it did, he scowled. Without a word, Tuck returned to his final fitting. Foster rolled his eyes. Throughout the rest of the day, Tuck found himself dwelling a little more on his brother's crass outburst than he had Katie's. Foster knew him better, and even though he thought FDR was full of shit, he was the second person to say something, and it was enough to force him to pause. Asking her to the wedding made sense, and it'd give him enough of a reason to spend time with her, but he doubted the rest. Still, hearing it twice from two separate people did make him think. He knew he cared about her. That much was obvious. He cared about her greatly, but love was something else entirely, at least in the way the others meant. They meant deeply and resoundingly, like someone to spend the rest of his life with. On some level, he was. He had no plans of cutting her out of his life at any point in time, so she'd always be there, but again, they meant on a different level. Tuck wasn't as sure as everyone else seemed to be about it. There were certain things he couldn't deny, however, he wasn't as steadfast as they were. Still, perhaps he should invite her to be his date. The wedding was in two weeks, which would give him enough time to ask her, and for them to make any preparations they'd have to make. He'd enjoy going with her, too, especially since Katie and Joe would be there. It wasn't that he wanted to show off in front of his ex, but more that he didn't want to be alone when he was fairly certain she was bringing someone. It was a pride issue, and who better to ask than someone he actually liked spending time with. Finding his resolve, Tuck decided he'd stop by her apartment on his way home. It would be a little late, but worth the trip. Besides, he hadn't seen her in a while, and wanted to. Mac was jogging through her apartment to finish getting ready. She was late and her hairdryer broke halfway through using it, leaving her hair in damp tendrils. Thankfully, it wasn't too bad, but she'd lost more time than she would have liked trying to get the blow-dryer to work again. As a result, she was running late. She made her way quickly across the floor plan of her place, from the kitchen and back to her bathroom upstairs. She'd forgotten her concealer, the new tub she'd purchased a couple of days ago. She'd left it on her kitchen island with every intention of taking it to her bathroom, but she'd never remembered. As Mac returned to the bathroom with her concealer, she took her seat on the vanity. Pulling down the neckline of her shirt, she began to dab the makeup into place. Her shirt wasn't overly revealing, but when wearing something that was low-cut in any regard, she'd put on makeup. There was always the off-chance that the shirt would shift, or she'd lean forward enough to reveal what was hidden. Her scars stood out in her mind, like a beacon in pitch black, so she covered them. As she patted the final bits of concealer into place, blending it out so it'd remain as close to her skin tone as she could, there was a knock at her door. She felt a jolt of excitement and worry because she wasn't entirely finished getting ready. When another trio of knocks sounded, she knew she had to hurry up and answer it. She made her way out of the bathroom and quickly to the front door. Just before opening it, she fluffed her hair and plastered a smile on her face. When she opened the door, however, the smile faltered. Tuck was standing on the other side in the hall, and while she was happy to see him, she was surprised by it. \"Tucker, hey.\" She said, her greeting reflecting her shock. \"What're ya doin' here?\" \"Was hoping to speak with you.\" He said. \"Mind if I come in?\" \"No, right, yeah.\" She said strangely before stepping aside and letting him into the apartment. Mac's heart began to race, but not for the usual reasons when Tuck was around. He walked a few feet into her apartment, but didn't make it past her kitchen before turning around to face her. \"You're going to the wedding, yeah?\" \"Well, yeah, of course.\" She nodded. He slid his hands into his pockets and shifted his weight oddly. Mac noticed. He seemed unsure for some reason. \"Would you like to go with me?\" Her jaw went lax and her eyes a bit wide at his question. She was a little surprised by it, but was so disappointed, too. Mac tried to speak, but words weren't exactly forthcoming. Her hesitation seemed to be enough to make Tuck rethink his proposal. \"Unless you don't want to.\" He said quickly. \"No,\" she said just as fast. \"No, I'd've loved to, but I,\" her statement dwindled a bit. \"I've a date, Tuck.\" She noticed him flinch ever-so-slightly, and his face go blank. She felt almost immediate guilt, but it wasn't true. Mac would have loved to attend the wedding with him, she simply couldn't. In all honesty, it never donned on her that he might ask, so she made other arrangements. \"Oh,\" he finally said. \"Well then, I suppose I should go.\" Mac opened her mouth to speak again, to say something that might remove some of the strange tension and awkwardness that filled the room, but she never had the chance. Instead, there was another knock at her door. Mac's heart sank and her eyes drifted shut with a sigh. When she met his gaze again, Tuck seemed confused, as though he sensed what was about to happen. Having no choice, Mac turned and opened the door, revealing her guest. It was a young man, inches taller than Tuck. He was lean in build, relatively attractive, but plain in the Englishman's eyes. \"Richard, hello.\" Mac said in her \"Angela\" voice. \"Please, come in.\" \"You look great.\" He told her as he entered. Tuck did his best not to scowl, but he did regardless. \"Uh, hi.\" He said when he saw Tuck. \"Richard, this is my friend Tuck. Tuck, Richard.\" She noticed the uncomfortable handshake between the two. \"Well, um…\" Mac muttered. \"Right,\" Tuck gave a sharp nod. \"Nice to meet you.\" He said to Richard without sounding a bit grateful. \"I'll talk to you later.\" With a soft nod, Tuck skirted past the two and out the door. Mac felt terrible the moment he was gone. If she'd thought on any level that he'd ask her to go with him to the wedding, she wouldn't have asked Richard. For the last three weeks, she and Richard had been dating. It was something she thought normal, something that would help acclimate her into a civilian life. When getting coffee one morning at a shop, he asked to join her, so she let him. They hit it off relatively well and began dating shortly after. It made sense to ask him if he'd join her. She didn't want to go alone, after all. Still, she had made a previous arrangement with Richard, so she couldn't cancel on him. Yet, now she was regretting the fact. ","Summary":" Hello All! This is just a little something that I hope you guys like. Enjoy! Chapter 1 Being ground"},{"Movie":"This Means War","Title":"Collateral Damage","Author":"S. A. L. Stratton","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9184291","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Mission is a go. Repeat, you are green to go. Intercept and apprehend the Heinrich brothers. Secure the device. And remember, this mission is covert. \" Boss reiterated our mission objective to us via our earpieces. Our mission was to capture two brothers, Karl and Jonas Heinrich. They were two...very bad men, who were very good businessmen in the wrong kind of business. And we were supposed to bring them in. Everything was planned, and I could only hope it went smoothly. The Boss Lady would roast us alive if we messed this up. I was already in the club, and had already made a friend with a lovely woman called Xenia. I watched as my partners walked inside, and spotted me. I saw FDR smirk and I knew what was about to happen. They headed over, and Xenia finally took notice of the two attractive men approaching us. \"Those men are walking towards us.\" She whispered to me, her French accent sounding stronger than it had a moment ago. I smiled at that, and stood up straighter as Tuck and FDR got closer. \"You must relax, Xenia, and follow my lead.\" I said, before my partners reached us. They stopped in front of us, and I knew they had their game faces on. Well, FDR certainly had his game face on. I'd seen the look on his face before, when we used to go clubbing together and he'd seen a girl he decided to seduce. Yet he was looking more at me, then at Xenia. I did a mental victory dance as it meant the outfit and wig I'd chosen was working. I was supposed to distract the youngest Heinrich brother, and if I was getting this reaction from Franklin then I was obviously going to complete my part of our plan. \"Hi, my name is Xenia and this is my friend, Britta.\" She introduced herself, holding her hand out and both of my partners shook it. \"Pleased to meet you. I'm Tuck.\" He said, and I inwardly smiled at the familiar English accent. I loved his accent. It reminded me of old British movies, and Pierce Brosnan. He was my favourite Bond, before Daniel Craig came along. \"FDR.\" FDR lifted my hand and pressed his soft lips to the back of it, his eyes connecting with mine, showing the mischief in them. I smiled at him, beaming past ruby red lips. \"So what brings you to Hong Kong?\" I teased them, knowing full well why we were here and what we had to accomplish, but despite the seriousness of the job, I had to get some fun out of it. \"Business or pleasure?\" \"Pleasure.\" FDR replied, winking at me, and I struggled not to blush. I mean, yes I know it's FDR, but he was still ridiculously attractive. \"Business.\" Tuck corrected him, his head fully in the mission and not much else, though his eyes would stray to me occasionally. I wonder if he liked the brunette wig I was wearing. It was a good wig. You wouldn't be able to tell that it wasn't my real hair. \"A little of both.\" FDR said. \"What kind of business are you in?\" Xenia questioned. I raised an eyebrow at them, waiting to hear their answers which would no doubt amuse me to no end. Tuck crossed his arms over his chest, and FDR smiled at Xenia's question. \"I am a cruise ship captain of a very large vessel. My small friend here is a kick-ass travel agent.\" He said, and I almost laughed. Yet, I had to stay in role, and as FDR was hitting on me right now, I had to play along. Even if Tuck's expression at FDR's 'small friend' comment made me want double over laughing. It was halfway between pissed and amused. Yet as I struggled to stop myself from laughing, a pick-up line popped into my head and with a smirk, I said it. \"Permission to come aboard, captain?\" I asked, staring up at FDR, who just stared back until Tuck gripped his shoulder, and I grinned at him instead, breaking our eye contact. \"On that note, will you excuse us, ladies, because we do have work to do.\" Tuck said, giving me a look, which was both amused and annoyed, whilst reprimanding me from encouraging FDR to lose focus. \"No, we don't.\" FDR said, still staring at me and Xenia. \"Yes, we do.\" Tuck said, walking away from us, getting into position. I pouted at FDR, seeing that the Heinrich brothers had arrived and had climbed out of their helicopter. The fun was over, and now it was time to get my head in the game. \"Yes, we do.\" FDR repeated, straightening up, and winking at me, before he too moved away. I turned to Xenia, and smiled at her, and we started to talk again. Heinrich walked past me, and I winked and smiled seductively at the youngest, Jonas, as I caught his eye. He blushed and stumbled, but as the eldest brother turned to glare at me for taking his brother's attention, I was already facing the bar. \"The way you can turn even the most evil of men to mush with just a wink and a smile will always astound me.\" Tuck's voice said, coming through my earpiece. I smiled, though it would have looked like I was smiling at something that Xenia had said to me. Inwardly though, I was grimacing. My womanly wiles only seemed to work on pretty much everyone but Tuck. I could hear FDR being hit on by another girl through my ear piece, which made me want to laugh again. That guy couldn't go anywhere without being hit on. Tuck was silent again, but I could see him in my peripheral vision, and I kept my eye on him as I barely paid attention to the conversation I was having with Xenia. I didn't see when the Heinrich's had gone into the guarded room, but I assumed they were already exchanging the money for the device. Collins, the Boss Lady, hadn't even informed us as to what the device was, just that it wasn't safe and we needed to retrieve it. \"Shots fired. Men down.\" Bothwick informed us via our earpieces. Seconds later, the Heinrich brothers walked out of the room, with both cases in hand. They were just about to walk past Tuck, when FDR gave us the okay. \"All right. Here we go.\" I knocked out one of the security guards that walked past me with a punch to his solar plexus, using my other hand to remove his weapon from his jacket. I held it behind my back as I slowly stalked forward. The eldest Heinrich turned around, and fired his gun up into the air, panicking the people at the party, including Xenia. I moved forward quickly, following Tuck and FDR as we chased the Heinrich's onto the helipad. I picked off some of the guards who were watching the helicopter that they had arrived in, diving as Tuck used a sub-machine gun to take out those I missed. \"Mag. I need a mag.\" I heard Tuck shout at FDR, as I took out the pilot. FDR ran towards him, taking his spare mag out of his top right pocket and handing to him, before taking out another guard. I looked back at Tuck, and he nodded at me, signalling another play. I kicked off my shoes, managing to flick them in the air, hitting one guard in the stomach, and breaking another's nose. I went to take on Heinrich, with Tuck as my back-up, and I punched him in the face, and kneed him in the stomach, before I let him 'over-power' me. It was the damsel in distress routine. The bad guy gets lulled into a false sense of security, thinking that because I'm a small, dainty woman that I'm not as equipped at handling myself as the others, especially in a small, studded black dress. \"Drop your weapons or I'll make a hole in her pretty little face,\" He threatened. Tuck and FDR made a show of hesitating, before lowering their weapons but not dropping them. \"I said, drop them.\" I took that as my cue. I slammed my elbow into his gut, grabbing his hand and wrenching the gun out of it, before I took his legs out from underneath him. Apparently that pissed off his younger brother, who, after being kicked out of the helicopter by Tuck, picked himself up and charged at me. With Tuck distracted by Karl, the eldest brother, and FDR distracted with the remaining henchmen, Jonas and I fought near the edge of the building and when he stumbled, he grabbed hold of me to steady him which resulted in me taking a tumble of the edge. I grabbed onto the ledge, and attempted to pull myself up, but couldn't. I looked up and saw both Heinrich brothers looking down at me. Tuck must have gotten distracted by some of their bodyguards. \"Kill her.\" Karl ordered his younger brother, passing him a gun. After that, he leaped off the building and pulled his parachute open, gliding away to safety. I noticed Jonas was holding the black case in his other hand. The one with the device inside. The silver case with the money must've been dropped, because money was floating around me because of the helicopter blades causing a breeze. He seemed hesitant to kill me, maybe because I was a woman, maybe because he thought I was pretty, who knows, but it would work out in my favor. It would buy me time until either Tuck or FDR came to my rescue, which really knocked my inner feminist back a few pegs. \"Rach!\" I heard FDR yell, hopefully working his way towards me. I heard gunfire still, which meant that they were still busy. Until it suddenly stopped and Jonas was half-way to falling to his death and I had to let go of the ledge with one hand to catch the case, before we lost the device. FDR was trying to reel Jonas back in, but Jonas ripped FDR's jacket pocket off and he fell. I winced as I imagined the impact of his body hitting the pavement, and closed my eyes for a second to get rid of the mental images. Tuck's face appeared above me, and I tossed FDR the case, so that Tuck could help me up. Once I was standing on solid ground again, we watched the scene unfold on the ground below as we caught our breath back. Jonas' body had fallen on top of a car, and people were swarming it now. I winced, before we turned away from it. I tugged off the brunette wig, tossing it away, before shaking my blonde hair free so that it fell naturally around my shoulders. Now my head was a lot less hot, and I felt more like myself again. Being brunette had been fun, but blonde was better. \"Heinrich is not gonna be happy.\" FDR remarked. \"I'm more concerned about the boss.\" Tuck replied, and I found myself nodding, kneeling down to grab my heels. Tuck held my hand as I slipped them back on, so I didn't stumble over, and then tucked my hand into the crook of his arm as we walked away. FDR wrapped his arm around my waist, and I did the same. \"Definitely.\" I said, as I made sure one of the guys had the case. FDR still held it in his spare hand, and I felt myself relax a bit more. At least we still had something to bring back to Collins. We weren't totally screwed. \"Hey, you think that girl is still here?\" FDR questioned. Tuck and I exchanged a smile, and I rolled my eyes at him. \"Franklin, I love you, but think with your head for once. Not with what's in your pants. It has led you wrong far too many times for it to be the voice of reason. Need I remind you about Kandahar?\" I answered him, earning a laugh from Tuck and a swat on the behind from FDR. I nearly socked him for that, but that was what happened every time I was 'sassy' to him, and when he was sarcastic to me, I slapped him on the back of the head. We had a system. \"What happened to 'Permission to come aboard, Captain?', huh?\" FDR questioned. \"That was my character, Britta, talking, dear. I have no intentions of climbing aboard your vessel in the near future.\" I said. \"So there's hope in the far off future?\" FDR joked. \"Sweetie, shut your mouth before I shoot you.\"[Chapter 2] We had one more night in Hong Kong before we had to fly back to Los Angeles. We spent the day filing paperwork for the local authorities, and signing coroner's reports for Jonas Heinrich's body, and securing the device into a CIA handler's...hands. But now we were free to do whatever we pleased. I had wanted to lounge about our hotel suite - which had two bedrooms, one with twin beds and one with a double, and you can guess, as I was the only female, who got the double bed all to herself - watching American TV shows in Chinese without the subtitles, and eating copious amounts of room service. Then maybe we'd play some drinking games before we all separated to our different rooms. Yet I was standing in yet another tight fitted black dress in a different club, watching Franklin dance with some Chinese bimbo who had pounced on him as soon as she'd seen the Rolex I had bought him for last Christmas. Tuck and I stuck to the bar, and, out of instinct more than anything, our eyes scanned the bar for all the exits and any immediate threats. It was FDR's fault we were here, and partly our fault. It was partly our fault as we still had a hard time refusing to go along with Franklin's bad ideas. But soon FDR was back with us, and had convinced Tuck to go shot for shot with him. I knew that it wouldn't end well if all three of us played, since I would win and no one would be sober enough to steer us back down the road to the hotel. Soon both my partners were completely wasted, and were leaning on me, as I led them out of the club. \"You know, Rachel, you smell like the beach.\" FDR announced, rather loudly, as I struggled to keep them both upright and moving forward. I rolled my eyes. So they were at the truth-telling part of inebriation. This would be fun. \"She does! And her hair is so blonde! It's like staring at the sun!\" Tuck agreed, and I snorted in amusement. So tonight I smell like the beach, and my hair is so blonde it could blind a person. Hmm...they could have said things that were a lot worse than that. \"Thanks guys.\" \"Rachel, I love you. You are my best friend, other than Frank.\" Tuck confessed, and I smiled. I already knew that, but it was still sweet of him to say, even if he was drunk and everything he says should be taken with a pinch of salt. \"I love Rachel too. She's my best friend too! Other than you, buddy!\" FDR said, patting Tuck's shoulder awkwardly, as he was leaning around me to do it. I just rolled my eyes, as I pushed them into the elevator of our hotel building and pressed the button to the floor we were staying at for the night. I leaned them against the walls of the elevator, and rubbed my shoulders to stop them from throbbing too much. Tuck and FDR weighed a lot more when they were drunk, mostly because they acted as though they were dead weight. Once we were at our floor, I pushed Tuck and FDR into our suite, and helped them get into bed. Once I made sure they had a sick bucket and a glass of water beside them should they need it sometime during the night, I headed to bed myself. I changed out of the second-skin dress and then put my night dress on, and climbed into bed. I didn't feel sorry at all for Tuck and FDR. Tomorrow, they'd be hungover, and there's a chance we'd have to face Collins and her wrath, so to get drunk the night before that was a stupid move on their behalf. They would not enjoy themselves tomorrow morning. I felt slightly more comfortable now I was back on American soil and wearing my regular clothes. There is nothing better than wearing leather jeans, a loose t-shirt and a leather jacket with my regular boots again. Tuck, FDR and I were headed across the foyer of the agency, joking and poking fun at each other as we often did, when what we dreaded happened. \"Tuck, FDR, Rachel.\" Boss called, causing us to look up at the balcony to find her. She looked pissed. She gestured for us to go up, and then turned on her heel and strutted away. We all exchanged a look of dread. \"She is going to ground us.\" I whispered, as we headed up. \"Don't say that. You'll jinx us.\" FDR replied. And in return I rolled my eyes. We were so grounded. We didn't complete our mission to the mission parameters and Heinrich was gonna be pissed we killed his baby brother. Which would mean he would hunt us down, though hopefully that would take a lot of effort on his part. \"There's nothing to jinx. It was supposed to be covert and we failed on that front completely.\" I whispered back to him, as we neared her office door. We walked into the office and sat down, with me in the middle of the guys, facing the boss head on. I didn't really like that at all. It was like staring into the eyes of an angry snake, poised to strike and hungry for blood. \"6 men in the morgue. A body in the middle of the street.\" She stated, bluntly. Getting straight to it was Collins' way. She didn't do polite chit-chat. \"Yes, but to be fair, we did manage to-\" Tuck started, until she pointed at him, and told him to shut up. \"To-That's me shutting up, right now.\" \"The mission parameters of the Heinrich case were clearly indicated to be covert,\" She said, smacking down a photograph, with Jonas' body on top of a heavily damaged car in the middle of a crowded street, onto her desk. I winced. \"Thanks to you three geniuses Heinrich will be seeking revenge for his brother's death. You guys are grounded.\" \"What?\" FDR questioned. \"Grounded?\" Tuck repeated. I just took a deep breath and shook my head, not willing to say anything that would make her punish us more. This was going to be torture. Being an agent for the CIA was only a cool, fun job when you were out in the field. No one wanted to be stuck behind the desk if you're a field agent. It was like asking a fireman not to run into a burning building because he was retired. Or expecting Batman not to investigate a crime in Gotham just because it's a little dangerous. When she let us go, we went to our shared office. Tuck and FDR's desks faced each other, and mine was just beyond theirs facing the entrance to our joint open plan office as it were. It was really private, if I was being honest. The walls were made of glass. We just sat there for most of the day, bored out of our minds. Tuck spun his gun around on his desk, and Frank just kept tapping a complex rhythm to go with the noise it made. And that's what happened for the next hour. I did paperwork that I needed to catch up on, and occasionally played Doodle Jump on my iPhone, and the boys sat there and huffed about not having anything to do. When FDR started complaining again, I stood up, grabbed my gun and tucked it into my waistband. \"Get up. Let's go.\" I said, walking round my desk and standing between theirs. They both did as they were told, and I smirked. They were so bored they were actually listening to me for a change. I wondered for a moment what else I could get them to do today. \"Where are we going?\" Tuck asked. \"Bring your weapons, boys. Let's go shoot the paper people to relieve some boredom.\" I smiled, walking in the direction of the firing range. We spent the rest of the afternoon firing at the targets, trying to best each other, before we finally clocked out and went home. It was a boring day, so when I got home, the last thing I wanted to do was nothing, but I didn't really want to go out either. So I settled for making microwave popcorn, popping a movie on and just chilling out in my sweats. I was halfway through being bored to death by the Notebook when my phone vibrated against my leg. I paused the movie and looked at the caller I.D. Tuck was calling. \"This is Rachel Simmonds of Virgin Airlines speaking. How may I be of assistance?\" I answered the phone in my best fake overly-optimistic air hostess impression. \" Why do you always answer the phone like that to me ?\" Tuck questioned. \"To remind you that you should never complain about being a fake travel agent. I pulled the short stick here. I mean, come on, air hostess? I knew I shouldn't have tried sarcasm for the first time when they were giving me my fake-real identity,\" I joked, smiling at the phone as I heard Tuck laugh. \"So what's up?\" \" FDR asked me to remind you that Nana wanted you round tomorrow. He said that she said she'll hunt you down if you don't make an appearance. \" Tuck said, making me roll my eyes. \"Why on earth would I not show up to Nana's?\" I asked, sarcastically. I love Nana, but she was really intense about the romance aspect of my personal life. She was always trying to set me up with people, because she wanted great-grandchildren. I was just not in that place in my life. I mean, I'm an assassin for the CIA. I'm not exactly good mother material. \" You just don't want her to badger you about giving her some great-grandchildren. \" Tuck replied, seemingly psychic today, making me want to club myself to death with the phone while he listened. \"I love the woman, and I'm eternally grateful it was her and my grandpa that picked me up from that foster home but why does she want me to have children all the time? I'm not even dating anybody.\" I whined down the phone. \" She loves you and wants you to be happy. It's what we all want, Rach .\" Tuck's voice got softer and it almost made me melt into a giant puddle on my couch. \"Stop it with the accent, buddy. You know no American woman can resist it!\" I only half-joked to him, grinning again as I heard him laugh down the phone. \" There's no off-switch, love. Just turn up tomorrow, would you? \" He asked. \"Fine! I'm there, but if FDR forgets dessert, I'm going to kill him. Okay?\" \" I'll hold him down for you, love. See you tomorrow, Rach .\" \"See you tomorrow, Tuck.\" I replied, hanging up the phone. Suddenly the Notebook didn't seem like a terrible movie anymore. I carried on watching the dumb movie with a giant dopey grin on my face, until my phone rang again. It was my best girl-friend, Lauren. Whenever I wasn't away on 'business' I usually spent time hanging out with Lauren, being one of her subjects at her product control group events, or hanging out a restaurant or bar. Lauren and Trish, our other friend, were who I hung out with when I need female company. I could have always made friends with some of the women at work, but, believe it or not, Lauren and Trish's normal civilian lives interest me more than talking more about cases we're all working on. Lauren and Trish were like my escape from work. \"What's up, Lauren?\" I questioned. \" Guess who I bumped into yesterday? \" Lauren asked. One of the things I liked about Lauren is she jumped straight into the conversation, and didn't bother with all the pointless chit-chat first. A bit like Collins. Though I appreciate it a little bit more with Lauren than Collins. \"The ex?\" I guessed, knowing I was probably right. \" Guess who he was with ?\" She prompted me. \"I'm going with a new girlfriend. Or boyfriend, keeping all options open.\" I replied, chewing on some popcorn between words. \" His new perky, gorgeous fiancee. He's engaged, Rachel. Engaged! And I'm still single. You know, Trish suggested online dating, but I don't know. What do you think? \" I thought about that for a second before I answered. If I at least made it look like I was making an effort to find someone to have her great-grandbabies with, maybe Nana wouldn't harp on about it for an hour tomorrow. Then again, she'd probably ask me word for word what I put down on my profile to make sure I was making myself sound attractive. \"I think it's a good idea. Trish could be having a golden moment.\" I joked, teasing her about all the times Trish has steered us wrong on nights out. One time she convinced us to go to a gay bar so we wouldn't get hit on, for it to be a lesbian bar and we spent most of the night having to reject women's advances. \" You think so? Will you sign up as well? \" \"Yeah. If it works out well for you, I might sign up.\" \" Have you gotten that friend of yours to ask you out yet? \" Lauren asked me, referring to Tuck. I rolled my eyes. Of course she would bring up a conversation we'd had months ago. She'd gotten me to confess why I hadn't dated anyone in a few months, and now she kept bringing it up. \"Oh look at that, I've got to hang up now.\" I said, but Lauren started to speak again. \" It'll happen, I promise. He'd be a fool to not see how beautiful, sexy, smart and charming you really are .\" Lauren's words boosted my confidence and ego, and I decided to return the favour. \"Yeah, just like your ex was a blind douche, because he clearly let the best he's ever gonna get slip through his fingers.\" \" Thanks, hon. Talk soon? \" \"Yeah, talk soon. Bye.\" I hung up the phone, and decided to give up on the Notebook and just go to bed. I would need as much beauty sleep as possible to deal with Nana's onslaught of questions about my love life, and the possibility of children in my future. It was nice and sunny when I arrived at Nana's the next day. I was wearing a blue bird-print dress with white wedged sandals. I left my hair down, but pulled it back slightly with a length of dark blue ribbon. Nana would hopefully approve. If I had worn the short and tank top combo I had wanted, she probably have murdered me. So I put on the dress to please her. I climbed out of my SUV, remembering the first time I ever laid eyes on this house. I was twelve and had been bumped from one foster family to the next, but then Nana and Grandpa Foster adopted me, and raised me along with their grandson, Franklin. I remember all the times FDR, Tuck and I spent playing around this house. Smiling I made my way through the house and out the back. The gathering was in the garden, and I managed to sneak past Nana, for now, and headed towards Tuck and FDR who were sat at one of the lawn tables. They never really conversed with anyone, but each other and me, at Nana's family gatherings. So they would sit themselves at the edge of the party, and people would approach them if they felt like it. Which, admittedly, wasn't often. \"Boys,\" I nodded to them, as I lowered myself into the chair next to Tuck. They both stared at me, surprise on their faces, and I raised an eyebrow at them. I started to panic. Did I have my breakfast on my face? I mean, I ate granola and fruit for breakfast, but it was still a possibility. \"What?\" \"You look really beautiful, Rach.\" Tuck said, making me smile and shake my head. \"Thanks, Tuck,\" I looked at FDR, and then his hands, and noticed the plate of cake in them. And it was my favourite: gluten-free chocolate cake. How did I know it was gluten-free? Because I used to have small wheat intolerance when I was younger and FDR still buys the gluten-free cake. He was a sweetie like that. Always looking out for me, because he was an orphan and I was as good as one. The two messed-up kids with no one else really but each other. \"Where's th-?\" \"It's in the kitchen. I hid you a slice. You know where it is.\" FDR replied, and I quickly got up and raced back inside, heading straight to the pantry, and the small, unused cupboard where my cake was hidden. We always hid stuff there, because Nana never used it. I tore through the kitchen and into the pantry, nearly yanked the cupboard door off its hinges before I found my present. My yummy, gluten-free present. 3rd Person P.O.V \"This is gluten-free. Try a taste.\" FDR held out his plate towards his best friend, who wasn't really giving him his attention. He was staring at Rachel as she disappeared back into the house in her desperate search for cake. Neither man noticed that Nana Foster had spotted them sitting as close to the edge of the gathering as they could all alone, and had started towards them. \"Why the heck are you two sitting over here all by yourselves?\" She demanded, to the amusement of both men. \"You're not gonna make me any great-grandbabies this way.\" \"It is a family gathering, Nana. I don't think you want us making any great-grandbabies today.\" FDR remarked, smartly, ignoring the sour look his grandmother had given him in return. \"To be fair, I have already provided you with a wonderful great-grandchild.\" Tuck reminded her, and FDR pointed at him as if to help him prove his point as he chewed his mouthful of cake, and hoping Rachel would turn up to save them from Nana's questions. \"Yeah, but that doesn't count because you screwed it all up.\" \"Ouch.\" And as if she sensed that Tuck had been wounded in some way, Rachel appeared behind her foster grandmother and placed a kiss on the old woman's cheek. Nana turned and took the cake out of Rachel's hand, placing it on the table, ignoring the way Rachel stared at it as if she couldn't bear to have been parted with it. If there was one thing that Rachel loved, it was the cake that FDR always bought for her. And right now, after she tore her gaze away from it, she gave her 'grandmother' a look of pure and utter disbelief, as though she couldn't believe that Nana had parted her from the slice of heaven that she had intended on feasting upon. \"When did you get here, missy?\" Nana interrogated. \"I've only just gotten here, Nana. I was getting cake.\" \"Cake isn't going to help you find a man and give me my great-grandbabies.\" \"Yes, but it makes me feel better about not providing you with the great-grandbabies you deserve, Nana. So really, the cake is a necessity.\" Rachel went to grab the cake again, but Nana smacked her hand away from it, making Rachel grumble under her breath. Thankfully, Grandpa Foster walked over, before Rachel pounced on the old lady for keeping her away from her cake. \"Rachel, sweetheart. What are you doing over here when you could be dancing with me?\" The old man asked her, taking her hand and not really giving her much option but to dance with him. Nana, Tuck and FDR watched as Grandpa led her to where other family members were dancing, and continued to watch as they began to dance. Nana noticed how both her boys watched with avid interest as FDR's grandfather twirled Rachel around, and listened to her laugh as the old man probably cracked a joke. She smiled a knowing smile before she launched an offensive. \"Rachel's a beautiful, smart, single girl. Why don't one of you date her, marry her and give me the beautiful great-grandbabies I want?\" Nana asked, clearly shocking the two younger men. They looked at each other, then at Nana, than past her to Rachel. \"Rachel's our best friend, Nana!\" FDR protested, even though he wasn't exactly turned off the idea. \"I may be an old lady, but I can still see when my two boys like a girl. And my most special girl, at that. Rachel's one of a kind, and some man's gonna realise that some day and snap her up, then you'll be sorry.\" Nana warned them, not knowing that she'd just given them both a realisation, and started something she probably shouldn't have. Rachel and Grandpa Foster walked back over, and Nana dropped the subject for now, letting them think it over. She wanted one of her boys to snap her Rachel up. She'd been praying for it to happen since they were kids, but they never got their acts together. She always assumed it would be Tuck, but FDR had looked at Rachel just a moment ago, the same way his grandpa still looked at her, though little Franklin probably didn't realise he was. \"Nana, my friend is trying to convince me to sign up to this online dating thing. If I do that, can I please eat my cake?\" Rachel almost resulted to begging her foster grandmother as she approached the old lady, and her two best friends. Nana smiled at her, sending a look backwards to FDR and Tuck as if to say 'I told you so', before she answered Rachel's question. They just looked at each other with a look. One that said 'we need to have an intervention for Rachel', because clearly she was desperate enough for cake to upload her personal information onto a dating website. \"Yes, dear. It's a step in the right direction. Eat your cake. Franklin bought it for you.\" Nana smiled. \"Come on, Lil,\" Grandpa Foster said, kissing his wife, before taking her by the hand. \"Let's show these kids how it's done, huh? Ciao.\" Rachel sat back down in her seat, and began eating her cake, smiling as she did so as she watched her foster grandparents dance while looking into each other's eyes. It was so beautiful to see two people still as in love as they were at their age. \"It's kind of gross when they kiss,\" And then FDR had to ruin the moment as per usual. Rachel shook her head, as she turned her attention onto FDR, knowing that's what he wanted. He looked away from her though, which made her raise an eyebrow. She followed his gaze to one of the cousins' kids running round in a circle with a bucket on his head. \"God I love that kid. Hm? Hey? What's going on?\" Rachel turned and looked at Tuck, who was still watching the old couple as they slow danced on the lawn. \"Hey, Mr. Deep-In-Thought. You wanna talk about it?\" Frank asked his best friend, both him and Rachel waiting for Tuck's answer. \"I was just-That kind of thing's lovely, isn't it?\" Tuck answered, gesturing towards the Nana and Grandpa Foster. Rachel smiled at the sappy romantic that lived within Tuck sometimes. \"It's really lovely.\" \"What's lovely?\" FDR questioned. Rachel rolled her eyes. Of course, he didn't get it. He probably didn't really understand romance because of all of his one-night stands leaving him emotionally stunted and unattainable. \"I love the way they look into each other's eyes like that.\" Tuck explained, and Rachel resisted her inner teenage girl instinct to sigh and say 'Awww….'. Why does every cute thing he says have to be emphasized by his bloody adorable, annoying accent? It was ridiculous, to be honest. Rachel couldn't fathom why Katie had divorced him, because Tuck was a great guy and that accent was amazing. \"I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.\" Rachel sighed, and put down her cake, wishing that FDR wasn't so dense sometimes. \"Have you-Okay. You asked him a serious question, Franklin, didn't you?\" Rachel questioned, on Tuck's behalf, because it was clear that FDR wasn't getting it. Franklin always seemed to understand Rachel better than most people, though Tuck came a very close second. \"Yeah. Yeah.\" \"Right. So do you want a serious answer from him?\" Rachel pressed. \"Yeah. You guys want me to put the cake down?\" FDR asked. \"Please.\" Tuck replied. \"Okay.\" FDR did as he was told, and put the plate down onto the table, then leaned forward in his chair to, albeit sarcastically, give Tuck his full attention. Rachel stood up from her chair, tucking it in behind her. Both men gave her questioning looks and she rolled her eyes. \"This is going to be one of your serious 'man chats'. I know when to take my estrogen out of the equation. I'll go and annoy your pregnant cousin's boyfriend until he shouts at me.\" Rachel explained, walking round the table to kiss the tops of their heads, before she walked away. \"Cake is down, Rachel is gone. Talk to me.\" FDR instructed. \"Well, no, seriously, man chat. Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"Man to man. I trust you. I know you'd do anything for me.\" Tuck started. \"Yeah.\" \"I'd do anything for you. You would take a bullet for me. I would for you as well, you know that. Right? Can you imagine all of that?\" Tuck questioned, referring to 'that' as an empty space between his two hands. \"Yes.\" FDR answered, looking straight at Tuck \"Can you imagine what that would be like to share with a woman?\" Tuck questioned, gesturing once more to the sweet, elderly couple that were still dancing just yards in front of them. \"No.\" \"Okay.\" \"No.\" FDR repeated. \"Thank you.\" \"Why'd you ask me that?\" \"Because I've been thinking a lot about that recently, and realizing that I want to share all that with a woman. And I think I know who with.\" Tuck said, as he stared over at where Rachel really was annoying FDR's pregnant cousin's boyfriend, and watching as the man really did get angry with her. FDR followed his best friend's line of sight, and his eyes widened as he spotted Rachel. Tuck and Rachel? He couldn't be talking about Rachel. Not Rachel. His best friends...that was just wrong. Right? Right? Besides, Rachel was...Rachel. Nothing romantic would happen between Tuck and Rachel...would it? Rachel glanced over at them, and saw that her two best friends had finished their conversation and were both looking in her direction, so she made her way back over to them. When she reached the table, she held out a hand. Tuck and FDR stared at her face and then her hand in confusion, before she sighed and shook it around a little. \"Which one of you knuckleheads is going to dance with me? I didn't put on this dress to just sit and eat cake,\" Rachel said, looking at them both expectantly. FDR and Tuck exchanged a look. \"So who's it gonna be? Bear in mind that I'm going to force both of you to dance with me anyway, so it doesn't really matter who goes first.\" FDR stood before Tuck did, and he smiled at the grin that spread across Rachel's face. He took her hand, and rolled his eyes at her as she fist pumped the air in victory. \"See! It's not so hard to make your best friend happy now, is it? Tuck, once this dance has finished I expect you to come and cut in!\" Rachel said to the British man over her shoulder as FDR led her to the area that everyone was dancing in. A slow song was playing as he pulled her close to him, and she rested her head on his shoulder as they swayed to the music. Nana saw that her little Rachel had convinced young Franklin to dance with her, and saw how adorable they looked together. She nudged her husband and they both watched as their grandson twirled their ward around the grass, listening to the woman's peals of laughter. And once the song had ended, they watched as their grandson's best friend took his place, and danced Rachel around in circles. Nana concluded that Rachel was the perfect thing for both of those boys, she seemed to balance them both. She was fiery enough to contrast Tuck's calm nature and she was serene and graceful enough to combat Franklin's stubbornness. Nana smiled to herself. Whichever of the two boys woke up and saw how wonderful and beautiful Rachel was, Nana was sure she would have adorable great-grandbabies. But dancing with Rachel, and Nana's words, set something in motion for both men, and it would be the start of something big for all three of the spies. Something life changing, and dynamic altering.[Chapter 3] The day after Nana's family party, I thought I'd visit my godson Joe, Tuck's son, at his karate lesson. I was running a little late, but I arrived in time to see Tuck get his ass smacked by the instructor. Tuck straightened up, having to look up at him to stare him down. For a moment, I wondered whether or not Tuck would break cover and just punch the guy in the face. I mean, I would. The guy was begging for it. But I dismissed the thought as quickly as it came. Tuck was the responsible one, most of the time. He wouldn't break his cover especially with Joe in his life. \"Pain? That's just weakness leaving the body.\" The instructor told him, just before he slapped Tuck round the face. I knew that if Tuck wasn't trying to keep up his 'travel agent' persona, he would have showed that ass the real meaning of pain. I mean, if I wasn't portraying a \"air hostess\" than I would have kicked his ass for him. And then he would have his picture taken, with his face all bruised and bloody, and they'd paste it next to the definition of pain in every dictionary in the country. I watched as Joe stood up from the bench he was sat on, grabbing his bag, and shaking his head at the poor display we both watched. Tuck sheepishly followed after him, and I couldn't help but frown at that. You know it's a bad day when your son is ashamed of you. Joe spotted me in the hallway, and dumped his bag on the floor for his dad to pick up. Joe seemed so pleased to see, judging by the giant grin on his face as he hurtled towards me like a bat out of hell. \"Rachel!\" Joe called. I bent down and caught him in my arms, lifting him up and squeezing him to me, before I set him down on his feet again. I grinned at the kid, who looked so happy to see me. Me and Joe were close. On some of the days that Tuck had Joe, we'd all hang out, eat pizza, make fun of FDR, and just have a laugh. Joe was my little man. I'd watched the kid grow up, and loved him to pieces. \"What are you doing here?\" Tuck asked, smiling at us. \"I was going to watch my little man kick some butt, but traffic held me up,\" I said, straightening up to talk to Tuck. He obviously knew that I saw the little 'confrontation', if you could even call it that. Tuck didn't stand up for himself whatsoever. Not even verbally. It was a sad sight, if I was honest. \"So how did it go?\" \"I got creamed.\" Joe sighed, looking sad. I placed my hand on his shoulder, and rubbed it to comfort him. \"I'm sure you didn't get creamed. And each defeat just sets you up to the inevitable victory, you understand? You may have lost today, but you're getting closer to winning.\" I said, as we walked out. I looked over at Tuck and he was smiling this big, dopey smile, and I smiled back at him, feeling slightly confused. A car pulled up in front of us, and Katie, Tuck's ex-wife and Joe's mom, smiled at us from the driver's seat. \"Hey, guys.\" She greeted. She didn't seem surprised to see me there, which was weird, because I didn't always have time to come and see Joe in his karate lessons, so this was the first time in a few months that I had showed up to support my godson. She just smiled at me warmly. Katie and I had always gotten along when she and Tuck had dated, but things got a little weird when they were married. It was sort of like she had just flipped a switch and didn't like me as much as before. \"Hey.\" Tuck and I replied in unison, and I mentally laughed out loud. You can't plan those sorts of things, they just happen. \"Hey, bud.\" Katie addressed Joe, who climbed into the car. \"Hi.\" Tuck passed him his gym bag, and closed the door behind his son, before he talked to Katie about something. Her eyes flashed to me as they spoke, but I knew I couldn't ask Joe for the details because he was listening to his music now. As soon as their conversation was finished, Tuck walked back to me, looking like he needed to talk. I knew it was nothing too bad, since he still had that dopey grin on his face. \"What's up?\" I asked him. \"Why don't you and me go out for dinner tonight?\" And just as something amazing was about to happen, my phone buzzed in my pocket, and I held up a finger towards Tuck, pausing our conversation while I accepted the call. \"Hello?\" \"Don't hate me, but Trish signed me up to this dating site, so I kinda did the same for you. \" \"It's not April Fools Day, so tell me you've become a day drunk, or this is a very lame attempt at a prank?\" I questioned Lauren, while Tuck stared at me in confusion. I shook my head, not knowing what was really going on myself. Lauren had to be joking...right? She wouldn't sign me up for online dating. I only told Nana I'd do that to get my cake. I wasn't actually going to go through with it! I was just going to tell her I had gone through with it, so she would stop annoying me, and then if she did, I was going to say that no one had asked me out and that's why I wasn't getting married or having children. \" You haven't been on a date for months, Rachel. You need to get out there. Besides, you've got a date tonight, and you're showing up for it. \" Lauren told me, and I felt my jaw scrape across the ground as the shock hit me. I've got a what? A date? Why would she do that to me? \"You did not accept that. Tell me you didn't just do this to me?\" I hissed down the phone at her, and I could practically picture her affronted face, before she got all serious and micro-manage-y on me. \" I did. It's for your own good. So come round my place, I'll pre-approve your date outfit, and then send you on your way. It's at six, at that new, little Mexican restaurant. You know the one? \" Lauren asked, and I thought about it. I did know that restaurant. It had just opened a few buildings away from Tuck's favourite bar, The Blarney Stone, and it had gotten some good reviews from some posh, stuck-up food critics. \"Yeah, I know it. You're so lucky that we're friends, because if it were anybody else, they'd be dead right now. I'm only doing it because you went through all this trouble.\" I said, sighing in defeat. I really hated blind dates. I'd gone on enough of them because of Nana always setting me up. They never went right. \" I do it because I love you, Rach. And I want you to be happy .\" Why was everyone saying that to me recently? First Tuck and now Lauren? Did I come across as lonely and unhappy? Maybe I needed to smile more and people would stop annoying me about settling down. \"Yeah, yeah, I love you too. Bye, Lauren. I'll see you later.\" I hung up the phone, and groaned. Why did she do this to me? Tuck stepped forward and rested his hand on my arm, trying to comfort me but still looking confused as to why. I smiled at him, trying to shake off my bad mood, but it didn't stop him from asking what had soured my previously good mood. \"What's wrong?\" Tuck questioned. \"My friend, Lauren, signed me up for that online dating thing and got me a date for tonight, and is making me actually go on it. He's probably going to be this giant loser, but what the hell. Maybe I'll get a free dinner out of it,\" I said, smirking deviously. Tuck just stared at me. \"What?\" \"You don't date.\" He replied, matter-of-factly. I chuckled at his response, when his words kind of stung at the same time. \"I do when I have time. And since we're grounded, I have time. It'll get Nana off my back about finding a husband, if I'm actually dating, won't it? I guess there's an upside to having a freak for a friend.\" \"I'm calling FDR. We'll go with you.\" Tuck actually pulled his phone out of his pocket and dialled FDR's number before I could say anything, so I crossed my arms over my chest, and waited. He put FDR on loudspeaker and held the phone out between us. \" What's up, man? \" \"Hey, mate. What do you think of this? Rachel signed up for online dating and has a date tonight.\" Tuck told him. I scoffed, and moved closer to the phone, so Franklin could hear me properly. \"I didn't sign myself up. My friend did.\" I corrected Tuck, sending him a dark look. He just ignored it and waited for FDR's response. Why did this matter to Tuck anyway? We were just friends, and he's never shown an interest in my dating life before now. So what was with the change? \" Let me get this straight. You put your personal, private details on a very public website? \" FDR asked, and I felt like hitting him through the phone like in the cartoons. I face-palmed myself and \"Do you not listen to me, Franklin? My friend put them on the website, but yes.\" \"Are you insane? \" \"Thank you, mate. That's what I was thinking!\" Tuck said, and I punched him on the arm. Who were they to question my mental faculties? They were probably just as crazy as I was, if not more crazy. I mean, what went down in Bangladesh wasn't my idea, after all. \"No. I'm not.\" I answered. \" Where is he taking you? \" FDR questioned. \"You guys are not doing this to me. No. Do you hear me, Franklin? Tuck? NO.\" \"He's taking you to that new Mexican restaurant. New does not equal good! Here's how it's going to go down. You're going to go on this date and we're going to go with you.\" FDR said, and made me want to reach down the phone and strangle him. I groaned with frustration. \"No, you're not.\" I said, frowning. \"Yes, we are.\" Tuck replied. \" I'm scared for you. You haven't done this in a long time. This guy could be all sorts of crazy. And besides, half of these guys pee sitting down, and the other half are on one of our watch lists. \" I laughed at him. He had a point. That was one of the reasons that I hadn't actually signed myself up for online dating. You don't know the kind of person you could be meeting, because it's very easy to lie on these sites. And Lauren and I watched an episode of Dateline once and I did not want to be turned into a skin suit...or tied up naked in some guy's trunk. \"It sounds like you're making this a forbidden fruit thing, which just makes me want to do it more,\" I joked, and Tuck stared at me, like I was going crazy. I rubbed his arm to comfort him, and patted his back with my free hand. \"It's just a date guys.\" \" Look, lucky for you, I'm free tonight. And I'm gonna bring the binoculars, the hand cream… \" I made a noise of disgust, that mirrored the disgust on Tuck's face. I gave him a look that said 'this is all on you, blabbermouth', and he shrugged. \" We'll keep a hundred-yard radius. It'll be sweet stuff .\" \"No, you can't bring the binoculars. You're not watching my date. That's so creepy.\" I said, trying to reprimand him, but I knew it wouldn't work. They were going to come and re-con my date whether I wanted them to or not. They were just looking out for me. \" Let us help you out, Rach .\" \"Franklin, I lived with you for almost eleven years. It's wrong. I need a little privacy.\" \" We'll be around the corner on ringtone. We'll be at that video store that's near there. One ring means you need an extraction, two, a cleaner, three, we can go home. \" I stayed quiet a moment, and stared at Tuck while I thought it all through. They'd never really paid much attention before to my dates…that I was aware of. Maybe they did. Maybe that's why I never got a second date. I knew it wasn't me. It was these two over-protective buffoons trying to do what's 'best' for me. \"Two hundred yards.\" \" Sold !\" FDR hollered down the phone. He was such a dork sometimes, but we still love him. Mostly. Sometimes. \"If I like him, do you guys promise not to screw everything up for me?\" \"What do you mean screw everything up for you?\" Tuck questioned. \"Because I just realized why I never get date two. It's not me. It's my two over-protective, Neanderthal-esque, self-appointed body-guards who terrify guys away from me. If I tell Nana this, she will be sooooo pissed. Like wear your guts for garters pissed.\" \"Ew. That is not a great mental image. We promise, as long as he's not a creep. You're attracted to those. You're like a bad guy/creep magnet. \" FDR said, and I felt a small bubble of outrage rise up in me. \"I am not! I've dated plenty of good guys.\" I protested, trying to rack my brain for examples, but I couldn't think of one good guy that I'd had a serious relationship with. I would have said Jason, but he cheated on me with Marcie Paxton (she used to hate me but after sleeping with my boyfriend decided that I was not so bad). Then I thought of David, but he got arrested and imprisoned on a GBH charge. The next person I would have said would be Paul, but that bastard cheated on me too with a waitress. \" Name five, Rach. \" I thought harder about it, and I could see the amusement grow on Tuck's face as I obviously struggled with it. I sighed and shook my head. \"I can't name one. So compromise. If he's a good guy, and I like him, don't scare him away. If he's a bad guy, and I still like him, feel free to dive in and save me from myself,\" I replied, rolling my eyes as I spoke. \"But you've got to remember that I'm a big girl, and I can take care of myself. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to stop being Rachel the spy, and be Rachel the girl and go freak out over having no clothes in my very full wardrobe. Bye, FDR! Bye, Tuck.\" I kissed Tuck on the cheek, and walked to my car, and when I drove past Tuck, he was still on the phone, which meant he was planning something. I shook my head, but smiled. I couldn't get Tuck's jealous face out of my head. He was jealous of some random guy neither of us had ever met because he was taking me out instead of him. It was cute, and instilled a new sense of hope in me. I had developed a crush on Tuck a few months ago. It was just like one day I realized how much I liked him. And then there was FDR. But I don't really want to over-complicate things by feeling romantic feelings for both my partners. That just wouldn't end well for anybody. I went to Lauren's at around five with two outfits for her to pick from. She picked the blue dress, because and I quote 'it brings out your eyes', and the black heels with a black clutch. It was dressy enough for a restaurant, but casual enough that I could be working at an office. Then she sent me away, satisfied that I would in fact be going on the date, and looked good enough for some guy she told me about in about ten minutes. His name was Lloyd Turner. He was 30 years old. He worked as an agent for models. And apparently was looking for love. I rolled my eyes at that. He was a modelling agent, and had probably slept with a few of his clients. Why would he be looking for love? Nevertheless, I still went, catching a cab so I could drink a lot if the date went terrible. I walked towards the restaurant. It was a nice place with a few tables outside for those who wanted to enjoy the sun. I quickly scanned the people sat outside for the guy Lauren had showed me a picture of, and found him. He was sat at the table closest to the sidewalk. \"Lloyd? Are you Lloyd?\" I questioned, taking off my sunglasses as I approached his table. \"I'm Rachel.\" He was cute, but he was no Tuck or FDR. He was ridiculously hot, but he looked like a surfer with slightly long blonde hair, big arms and perfectly sun-kissed skin, but I wasn't really into that. Lloyd seemed to be stunned or something, and kinda stared at me for a second, before he stood up, taking his sunglasses off, and spoke. \"Hi. Erm, god, sorry, please sit down,\" He said, pointing to the empty chair opposite him. I sat down, smiling at his nervousness. \"I have to say this, Rachel, you are very, very beautiful.\" \"I thought you worked with models all day? How could I compare to all the beautiful women you get to see half-naked every day?\" I teased him. \"Most of them are half-starved and look like a tiny gush of wind could rip them in half. It's not always a glamorous life, but you are beautiful. Have you considered modelling?\" Lloyd questioned, and I figured he was just flattering me to get something out of the date, but I was not that kind of girl. \"No. I'm quite happy with my job. Free flights anywhere I want and I get to travel the world,\" I smiled, and then leaned forward. \"Do you mind if I ask you something?\" \"Sure. Go ahead.\" \"What was it on my profile, which my friend made for me, that made you ask me out? Be honest. I won't judge. Much.\" I questioned. Lauren wouldn't show me my profile, and I assumed it was because I would have killed her for putting something I never would have said or something I've never done. \"Actually, it was a combination of your profile picture where you were on the beach in a bikini, the fact you're an air hostess, and she mentioned that you were the national junior gymnastics champion in your teens. My sister used to do gymnastics before she had a horrible fall during a routine.\" Lloyd admitted, and I nodded, mirroring his sad look. The whole story could be BS and he's trying to get my pity so he looked like a good guy, but it might not be. Yet there was something wrong with this guy and it wasn't the fact that he had jerk nails. I just didn't feel...right sitting across from him, but for the sake of Lauren and Nana, I stayed where I was and gave the guy a chance. I could always do a background check on him tomorrow at work. \"Gymnastics isn't an easy sport. Anyway, I feel as though I should apologize for anything bizarre on my profile. My friend Lauren was trying to do me a favor…we'll have to wait and see if it backfired on me.\" \"Do you think it's going to backfire on you?\" Lloyd questioned, raising a perfect eyebrow. Oh god, he's a groomer. Like one of those meticulous guys who plucks their eyebrows, waxes their chests and arms and hands, probably his legs too. That kind of thing creeps me out. Yet I stopped myself from dialing Tuck's number for an extraction, because I knew I was jumping the gun a little here, and I should probably give Lloyd a chance. \"I hope not.\" I replied, smiling at him.[Chapter 4] Tuck and FDR were waiting for Rachel's phone call in the video store. Tuck was browsing through movies they could watch on the off chance that Rachel's date bombed and she needed some comforting, and FDR was browsing through the women in the store, and not finding any to his liking. It was a slow night. Tuck's phone rang, and both men froze, as they counted the rings. One...Two...Three. Tuck and FDR exchanged a look, before sighing simultaneously. They weren't happy with this at all. I mean, this was Rachel. Rachel. She didn't date, and if she did, FDR and Tuck always scared them off afterwards, because they were always bad news. She didn't seem to have a radar that warned her away from the jerks or crazies. One of her exes had actually been incarcerated for almost beating another man to death just because he looked over at Rachel in a bar. Tuck was surprised that Rachel thought that this guy was okay, but that was her choice. \"Good for her.\" FDR muttered, not really meaning it, and Tuck nodded at him. \"I think I'm gonna head home, mate. See you later.\" Tuck said, walking away and not giving FDR a chance to say anything back, before he disappeared up the escalator that led out. FDR was a little annoyed at the guy he'd never met. Rachel was almost definitely too good for him. He wouldn't know that she used to be wheat intolerant and that she was still a little bit sensitive when she ate it. He wouldn't know that she almost went to the Olympics as an elite gymnast when she was sixteen. And what kind of name was Lloyd? Seriously? Lloyd? And ever since his Nana had mentioned it, dating Rachel had made a little more sense. No woman knew him better than Rachel. And she was beautiful, smart, funny, caring, practically fearless, and she loved all the movies he did. Apart from the Titanic. She never understood why Jack couldn't fit on the door at the end of the movie. Yet he couldn't make a move on her. It was like he was paralysed. So he just kept adding to his list of one-nighters instead. FDR stayed, waiting for a woman he could take home to arrive, and he waited a good hour, before he spotted Rachel coming down the escalator. She hadn't spotted him yet and, while she didn't look like she'd just been on the worst date of her life, she didn't look like she'd had the best first date of her life. And then she saw him, staring up at her, and she smiled like her night had just gotten a little better. FDR would never understand why she looked at him like that, because, now that he thought hard about it, she always looked at him like that when she saw him. Like her days were just that little brighter with him around. She walked towards him, and sighed through a chuckle, which really didn't help him understand how her date had gone. Was the chuckle a good sign? Was the sigh a bad sign? \"How did it go?\" FDR asked her, as she started looking through movies. She gingerly picked up a silly tween movie, tutting at it in disapproval before she replaced it back on the shelf and wiped her hand on her dress as though the movie had germs on it. \"It wasn't bad exactly. At first, I thought we kinda hit it off, but then he started asking me if I wanted to settle down, what area do I think I'd want to live in, how many kids could I see myself having. Questions that just aren't first date material. So I made an excuse and came running here,\" She looked around, seemingly searching for someone, before she turned back to him. \"Where's Tuck?\" \"He went home. Let's pick out a movie, and we'll go drop by his place to hang out.\" FDR replied, a little annoyed that she was concerned with Tuck's whereabouts when he was right there. \"Why are you still here?\" Rachel questioned, glancing around before the realization set in and a knowing smile grew on her face. \"Pickings are slim tonight, huh?\" \"You could say that.\" \"I am here for you, Franklin. I shall replace Tuck as your wing-man. I can't say I can beat a British accent, but being a member of the opposite sex, I know what a woman is thinking,\" Rachel said, her eyes scanning the video store, scouting for any attractive women for FDR. Admittedly, there were a few, but none that she really approved of. And she wanted nothing but the best for her Franklin. \"The girl over in Foreign has far too much angst. Girl in the sweet home-maker sweater will be naming your children by morning. There is no clean getaway here.\" \"It's fine. We'll grab a movie and go to Tuck's. I think I can rest a day, Rach.\" FDR said, wanting nothing more than to just go to Tuck's with Rachel and a movie, and hang out. Or maybe go to his place with Rachel and a movie. Tuck didn't have to be there. And with the thoughts now running through FDR's mind, he would prefer that his male best friend wouldn't be there. \"I'm wondering…how do you even pick a girl up at the video store?\" FDR watched as a devious smile spread across her pink lips, and something flashed in her eyes as she stared at him. \"Show me.\" \"Show you?\" He asked, not really understanding what she wanted from him. She couldn't want him to hit on her...could she? That would be too...fantastic. \"Show me how you pick up women in a video store. Practice your charm on me.\" Rachel instructed him. FDR blinked at her in shock. She wanted him to what? Hit on her? Treat her like one of the other girls? He couldn't do that. Rachel wasn't one of the other girls. She was...Rachel. \"I don't think I can do that, Rach. You know me.\" FDR replied, trying to get the idea out of her head. \"I don't have to know you. Pretend I'm like any other girl. We've never met, and you see me picking out a movie, and you think I'm hot and I'm the best the video store has to offer, so you walk over and hit on me, hoping to take me home,\" When FDR shook his head, Rachel laughed and swotted his arm. FDR just stared at her as though she was joking about the whole thing, and Rachel continued. \"Use your imagination, Franklin. Think of it as a game that you have to win. You see I'm not convinced, despite your track record, that you are that good at picking up women.\" Rachel walked away, and began to browse the movies in the drama section. She reached out to pick up a film, but a hand grabbed it at the same time. \"I'm sorry. You-\" She looked up, and saw that it was FDR. \"No, no, no, that's okay. You take it.\" FDR said to her, going along with her little idea. Rachel realized this, and smiled briefly before she put on her game face. \"Are you sure?\" She asked, widening her eyes slightly. \"You know, you're not gonna like it. Twist ending. You'll see it coming a mile away.\" He replied. \"And how would you know what I like, stranger?\" Rachel teased him. \"I know movies. And women.\" FDR smiled at her, and Rachel could see how that smile had gotten many women into his bed. She raised an eyebrow at him. \"Really?\" Rachel questioned, and FDR responded with a noise of agreement. \"Okay. Well, then, why don't you tell me what I want?\" Rachel sauntered away from him, and he followed, putting his hand on the small of her back (Rachel, for a brief second, felt like the place where his hand rested was on fire, but it soon disappeared) and steering her in the direction he wanted her to go. She watched as his eyes scanned the shelves stacked with films of every genre, before he stopped her. He grabbed a movie off of the shelf and passed it to her. Rachel scrutinized it, wondering why he had picked this particular movie. \" The Lady Vanishes? Why is that?\" Rachel asked him, looking from the case up to FDR. \"Well, firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock. Ever. It's got comedy, drama, romance, it's a thriller. It's classy, but not stuffy. And it's a little obscure, so if you haven't seen it, you'll thank me for introducing you to it,\" FDR explained, staring down at Rachel with his blue eyes, knowing the effect they had on all women, and Rachel smirked up at him. He wasn't sure if it was a good smirk or a bad smirk.- \"And if you have, you'll know what a good choice it was.\" \"Well, I have seen it.\" Rachel replied. \"Mm-hm.\" FDR moved closer to Rachel so there was only a narrow gap of air between them. He was so close that he could smell the perfume she was wearing, which was great. \"And it is a good movie.\" \"Mm.\" FDR replied, a smirk on his face. He was winning this game that she created, and hopefully he'd get a good prize for doing so. He shook his head, as his thoughts went down a very interesting road again. \"However, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo …or pretty much any of his movies from 1960 to 1972,\" Rachel smiled in victory, as she watched the smirk on FDR's face dwindle into a frown at her knowledge of Hitchcock movies, and how his charm hadn't actually worked on her. \"In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.\" \"A second. You know what? Scratch-\" Rachel cut him off. \"You almost had me, FDR. I'll admit that. It was a real eye opener to see you in your real habitat. Thanks for helping me pick out a movie. You should stay here though, while I go to Tuck's. A bleach blonde with great legs just walked in, and she looks vulnerable. Happy hunting, darling.\" She kissed him on the cheek, and went to pay for the movie. On her way out, she could see that FDR had yet to go talk to the blonde, who was throwing him 'come hither' glances and not being very subtle about it. So Rachel took matters into her own hands. As she walked past the blonde, she stopped and tapped her on the shoulder. The blonde turned around. \"Hi. Sorry to bother you, but I saw you looking over at tall, dark and handsome. I was talking to him earlier when you walked in, and he said you were the prettiest woman he's ever seen. I think you should go talk to him.\" \"Really? He doesn't look like the kinda guy looking for a relationship though, does he?\" She replied, glancing over at him again. Rachel followed her gaze and saw that FDR was looking over, with a somewhat confused expression. Rachel subtly winked at him, before turning her attention back to the blonde who was still checking him out. \"Believe me, I know his type. He is not just interested in a one-night rental, if you know what I mean. You should give it a chance.\" Rachel secretly thought that the blonde didn't really look like she was interested in a relationship, and more the one-night rental person herself. The blonde nodded and thanked her, before walking in FDR's direction. Rachel caught his gaze one last time, saluting him with a smirk as she turned and walked out. FDR couldn't stop thinking that Rachel hadn't fallen for his charm, like most women, and why that was. He'd talk to Tuck tomorrow about his feelings for Rachel. Tuck was good with all the emotional feelings stuff. This required a man-to-man chat, but he was pretty sure what he wanted now. And it wasn't the blonde he was barely listening to, it was the blonde he was watching disappear up the escalator. He'd never really seen a woman as perfect before, but if anyone was, it was Rachel Simmonds. And now he was determined to make her see that he could be just as perfect for her. Tuck was watching T.V in his apartment, working his way through a large packet of Cheetos when his doorbell buzzed. He begrudgingly got up off his couch to open his door, when he was suddenly glad he did. Rachel smiled at him, holding up a movie and a bag of sweet popcorn, and brushed past him into his living room. Tuck watched her, half amused and half confused as she kicked off her shoes and pretty much jumped onto his couch. \"How'd the date go?\" \"I don't think I'll be going out with him again.\" She replied, dropping the popcorn and the movie on the floor, and popping one of his Cheetos into her mouth. Tuck moved back to his couch, and sat down next to her. She immediately swung her legs round and laid them across his lap, like she'd done a million times before. Except this time, Tuck was really paying attention to how long and toned her legs were. \"Why's that?\" He questioned, feeling a lot better seeing her come back from her date early. \"He really was looking for a serious relationship, but he took it to new levels of crazy. The first date isn't when you plan your wedding,\" Rachel looked over at Tuck, with a disturbed look on her face. \"Plus, he was a groomer. And he had no tattoos. He even told me he thought tattoos were disgusting. I mean, how can someone think that? Tattoos are hot. But I think the reason we didn't really click, was because of the groomer thing. His eyebrows were better than mine, Tuck!\" Tuck burst out laughing at her description of the guy, and as much as she tried not to, Rachel ended up laughing with him at her misfortunes. It was quite funny looking back on it. It made for an uncomfortable date at the time though. \"So it was a bad date?\" \"It wasn't that bad, but it was not great. I kinda wish that I'd just called in for an extraction and come back here and watched movies with you, but if I'd done that I wouldn't have had an enlightening experience.\" Rachel replied, confusing Tuck again. \"What enlightening experience?\" \"I went to the video store, and FDR was still there, scouting for a bed warmer, as per usual, but pickings were slim. So I got him to hit on me. I've always been curious about how he manages to do it. So he did, and it was an interesting experience, but I'm chalking most of his success up to the lowering IQ rate of women in Los Angeles,\" Rachel grinned at Tuck, who smiled back. \"I'll admit I almost fell for the FDR charm, but he doesn't have a British accent, so he probably should have worked harder.\" Tuck chuckled at that. Ever since they had met, Rachel had loved his British accent. He couldn't fully understand why, but she did. And she managed to bring it into nearly all of her compliments towards him. \"He can blame you for that. Ever since I met you, your annoyingly charming accent has been the deciding factor of all my brief relationships.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. I have a scale of how great someone is. One being the equal to the thing I hate most; men who are practically metro-sexual. Ten being equal to the thing I love most; the British accent,\" Rachel explained, putting a giant grin on Tuck's face. Rachel climbed off the couch to put the DVD into the player. Tuck couldn't help but stare at her ass, or arse as they would say in Britain, as she was bent over, but quickly dragged his eyes away as she straightened up and moved back towards him. \"FDR did help me pick out a movie. The Lady Vanishes . Have you seen it?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"It's a good Hitchcock movie. Not one of his best, but still good.\" Rebecca said, curling up into Tuck's side, pulling his arm around her and resting her head on his shoulder as the movie started. Tuck was elated that her date with the pushy, groomer Lloyd hadn't worked out, that she'd rather have spent her night watching movies with him. Tuck had realized that he had feelings for Rachel when Nana had mentioned about dating her. Honestly, now that he thought about it, who could ever be better for him? No one, not even FDR, knew him better than Rachel. Joe loved her. Even his ex-wife would comment on how pretty, funny or nice Rachel was, probably hinting at something all along. Plus Rachel was beautiful, smart, funny, caring, practically fearless and loved all the same music as he did. Except she always called him cheesy for liking his favourite bar, The Blarney Stone. They made a good team, and she had a way of reading his body language or his face to know what he wanted when they were in the field. Or even when they weren't. The fact is Rachel Simmonds was his perfect girl, and he'd only just realized it. \"What are you thinking about so hard? I can practically smell your hair burning.\" Rachel asked, looking up at him. \"Nothing.\" \"If you say so, babe, but you know I'm always here for you to talk to. Day or night.\" \"I know. Thanks.\" \"It's no problem. You'd do the same for me.\" Rachel smiled, leaning up to kiss his cheek, before nestling back into his side and returning her attention to the movie and the popcorn in her hand. Tuck shook his head. Yes, Rachel Simmonds was his perfect girl. Now he had to make her see that he was her perfect guy.[Chapter 5] The next day I went to work feeling pretty Zen. I'd had fun with FDR and then Tuck last night. In fact, I'd enjoyed myself so much with my two best friends that I'd almost forgotten I'd even had a date with that guy last night. What was his name again? Luke? Lewis? Lloyd? Lloyd! I had a date with Lloyd last night. When I'd gotten back to my place, he'd left a message on my machine telling me how great it had been to meet me, and wondering if we could meet up again soon. I was going to do a background check on him when I got to work, to see if he had any red flags, to see if he would potentially stalk me if I didn't call him back. He came on far too strong, to be fair, and I wasn't attracted to him. But other than that small worry, I walked into work feeling practically stress-free. I headed to my desk and walked in on the end of a conversation between Tuck and FDR. I assumed it was the end because it didn't make much sense otherwise. \"So we have a gentlemen's agreement?\" FDR asked. \"A gentlemen's agreement.\" Tuck agreed. \"Do I want to know what that's about?\" I questioned as I stopped just in front of their desks. They both looked at each other, and nodded in agreement to some unspoken conversation. \"No.\" They both said at the same time, neither of them actually looking at me, which immediately set off my BS detector. They were hiding something from me, and they knew that it was going to bug me. We had a full disclosure agreement. We never kept anything from each other, nothing, and we functioned better as a team because of it, but they were hiding something from me. \"O-kay.\" I shook my head, shaking away my confusion. They'd tell me in their own time what was going on, and if not then I'd kick their asses. Nothing would stress me out today, not even my two best friends acting weird, and shooting me glances every five seconds as I worked on more of my paperwork. I remembered to do a background check on Lloyd, and loads of red flags popped up, much to my surprise. \"Oh, God.\" I accidentally said out loud, as I read through all of his offences. They were pretty bad. Like 'Oh my fucking God' kinda bad. Like an episode of CSI: Las Vegas bad. \"What?\" FDR questioned, as both he and Tuck looked up at me with concern. I looked up from the screen of my computer, my face frozen in shock, and I pointed at the screen frantically. \"I think I'm finally grateful for being so picky with men.\" I replied finally. \"Why's that?\" Tuck asked, as he and FDR rose from their seats to come and inspect the files on my computer that I was still pointing at. \"Lloyd Turner was questioned about being apart of a woman trafficking ring, and still remains a suspect. Oh God, I could have ended up in some crack den somewhere having new drugs tested on me or being raped by my pimp. This is worse than ending up as a skin suit! Why, Lauren, why did you have to do that to me? Now I have to change my phone number!\" I whined, slapping my hands against my face, and then carried on reading through his red flags. Tuck and FDR hovered behind me as I went through it all. Turns out the guy's name wasn't even Lloyd Turner. He was Arnold Jim Winton. What kind of name is Arnold Winton anyway? Arnold Jim Winton? His parents must have hated him. \"I bet you're glad you're not attracted to metro-sexual males now, aren't you?\" FDR asked me. \"Yes. He had jerk nails as well. There were signs. I mean, what guy is that interested in your future on the first date?\" \"A nice one?\" Tuck asked, and I patted his arm, smiling at him. Trust Tuck to find the romantic in such a creep. \"Those kinds of guys are rare, sweetie. Most guys are just looking for a hook-up. If I was a weak person, I'd just go back to the bed-hopper I was in my early twenties. But Rachel Simmonds is not weak, and does not want to listen to her foster-grandmother badger her about great-grandbabies for the rest of her life.\" I sighed, and stood up, opening the bottom drawer of my desk and grabbing my gym bag. I needed to take my frustrations out on something. A punch bag, a dummy, or one of the newbies. There were always newbies being trained in the gym. \"Where are you going?\" FDR questioned, as I walked past him. \"I need to hit something. Hopefully, they've got some new agents training in the gym. I like traumatizing the newbies, it always brings a smile to my face,\" I explained, then I looked at FDR's desk, noticing all the paperwork that was piling up. He always left it until I forced him to do it, or did it for him. \"You need to do some work, Franklin.\" \"I'll do it eventually.\" \"Hopefully before Collins sees it and kicks off at you, please? I don't want to smooth over one of her meltdowns for you again.\" I said, pointing at him in warning, before I walked away to relieve some stress. Tuck followed me and we sparred together for an hour or so, before we just watched the newbies fight it out to prove they were good. When Tuck and I had been sparring, they had stopped and basked in the awesomeness that we were. Mostly I think they were surprised that I could fight as well as I can, which is slightly sexist, but with my job I get that a lot so it's just water off a duck's back now. \"Rach, do you want to, um, maybe, if you want, go to the carnival with me tonight?\" Tuck asked me, sounding nervous for some reason that confused me. We'd known each other for far too long to be uncomfortable or nervous around each other. \"Sure.\" I answered, and he looked surprised. \"Sure? Good. Good.\" \"Why are you surprised that I'd say yes…unless it's a date and that's why you're nervous?\" I joked, but seeing the serious look on Tuck's face made me stop grinning, and start mentally hyperventilating. Tuck was asking me out on a date. Tuck. John \"Tuck\" Harrison was asking me out on a date. My best friend, Tuck Harrison, was asking me out on a date. I felt like I was in my Junior year in high school again, reverting back to the girl who had panicked for two days after the quarterback had asked her to homecoming. Ah, Luke Tanner. He was hot and such a great kisser. And the abs! God, the abs! \"It's a date, unless you don't want it to be, then we can go as friends. If you want?\" Tuck asked again. I swear, for a brief, minute moment, my heart stopped beating in my chest. It was a date? I felt a smile spread on my face, and seeing his hopeful smile, I calmed down and actually gave the poor guy the answer he was waiting for. \"I'm in. It's a date.\" I smiled, and Tuck beamed at me. \"Great.\" More than great, I thought. Fucking fantastic is more like it. After work, I'd gone home, showered, pulled a brush through my hair and forced it up into a ponytail. I pulled on a clean t-shirt, jeans and a pair of red converse. And I added minimal make-up, like I always do. If I went overboard, Tuck would definitely notice. And I would definitely die of embarrassment. I didn't want to make it look like I was trying too hard, especially not with Tuck. I didn't want to make things weird. He picked me up from my apartment, complimenting me as usual, and I acted as if this was normal. As if going on a date with one of your best friends was normal. I mentally scolded myself for acting like a stupid teenager, and told myself to man up. It was just Tuck. Sweet, handsome, British Tuck. Going on a date with him was what I wanted for the last few months. So I calmed myself down, and smiled, and vowed to not be weirded out or to over-think the whole date. When we arrived, Tuck bought us a large amount of tokens, and I grinned with excitement. I love the carnival. It was one of the first things I remember Nana and Grandpa Foster taking me and Franklin to when I first became part of their family. It was a special memory, and each time the carnival was in town, FDR, Tuck and I went. You know, if we weren't busy with work and were in the country. \"God, I love the carnival.\" I said, spinning round once, before turning round to beam at Tuck. \"I know. That's why I brought you here,\" Tuck grinned, as I took his hand and let him lead me away from the entrance. \"And we're not leaving until we've spent all our tokens.\" \"Let's do this.\" We played air hockey, and I absolutely annihilated him. I knew it was from my skill alone, because Tuck knew I would beat the crap out of him if he threw his game so I would win. It's just not as satisfying knowing you've only won because the other person didn't try, and I didn't want to win just because I was a girl and he was being a gentleman and losing on purpose. After air hockey, we walked around, until I saw a little girl crying because she lost at one of those shooting moving target games. I pursed my lips as the guy told her again that she hadn't won so couldn't have the stuffed pink unicorn she really wanted. So I decided to become a nicer person. I fished in my pocket for a couple of tokens and headed over, tugging a confused Tuck behind me. \"Hello, Miss! Think you can hit five of the moving targets for a prize?\" The vendor questioned, and I smirked as I handed him the tokens and picked up the pellet gun. I lifted the fake rifle and looked down the sights, following one of the targets and squeezed the trigger. A small ding sounded as I hit a moving bulls-eye, and I smirked again, before quickly hitting four more targets with an exact precision. The guy stared at me open-mouthed, as I lowered the gun and smiled at him expectantly. \"What, uh, what prize do you want?\" He questioned. \"The pink unicorn.\" I said, and he quickly reached up and plucked it down for me. I smiled once more at him, before I turned away. I saw the little girl still standing just to the side of the booth with her mom, and gestured for her to come over. Her mom hesitantly let her, but she nudged the shy blonde kid forward. I crouched down so I was at her height and I smiled warmly at her. \"I got this for you. Take good care of her, sweetie.\" I told her, and she stopped sniffling and smiled slightly, as she took the unicorn and skipped back over to her mom. I grinned as she showed it to the mother, who smiled thankfully at me, and then I heard more dings from the booth. I looked round, and Tuck was shooting the targets. And, of course, he hit every one. It would be painfully embarrassing if he had missed them, since we were CIA agents and were trained in the use of many different firearms. He picked out the largest prize, this great big pink bear, and jogged over to me with a giant grin on his face. \"I thought since you gave yours away to the girl, I'd get you a replacement. You were very good with her.\" Tuck smiled, and I shrugged my shoulders, and hugged the bear to my stomach. \"I've had a lot of practice being a godmother. Thank you for the giant bear, though. I was thinking this morning that I needed one of these to just bring all the stuff in my house together.\" Tuck laughed at me, and we walked away from the booth and decided to go do something else. So we just strolled around the carnival aimlessly, until something interesting popped up for us to do. We had already been on the dodgem's, the Twister, and I had gone on the merry-go-round while Tuck had stood and laughed at me through a hot dog. So now we were stuck for things to do. \"So the great air hockey cheats, that is.\" Tuck said, as we walked around, looking for something to do. \"I'm available for lessons anytime,\" We laughed, and I felt happy and carefree. This was going great, and it wasn't as awkward as I thought it would be. \"But only for you.\" I joined our hands together, trying not to make it seem like a big deal. He smiled down at me, his blue eyes twinkling, and I smiled up at him, before looking away quickly, suddenly finding the cotton candy station incredibly interesting. \"There's something else I wanna show you.\" Tuck said, and I arched an eyebrow at him. \"Mysterious. I like it. Lead the way.\" \"Before we get there, I'm going to stop and cover your eyes so you don't ruin the surprise.\" Tuck warned, grinning at me. \"You aren't involved in woman trafficking, are you? Because that will have been the second time this has happened to me this week.\" I joked, as Tuck led me along. We were heading away from the main part of the carnival, and my curiosity was burning holes in me, and I was almost desperate to know where we were going. \"I promise I'm not taking you to a crack den.\" Tuck replied, going along with my joke, using my words from earlier that day. \"Well since I've got your promise,\" I said, as Tuck came to a halt. He tugged my teddy out of my hand and left it in a safe spot hidden in a bush. He walked around me so he was behind me, and gently placed his hands over my eyes. \"If I trip up because of you, I'm taking you down with me.\" \"I won't let you trip.\" He promised, and I nodded, knowing I could trust him. There was only one other person on the planet that I had the amount of trust in as I had in Tuck and that was FDR. Tuck led me slowly forward. For me, it was like walking in the complete darkness. We walked for what felt like forever, and it was almost silent apart from Tuck instructing me on where to put my feet. I didn't say anything until curiosity got the better of me, and I just had to ask. \"Okay, where are we going?\" I asked, placing my hands over his as they covered my eyes. \"There are lions in here.\" Tuck whispered into my ear, his warm breath tickling my ear and sending shivers down my spine. \"No.\" He wouldn't do that to me. I hate lions. Lions are terrifyingly huge cats. And what was up with a lion's hair? I mean, is it hairless or does it have a coat? It's entirely too confusing. \"Yes.\" \"Are you serious?\" I asked, as I strained to hear some sort of noise. I laughed when I realized I heard nothing. There'd probably be some noise if there was lions in here. Unless they were asleep. Tuck's hands left my eyes, but I kept them closed until he told me to open. I didn't want to ruin his surprise. \"Okay, open them.\" And I blinked my eyes as they adjusted to the light in the room, and then to the sight they were beholding. He had brought me to the acrobatic arena and the apparatus was lit up with small white lights. And above it you could see the stars shining in the sky. It was really a sight to see. \"Wow, it's so beautiful.\" I said, grinning at it. \"Come on.\" Tuck said, taking my hand and dragging me along behind him. \"We're going up there? I haven't done gymnastics that didn't involve attacking anyone since I was a teenager.\" I said, as he led me to a ladder. I stared up at it, apprehension filling my body. I used to be a gymnastic champion when I was younger, but got too old to compete, and since it was such a long time since I'd done proper gymnastics, I was a little hesitant. Or scared. Whichever worked best, but, out loud, I'd only admit to being hesitant. \"It'll be fun, I promise. Have I ever steered us wrong before?\" Tuck asked me, turning me around to look at him instead. \"Yes. I remember you steering us wrong and we ended up in Belgium. Remember that? We went out for Chinese on a holiday in Holland, and because of your poor directions, me, you and FDR ended up crossing the border to Belgium.\" I laughed at the memory. All three of us ended up having an argument, all blaming each other when really it was only Tuck's fault for misreading the map we were using. Tuck stared at me for a second, before he recovered. \"But I haven't steered us wrong since then! And that is what counts. Do this for me. I swear, we'll have fun.\" Tuck said, using his blue eyes and adorable British accent against me. \"Fine, but stop using that accent. I told you it's irresistible, but you still insist on using it against me!\" I replied, turning away from him and climbing up the ladder. It felt like a long way up, but once I got to the top, it felt like old times when I was doing handstands on the uneven bars. I shrugged off my cardigan and let it drop to the floor, and waited for Tuck to climb upon the other side, and onto his trapeze. I watched him for a moment, while he waited for me to swing onto mine. \"You know I trust you, but I've still gotta ask. You're gonna catch me, right?\" I called to him. \"Yeah.\" Tuck answered. \"Promise?\" \"Absolutely.\" Tuck replied, and I smiled, before nodding, and grabbing hold of the trapeze. \"Okay.\" \"One…Two…\" On two, Tuck had swung himself upside down so he was ready to catch me once I'd turned myself around. \"Three.\" I swung out, laughing at how exhilarated it felt, and swung myself upside down as I neared Tuck. \"There you go.\" Tuck said, as we were pulled away from each other by the motion of the trapeze. I held my hands out as we swung near each other again, and Tuck grabbed them, pulling me off my swing. He swung me up into the air, and then suddenly let me go. I held in a scream as I fell into the net, and let out another laugh as I bounced back up into the air, before falling again. Tuck soon landed near me, laughing as well. Though I'm not sure if he was laughing with me or at me. Oh well. We kinda kept bouncing until we met in the middle of the net. \"What was that?\" I asked, still half-laughing. \"I'm sorry, I lost my grip.\" Tuck lied. I leant up on my arm, so I could look down at him, draping my over arm over his stomach, and my leg rested between his. This was actually more intimate than I was expecting on our first date. If I was being honest, I had expected that if we ever did start dating that he'd take me to the Blarney Stone, his favourite bar, but this was ten times better. \"You did that on purpose.\" I accused him, smiling down at him. \"Uh…maybe I did.\" Tuck replied, pretending to think about it first. \"I think you did.\" I replied, breathlessly. I wanted to blame it on my fall, but it was probably how close my face was to Tuck's. This was all new territory for us; dating and what not, but I liked it. Tuck was a great guy, and would probably be the first great guy I've dated, and maybe it would work because of how well we knew each other. I knew Tuck like the back of my hand. And he knew everything about me as well. \"Well, sometimes falling is the best part.\" Tuck said, and I felt my heart melt to my feet. I leaned in and pressed my lips to his and felt those cliché fireworks explode in my head. Tuck tugged me on top of his body, and we must've spent about ten minutes just making out whilst lying in that net. It was probably the best first date I've ever been on. The next day, Tuck and I were sat in our office. I thought it would be weird, what with the shift in dynamic between us since Tuck and I had been on a date, but it was still the same. All the banter was still there, and there was zero awkwardness. Well, it wasn't awkward until FDR walked into the office, with an upset pout settled firmly on his mouth. \"What's got your panties in a twist?\" I joked with a chuckle, until he put his eyes on me, and I saw traces of anger in them. \"Did you guys forget something last night?\" He prompted, and I thought really hard about what I could have forgotten last night. In the middle of my date with Tuck, I had panicked about leaving my hair straighteners on but when I got home they were off. But I doubt that's what Franklin is referring to. I exchanged a glance with Tuck and he seemed to be drawing a blank as well, and apparently our silence only frustrated Franklin even more. \"We were supposed to hang out last night! CHiPs marathon and Rock Band, remember?\" FDR hissed, and I instantly felt guilty. \"I am so sorry, Franklin! I completely forgot about CHiPs and Rock Band. So sorry!\" I apologized, and felt guilt surge through me. I'd forgotten FDR last night! I was a terrible best friend. \"I called you guys like five times each! I was worried about you! Why didn't you answer your phones?\" Franklin reprimanded us, and the guilt just built up. I hadn't remembered that we were supposed to hang out, and because of that Franklin was worried about us. And with Heinrich probably plotting revenge on us, who knew what had gone through Franklin's head when we didn't return his calls. \"In my defense, mine has been with a techie since yesterday afternoon. He's changing the number for me. And to be fair, Franklin, how many times have you cancelled on us to go hunting for something tall, blonde and gullible?\" I questioned, because I needed to relieve some of my guilt. \"That's not the point. Where were you guys last night?\" \"We, uh, went out on a date.\" Tuck answered him, and I saw Franklin visibly stiffen, though I couldn't for the life of me understand why. We're partners and best friends, I mean, it's not completely implausible. It wasn't beyond the realm of possible for me and Tuck to start dating. \"You guys...went on a...date?\" FDR practically repeated, and I rolled my eyes. \"Do I need to take you to the doctor to have your hearing tested, Franklin? Yes, we went on a date. That's why we didn't come hang out. Three's a crowd, darling. Now if you'll both excuse me, Collins has asked me to assist in training some newbies.\" I said, rising to my feet, grabbing my gym bag like yesterday. \"I'll come watch. I need a good laugh.\" FDR said, and followed me all the way to the gym. I quickly changed into my work out gear, which consisted of a black and grey sports bra, grey sweatpants and black vans, and my hot pink protective gloves. I wouldn't have chosen that colour myself, but FDR bought them for me, when it became clear that I was too lazy to wrap my hands before working out. When I entered the work out room, the newbies were all just lounging around, and FDR was leaning against the back wall, watching them in amusement. Amusement at what was about to come. I whistled loudly to gain the recruits attentions, and they sprung up onto their feet, their backs as straight as a metal rod, and waited for instruction. \"I'm Agent Rachel Simmonds, the grinning moron behind you is Agent Franklin \"FDR\" Foster. Ladies, proceed with caution,\" I winked at Franklin, letting him know I was just teasing, and he rolled his eyes back at me. I smirked at the recruits as I refocused on them. \"How's training been so far?\" \"It's been good so far, ma'am.\" That's when FDR let out a bark of laughter, probably seeing my eyes narrow at the guy who called me 'ma'am'. I was sixty years old! I'm only twenty nine and that doesn't warrant the title of 'ma'am'. That was one of my pet peeves. \"Well, today the boss lady asked me to take over training, put you through your paces. You,\" I said, pointing at the kid who had called me ma'am. He looked at me, and showed a little nervousness, which I permitted since it was obvious as to what was going to happen. Well to me and FDR, it was obvious. \"Step forward.\" He did as he was told, and I smiled, and saw his nervousness vanish. That's when I struck. I moved quickly, punching him in the stomach, then grabbing his wrist and twisting his arm behind his back, popping it out of joint. Then I kicked his knees out from under him, and pushed him against the mat. \"Rule Number One, always, always be ready for an attack. Let yourself get lulled into a false sense of security by a pretty smile or a kind word, and that's how you get yourself killed,\" I said, letting him go, pushing his shoulder back into place, and helping the guy to his feet. \"Rule Number Two, never, ever call me 'ma'am'. That's how you get yourself killed.\" They chuckled at that and I smiled. \"Now, Rule Number Three is think and then act. You wouldn't believe how many times that I've almost been killed because a fellow agent didn't think before he acted.\" I told them, giving FDR a pointed look, to which he immediately protested. \"Bangladesh was not my fault! That guy was begging to be shot in the knee!\" \"What happened in Bangladesh?\" A female recruit questioned, letting curiosity get the better of her. \"Rule Number Four, never ask about Bangladesh. Or Kandahar.\" I warned, but, as usual, FDR was in a playful mood and tried to undermine me in front of the new kids. \"You should ask her about Moscow. That one was interesting!\" Franklin said, and the newbies all looked at me expectantly, and I glared at my partner. \"Is there any particular reason you're here, Agent Foster?\" I questioned, now a little annoyed with his presence. Moscow was a touchy subject. It was a deep cover mission, and I'd had to date this Russian drug lord who was smuggling drugs through Mexico and into the US for a nice profit. He wasn't a very gentle guy, let's put it that way. Mostly because he wasn't even straight, and was only pretending to be because he was ashamed. And during those shame spirals he would take his anger out on me, and as it was a deep cover mission, I wasn't allowed to fight back. It felt like my early childhood all over again. \"I was actually hoping that we could go out tonight to one of my favourite clubs. Barcelona, at eight.\" FDR stated rather than actually asked. \"I'm sort of in the middle of something, FDR. My job, remember?\" \"I guess that I could stay and tell the recruits more about Moscow. She had to infiltrate this drug ring and pretend to be the drug lord's girlfrie-\" \"If I say yes, will you leave please? You're undermining me in front of the kids!\" I said, and smirked at the indignant looks the recruits gave me as I called them 'kids'. Most of them were probably only ten years younger than me, but in 'agent years' that was practically thirty years. Being an agent gave you a shorter lifespan. \"Of course. Barcelona, at eight.\" \"Fine. You drive.\" I sighed, waving him away. FDR pushed off of the wall he had been leaning on, and walked half way out the door. \"Fine. You're so hot when you're beating the crap out of the newbies.\" \"Get the hell out of here, FDR!\" I half-shouted, half-laughed, as he darted out of the room. As soon as he was gone, I refocused on the recruits. \"So where was I...?\" Tuck sat at his desk, cleaning his gun with an old rag. He was trying to concentrate on something other than the fact that FDR had taken Rachel clubbing. He wasn't sure if she knew it was a date, but she had still gone, even if she had kissed him on the cheek before they left the office. \"Tuck. Where are your partners?\" Another agent asked him. \"Oh, they went out on a date.\" Tuck replied, looking away from his gun to acknowledge the other two agents' presence. \"Of course they did. FDR's an assassin, slays everything he sets his sights on, right? Apparently even his partner.\" The female agent said, before they walked away. Tuck digested her words, before he let himself panic. What are the chances that FDR would stick to their agreement and not sleep with Rachel if the opportunity arose? Not that she would sleep with him, but if she was drunk enough to want to? Tuck climbed out of his chair, and went to find a technician who could track FDR's car. FDR pulled up in front of the club, and jumped out his side, rushing around the front of the car to open my door before I did. I raised an eyebrow at him, but climbed out, and followed him inside the club. I could see the lights from the entrance, and wasn't really happy that I was here. I didn't do clubs anymore. I'd matured past all that. \"You ever been here before?\" FDR asked me. \"The club scene isn't mine anymore. You should feel lucky I'm gracing you with my presence here.\" I joked, as he led me through the crowd. Occasionally, he'd greet someone, which didn't really surprise me. It's a club, so of course Franklin knows everybody. \"You're gonna love this place, I swear. Hey, Ciera. How are you?\" He said, to a coat-check girl as we passed her. I felt like I was in some bizarre dream or an alternate universe. I did the club scene in my early twenties. Bars were where I bought my booze now. That or the supermarket. I wasn't into this kinda thing anymore, unless I had to for a mission. The strobe lighting, the pulsing bass, the girls grinding against anything that came into their path, the guys grabbing my ass…this wasn't my idea of fun anymore. But somehow, Franklin had persuaded me to come here with him. \"We never have fun anymore, Rach. You've got to loosen up. Get off simmer,\" FDR said, walking backwards as he talked to me, probably trying to make sure I was giving him my attention or that another club rat hadn't kidnapped me. He turned around and noticed another person he recognised. \"Nathaniel! What's up, baby? How you been?\" FDR bumped fists with the bartender, before he grabbed my hand and twirled me around. \"Look at you! You are shining like a bright light,\" I grinned at him, and shook my head as he led me forward again. Then we stopped as he spotted a group of people in a booth who all looked happy to see him. I was beginning to notice that he would speak at these people, but not really to them, and then we'd move on again. It would make an interesting social interaction study. \"All right, I gotta go say hi to the DJ. He knows me.\" \"You know a lot of people here tonight.\" I said. \"Yeah, I'm a popular guy.\" I raised an eyebrow at that, and FDR swotted me on the butt. I laughed at him, and he started tugging me forward once more. Some guy pulled up a rope and FDR nudged me forward, letting me go first. And then a table arrived right in front of me, and I realised something. It was like I was having an epiphany. This was FDR's version of a date. I sat down on the chair someone provided for me, but when FDR went to the bar, I jumped up and ran for it. I disappeared in the crowd of sweaty dancers, and made a beeline for the entrance, and my exit. I was almost across the street when I heard FDR following me. \"Hey, Rach! Where are you going?\" He asked me. \"Where are you going? We just got here.\" \"You didn't tell me this was a date, Franklin.\" \"Did you not know that? I thought it was obvious. Come on. We'll go back inside and we'll have a good time, like the old days. Just you and me.\" FDR tried persuading me, tugging me to a stop. I turned and faced him. \"But it's not like the old days. I've already moved past this stage, Franklin. Back in high school, when I was a gymnast, my best event was the keg stand, remember?\" \"We should see if they have a keg inside.\" He said. \"Unbelievable.\" \"What? All I said is that we should see if they have a keg stand inside.\" \"That's why I'm walking away right now.\" I said, turning to walk away, but he said something that stopped me from walking. \"Because you've gotten too uptight and don't know how to have a good time anymore?\" FDR questioned loudly, and made me turn right back around to snap at him. \"No, because I'm not going to ruin our friendship just so I can be another notch on your belt, Franklin. God. Sometimes you have the emotional intelligence of a 15-year-old boy. You think calling me uptight is going to make me want to date you or go back up in the club? I don't think so.\" \"Thank you, judgmental princess.\" FDR retorted. I shook my head at him, and tried not to laugh. Every time we've ever had an argument, I've always ended up in stitches. This was not the time for that, but I couldn't not laugh. \"Let's just call it a night.\" \"Please let's call it a night.\" FDR replied. \"Goodnight, FDR,\" I said, turning to walk away from him, but stopping when I noticed something very bad walking towards me. My high school boyfriend, Jason, was walking this way with a pretty, slender brunette on his arm. I'm pretty sure it was Marcie Paxton, the girl he cheated on me with in my senior year. I could not be standing here alone, still somewhat single (Tuck and I hadn't really spoken about what was going on with us), when he walked past me with her. \"Oh my god, this is not happening.\" I turned round, and grabbed FDR, who still looked pissed. \"Kiss me.\" \"What? No.\" FDR protested. \"Franklin, I will forgive you for duping me into a date with you, and for treating me like one of your other girls, if you would just kiss me right now.\" I hissed at him, looking away to see how close Jason was. \"Why would I do that? Are you bi-polar or something?\" He questioned, and I ignored the jab. I wasn't bi-polar, I was desperate. There's a difference. \"Because you wanted to do it the other day in the video store.\" I retorted, and pulled his face towards mine, and pressed my lips against his. He didn't respond straight away, but a second later, FDR was pulling me closer and holding me against him. I gripped the top of his suit so I wouldn't fall backwards, as our mouths moved roughly together in a passionate kiss. I barely heard Jason when he said my name. I was kind of blind sided by how good of a kisser FDR was. I could tell he'd had a lot of practice. Jason said my name again, and I pulled away from FDR actually reluctantly. \"Oh. Oh, Jason. Oh, my God, it's so weird running into you. That's so funny,\" I smiled, looking up at FDR to beg him with my eyes to play along. \"Um…this is my boyfriend, FDR.\" \"Cool. What do you do, man?\" Jason asked him. I glanced up at FDR again, who was just staring down at me, before I widened my eyes. I really did not want to look like a single loser in front of the first guy who broke my heart. FDR turned to him, and held out his hand. \"I'm a neurosurgeon. I'm the department head at the children's hospital.\" FDR answered, shaking Jason's hand. Jason looked unimpressed, but Marcie definitely was. I loved FDR's ability to lie effortlessly. It made this moment so much sweeter because Jason was now jealous of FDR because he had captured Marcie's attention very quickly. \"Wow, that's amazing.\" Marcie said, practically swooning over FDR. I wrapped my arm around his waist, and leaned into his side. I kind of shocked myself, as I realised just how territorial that move was. I didn't own FDR and he didn't belong to me. At. All. \"He is. He's really amazing.\" I agreed. \"Amazing?\" I heard Jason mutter. \"You know I don't know what makes me happier. The smile on a child's face or waking up next to you every morning,\" FDR said, and I almost swooned. God, I never knew he could be that sappy or romantic, lying or not. He looked down at me with a smile that I almost swore was real. \"I love you.\" \"I love you. I love you too.\" I replied, with a fake giggle as FDR kissed me again quickly. \"We're very happy.\" I told Jason and Marcie. Jason looked annoyed, which made me even happier. I had officially won our break-up, even if it was based on a lie. It still counted. Totally still counted. \"We are.\" FDR agreed. \"Yeah.\" Jason said, unenthusiastically. \"Who wouldn't be happy with a girl like this? She's got everything. She's got the beauty, the style, the grace.\" FDR said, smiling down at me. As I looked up into his eyes, I could have sworn the emotions there were real, but this was FDR. In the office, the other agents say he slays everything in his path by any means necessary. So who knew if he was being genuine anymore. \"He's so sweet to me.\" I said, kissing FDR again, slower this time. \"Yeah, I think we should get going.\" Jason said, looking awkward. We both turned our heads to look at him. \"Justin, it was such a pleasure. We gotta go.\" FDR said, holding his hand out for Jason to shake again, and purposefully getting his name wrong. I smirked a little at that. \"I mean, it's Jason, but that's cool,\" Jason said, taking his hand and shaking it once, before letting it go. \"Great meeting you.\" \"Jason, yeah. Whatever.\" FDR said, turning his attention to Marcie. \"Really nice meeting you.\" She said, looking at FDR as she said it. \"Really nice meeting you?\" Jason asked her, quietly. \"Sweetheart, it was a pleasure.\" FDR replied to her, grabbing her hand and kissing the back of it. \"Oh, look at that. A little kiss on the hand there. That's sweet.\" Jason said, pathetically. I wanted to burst out laughing at the annoyed expression on his face, but I held it in. Jason steered Marcie around us, clearly desperate to get away from us. Probably because he knew that I was with someone on a much higher level than him. Men hate that. \"You are so lucky.\" She said to me, as they walked past. \"I know.\" FDR laughed, but I'm pretty sure he was laughing at me, and not at Marcie. \"Bye, guys,\" FDR said, as we turned around to watch them leave. \"See you. Have fun, John.\" \"It's Jason.\" He replied, not even turning around. I sighed, and stopped smiling. My jaw ached from the amount of fake smiling I just did. \"Okay. Thank you, Franklin.\" I said, as soon as Jason and Marcie were far enough away from us. FDR pressed his finger behind his ear, and I knew he was going to milk this. \"What did you say? I'm a little deaf.\" \"I said, thank you. Thank you. You don't have to be annoying about it.\" I sighed, rolling my eyes at him. He just smirked at me. \"Let's go get some pizza. I know a place around the corner,\" When he saw me hesitate, he continued with a very valid argument to the argument I never got to say. \"Rach, you owe me an explanation for whatever that was.\" \"Okay. You're right, I do. That was weird.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Sure.\" We were sitting down in the pizza place, beer in hand, sharing the best meat lovers pizza I'd ever eaten, while I explained to him why I'd made him pretend to be my boyfriend. It wasn't that long of a story, if I was honest, especially after I'd condensed it slightly, removing the unnecessary parts. \"You remember how popular I was in high school, right? Well, he was the quarterback to my head cheerleader. In a romantic drama, he would have been the guy I ended up with.\" \"So? What went wrong?\" Franklin questioned. \"I found him in the girls room, half naked with Marcie Paxton, the girl he was just with, on prom night. It stung a little when I had to dance with him because we won prom king and queen, but I pulled through it. It was probably the most humiliating thing I've ever gone through. Except Moscow.\" \"I don't remember any of this. Why don't I remember this?\" Franklin asked me, sipping on his beer. \"I didn't tell you. I suffer in silence, you know that. Besides, he was my mistake, not yours.\" I smiled at him, shrugging. \"I don't believe in mistakes.\" FDR replied, his tone serious. I chuckled. \"That's a very convenient philosophy for you, isn't it, Franklin?\" I teased him, and he swotted my leg with his hand in response. \"It's the mistakes that makes us who we are.\" He replied. \"God, that is the most serious answer you've ever given to a question. And I mean ever. Who are you and what have you done to my FDR?\" I teased him, pretending to search his face to check if he was the real Franklin. He batted my hands away, and smiled at me. \"We were having a moment, and you just ruined it, Rach. You are a moment killer.\" He whined. \"I'm sorry. You're very smart, Franklin.\" I grinned at him, as I tried to make up for ruining our 'moment'. \"Yes, I am.\" \"Pretty smart for a club rat.\" I joked, sipping my beer. FDR laughed, shaking his head at me, pretending I'd offended him. Hey, if the club rat shoe fits…FDR would be wearing a pair. \"Ouch. Why must you wound me?\" \"Someone has to knock you down a peg, otherwise you'd need someone to cut you and your ego out of every room you go in.\" I joked, sipping on my beer again. \"Speaking of my ego, I think we should talk about that kiss. Or those kisses.\" FDR said, correcting himself at the end. I sighed, and sat up straighter. Of course, he'd bring that up. It was such a FDR thing to do. He couldn't just let it be. FDR stared at me, and I'll admit, my heart did race slightly, so I distracted myself by chugging the rest of my beer. After I'd placed the empty bottle back down on the counter, I turned my body back round to face him. His blue eyes were just so irritatingly beautiful. Why do men make things so difficult by being so damn attractive? \"I don't know what you want me to say, Franklin.\" I replied. \"Say you'll give me a second date.\" \"I didn't even know we were going on a first one. You're putting me into an uncomfortable position, FDR. I just went on a date with Tuck and we had a nice time and I like him. Do you know what it makes me look like going on a date with you the day after? Tuck probably hates me. I can't date both my partners. It's wrong.\" Franklin smiled at me. \"So you'll date one of us, and I'm guessing it's not me. Well, I'm a persistent man, Rachel Simmonds, you know that. I'll convince you to date me and you won't regret it.\" \"I don't regret anything, Franklin, but I'm not going to date you. You and I can only be friends.\" \"You keep telling yourself that, but I am going to prove you wrong. I can be that guy that girls want to date, that you'll want to date, and I will prove it to you.\" I groaned with frustration, and considered ordering another beer. FDR was one of those guys that once he set his mind to something, you couldn't turn him off it. He would become increasingly annoying until he'd accomplished what he'd set out to do. I'm not sure I'm mentally prepared for all of this.[Chapter 6] FDR walked into headquarters the next day with a smile on his face. Other than a couple of hiccups, his date with Rachel had gone well. They'd eventually enjoyed themselves over pizza and despite the fact she insisted it wasn't a date, she'd admitted that she'd had fun. Rachel had even said, as he dropped her off at her place, that they should hang out alone more often. FDR had smirked at that in victory, causing her to clarify it would only be only as friends. \"Agent Simmonds looked good last night.\" FDR turned round and looked at the technician who'd spoken to him with confusion, before he turned around again. He paused thinking about it, until he realized. Tuck had re-conned his date. His best friend had re-conned his date with his other best friend, even when she insists it wasn't a date (which it was). That totally went against their gentlemen's agreement! FDR carried on walking towards their 'office' space, and was glad to see Tuck already at his desk, tapping away on the keyboard of his computer. He walked between the desks and paced for a second, before speaking. \"You re-conned my date.\" He accused, standing still and crossing his arms over his chest. \"What? No. No.\" Tuck adamantly denied, as he stopped typing and put his feet up on his desk. \"Yeah, you did.\" \"Okay. I'm sorry, I did. I re-conned your date.\" Tuck said, sounding ashamed, but FDR was annoyed at his long-time best friend and partner. \"We had a deal!\" \"I know. Sorry, I just started thinking-\" Tuck attempted to explain himself, but FDR cut him off. \"You started thinking?\" He questioned, sarcastically. \"I had to find out-I don't know. That's all.\" Tuck replied. \"So if there was some action, what were you gonna do? Call in Special Ops?\" FDR asked, only half-sarcastically. He was curious on how far a jealous Tuck would have gone if FDR and Rachel's date (which was a date no matter how many times she denied it wasn't) had progressed to, as Tuck calls it, 'hanky panky'. Not that it would have anyway. Rachel wasn't that kind of girl. She was all for the whole dating game, and marriage and babies and stuff. FDR hadn't ever really seen the appeal to it all before. \"No!\" \"Sniper squad? Take me out?\" \"No, no. I mean-\" Both men shut up as Rachel approached with Collins. From the way that Rachel's brow was furrowed and a frown was set on her face, they were talking about something serious. Or something that Rachel didn't like. Or both. It was possible. \"Our Munich office got a hit back on one of Heinrich's men from Hong Kong. Name is Ivan Sokolov,\" Collins explained, handing FDR an identical information packet to the one that Rachel was now looking through herself. \"Here's a surveillance file from the DFS in Mexico. We expect he's trying to get Heinrich into the country through L.A Harbor.\" \"Chatter suggests that Ivan lives here in L.A. Heinrich probably has men planted all over in case of situations like this.\" Rachel explained, not looking up from her information packet as she walked over to her desk and sat down. \"Now, flush him out.\" Collins ordered, walking away. \"She's definitely lost her sparkle,\" FDR commented as soon as his boss was out of ear shot. He tossed Tuck the file and sat at his desk, and gave them a plan of action. \"All right, look, you flag Interpol, I'll call some of our contacts. Rachel, you try to dig up as much information on our guy and try to find locations he will most likely be.\" Rachel nodded and jumped up out of her seat. \"Where are you going?\" Tuck asked, his eyes following her as she walked around her desk. \"I'm gonna hunt up a techie, and get some I.T support. More screens equals more space to find our newest friend.\" Rachel explained, as she strolled away, file in hand. Her two partners watched as she approached a technician, clicked her fingers at him, and walked away with the guy snapping at her heels like her own personal lap dog. She had a talent, sometimes she abused that talent. \"I really like Rachel.\" Tuck said, looking over at FDR. \"I really like her too.\" FDR replied, not looking up from a file he had in his hands. \"No, I really, really like her.\" Tuck said, emphasizing his words as he tried to make his friend understand. FDR had always been clueless when it came to feelings. Especially when it came to romantic feelings. Once Rachel had caught her boyfriend cheating on her when they had come home from the Moscow mission, and FDR had taken her out and tried to find a guy for her to take home. That had led to the pair's biggest argument ever. \"So do I.\" FDR said, glancing up at Tuck to show that he meant what he was saying. \"You do?\" \"Yeah, I do.\" \"So you're not backing off?\" Tuck questioned. \"Nope.\" FDR answered, popping the 'p' in 'nope', mostly to emphasis the word, but also to try and wind Tuck up a little bit, which was relatively easy. Especially now. \"Okay,\" Tuck replied, moving the file off his lap. \"Then you ought to know that when we went out on our date, Rachel and I…we, um…\" Tuck made a gesture to show what he meant, but it only confused FDR. \"What? What did you do?\" \"We shared a kiss.\" Tuck said. \"Wow.\" FDR replied, sarcastically, making Tuck frown at him. That kiss had meant a lot to him, and here his best friend was belittling it. It was a sweet moment that had confirmed to Tuck that Rachel possibly shared his feelings. At least enough to kiss him for ten minutes and not run away or laugh at him afterwards. \"Mm-hm.\" Tuck turned back to his computer monitor and started tapping away on his keyboard again. \"An incredibly magical kiss with tongue. Oh, dear. Wonderful.\" FDR teased Tuck, mimicking his British accent to add further insult to injury. Tuck glared at his friend. \"You are an animal.\" \"Look, pal, we kissed too. It was pretty special and I don't think it'll be the last.\" FDR said, using his normal voice and looking through some of his contact files to see if any of them had any connection to Ivan or Heinrich. \"Well, we'll see about that, won't we?\" Tuck replied. \"We shall see about that.\" \"Yes, we will. We will see about that.\" FDR looked up at Tuck, who was typing again and glaring at the monitor like it was his enemy. \"Don't do that. Don't say what I just said.\" \"We will see about that. About that, we will see. We will see about that. About that, we will see.\" \"About what, will we see?\" Both men looked up at Rachel, who had returned, walking whilst staring down at a tablet. She lowered it and raised her head, glancing at both of them in turn. Tuck and FDR exchanged a glance and nodded. \"Nothing.\" They said in unison, which both impressed and irritated their female partner. Rachel rolled her eyes, and moved until she could collapse into her chair. \"Whatever. Don't tell me. I probably don't want to know anyway,\" She mumbled, looking up at them and noticing that they were still looking at her. \"Let's get to work, gentlemen. I'm not doing it all myself.\" They both seemed to snap out of their own little words, and went back to work. Rachel shook her head at the pair before she continued to read through the information on her tablet. She and the techie had gotten quite a few locations that Ivan like to inhabit, and now she was trying to see if they had any informants that hung around those places. \"Weirdoes.\" She muttered under her breath. Tuck had gathered a group of techies together in one of the smaller training rooms at headquarters. In order to make sure that Rachel fell in love with him instead of FDR, he had to know everything there was to know about her, even the stuff that she kept private. Normally, he would respect her space and her privacy, but this was necessary. \"Right. This is a live operation, it's a full wrap and tap, boys. I want parabolics, infrareds, sat cams, everything we got on the job,\" Tuck ordered, as the men sat in front of him nodded along to his words. \"And we are gathering intel on Agent Rachel Simmonds.\" \"Agent Simmonds, sir?\" Boyles questioned, already knowing that there was something wrong with this. Why would they be gathering intel on Agent Simmonds? If she found out, she would kill them all in some excruciatingly painful way that would make it impossible for them to have an open casket funeral. \"Yes, Boylee. What are her secret likes and dislikes. I want to know what makes her laugh, what makes her cry. Her best friends outside the agency, all family members. Everything is important. Who she was sleeping with last week.\" \"You want us to take them out?\" Boyles questioned. Tuck stared at the ground, thinking hard about his answer, before he shook his head. \"No.\" \"I'm sorry, boss, but what does this have to do with Heinrich?\" Boyles asked, though he already had an inkling as to what answer he would get. \"I'm afraid that's level 5 classified. For my eyes only,\" Tuck answered very quickly. \"This operation is top secret, lads. Don't let your country down.\" \"Roger that.\" Boyles, and the other two agents said in unison, causing Tuck to smile. FDR was stood in front of three technicians he had rounded up to help him gather intelligence on Rachel. He had grown up with her, but she had her secrets. There weren't any big secrets between them, because they made that a rule. It was her Rule Number Five: No life-altering secrets. He knew quite a lot about Rachel Simmonds, but he needed to know everything in order to make her fall in love with him instead of Tuck. \"Okay, gentlemen, this is a live operation. I want you to acquire intel on one Agent Rachel Simmonds.\" FDR announced to his techies. \"Simmonds, sir?\" Bothwick asked, not understanding what connection Agent Simmonds could have to the Heinrich case, other than the obvious one. \"Yes, Simmonds. I want intel on her. What are her secret likes, dislikes. Her favourite movies, music, books. I want to know her best friends, family members. And the last three guys she slept with.\" FDR instructed the three men, who nodded along, remembering everything. \"You want us to take them out?\" Bothwick questioned. It was a plausible thing to ask. They did take people out. They were allowed to do that as members of a governmental organisation. \"Yea-no.\" FDR decided. If three of her ex-lovers were found dead, Rachel would get suspicious. She wasn't dumb, she'd work it out eventually and then she'd cut special body parts off, parts that he'd gotten rather emotionally invested in after all these years. \"I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with the Heinrich case?\" Bothwick inquired. \"That's level 5 classified. For my eyes only. This operation is top secret. Don't let your country down, boys.\" FDR smiled at the three technicians, who nodded once at him. \"Roget that, boss.\" Tuck and FDR disappeared for most of the day doing only God knows what, so I didn't even see them before I clocked out and went home. I decided to have a 'me' night. I'd just gone out the past two nights, so tonight was the night I was going to spend by myself, listening to Montell Jordan's 'This Is How We Do It' very loudly, eating popcorn, looking at adorable shelter dogs and watching one of my favourite movies, \"Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid\", in nothing but a giant sweater. It's one of the movies that FDR and I used to watch with Grandpa Foster when we were kids and the sweater was super comfy. As I sung along to Montell Jordan, occasionally throwing in the odd dance move, I felt like someone was in my apartment. I shook it off, though, because a) my home phone was unlisted, b) I always switch up the way I go home in case someone is following me and c) my house is a step down from being as secure as Fort Knox. The only people that could get in were Tuck and FDR, but they both said they had plans when I asked them what they were up to for the night. So I just shrugged it off as paranoia and carried on with my night. As soon as my popcorn was done, I hopped over to my couch and turned the volume up on my flat screen TV and settled in for the night. I didn't get the bad feeling again all night which just confirmed to me that it was paranoia brought on by thinking that someone was trying to smuggle Heinrich into the state. Though I don't know how he would know that we lived in LA, because we were in Hong Kong when Jonas Heinrich accidentally took a nose dive off the top of that building. He wouldn't find us...at least not for a while. Tuck watched Rachel as she danced around her kitchen, before he went in. He knew that Rachel had a keen instinct and would probably know someone was there the moment they stepped in, but he had to place bugs around her house so he could eavesdrop on her conversations with her friends to see what she was saying about him. He hadn't actually been inside her house in a while and noticed that the collectible Camaro collection was new and took note of that. He knew that Rachel was a car fanatic, but he couldn't remember what her favourite car was. Now he did. He placed a couple of bugs upstairs before he quickly made his exit, before Rachel caught him and killed him for breaking into her place. Rachel hated her privacy being disrespected, and that's why he and FDR always called before they dropped by her house. They had been yelled at too many times to not remember to do that. FDR broke into Rachel's house, stalking down the stairs from the top floor to the bottom floor when the coast was clear, listening to her sing along to 'This Is How We Do It' as he placed bugs around the communal areas. He was placing one on one of her lampshades when he noticed a small painting by Gustav Klimt. He didn't know that Rachel liked art. He ducked behind into her den as she came out of her bathroom, still singing along to the music. She glanced at her open laptop on her counter space as she went past it and aww'd at the screen. When she moved away and he wasn't in her sights any more, FDR moved and looked at what was on the screen. A website for a pet shelter. FDR memorized this, realizing he didn't know Rachel as well as he thought he did, before he snuck out again, before she caught him. Because Rachel would kill him if she caught him sneaking around her house while she was wearing nothing but a jumper that barely passed her ass. Not that he was complaining. It had been quite the distraction. The next day at headquarters, me and my lap-dog, Techie (as I have affectionately labelled him because I cannot for the life of me remember his name) got an address for Ivan Sokolov, Heinrich's guy, so first I notified Collins and then me and the boss lady went to tell Tuck and FDR. Only when we approached mine, FDR and Tuck's 'office' space, the two idiots were just sitting there, engaging in a really competitive game of paper toss, chucking paper balls into the bin in front of my desk. They looked like a pair of kids passive-aggressively fighting over something. Which made me wonder what they were fighting over. \"What the hell is going on in here?\" Collins demanded, which made both men take their feet off their desks and sit up simultaneously. I shook my head at them, sighing. I don't know what was going on with them, but they were acting weird, and had been for a while now. \"Nothing.\" FDR answered. \"Well, I'm sorry to interrupt playtime, but your partner got an address on Ivan Sokolov, and we thought you boys might wanna get out of the office.\" Both guys jumped to their feet quickly, but I noticed that Tuck threw one last paper ball and I watched as it hit its target. I turned and walked away, both the guys following me as I headed out of headquarters and to my SUV. \"Wanna tell me what the pissing match was about?\" I asked, glancing at them both as I drove us to the address, looking out of the corner of my eyes at FDR and in my rear-view mirror at Tuck. \"Nope.\" FDR and Tuck replied together. I shook my head, and clenched the wheel a little tighter. \"That's fine. You guys don't have to tell me anything. Just leave whatever it is back at the office and keep your heads in the game. I don't want to get shot because you're having some petty squabble that you refuse to tell me about.\" I snapped at them. I don't care if it was harsh. I didn't want to get shot and then have to spent even longer out of the field because Tuck and FDR are having problems. And I needed to be able to trust them to have my back and put aside whatever shit they had going on to be able to do that. I pulled up in an alleyway a street over, so that we had a quick getaway (if we needed to catch Ivan) that wouldn't get spotted by any guys who were protecting the club. Ivan hangs out at a strip club, which really isn't surprising if I'm honest. It's a tad stereotypical of him, because most bad guys spent a lot of time at strip clubs, but hey, that's his business. It just gets tiring going into these types of places, where the women are half-naked and ogled at and in turn I get ogled at by these aroused, demeaning men. This part of my job kinda sucked. I walked in between FDR and Tuck as we headed to the club entrance, and they began arguing over who was taking lead. \"I'll take lead, you run backup.\" FDR said. \"No, I was thinking of taking lead on this one, thank you.\" Tuck argued. \"I'm always the first in the door.\" FDR retaliated. \"You're not always first at everything.\" Tuck retorted quietly as we approached the bouncer. \"Oh for…I'm taking lead,\" I whispered, stepping forward. I smiled seductively at the big, well-built man in front of me, and looked up through my eyelashes at him. \"Hi. We're friends of Ivan.\" The guy's eyes raked over my body before settling back on my face with a smirk, then he nodded his head and stepped out of the way of the door. I glanced back at the guys and walked in and stopped just inside the door, waiting for them. I pointed at Tuck and FDR in turn as I gave them their orders. \"You're the drunk, you're the sober friend and I'm going to stick around at the bar in case he tries to make a break for it. That's the plan. Don't get each other killed.\" I instructed, with a glare, before I turned and made a beeline for the bar, ignoring the half naked women who were gyrating on pretty much every surface. I watched out of my peripheral vision as Tuck and FDR went into the back, Tuck already starting to pretend to stumble. I had to give him props for his acting skills. He was a very convincing drunk. \"What can I get you, beautiful? A drink? A job?\" The bartender asked me, leering at me from over the counter. I smiled politely at him, and resisted the urge to punch him. Whatever the guys were arguing about was already starting to frustrate me. For starters, we never had secrets. It was one of the reasons we functioned so well as a team, because everything was out in the open. And secondly, they were letting it affect us. And that pissed me off. \"You can get me the coldest beer you've got.\" He did as he was told, but I didn't even get to have two sips of it, before gun fire sounded off in the back, and Ivan burst through into the club wielding a shot gun. I climbed out of my seat, watching as Tuck and FDR darted forward, and held back. Someone had to use their head here. And it was clear to me that my partners were running on pure adrenaline and little common sense right now. They weren't really working together like they normally did. It seemed to me as if they were both trying to capture him themselves. I waited until Ivan threw Tuck off of him and into FDR, knocking them over like bowling pins, before I jumped into action. I vaulted over a banister and ran onto the stage, and tackled Ivan into one of the stripper poles. We both hit it hard, but Ivan rolled out of my reach and pulled out a handgun, aiming it at me and pulling the trigger quickly. Luckily for me, he was a poor shot (which is bad for a henchman), because he aimed for my chest but shot me in the arm. I hissed in pain, but recovered quickly. Probably due to my own rush of adrenaline. I dived towards him, rolling forward and kicking out his legs from underneath him. I disarmed him, but he managed to get a lucky punch to my face. I punched him in the throat, stunning him and then pulled his arms behind his back and cuffed him. FDR and I pointed our guns at Ivan making sure he wouldn't try anything as Tuck dragged him backwards so he could tie him to one of the poles so he couldn't run. As soon as I was satisfied he wasn't going to move, I stepped away from him and glanced at my partners. \"I've got to say boys, I'm a huge fan of your work. Great job today, really!\" I said, sarcastically, before I walked back to the bar to see if my beer was still standing and full. All that was left of my ice cold beer was several shards of glass and a puddle that dripped over the counter and onto the floor, so I stormed back over to FDR and Tuck. I ignored them and dropped down onto the stage and dialed Collins' number. \" I assume that you have Ivan in possession .\" \"Yes, ma'am. We need an extraction and medical team.\" \" Extraction and medical team ETA five minutes .\" \"Thanks, boss.\" I hung up the phone, and eased my leather jacket off, grimacing as the leather grazed the bullet wound. I pulled my shirt off, thankful that I was wearing a tank top underneath, and looked at the wound. \"You've been shot?\" FDR questioned. \"Nope, I fell on a ketchup bottle.\" I rolled my eyes at him, before I continued scrutinizing my wound to see how deep the bullet went in. It wasn't that deep, but I decided to leave it until the medics got here to remove it, so I just held my bloodied top against it to staunch the blood. Tuck sat down next to me, and pulled my now ruined shirt away from my arm and glanced at it. Then he gently probed the skin around the bullet hole, hesitating when I hissed in pain, before continuing. Tuck then ripped the sleeve off my shirt and tied it around the wound as a makeshift bandage. \"There you are. That's a little better, isn't it?\" Tuck murmured, mostly to himself, before he raised his eyes from my arm to my eyes. \"So I'm guessing he wasn't convinced by your acting, huh?\" I questioned. \"Apparently Heinrich doesn't have friends.\" FDR replied, sitting on my other side. I chuckled a little bit at that. \"Of course not. What evil, international criminal has friends, really?\" I joked, really wanting to just rest my head against Tuck's shoulder, hold FDR's hand and doze off for a couple of minutes while we wait for the medic, because the adrenaline was wearing off and my arm was actually beginning to hurt. But because we were sitting in front of Ivan, I couldn't because it wouldn't be professional or wise. \"None that I can think of.\" Tuck replied, and I smiled at him. The evac and medical team arrived moments later, and some agents grabbed Ivan, and I pretty much had to order Tuck and FDR to go and supervise his transportation, while the medics came and took out the bullet lodged in my arm and wrapped it up. Instead of heading back to headquarters though, I just drove back to my apartment. I showered and changed into a loose fitting sweater that covered my arm up and then texted Lauren and Trish, asking them to come over. I needed someone to talk to about this whole Tuck and FDR business. I mean tonight is just proof of the fact that I cannot just date two men at once, even though I wasn't dating FDR and I'd only been on one date with Tuck. But still I began to freak out and needed to talk to the only two female friends that I was close to that lived in LA. So Lauren and Trish came over, though Trish told me that this had better be worth it because she had to hire a babysitter, and I cracked open a bottle of red wine. Trish and Lauren sat on the other side of my kitchen island and I stood, sipping on my wine before I explained my problem. They both seemed pretty pleased with me. Trish seemed ecstatic actually. Apparently her and Bob only got to have sex once a week on a Wednesday at 9:00 pm and that she was happy because now she could 'live a fantasy life through me'. \"I just can't believe that this is one of my problems now. Last month, I was dating my TIVO. This month, I'm potentially dating my two gorgeous best friends.\" \"You need to stop referring to your TIVO as if it's a man. It's not. You sound like you're an old lady with nine cats who knits her ass off,\" Trish said, making me chuckle into my wine glass. \"And you never said gorgeous. You said good-looking. There's a difference-\" \"You wanna see a picture of them?\" I questioned, grabbing my phone and going through my photos to find suitable pictures of Tuck and FDR. \"Yes.\" Lauren and Trish said together. \"Give it!\" Lauren demanded, holding her hand out for my phone. I clicked on a picture I found of FDR and made sure there was one right next to it of Tuck so she could just slide it across and see. I passed Lauren the phone and she and Trish leaned in together to looked at the picture. \"Oh. Wow.\" Lauren said, staring down at the picture of FDR. I think it was from a dinner at Nana's last summer. \"Right?\" I asked. \"That's dirty sex. You know when you know you're gonna have dirty sex and it's gonna stink. Not like sex. I mean, like, man stink, the good stuff,\" Trish said, and I laughed at her little rant. That's the way Trish was sometimes. She would talk and talk and talk and not realise she was doing it. \"That's pretty impressive. For you, yeah. What does the other one look like?\" FDR was in his recon room, watching the live surveillance from Rachel's house. She had her two friends over, Lauren and Trish, and they were discussing him and Tuck. Rachel seemed to be pretty confused about the whole situation, and FDR knew how Rachel hates confusion. Rachel Simmonds and confusion did not mix well. \"That's pretty impressive. For you, yeah. What does the other one look like?\" \" You just scroll over.\" Rachel instructed Trish. \"Oh, my God. He is hot too.\" FDR heard the door behind him slide open so he jumped to his feet, thinking it was Collins. Tuck looked at him and closed the door behind him. FDR sighed, thankful it wasn't his boss, because she would definitely have killed him for this, or, worse, told Rachel so she could kill him. \"I am impressed by you. This is hotness. That man is-\" \"You scared the shit out of me,\" FDR said, as he sat back down in his seat. He turned round and looked at his partner, who just stood at the back of the small room with his hands clasped behind his head, trying not to glance at the monitors that displayed Rachel's apartment. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yup.\" \"Medically speaking?\" \"Fine.\" \"They're people, not products. \" Rachel's friend, Lauren, said to the crazier blonde . The moment's silence between the two men allowed her voice to be heard, before FDR drowned the trio of blondes out again. \"You're not a very good liar, you know that?\" \"Oh, yes, and you are. Seeing as we're both here, we might as well share resources.\" Tuck replied, grabbing a chair and moving it so he was directly in front of the monitors. \"They're the most incredible guys!\" Rachel said. \"Guess I don't have a choice. Please, sit down.\" FDR said, sarcastically as Tuck did just that. \"Oh, I'm staying.\" \"Okay, good, good. Well, I'm available as a friend. If you want me to have sex with both of those guys just to test out stuff and see who comes back a winner and who doesn't…\" \"Okay, good, good. Well, I'm available as a friend. If you want me to have sex with both of those guys just to test out stuff and see who comes back a winner and who doesn't and they wouldn't even know it was me. I'd pretend I was you. I'd put my hair up in a pony,\" Trish rambled off a plan that she knew I wouldn't agree to anyway. She lived in this wonderful dream world and I give her points for that. \"Obviously I'm busy, because I'm a mother, but I would carve out time in my schedule because that's the kind of friend I am.\" I exchanged a look with Lauren, before I looked back at Trish. \"Okay. I love you, Trish, but that's not helpful.\" I said, locking my phone again after Lauren passed it back to me. I placed it on the counter and looked at Lauren for help. \"We could do one of my focus groups I do at work. You can be the focus group and me and Trish can be in charge.\" Lauren suggested. \"That's actually a good idea! Let's do that.\" I replied, sipping on my wine and moving around the island so I was sitting next to Trish. Trish turned to face me and Lauren moved her seat so they were both looking towards me. \"Okay. This is good, I like this.\" Trish said, moving around in her chair to get comfortable. \"Okay, so we will ask you questions about the \"products\". And you tell us who you like and why.\" Lauren instructed me. I nodded, and downed the rest of my wine before I spoke. \"They're both incredible.\" \"What a struggle. I have to go home and clean tartar sauce out of Bob's beard right now and probably one of his un-descended testicles and you're gonna sit here and talk to me about how amazing these guys are.\" Trish ranted, making me laugh. \"This is why I love you, Trish. You have a way of painting the most vivid picture of your weird but wonderful life.\" I teased her, grabbing the wine bottle and refilling my glass. \"Is there anything bad about these guys?\" Lauren asked me, pulling my mind away from the disturbing mental image of Trish's husband Bob naked with a jar of tartar sauce. I've had better mental images. \"Okay, let me think. Flaws. Isn't it funny that I've known these guys for years, but I can't think of anything-\" I cut myself off, and snapped my fingers as a helpful mental picture popped into my head. \"There is one thing! FDR has these tiny, like, girl hands. Like little T-Rex hands.\" \"Oh, gross! That means he's got a Mike and Ike for a penis.\" Trish said, making me laugh. \"Actually no. I grew up with FDR, lived in the same house with him for years, and he had problems with locking the bathroom door. He's doesn't have a Mike and Ike. Trust me.\" I said, making Lauren giggle and Trish practically foam at the mouth. She was probably trying to visualise FDR naked. \"And Tuck…I don't know. Maybe he's too romantic. Like the relationship to him could be some whole fairy-tale romance with this perfect, happy ending. But at the same time, I kinda like that he's really romantic. A girl's got to feel special, you know?\" \"So they're about the same, they're kind of even.\" Trish replied. \"So you've got to get into decision-making mode.\" Lauren instructed me. \"Yeah, and I need you to do it kind of quickly, because this is fun, but I'm not the one having sex. So I can't be that invested.\" Trish said, shrugging her shoulders. As she mentioned time, an idea popped into my head. \"Okay. You know what I need?\" I asked. \"Mm. A joint.\" Trish suggested, taking a large gulp of wine after she 'contributed'. I shook my head at her. \"No. I need a deadline. I've got to give myself a finite amount of time to make this decision.\" \"That's good.\" Lauren said. \"One week and I have to make a decision.\" I decided. \"One week?\" Trish questioned. FDR and Tuck exchanged a glance. They had a deadline to convince Rachel that she should choose them and not their best friend. One week and counting.[Chapter 7] \"Okay, so Rachel Anne Simmonds was born in Arizona, but moved to Los Angeles when she was seven to go on to live in various orphanages and foster homes until the age of 12 when she was taken in by Agent Foster's grandparents. She graduated high school at the top of her class, with a full scholarship to several colleges, namely Princeton University, Columbia U, the University of Chicago and Stanford University. She joined the CIA, and passed her field agents exam with the highest recommendations from the examiners, who noted that her skills in both hand-to-hand combat and weapon combat surpassed their high expectations,\" Tuck's main technician and the head of his recon team told him. Most of it he already knew, but it didn't hurt to be reminded. \"She's a fan of classic rock and collecting mini Camaros.\" \"What, as in the cars?\" Tuck questioned, a plan forming in his head. Oh, Rachel was going to love this! I don't know what spurred Tuck to do this, but I'm not going to complain. He showed up at my apartment, with a giant, pleased grin on his face, told me to change out of my sweats because he was taking me out. So I put on a nice pair of black skinny jeans, a red checkered top, and some black boots. After I brushed my hair up into a ponytail, we were out the door, in his car, and suddenly racing one of the sweetest Camaros I'd ever seen. I love a good Camaro. It's just one of those cars that always looks cool and is great to drive if it's kept in a great condition. \"Oh, my god, this is so fun!\" I said, as I turned a corner, letting the rear drag out a little bit, causing a little bit of smoke to come off the tires. \"You're a natural in this.\" Tuck said, sounding a little nervous. I smirked at that. He knew my driving skills were amazing, but I was driving a little more recklessly and a little less controlled then I would in a car chase. Mostly because there were no civilians around. \"It's so weird. My ex-boyfriend used to collect these. He was one of those rich kids rebelling against their parents. But his were never as nice as this one, and he never let me drive them.\" I told him, as I gave the car a little more gas to work with. I watched the speedometer needle rise, and grinned to myself. This particular Camaro was so beautiful, and ran like a dream. \"I can't impossibly imagine why he wouldn't do that.\" Tuck teased me, and I laughed at him, until I heard what I thought was gun fire. I took my eyes off the track in front of me, \"What was that? Did you just shoot something?\" I asked, my eyes alternating between him and the track in front of me. I was pretty sure it was gunfire, but Tuck wouldn't purposely lie to me. I had definitely heard something that sounded like gunfire. \"No. That was the exhaust backfiring. Give it some throttle. Go on!\" Tuck encouraged, clearly wanting to get off the subject and distract me with the car. \"O-kay,\" I said, still not believing him, but seeing no reason as to why he would shoot something out in the middle of the racetrack, so I mentally shrugged off my paranoia. \"Woohoo!\" I let go off the wheel for a second, throwing my hands up in the air, and Tuck quickly grabbed the wheel as if I was about to lose control of the car. I laughed and smacked his hands away, slowing down a tad so he'd stop having a heart attack. I smiled at him, and took one hand off the wheel to hold one of his. \"You need to relax!\" I said, pressing on the gas again, slowly making the speedometer's needle rise. Tuck was watching it like a hawk as it hit 70 mph, and then 80, and I swear, I saw him have a brain aneurysm when the speedometer's needle pushed 90 mph. I grinned at his expression, and laughed out loud, but I was barely heard over the throaty growl of the engine. I saw the beginning of the track and I hit the brakes, listening gleefully to the sound of the tires squealing before we came to a stop. I laughed at Tuck's panicked expression and climbed out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition for the owner who was waiting for us. Tuck came up behind me and wrapped his arm around my waist, leading me back to his car. He went to open the door for me, but I turned around to face him. \"That was a lot of fun. Thoughtful because you know I'm a car fanatic. Thank you.\" I said, tip-toeing slightly so I could press my lips against his. Tuck responded within seconds, his hands gripping my waist as mine locked together behind his head. Tuck was an amazing kisser, better than I'd imagined he would have been. Eventually I pulled away with a satisfied smile on my face. \"I'm thinking I should have asked you out years ago.\" Tuck said, not taking his hands away from my waist, so we stayed put. \"Maybe you should have.\" Tuck kissed me again softer than the first, before pulling away and letting me go, much to my bitter disappointment. You know that unsatisfied feeling when you do something but then its over too soon and you kinda wanted it to go further? Yeah. It sucks. Tuck took me home and kissed me goodbye at the door, and we both ignored the parts of ourselves that wanted to take it further, and he left with all of his clothes on. \"She volunteers at dog shelters with her friend Lauren when she has time off. She favors red wine when she's got female company, beer with male company and scotch or Russian vodka when she's alone. She likes lavender bath salts and she collects posters by Gustav Klimt.\" FDR's main technician, Bothwick, who was also his head of 'operations', read out loud to him from the information they'd gathered or observed about Rachel. No one knew exactly why they were re-conning one of their own agents or what connection she had to their current case, but they went along with it anyway. Mostly out of hope they'd get paid for over time. \"Huh?\" \"Yeah. Austrian cat. Boy can paint. Ain't you never seen The Kiss? You know, like that…\" Bothwick started imitating two people kissing and FDR looked down at him from where he was sitting up on the desk. \"Yeah, of course I have.\" FDR replied, and he realized what his next date with Rachel had to be. Something that she normally wouldn't have the opportunity to do, and probably wouldn't even think of doing herself. Something special. So FDR hadn't given up on the whole idea of us dating, so when he told me he had a surprise for me, I was a little wary about it. He took me to a warehouse, and, despite knowing him for years and trusting him with my life, I was comforted by the feeling of the small pistol I had strapped to my leg underneath my red dress. I was always prepared. He led me through this giant crate maze, until we turned a corner and he stopped, allowing me to bask in the brilliance of several Gustav Klimt paintings. \"Is this what I think it is?\" I questioned, walking forward, my eyes flickering to each painting, soaking it all in. \"You're a fan, right?\" FDR asked me. \"Of Gustav Klimt?\" \"Of Gustav Klimt. He's my favourite artist.\" \"You don't like art, Franklin. Unless it's nude art,\" I teased him, throwing a smile at him so he would know that I was joking. \"He's my favourite artist. This is incredible. Are these real?\" \"Yeah.\" We walked closer the paintings, and FDR pointed at the smallest one that we were closest too. \"Do you recognise this? The Harpist, 1895?\" \"Yes. I've seen it in a book.\" \"Pre-secession movement. The tension between the two-and three-dimensionality is incredible,\" He waved me over to another painting, and I was stunned. How? How did FDR know all of this? FDR? I must've hit my head really hard and not realised it, because clearly I was experiencing some sort of concussion induced hallucinations or I was dreaming in a coma. \"This is my favourite.\" \"Undine, 1902.\" \"Oh, my goodness, this is amazing.\" I breathed as I stared at Klimt's painting. It was beautiful. \"Innovation became intrinsic to Degas and other modernists. You can see influence of art nouveau,\" FDR explained, still surprising me with all his knowledge until he carried on speaking. \"He was a strong advocate of the finger-painting movement.\" \"What?\" I asked, tearing my eyes of the art and to him. FDR started to stumble over his words and stopped making any sense. All I really took out of it was he thought Gustav Klimt sometimes used mud and sticks and his hands and he used something else when he couldn't find a stick, but he stopped himself from making an even bigger ass out of himself. \"You know, I think enough talking,\" He said, stepping backwards to a painting covered with a sheet. \"Let's let the paintings speak for themselves.\" He yanked the sheet off and uncovered The Kiss. I stared up at it, smiling at the beauty of it, barely aware that FDR had moved away and was by my side. \"Wow. It's so beautiful,\" I turned to him, and slid my hand down his arm until I was holding his hand. I looked back at the painting and rested my head on FDR's shoulder as I soaked it all in. Gustav Klimt was a genius. \"It's amazing. Just incredible.\" \"Yeah. It is.\" FDR agreed. \"Thank you.\" I said, looking up at him. \"Anything for you, Rach.\" He replied, staring down into my eyes, almost sucking me into his baby blues. God, why did they have to be blue? Why not brown? Boring brown eyes that looked like mud, instead of bright blue eyes that sparkled like the Caribbean sea. This made my decision making more difficult. That night when I went home I called Lauren. \"How did it go? \" Lauren asked me, as I moved around my kitchen, my phone stuck between my ear and my shoulder and my hands grabbing ingredients for my dinner. \"They both went well. Too well. I don't know what to do.\" \"I'm coming over. Give me fifteen minutes and have the wine open.\" \"Got it.\" I hung up the phone, and put away all the food I'd just dragged out of my cabinets and my fridge. I'd probably end up having take-out anyway. I grabbed a bottle of wine from my fridge and two glasses and opened the wine, ready and waiting for Lauren to get here. But while I waited, I had a mini panic attack, and questioned the morality of what I was doing. Dating my two best friends? What kind of masochistic moron did that? Well...me, obviously, but why was I doing this to myself and to Tuck and FDR? It was stupid, and frustrating, and so unfair to everyone involved. I drank my glass of wine to cool my nerves, before pouring another. The doorbell rang and I rushed to get it, eager to get Lauren's advice. \"Alright, go up on 5. Let's pump the audio a little bit.\" FDR instructed Bothwick, as the watched the monitors. Rachel was in her kitchen, waiting for her friend, already drinking a glass of wine as she waited. \"Are you sure about this, sir? We might have some constitutional issues here.\" Bothwick warned, before he did anything. Though he knew his 'boss' would have some retort that would make what they were doing okay. \"Patriot Act.\" FDR replied. \"It's not just that, sir, but if Agent Simmonds finds out that we've bugged her house and listened in on her conversations…she'll kill us all.\" Bothwick said, and FDR knew that it was a possibility. If there was anything that Rachel disliked more than groomers, it was her privacy being invaded. Once FDR had gone through her desk, looking to see if she'd hidden his and Tuck's Christmas gifts in there, but she'd caught him and he had quickly found himself on the floor with a knife pressed against his throat. Rachel was a great, sweet girl, but she was deadly too. She had taken lessons in more than just the combat training they received when they had joined the CIA. She had learnt all sorts of martial arts, and her gymnastics only helped her become even more deadly. \"I promise she won't find out. Now could you just-\" FDR trailed off, gesturing at the monitor. Bothwick sighed, and pressed the button that would bump up the audio, just in time for Rachel to sit down at her kitchen island with her friend. \"So how was it?\" Lauren asked her. \"They're both incredible. FDR has these amazing eyes that you just wanna melt into. So beautiful. He really challenges me, you know. But I've known him since I was twelve. He's that guy who's always on, he's super slick. Sometimes, I think he doesn't care about anything more than himself. Even when we were kids, he looked out for his best interests,\" Rachel explained, occasionally sipping her wine between sentences. \"You could never get him to do anything if it didn't benefit him, but I used to try work around that.\" FDR stared at the monitor. He didn't realise that she felt that way, or that he was like that until she pointed it out. \"Didn't you say she volunteered at dog shelters?\" FDR asked Bothwick. \"Yeah?\" \"Where's the nearest shelter?\" This was getting stranger. FDR picked me up in the morning and took me to work, and after pretty much disappearing all day, while I did most of the work on the Heinrich case, he asked me for my help with something. Of course I agreed, and somehow we ended up at a pet shelter. A pet shelter of all places was somewhere I would not have guessed, even in my wildest, weirdest dreams, that FDR would take me or even know where one was. As far as I knew, FDR was not an animal person. He'd never really taken an interest in Nana's horses, but that could just be because he thought they weren't a very masculine animal, but who knows? \"What are we doing at a pet shelter?\" I questioned, as we headed inside. \"Well, they say it's a sanctuary for them, but its really more of sanctuary for me.\" FDR answered, holding my hand as we walked in. There was a cute little dog being groomed in front of us, and I heard the barks of several more dogs in cages around the room. \"I didn't know that you volunteered at a dog shelter,\" I said, as I glanced around at all the dogs in their cages. I grinned at him. \"This is amazing. Franklin Foster volunteering at a dog shelter. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I probably would have hit you on the back of the head for lying to me.\" \"Well, I don't really broadcast it. The guys at work would laugh at me.\" \"I just had no idea you were so passionate about animals.\" I remarked, as we walked around the cages, getting a closer look at all of the adorable, abandoned dogs and puppies. FDR glanced down at me, and I raised an eyebrow at him as I waited for a reply. \"Yeah. Animals and kids.\" \"Well I knew about the kids part. Joe adores his Uncle Frank.\" \"Exactly. I guess there are a lot of things you don't know about me.\" FDR replied. \"I guess so.\" I smiled up at him, running my free hand up and down his arm. \"So…do you wanna help me pick one out?\" FDR asked. I looked at him in surprise, my eyes widening and my mouth dropping slightly. \"You're gonna adopt a dog? And risk ruining your bachelor pad? Dogs shed hair, you know? And chew things. A lot.\" I warned him, not really understanding why he wanted to adopt a dog. I mean, okay I just found out he had a love for animals. Growing up, he'd never really expressed an interest either way, but maybe he just hid it so he didn't get teased or something. \"I just think it's time for me to be responsible for something other than myself, you know?\" FDR smiled at me, and I felt myself melting under his soft blue-eyed gaze. FDR was growing up. I mean, it only took him thirty years to do it, but it was so sweet. \"Wow, that's so great.\" I said, kissing him quickly, before I pulled away to smile at him. \"Okay. Let's pick the saddest, oldest bastard here.\" FDR said. I pulled a face, but didn't say anything. I let him lead me round until we found this cute, grey dog with the saddest face ever. Of course, FDR adopted that one, and I picked out some of the stuff he'd need to look after it; a dog bed, lead, poop scoop, dog treats, flea shampoo and a dog brush. FDR didn't really think it through when he brought us here in his two seat convertible so I had his dog on my lap, and he forced all of the added extras to fit in his tiny trunk. When we got to his place, I helped him set the dog up and stayed to show him how to groom him and stuff, before I went home. It was one of the weirdest and cutest dates I'd been on. I never knew that FDR really wanted that kind of domestic life. Because getting a dog was very domestic-y, and it was a huge responsibility. And up until a few days ago, I would have said that Franklin was not ready for that kind of responsibility, but now...he was changing. And I want to say for the good, but I still loved the Franklin that he used to be. The older Franklin was just not someone I would have dated on a long-term basis. But he was maturing, and he seemed happier for it, so maybe I should just be happy for him. (conversation continued from before) \"Okay. So what about Tuck?\" Lauren asked Rachel. Tuck waited to hear Rachel's answer, as he leaned against the wall of his own recon room whilst watching the monitors. He watched as Rachel paused for a second before she answered her friends question, as though she was carefully thinking through her words. It was almost as if she knew he was listening in and was choosing her words so that she didn't hurt his feelings. \"Tuck is great. He's sweet, he's kind and we always have so much fun,\" Tuck chuckled at that, feeling like he had achieved something. \"More fun than I've ever had with anyone my entire life. But he's maybe too sweet? A little earnest? Maybe the safe option.\" \"Yeah. That's boring. I almost fell asleep just listening to that.\" Lauren replied. Tuck moved forward, closer to the monitor, and held his hand over his mouth. \"Safe.\" He repeated, as if he'd never heard the word before. Well, at least not associated with him. Tuck was taking me paint-balling. I had to admit when he told me, I almost laughed. We get to shoot real guns with real bullets at real people all the time, but I guess that was the fun in going to paintball. There was no real consequence to shooting someone with a paintball pellet, except for some nasty bruises the next day. Another thing that made me laugh about the whole thing was I put on an old grey t-shirt and a pair of dungarees with some combat boots and Tuck still told me I looked beautiful. He was adorable and charming and I was still in love with that British accent. Every compliment he gave me \"Okay, I think I'm ready, Tuck. This will be fun.\" I said, walking towards him. \"No. This is not fun,\" He said, looking at me with a serious expression on his face. \"It's dangerous.\" I quirked an eyebrow at that, and bit my lip to stop myself from laughing as Tuck pulled apart a pair of camouflage curtains, and revealed the carnage, the war zone that was the paintball arena. I stared at it. \"This looks like the watered down version of Bangladesh,\" I muttered to myself. Bangladesh had not been a walk in a park, let me tell you. Tuck nudged me back slightly before he jumped onto a wooden bar, and swung himself so he kicked a guy in the face. I winced, but stared at Tuck in shock, as he carried on as if her were in an actual war zone. He kicked a guy in the stomach and knocked him over, before he leaned over a wooden bridge and shot someone underneath it. \"Oh, my god. We are totally getting sued.\" Tuck looked back at me, staring at him in shock and waved me over. \"Come on, Rach.\" He called, looking down his scope for another target. I nodded, and spurred into action. I dropped the goggles the guy had given me. I didn't need them, and they'd probably just end up annoying me. I dropped into a defensive crouch and quickly moved forwards towards Tuck, where he was waiting behind a small wall. He checked that the coast was clear before he waved us forward. \"Clear. We're coming out. Okay, come on.\" He instructed me, and I was still somewhat in shock at his display earlier so I just followed him without question. \"Get him!\" A kid yelled, and was quickly taken out by Tuck, the force of the blows knocking him off his feet. \"I'm glad that we didn't bring Joe.\" I muttered to myself, staying behind another wall, while I watched Tuck single-handedly take out three more amateur paintball enthusiasts and a kid probably here for a birthday party. \"No head shots! That's illegal!\" A man shouted, and I winced. Yep, we were so getting sued. \"Oh, my god.\" I said, out loud. Tuck was so focused on taking everyone out that most of the kids who were playing hid in an underground fort-like structure. He didn't even realize that I stopped following him after a while. I just sat on the wall, watching as he threw a paint grenade into their hiding spot, listened to their yells of fright as it exploded all over them, and then Tuck moved onto the next guy. There were a couple of stragglers who tried to take me out, but I got those quickly, without causing too much damage. Tuck hopped across these logs to a tree fort, where the flag that would end the session was. He tossed this guy off of the fort, sending him tumbling to the ground, and grabbed the flag. He held it up and looked down at me from where I was standing, still kind of shell shocked. He jumped down and I jogged towards him. \"Did you see me light that up?\" Tuck asked me, slightly out of breath. \"Okay-\" \"That boy came right out of nowhere.\" \"You were disturbingly…I dunno. I wanna say good or fast or aggressive, but I'm kind of in shock. You do remember that this is not Bangladesh or Kandahar or Moscow, but a paintball tournament, right?\" I breathed. \"Yeah, how does that make you feel?\" Tuck asked me, grinning and pointing at me once, before he started to catch his breath again. \"Like if our nation gets attacked by random kids with paintball guns, I'll be safe.\" \"Safe.\" Tuck repeated, but I carried on talking as if I hadn't heard him. \"I tried to have your back there. I got off a few shots, but I don't think it mattered either way. I felt like we were back in Bangladesh or Singapore. Remember how terrifying Singapore was? You scared the absolute shit out of me in Singapore.\" I rambled, trying to get all the shock I felt out of my system. I shouldn't really be shocked at the display I just saw, but I just didn't see it happening at an innocent game of paintball. \"Really?\" \"Yeah! Do you not remember that? I was trying to work my magic with the drug lord, he put his hands on me, then you and FDR burst in, all guns a-blazing, nearly getting us all killed, and you took out half of the guys there. My friend, Lauren, wanted us to go to Singapore for this crazy girls adventure last year. I couldn't do it, because every time she mentioned it, I had terrifying flashbacks.\" \"Yeah?\" Tuck beamed, as though it was a victory. \"Well, then. Let's go get something to eat.\" He grabbed me by the hand and led me away, and I was still too confused and surprised to argue with him. I'd have to report back to Lauren and tell her that 'safe' was not a word I'd use when talking about Tuck anymore. Never again would I say that. Never. Nope. Not again.[Chapter 8] I was sat next to Lauren and Trish in a playpen as Trish's kids were running wild with a bunch of other kids. \"So you know how I was telling you that Tuck has been really earnest?\" I asked Lauren and she nodded. Trish sat up at the mention of the men I was sort of dating. I was dating Tuck, but I don't know whether or not I think I'm dating FDR. I mean we've kissed, and he keeps taking me out on dates, but I don't know whether I want to admit that it's dating. I feel terrible enough without admitting it. \"Well, the other day, we went paintballing and he nearly put this kid's eye out with a paintball gun. And then FDR, we went to this animal shelter and he adopted a 12-year-old dog with a milky eye. I'm telling you, it's getting weird. I can't help but thinking that I'm putting them in this position. It's making us all crazy.\" \"So, what are you going to do about it?\" Trish asked me, chewing on one of her son's sweets. Lauren sipped on a juice box as she waited for me to answer Trish's question. I stared ahead of myself, not really seeing anything, as I thought about what I should do. Lauren obviously got tired of waiting for me to make a decision so began telling me what I should do. \"I think you have to do what any rational woman in your position would do.\" Lauren said. \"Break up with them?\" Trish suggested. \"Sleep with them,\" Lauren answered. Trish and I turned our heads to stare at her. \"Sex tiebreaker.\" \"Oh, thank you! Finally!\" Trish pretty much yelled as she rejoiced at Lauren's words, even though I hadn't agreed to them yet. \"Finally! A sex tiebreaker! That is what you need to do! You have to have sex with both of them! Thank you!\" I looked around at all the little kids and mothers that Trish's loud rant about sex tiebreakers had just terrified or pissed off. There were little kids crying and mothers' hands tight over children's ears, and Trish seemed oblivious. One mother made a noise of disgust, and Trish snapped at her. \"What? It's called the birds and the bees, bitch, okay? Google it.\" \"Maybe you're right. Maybe I have to sleep with them. I can't think of any other way to decide. I mean, someone, please, tell me another way to decide and I will totally give it a shot,\" I said, ignoring the glares we were receiving from every other woman in this place. Lauren and Trish were both silent for a minute before shrugging. \"I guess it's going to have to be a sex-tiebreaker.\" Tuck and FDR stared at the monitors dumbfounded. They'd tracked Rachel and her two blonde friends to a children's play area, and had listened to their entire conversation. They stared at the screen for a second, before they spun around in their chairs to face each other. \"We had a deal.\" FDR stated. \"Well, we have a deal. We have a deal.\" Tuck replied, scoffing slightly. \"I'm not gonna have sex with her.\" FDR said, though his mind was travelling down a completely different road. \"And I am not gonna have sex with this woman either.\" Tuck said, pointing towards the screens that displayed Rachel sipping on a kid's juice carton as the three women supervised the older woman's kids as they played. \"No matter how hard she tries. We have a gentleman's agreement.\" FDR reminded them. \"We do. We have a gentleman's agreement. And we are gentlemen. Okay?\" Tuck replied, his voice breaking towards the end of his sentence, as though he was unsure whether or not they were gentlemen. Well he knew that FDR certainly wasn't. \"Ha-ha-ha. Okay.\" FDR said, holding his hand out for Tuck to shake. Tuck gripped his partner's hand, and they shook hands firmly. \"Okay.\" Tuck repeated, still shaking FDR's hand. \"Good.\" FDR said, as they finally let go and both looked down at their watches, looking for an excuse to get away from each other and to their individual recon rooms to plan their prevention tactics. \"That the time?\" Tuck said. \"Yeah, I got that thing.\" FDR replied, as they both rose from their seats, and moved quickly away. \"I've got somewhere to be at this time.\" Tuck mumbled in reply. Bothwick and Boyles were waiting for their 'bosses' outside the room, and they split and began walking behind the two determined men. FDR gave instructions to Bothwick as they walked back to his recon room. \"Full-scale tactical prevention mode.\" FDR ordered. \"What exactly do you have in mind?\" Tuck had taken me out to dinner after work, and then we went back to his apartment. When we got inside there was candles lit everywhere, and it looked very romantic. I wondered who he'd gotten to do all of this while we were out, because he'd been with me all day. \"Wow, this is amazing.\" I said, as I walked in backwards to try spot anything else he might of added to his apartment since the last time I'd been in here. I noticed the soft jazz that was playing over the speakers and smiled. It was a very romantic atmosphere, very Tuck. \"Indeed. Do you think the candles are a bit cheesy?\" He asked, as he led me to the middle of the room by my hand. \"No, I think they're wonderful,\" I answered, as Tuck tugged me into his body gently, and wrapped his arms around my back. I trailed my hands up his chest, before curling my arms around his neck, and leaning in closer to him. \"This has been the perfect night.\" I pressed my mouth to his, softly at first, but applied more pressure as Tuck eliminated the remaining space between our bodies. This was it. Now or never. I was going to sleep with Tuck and that would help me make my decision. FDR watched the monitors as his two best friends kissed, noting that things were getting quite heated according to the thermal monitor. Time to stop it. \"Dickerman…make it rain.\" Tuck was peppering kisses on my neck when, suddenly, water cascaded down on us, soaking everything in the apartment including us. The candles were put out and so was the mood. I gasped as I stared up at Tuck, shocked at the sudden onslaught of water. Tuck looked kind of pissed as though someone had turned on the sprinklers on purpose. It was probably because of all the candles. As the fire detection system gets older, sometimes they get more sensitive to minor open flames. I burst out laughing as it continued, finding the whole thing hilarious. \"This isn't funny, Rach.\" Tuck insisted, but I couldn't stop laughing. \"I'm sorry, I am, but it's a little bit funny.\" I said, trying to stop myself from giggling anymore, but the laughter just kept on coming, so I buried my face in his shoulder and just hugged him as I forced the chuckles, giggles and laughter down and locked it away. The sprinklers eventually shut off, and I managed to reign in my giggling. I looked up at Tuck, and asked him an important question. \"Do I look like a drowned rat?\" It had the desired effect because Tuck chuckled, lifting his hands to my face to rub away some of my running mascara. \"You look beautiful.\" He said, planting a quick, soft kiss on my lips before we parted. \"Thank you. We should start trying to save your stuff before it gets ruined.\" I said, looking around at the flooded apartment. Tuck would probably need to buy new electrical everything, but we managed to save his books and furniture. It would have been a funny sight, walking into the apartment and seeing me blow-drying Tuck's books dry with a hair dryer we borrowed from the woman who lived next door to him. Most of his clothes were dry so we changed out of our sopping wet ones and into fresh, dry clothes. I borrowed a sweat shirt, a pair of his boxers and some sweat pants that I had to roll up at the bottom so I didn't fall over the ends. Tuck drove me home, and walked me to my apartment door, handing me the plastic bag with my damp clothes in. \"Wasn't exactly the best end to the perfect night, was it?\" He questioned with a chuckle. I just smiled, and kissed him, soft and slow. \"I wouldn't say that,\" I murmured as I pulled away, staring up into his blue eyes. \"Goodnight, Tuck.\" \"Goodnight, Rach.\" He replied, placing a quick kiss on my mouth before he stepped backwards until he reached the elevator. I opened the door to my apartment and gave him a quick wave before I went in. I leaned back against my front door, my fingers pressed against my lips, a smile spreading across my face that was caused by nothing. I can think of worse ways to end a perfect night than a great kiss with a gorgeous man. Tuck and Boyles walked towards his recon room in silence until Boyles asked him a question. \"You really think you can trust him?\" Boyles questioned, looking down at his superior as they walked. Tuck had an air of determination around him, and contemplated the answer to his lackey's question quickly. \"Absolutely not.\" FDR took me out for dinner that following night, which went well, and then took me back to his apartment. We were reminiscing about an old mission as we walked in and I immediately noticed how clean his apartment was. It wasn't usually untidy, per se, but with the new dog, I guess I was expecting some mess. Then again the dog was old and half blind so it probably didn't get up to much mischief when FDR wasn't around. \"Okay. I believe you.\" FDR told me, as he turned and leaned against his kitchen island, pulling me towards him, so I was pressed up against him. He kissed me and I let him, until I pulled away. \"I'll be right back.\" I smiled at him, before walking away to his bathroom, where I would proceed to have a panic attack and question my integrity and the morality of what I was doing. FDR watched Rachel walk away, before he grabbed a bottle of wine and two wine glasses and rushed over to his couch. He placed the items on his coffee table, before turning on his stereo. Sade's \"Smooth Operator\" played over the speakers and gave the room a certain vibe. FDR then lit a candle, and almost sat on his dog when he tried to sit on the couch. \"Come on, scram. Let's go.\" He shooed the dog away, rolling his eyes at the animal when it growled lowly at him as it padded away. FDR stood, waiting for Rachel, when he felt something sharp hit him in the neck. He groaned and grabbed at the mysterious object. \"God,\" He hissed as he yanked it out of his skin, revealing a tranquilizer dart. He looked up out of his window and just about made out his partner on the roof of the building opposite his apartment. \"Son of a-\" He slowly sunk down onto one knee, as the tranquilizer kicked in, and shifted so he was on the couch. Seconds later he was unconscious, with his head slumped backwards and his arms splayed wide, his hand still clenched around the dart that drugged him. I came out of the bathroom, grinning when I heard Sade on the stereo. FDR had a not-so-secret love for Sade and I'm pretty sure that it's his go to music for when he wanted to get someone in the mood. That grin was quickly wiped off my face as I noticed FDR passed out on the couch. \"Franklin?\" I questioned. The only response I received was a soft snore. I narrowed my eyes at the unconscious man, crossing my arms over my chest. \"Really, FDR?\" I stood there for a second, before moved to the coffee table and blew out the candle, grabbing the stereo remote and stopping the music. I grabbed my purse , pulling my phone out and calling a cab. It arrived pretty quickly and got me home just as quick too. I tipped the driver as I climbed out and hurried into my apartment. This night didn't end as well as last night. How could he have fallen asleep so fast? I wasn't even in the bathroom for that long. Something didn't feel right about it, but I shrugged it off. FDR was probably just tired. He and Tuck had been staying late at the office on-and-off, doing God knows what, but maybe that's why FDR fell asleep. Well that'd better be the reason or I'm gonna kill him. Tuck and FDR were arguing in the elevator that led to the detainment level at headquarters. \"A tranq dart! A tranq dart. Three inches over, I would've been dead.\" FDR hissed at his partner. \"Four,\" Tuck countered, holding up four fingers. \"Four inches, okay?\" They both tried to get out of the elevator at the same time but got stuck, which fuelled the animosity between them even further. \"Neanderthal.\" FDR growled as he let Tuck pass first. \"Good morning, sirs.\" A low-level agent greeted them. \"Shut up, Jenkins!\" They snapped in unison. \"Jesus. I cannot believe you didn't trust me.\" FDR complained, stopping so that Tuck would have to face him. \"You were listening to Sade. We both know what happens when you listen to Sade.\" Tuck accused, pointing a finger in FDR's direction as they squared up to one another. \"She's an incredible singer.\" FDR insisted. \"Indeed she is, but your hormones start going and you turn into Captain Horny Pants,\" Tuck said, continuing over the top of FDR's protests. He poked FDR in the chest to regain his attention. \"And might I remind you…you were the one who flooded my apartment first.\" \"Those candles were a fire hazard.\" \"No. The only thing you were worried about getting fired up was Rachel, wasn't it?\" Tuck questioned rhetorically. \"Honesty, Franklin. Try it.\" He left FDR to follow him as he headed to Ivan's cell. \"Right!\" He said, raising his voice. He pulled his jumper off and placed it on one of the tables that were either side of Ivan (but far enough away that he couldn't reach anything should he get a hand free). He grabbed a pair of pliers before he walked towards a silent Ivan. \"Now, I have very serious anger management issues today, Ivan, so I would appreciate it if you'd do me the courtesy of answering all my terribly boring questions sharpish.\" He waved the pliers in Ivan's direction. \"Heh, heh. The pliers, really?\" FDR questioned. \"Yes, the pliers, really.\" \"Predictable, safe and boring yet again.\" FDR taunted him. \"Why don't you tickle Ivan's feet till he talks with your teeny, tiny itty-bitty jazz hands?\" Tuck retaliated, not realising that Rachel had entered the room, and was listening to their conversation. As her two partners stared each other down, she walked forward, pushed them out of her way and kicked Ivan in the chest, knocking him over while he was still tied to the chair. She walked around the chair until she was standing directly next to his head, and pressed her heel against his neck slightly. \"Where is Heinrich, brother?\" She questioned him in fluent Serbian, ignoring the two shocked faces of Tuck and FDR. She guessed they really were so absorbed in their petty squabbling that they didn't even notice her approach until she was pushing them away. \" Sooner or later he'll be coming for you. Sister ,\" Ivan replied in his native tongue, wincing as Rachel pressed down a little sharper. He continued in English. \"You are going to die.\" Rachel, Tuck and FDR stared down at him, emotionless masks slipping onto their faces. \"Don't worry, you two will be next.\" He said, aiming his words at Tuck and FDR. Rachel stepped off of his throat, and stood on one of the chair legs so the chair sharply turned upright again. Ivan hissed in pain, but said nothing else, but watched as the American woman grabbed a chair and sat in front of him, crossing her legs in a slow, seductive way. She pulled a cigarette out of her jacket pocket and placed it between her lips, lighting it before she replaced the lighter in her jacket. \"You guys can go. I think Ivan and I need some special one-on-one time.\" The woman told the two men. Ivan watched in amusement as the shorter man passed her the pliers, mumbled an apology and turned on his heel and left. The other man stared her down until she blew smoke in his direction. He narrowed his eyes at her before leaving as well. \"So, Ivan, you wouldn't answer my colleagues' questions, so I'm hoping you'll answer mine.\" I said, taking the cigarette out of my mouth and exhaling the smoke. I turned the cig around and placed it between his lips, letting have a couple of drags before I took it back again. \"What makes you so certain that I'll answer your questions, woman?\" He questioned. \"Because I know men, Ivan. There hasn't been one man that they've brought into this room that hasn't given me the answers I want, one way or another. So you've got three options. Number one, you cooperate completely by telling us where Heinrich is and what he's planning and we'll send you on your way to a lovely single cell with a nice TV and special privileges. Number two, you don't cooperate and I'll break a bone in your body for each question that goes unanswered.\" I said, stubbing the cigarette out on the arm of my chair, and standing up. Ivan's eyes followed me as I replaced the pliers in the box, and shrugged my jacket off. I moved back to my chair and sunk into it, leaning forward with my arms resting on my knees. \"And what is option three?\" He asked, curiosity burning in his eyes. \"Number three, you still don't cooperate and I shoot you.\" \"Kill me and you won't get your answers.\" Ivan laughed. \"Who said anything about killing you?\" I questioned, pulling my gun out from the waistband of my jeans, and holding it casually in my lap. \"You said you'd shoot me.\" \"Yes. First I'll put a bullet through your foot and work my way up from there. Have you ever heard a man's screams, Ivan, when someone shoots him in the groin? It's loud,\" I said, leaning forward again, and smirking at him as I watched his eyes follow the gun as I moved it so it pointed towards his lap. \"Luckily for everyone else in the building, we had this room soundproofed.\" Ivan's eyes showed he was nervous but his face was impassive, conveying no emotion. If it weren't for his eyes I wouldn't know that he was scared. \"So tell me, brother, where is Heinrich?\" I questioned in Serbian. \"He'll be with us soon. And he'll have his revenge. \" I shrugged my shoulders and smirked at Ivan, who stared at me as I stood up from my seat. \"We'll see. When Heinrich gets here, I'll tell him that he needs to find better henchmen,\" I said, as I moved the chair back to where it was, before I turned to Ivan again. \"The ones he has are lousy shots and talk too much.\" I grabbed my jacket and Tuck's sweater, and left Ivan to stew. The doors closed behind me, locking him in there again, and Tuck and FDR were waiting for me. I wordlessly handed Tuck his sweater and move to walk off, but FDR grabbed my wrist and stopped me. \"So?\" He questioned. \"Heinrich is probably in the LA area or making his way here,\" I replied, holding back all the questions I had for them. Like 'what the hell was that?', 'are you both complete morons?' and 'seriously, what the fuck was that?'. I knew that they were arguing because of me, and I felt terrible about it. \"I'm going to talk to Collins. You guys go hack into LA harbour's database. Every boat that docks is recorded and accounted for. What date it arrived, what time, who arrived on it…if Heinrich is in LA, he got in through the harbour.\" They nodded and I went to walk away again, but Tuck's voice stopped me in my tracks. \"I'm sorry, Rach, for my behaviour in there. It wasn't professional.\" \"Yeah, me too. I'm really sorry.\" FDR added. I turned around. \"It's fine. You're stressed, I'm stressed. Tensions are running high. We just need to work everything out and everything will be fine,\" I replied, quietly, mostly trying to reassure myself that everything would be fine. \"I'm gonna go talk to Collins. You guys get to work.\" This time when I walked away, I carried on going, ignoring everyone who tried to engage me in conversation. I headed to Collins' office, and knocked before entering. \"Rachel. Did we learn anything from our guest?\" \"I think that Heinrich is in LA. I think Ivan was a distraction to keep us from checking out the harbour, and Heinrich used that distraction to come into the state.\" \"Get Tuck and FDR-\" \"To check the records of the harbour. I've got them on it, boss.\" Collins nodded, and looked at me expectantly when I didn't turn and leave. \"Is there anything I can help you with, Agent Simmonds?\" She questioned, raising an eyebrow at me. I sighed, and crossed my arms over my chest, really thinking it through before I answered. \"Yes, actually. Um, I was thinking that I want to be transferred to solo ops.\"[Chapter 9] Nana called me and asked me to go to dinner at the house, so FDR picked me up and took me. I wore a white summer dress, with a dark blazer and white flats, and FDR told me I looked stunning. I didn't really want us to show up together. I didn't really want to go at all. Nana had a way of knowing everything. So when I showed up, she was gonna take one look at me and know that I was dating someone, and then she'd ask who and I'd try desperately to change the subject, but she wouldn't budge because she was a stubborn, old lady. The one good thing about going to Nana's is Franklin bought pie. So FDR and I walked up the drive to Nana's house, watching in amusement as his young cousin who always had the bucket on his head fell over. Making it to the door without having a panic attack, I knocked and, moments later, Nana opened the door. \"Hello, dears.\" \"Hey, Nana.\" We managed to say in unison. Nana looked at us, scrutinising us and thankfully, due to my CIA training, I resisted the urge to squirm uncomfortably. \"I brought pie!\" FDR said, to break the silence. \"Yeah, well, you know where the kitchen is. Rachel and I have a lot to talk about.\" Nana said, as reached out the door and took my hand, pulling me inside. I glared back at FDR, signing to him that I was going to kill him. Nana led me through the house and out to the stables. The stables were my favourite part of the house. Nana taught me to ride when I was a teenager, and I'd spent most of my time that I wasn't doing gymnastics or cheerleading in the stables, helping Nana muck out the horses. \"It's nice out today, isn't it?\" Nana asked, making small talk. This was step one of the interrogation. We stepped into the stables, and my eyes immediately went to the wall where there were pictures of us when we were younger. \"I still can't believe FDR had that unibrow. It looks as though it goes all the way around his head,\" I joked, my eyes moving down and spotting a picture of me that I didn't recognise. There was a child that was clearly me, but there was a beautiful, blonde woman crouched down next to me that I didn't recognise. \"Where did this come from? I look about four in this photo.\" Nana looked away from Dottie, her horse, and glanced at the picture. \"You don't remember this picture? You brought it here with you. Didn't let it out of your sight for three weeks.\" Nana answered me. \"Who's the woman in the picture?\" I asked. \"We always thought it was your mother. We showed the photo to your social worker, but she didn't recognise her. There's a name on the back of it. Annie Smith. We tried to research her, but there are too many Smith's to find the right one.\" Nana explained, as I continued staring at the picture. I ran away from my father when I was seven, moving from orphanage to foster home and back again until I ended up in LA and was fostered by my Nana and Grandpa. I can't remember my mother at all. If it was her in the photo, it was probably the last time she came around, because I have no recollection of her whatsoever. \"Do you mind if I take it?\" I asked, glancing at Nana as she stroked Dottie's nose. \"Of course not, sweetheart, it's your picture!\" I pulled the pin out and took the photo down, replacing the pin in the wood afterwards. I moved forward and saw the pictures of FDR's parents. His mother was beautiful and his dad was handsome. He could harp on all he wanted about how God gifted him with good looks, but really it was just good genetics. \"Why'd you bring me out here, Nana?\" \"I thought you might need to talk to me, dear. You had that look on your face,\" Nana answered, continuing to pet Dottie. I walked over to her so she could see my confusion. \"When you were younger, I always knew when you needed to talk to me or you were confused or conflicted, because you had this look. So what are you confused or conflicted about?\" I stared at Nana for a moment, half-smiling at how wise she was. \"I, uh, I don't know what to do, Nana. Before you met Grandpa, did you ever love someone else?\" I asked. \"Ah, this is love troubles. I knew those boys would see sense, but I was hoping it would just be one or the other, not both,\" Nana rambled. I was confused but put it down to age creeping up on her, because I had no idea what she was talking about. \"You don't know which one to choose, do you?\" \"No, I don't. I'm all messed up and confused. They're both incredible, and they both know pretty much everything about me, and I trust them both with my life. And each time I think I've made a decision, one of them does something to confuse me all over again.\" \"Sweetheart, I don't think that's it. I think you're afraid to pick who you want to be with because you don't want to lose the other.\" Nana said, wiping a tear away as it rolled down my cheek. \"If you were me, how would you know who to choose?\" I asked her, trying to stop myself from crying, but failing. \"I'd choose the one I want to spend all my time with, the person who makes me the happiest, the one who knows I have flaws and loves me for them. Whomever you choose, the other man won't leave you.\" \"You can't know that, Nana.\" \"I do. They care about you, enough to give you this time to decide. They won't leave because you didn't choose them.\" \"Promise?\" I asked, cracking a smile and wiping away a few more pesky tears that had managed to escape. \"I promise and if they do, they'll have to answer to me.\" Nana smiled at me, and pulled me into her arms. I nuzzled my face into her shoulder, thanking my lucky stars that she fostered me all those years ago, and held her tight. \"Thank you, Nana.\" I whispered to her. \"It's no problem, dear. You can always come to me with your problems, you know that?\" I pulled away and nodded, before asking her if it looked as though I'd been crying. She chuckled at me. \"It's barely noticeable, Rachel. If anyone asks, we'll tell them you have hay fever.\" Nana said, taking my arm and tugging me back out of the stable and towards the house. One of FDR's cousins was here, and cooked dinner, so when Nana and I walked into the dining room, it was already on the table, waiting. FDR smiled at me, as Nana led me to my seat next to him, until I was sitting down next to him and he noticed the 'hardly noticeable' red rims around my eyes. He leaned closer to me to whisper in my ear. \"What's wrong?\" His warm breath tickled my ear, and the corner of my mouth tilted up in a half smile at it. I turned my head, and looked at him. Franklin had grown up a lot these past few weeks. He was still immature at times, and insensitive at others, but he was working on it. I smiled at him, as he gazed at me with his blue eyes conveying concern. \"Nothing important.\" I replied, before I turned away, catching Nana's eye before I decided to just stare down at my plate of food. Over dinner, we reminisced about our childhoods, with Nana cracking out a few stories about FDR that I didn't even know about. FDR just sat there, with his arm resting on the back of my chair, as Nana revealed all his most embarrassing secrets. \"He had the biggest blue eyes, like marbles, which almost made up for the bed-wetting.\" Nana said, making us all laugh at FDR's expense. \"Nana. We really don't have to talk about that right now.\" FDR said, moving his arm so his hand rested on my hip instead. \"Oh, I think we do.\" I replied. \"No, no, no.\" \"I think we should,\" I insisted, ignoring him completely as I encouraged Nana to continue. I was digging up a lot of dirt here that I could use against him in the future. Franklin kept protesting, but I cut him off. \"I think we ought to.\" \"He wore that Superman costume everywhere. You wouldn't believe the smell. But how were we to know that he would take it so literally? The little fellow jumped off the roof.\" I turned and looked at him as I laughed at him, so he could see how much I was enjoying this particular family gathering. \"I was given misinformation, okay? We all make mistakes. That was one of mine.\" Franklin said, defending himself. I was about to remind him of what he said to me at the pizza parlour on our 'first date', when Nana beat me to it. \"Yes, but remember, Franklin, there are no mistakes.\" So that's where he got the line. Nana. I don't remember her imparting that certain philosophy on us when we were growing up. I smiled, and picked up my wine glass. \"To no mistakes.\" I said, raising my glass. Everyone around the table repeated my words and clinked their glasses together. I smiled as FDR clinked his glass against mine, as he stared into my eyes. I turned away and sipped on my wine, but I could still feel his gaze, like it was burning holes into the side of my head. It was a lovely meal, and I complimented FDR's cousin before we left. I hugged Nana and thanked her again for the advice, and FDR whisked me away to his car, annoying me with rapid-fire questions as to what I was thanking Nana for. Apparently 'it's none of your business' didn't get recognised by Franklin. When he was walking me up to my apartment door, he was still asking me questions, so I distracted him by asking one of my own. \"So, wearing dresses?\" \"I was only wearing them because I thought they were capes. The dresses.\" Franklin insisted, as we came to a stop at my door. I smiled up at him. \"I had a nice time tonight.\" \"Me too.\" \"I like that guy with the unibrow and the braces. Reminded me of the old days. I think I might like him more than I like you.\" I joked, as FDR chuckled at me. \"Mm. He likes you too.\" We both laughed at him, until our laughter kinda slowed to a halt. I looked at my door, and hesitated. I wasn't sure what I wanted right now, for him to leave so I could at least pretend I still had some morals, or for him to stay. There was a lot of tension between us, but I don't think it was the bad kind. We just stared at each other, deciding what to do, until FDR spoke. \"I, uh, I should go.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I should be a gentleman.\" He said, neither of us taking our eyes of each other. \"Yeah,\" I nodded, until a sudden impulse led me to continue speaking. \"Well, the good new is I'm no gentleman.\" I smirked at him, and then, as though that was one of the many code words we had come up with over the years, FDR's mouth was suddenly on mine. I stumbled backwards, but his hands kept me up right, as we pretty much fell into my apartment, shrugging our jackets off. FDR pushed me up against the wall closest to the door, and pinned me there with his body. As our mouths battled for dominance, our hands roamed each others bodies. I started to unbutton his shirt, but quickly got distracted as he moved his mouth to attack my throat and neck instead. FDR tugged the hem of my dress up to my hips so I could wrap my legs around his waist as he lifted me up and carried me over to my kitchen island. I moaned breathlessly into his mouth as I pushed his shirt of his shoulders. My mind was kind of muddled from all the hormones that were raging within me, so it didn't occur to me that this was a moral grey area. I just let FDR pull my dress up over my head and toss it away. I smirked at him, as his eyes raked hungrily over my half-naked body. He hoisted himself up onto the island and, pressing his mouth against mine in a searing hot kiss, tugged me towards him so I was practically straddling him. I couldn't tell I was going to regret this tomorrow but, with FDR kissing me softly as he laid me back against the cold marble countertop, I didn't really care right now. Boyles stared the monitor before looking at the other three agents who were manning the screens that night. Tuck wasn't there, so Boyles was in charge, and he didn't want to have to tell Tuck what was going down right now. \"This is not good. Not at all.\" He muttered nervously, taking out the disc that had the recording on and shoving it in the inner pocket of his suit's jacket. He would pretend something went wrong with the taping. He'd attempt to bluff his way out of it. Though the reason he was a techie was because he couldn't lie all that well. \"Oh, God, this is not good.\" I woke up the next morning, and stretched my limbs which ached. A good kind of aching feeling, but I still felt the need to get up and stretch my limbs out properly. Yet when I went to move, something pinned me down. I looked down at my body and an arm was wrapped around my middle. I turned my head and Franklin was sound asleep beside me. He was still asleep and here? I mean, it sounds harsh and horrible, considering that he was being a lot more mature recently, but Franklin was the dine and dash type, if you know what I mean. But realising that, and the fact he'd stayed, brought a smile to my face. I slowly lifted his arm off my body and moved myself off the bed, before lowering his arm again. I tip-toed back into the room, seeing he was still asleep, and went to slip my shoes on. I turned my back to the bed and bent down to slip them on. \"Hey,\" He said, making me straighten up and turn in his direction. \"Morning.\" \"Good morning,\" I said, not looking directly at him. It was weird. This was FDR and I'd slept with him. \"You know if I was an ordinary girl, that would have scared the life out of me.\" FDR sat up slightly, resting back on his elbows as I slipped on the other shoe I'd forgotten to put on when he distracted me by waking up. \"You're dressed. Where you going?\" \"I have to go to work.\" I said, as I moved to my wardrobe and grabbed a leather jacket to put on over my dress. FDR sat up properly, and I wasn't sure if I was disappointed or not that the sheet stayed in place over his lower body. \"I thought we'd make pancakes or something. I know you love pancakes.\" Franklin said, as he watched me put on the minimal make-up I always do. \"I do love pancakes. Really, I'd love to have pancakes. Who doesn't like pancakes? Crazy people.\" I said, screwing the lid onto my mascara and dropping it like it was hot lead back onto my vanity table, before I hopped up and tried to find the bag I'd left my car keys in. \"Crazy people.\" Franklin repeated. \"But I have to go to work. I have an early meeting with Collins. Like super early.\" I said, dropping to the floor and looking under my bed. I found it, grabbed it and rolled away and rose as gracefully as I could back onto my feet. \"What's the meeting about? Do I have to be there?\" FDR questioned, about to climb out of bed. I stopped him quickly. \"No, no, no. Collins and I just have some things to discuss about the Heinrich case. You guys don't need to be there. I've got it handled,\" I lied, shrugging my jacket on, before I dug my keys out from my bag. Upon finding them, I dropped the bag to the floor and kicked it away. \"So I've gotta go.\" Franklin looked a little disappointed by that, and turned his gaze to the sheets pulled around his waist. I shook mental images of last night and earlier this morning out of my head, before I focused on him again. \"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, that's cool. Boss is calling. I get it. Okay.\" I felt like I'd wounded his ego or hurt his feelings or something so I quickly said something that might make it better. \"But last night was like…\" I trailed off, not being able to find a suitable enough word, but FDR had one. \"Was incredible.\" He said, smiling this cute, dopey smile at me and gazing at me with those beautiful blue eyes, and it made me want to just crawl back into bed with him and say 'screw Collins', but I knew that I needed to go to this meeting. It was about my transfer to special ops and I couldn't miss it or Collins might tell me I can't. \"That was the best kind of crazy,\" I said, before it felt really awkward again. \"So…thank you for the-\" \"Thank you for that.\" Franklin replied, gesturing towards me. \"So, I'm gonna go. Just, um, lock up on your way out, if you could. You know the password for the security system and where the spare key is so…yeah. Bye.\" I said, grabbing my phone of my vanity table and quickly exiting my room and the apartment. As soon as I was in the elevator, I turned on my phone and called the first person I thought of to talk about what just happened. \"Hello?\" \"Trish? It's me, Rachel, I slept with him.\" I whispered, though I'm not entirely sure why. \"Oh, my God. Which one?\" She asked. \"FDR.\" \"Oh, my God, that's awesome. How do you feel? Can you walk?\" Trish was a lot more invested in this than she let on. I still can't believe she only sleeps with Bob on a Wednesday. Just once a week. \"Small hands, not an issue.\" I replied, as the elevator came to a stop and I hurried out, speed-walking to my car. \"I told you it wasn't going to be an issue!\" She said, sounding too happy for me. \"How was it?\" \"It was amazing. Like five times amazing. But I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to go meet Tuck this afternoon. But after last night, I can't see Tuck now.\" I replied, all ready coming up with three plans to avoid Tuck at work. \"No, no, they do it to us all the time, okay? You think Gloria Steinem got arrested and sat in a jail cell so you could act like a little bitch? I don't think so. You get out there, you get flexible. \" I paused as I sat in my car, slumping forward until my head rested against the steering wheel. \"I think I'm going to hell.\" \"You're not going to hell. And if you go there, I'll be there to pick you up.\" Trish replied, making me laugh. I straightened up and leaned back in my chair, running a hand over my face. \"Okay, save me a drink.\" I said, before I hung up. I placed my phone into the holder I had for it on the dashboard, and adjusted my mirrors, realising that I had sex hair. I ran my hands through it but that only made it worse, so I just gave up, turned the car on and drove to headquarters. \"Boylee, have you got last night's surveillance tapes, please?\" Tuck asked, as he walked into his recon room. Boyles walked towards him, and Tuck observed that he seemed nervous. \"Uh. We didn't get anything. We got nothing. The tape jammed, so…Ha, ha.\" Boyles attempted to lie, knowing it wasn't entirely convincing. \"Boylee, it's digital, you plank. Right. So can I have the disk?\" Boyles could tell by the tone of his voice that Tuck wasn't asking. It was an order. He reached into his jacket, and pulled it out, but didn't place it in Tuck's waiting hand. He didn't really want his 'boss' to watch it. \"Seriously, you don't wanna see it.\" Boyles tried, but Tuck just snatched the DVD out of his hand. \"I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much. Now, did you see this?\" Tuck questioned. \"Only once.\" \"Right. What happened?\" \"Agent Foster entered the premises.\" Boyles replied, hoping he didn't have to really spell out what happened in detail. \"All right.\" \"Yep.\" \"And?\" Tuck demanded. \"Ha, ha.\" Boyles laughed nervously, looking at the floor towards his feet as if he wished the ground to just swallow him whole to save him from this. He wasn't sure whether or not Tuck would kill him because of what he'd seen. \"Boylee.\" Tuck pressed. \"Ahem. Then he-\" \"Boylee, what happened next?\" Tuck demanded. The techie's nervous way of skirting around his question was beginning to piss him off. \"Then he entered the premises.\" Tuck waved the disc in his face, understanding the euphemism there and feeling infuriated. \"I got it, mate. Yeah, I totally understand. Thank you very much. Cheers, mate.\" Tuck said, throwing the DVD in a bin as he stormed out of the room. Boyles sighed with relief, and his body relaxed as he realized that he wouldn't in fact have the absolute snot beaten out of him today at the hands of his angry superior. \"You have absolutely no self-control.\" Tuck scolded FDR, as they walked down a hallway at the CIA headquarters. FDR was about a step behind Tuck, because his partner was walking so damn fast. Tuck really was angry. \"Tuck, look, I didn't plan on this happening, okay? She's the one that initiated it in the first place.\" FDR said, in an attempt to defend himself. He felt guilty that he'd betrayed his best friend this way, and he was one hundred percent sure that Rachel felt the same. That's probably why he hadn't seen her since this morning. Her meeting with Collins couldn't have lasted this long. She was avoiding them both. \"Well, of course she initiated. You roll out the big, happy family, something that we both know that Rachel has always wanted, it's like girl porn, isn't it?\" Tuck said, before he continued. \"You broke the rules, man.\" \"Forget the rules. This is not a game anymore. I really care for Rachel.\" FDR argued. \"Great, you have affections. It only took you 30 years.\" Tuck seethed, still walking at a punishing pace. \"Tuck.\" FDR said, getting his friend to stop. \"What?\" \"I slept with her.\" FDR said, as if that was news to Tuck. \"Yeah, well, I'm well aware of that, aren't I?\" Tuck replied, walking away again. \"No, slept. Fell asleep. That's never happened to me before.\" FDR explained, before he jogged to catch up with Tuck, who was intent on leaving him and his pathetic excuses behind. Tuck headed to his desk, but his step faltered slightly when he saw Rachel at hers. He shook his head and sat down at his desk without saying a word. Something that the blonde woman picked up on. She frowned, and tears pricked in her eyes, but she knew she deserved his silence, so she forced herself to get a grip. FDR wasn't too far behind him, and he gave her a smile before he sat down at his desk. The atmosphere was awkward and Rachel wanted to beat herself around the head with a bat, because it was her fault. I sat at my desk, organising all of my paperwork into neat little piles, when Bothwick came with a few small boxes. \"Boss said you wanted these. Where do you want them?\" He asked me. \"Yeah, uh, just drop on the floor here by me. Thanks, Bothwick.\" I instructed and he did as he was told, shooting me a smile and FDR a pointed look as he walked back the way he came. \"What are the boxes for?\" FDR questioned, as I stood, stooping over to grab a box and place it on my desk. Tuck looked up at me, curious, but didn't say anything. I was supposed to go out with him this afternoon, and he was pretty much ignoring me. I hate myself. \"I am emptying my desk. I've been reassigned to solo operations.\" I answered, as I dumped all of my paperwork into the box, and then dropped it to the floor and picked up the next one. Tuck and FDR both stared at me, in confusion mixed with horror, before they both exchanged a look, before climbing to their feet. They started to walk away before I stopped them. \"Where do you two think you're going?\" \"We're going to talk to Collins, obviously.\" FDR answered. \"We'll get this sorted out, Rachel. Don't worry about it.\" I chuckled at them, and said something that stopped them in their tracks. I wasn't done talking yet and they still tried to walk away from me. \"I asked for this, you know.\" I called to them, my words hitting their backs and forcing them to turn back. They walked right up to my desk and crossed their arms tight over their chests and stared at me with confused, but stern expressions. \"Why?\" Tuck asked. \"Because we're not a team anymore,\" I explained, opening one of my desk drawers as I spoke and began to empty its contents into the box I had on my desk. \"I was stupid enough to agree to dating both of you and to think that we could all come into work and for it to still be the same as it was. It's not. It won't ever be that way again.\" \"What are you talking about? We're still a team!\" FDR protested, making me laugh. \"Who's been doing most of the work on the Heinrich case, huh, Franklin? You? Tuck? I never see you guys here anymore. I've been working my ass off trying to find this asshole, and you two are busy doing…whatever,\" I said, tossing a stapler into the box slightly more aggressively than I had mean to. I stopped packing and instead rested my hands on my hips. \"What we're dealing with is difficult, I know that, and it was stupid of me to think that it wouldn't cause a distraction in our professional lives. But it has. I got shot because you two were both trying to play the alpha male. I had to intervene in an interrogation because you were squabbling. I need to come in to work and know the people around me have my back. I can't keep doing this job if I'm worried about my partners getting me killed. Solo ops is the way to go. I don't have to trust anyone but me.\" \"You don't trust us?\" Tuck asked, looking slightly hurt. \"I trust you guys with my life, but I can't risk it. You're distracted with this whole thing. I'm distracted by it too. So I'm removing myself from the equation while we work this out. It's only temporary. Six months tops,\" I explained, my eyes flickering between the pair. \"You don't have to like my decision, but I want you to respect it. It's the only one I've managed to make for the past few days.\" They both nodded, and walked back to their desks, and slumped down into their chairs. I sighed and continued packing, deciding what was important and what I could leave. What I didn't take to my new office, I was leaving in my locked drawer. It was a combination lock so I knew that Franklin wouldn't be able to get in there. I grabbed a box, and whistled. An office boy looked up from his desk, and when he caught my gaze, he pointed at himself asking me if I had whistled at him. I rolled my eyes and gestured for him to come to me. He immediately jumped to his feet, and rushed towards me as though walking at a regular speed would result in him getting shot in the foot. \"Yes, ma'am?\" The kid asked, standing in front of my desk with his back straight and his chest puffed out. I quirked an eyebrow at that, and then gestured with my head to the boxes on the floor. \"I need you to take those to my new office on the next level up. Bothwick will tell you where it is,\" I instructed him, with a sickly sweet, but clearly fake, smile. The kid looked like he was trying to convey confidence but looked like one harsh word would send him to the supply closet to have a nervous breakdown. I didn't really understand that, but he was the only office boy around. \"Don't break or ruin anything and I'll tip you twenty bucks for your troubles. Oh, and don't call me ma'am.\" He nodded enthusiastically and immediately went to work, while I lingered at my desk to observe him before he balanced three boxes on top of each other and slowly walked away. I watched him go, before I turned to talk to Tuck quickly. I sauntered over to his desk, and smiled at him slightly, guilt probably showing on my face. \"Are we, uh, we still going to get Joe after work?\" I questioned, holding his gaze. \"Of course. And, Rach, I'm not mad at you, you know. It's not your fault that you're confused and don't know who to choose. It's probably our fault, love, so take your time, okay?\" Tuck said softly, gracing me with a sweet smile that instantly soothed my fears and calmed my nerves. \"Thanks, Tuck. I'll meet you by your car later.\" I said, feeling slightly better about the whole situation. Tuck understood that I was confused and that I needed time. I also knew that while he said he wasn't mad at me, he was probably fuming at FDR. I technically initiated it, and it takes two to tango, but Tuck wouldn't see it that way. I gave them both a small wave, and I almost walked away before I remembered something. \"Oh, guys, if you need any help on the Heinrich case, my password for my computer is pretty easy for you guys to guess. All my case notes and files are stored on there if you need them.\" I informed them, before I smiled again, and finally left. Hopefully, I'd be able to come back sooner rather than later, but you never know, I might completely destroy our friendships and never return to the team.[Chapter 10] Tuck and I stood outside Joe's school waiting to pick him up. It still felt a little awkward, but I tried to ignore it. Tuck didn't feel it obviously, because he was beaming at me like the sun was shining out of my ass or something. Kids started pouring out of the building and it didn't take us long to spot Joe, or for him to spot us. \"Hey, spudley, how you doing?\" Tuck greeted his son. 'Spudley?' I thought to myself, as Joe stopped in front of us. \"Come on, give us a cuddle.\" Tuck bent down to his son's height and embraced him, before Joe pulled back and smiled at me. \"Do I get a cuddle, oh beloved godson?\" I questioned, crouching down as Joe's small arms wrapped around me. \"What are you doing here, Auntie Rachel?\" Joe asked me, as I released him and straightened up. The heels I was wearing would have had me toppling over if I had stayed crouched down for any longer. \"I was wondering if you and your dad had any plans for this afternoon, because my friend asked me to help her out today at her job and I think I may need a couple of helpers and I think you could be the men for the job.\" I grinned, as we started to head to Tuck's car. \"Yeah?\" Joe asked. \"That sounds great,\" Tuck replied, opening Joe's door for him and closing it behind him. \"What does she do?\" \"Lauren is a product testing executive. She tests all these new products, sees which ones work more effectively and gives them the better recommendation. Plus, she gets to destroy stuff without the government telling her boss on her.\" I grinned at him, as we climbed into the car at the same time. \"So what do you need help with, Auntie Rach?\" Joe asked. \"Well, my friend Lauren has to catch up on all this paperwork she needs to get done, so she asked me to come in and test some of products out for her.\" I explained to him, twisting round in my seat to face him. \"That doesn't sound fun.\" Joe replied. \"Just wait, Joe. We'll have fun, I promise.\" Lauren ushered us to the testing area as soon as we arrived and handed me a wooden mallet and told me what stuff needed testing and how to do it. I smiled and shoved her in the direction of her office, telling her we'd get it done, and when Tuck's back was turned to us, she gave me a thumbs up, and mouthed 'he's so hot' before she rushed to her desk. I may or may not have threatened her with the mallet. I placed a toy fire truck on the floor, and positioned Joe in front of it. \"Okay, Joe, here's what you've got to do,\" I said, handing him the small wooden mallet and stepping away. \"Smash it to pieces.\" \"Really?\" Joe asked, turning his head to stare at me in surprise. \"Really. Break it. Hit it as hard as you can. I think we're supposed to test how durable it is, so you need to hit it really hard. Got it, bud?\" Joe nodded, a giant, pleased grin on his face and turned back to the truck, lifting the mallet above his head and bringing it down, fast and hard, onto the truck. And, of course, it broke into two pieces and we all burst out laughing. Joe continued smashing it until we were certain that there was a definite design fault and I wrote it down to give to Lauren later. Next we tested a popcorn machine. Well, Joe tested it and I stood back and watched as Tuck and his son messed around. The top kinda blew off and popcorn was flying everywhere, so Tuck grabbed Joe, lifted him into the air and spun him round in it. I laughed as I watched the interaction. Tuck rarely got to spend much time with Joe, because we were pretty much always on jobs overseas, so it was great to see them have some fun together as father and son. I almost felt like I was intruding on their time. Yet when Tuck or Joe would look at me, and grin, I felt like I could do that whole thing. The family thing. When Tuck eventually put Joe down, we moved over to the next product, which was three different window cleaners. I sprayed them onto the fake windows, and then moved back, handing both Tuck and Joe a hose. We were all laughing as we hosed off the cleaner. Joe and I exchanged a look, and both turned towards Tuck, the spray cut off for a moment, and pointed our hose heads at him. \"Hands up.\" Joe ordered his dad. \"No.\" Tuck said, looking at us, but we ignored his protests and squeezed the triggers and soaked him. It turned into an all-out water fight with Joe turning traitor on me and ganging up on me with Tuck, until I was standing in a sopping wet dress with my hair completely ruined. At least, I no longer had sex hair. I guess that was the bright side. We shut off the hoses, and placed them down onto a counter and then we all stood there staring at each other. \"I think there's this giant stand-in dryer somewhere,\" I informed them, my eyes scanning the room until I found it. \"Ah-ha! This way gentlemen!\" I grabbed Joe's hand and dragged him along behind me, with Tuck following us, to the giant dryer that looked like a standing tanning booth. I climbed into it with Joe and dragged Tuck in so we were all packed in together, and then turned it on. About twenty minutes later, our clothes, bodies and hair was all bone dry. Though while we had stood in that contraption, Tuck kinda gazed at me with this heat filled, meaningful stare that made me went to melt into his arms and, if Joe hadn't been there, I probably would have. Then we took Joe home. I waited in the car, but watched as Joe and Tuck hugged goodbye and Katie came out and stood just by her front door to welcome her son home. Tuck watched Joe practically trot over to his mother before he got back into the car. \"Dinner?\" I asked him. \"We can go to that new Mexican place I've heard so much about.\" Tuck replied, grinning at me as he teased me about my one failed date with the woman trafficker named Arnold. \"Shut up,\" I said, punching him in the shoulder, laughing with him. \"Actually there's this cool Thai restaurant that just opened downtown that I've heard good things about.\" \"Thai, it is.\" Back at headquarters, FDR was fuming. \"He used the kid! He used the kid!\" He ranted, pacing around his small recon room. Bothwick looked up at him, away from the monitors and smirked. \"Maybe we could get you a kid, sir. For a day. Pretend it's a big brother-little brother thing.\" Bothwick added the last part on, realising that Agent Simmonds knew that Agent Foster didn't have a kid himself. That he knew of. He'd heard all about Agent Foster's sexual escapades before he started this-whatever it was with Agent Simmonds, and for all anyone knew he could actually have fathered a kid somewhere. \"You know a guy?\" FDR questioned, actually considering it. \"I know a guy.\" Bothwick replied. FDR considered for another moment, before he shook his head. \"No.\" He looked at Bothwick again, as though he was reconsidering it, before he shook his head again and returned to watching his two best friends' date. Tuck returned me to my place, but we didn't get out of the car right away. I turned round in my seat and smiled at him as I waited for him to speak. \"I had a really fantastic day today, thank you very much.\" \"So did I.\" I replied, leaning in to kiss him on the cheek. \"Goodnight.\" Tuck said, and I kissed his other cheek as he kissed mine. Except neither of us pulled away. Tuck's warm breath fanned my face and despite what happened between me and FDR the night before, I couldn't turn away from Tuck as our faces moved closer until our lips met. It was soft and slow at first, before the passion built up and it became rough and fast. I pulled away breathless. \"You should…um, you should come inside.\" I breathed, and he nodded furiously in agreement. We both climbed out of the car, but as I closed the door behind me, Tuck pressed me up against the door as his mouth claimed mine. My hands ran up his chest until my fingertips brushed his collar, and then gripped it and pulled him even closer to me. Tuck's hands gripped my waist as I pushed him away from me slightly, and broke our kiss so I could drag him inside. When we stepped into the elevator, Tuck spun me round to face him, backed me up into a wall, and kissed me hard. He lifted me up slightly, and I wrapped my legs around his waist, locking my ankles together. Our chests were flush against each other as our mouths moved as one. It was hot and passionate and brain-muddling. A ding interrupted us, and Tuck tore his head away to see if we were on my floor. He placed me down onto my feet, and tugged me out of the elevator by my hand. I handed him my door key and he unlocked it, pulling me towards him, smashing his mouth onto mine and we stumbled backwards into my apartment with Tuck kicking the door closed behind us. We stepped back until I felt my ass brush my hallway end table, and then Tuck lifted me onto it. His lips moved away from mine, peppering kisses down my neck. I was having a small panic attack, until I practically yanked his head until his mouth slanted across mine again, which evaporated my worries. It was weird but Tuck practically moved us around my whole apartment, until we ended up on my 'dining room' table. I was breathless as Tuck scraped his teeth across the skin just under my ear and then kissed all the way down to my neck. \"Tuck, we need to talk,\" I said, pulling his face away from my body, but seeing him all hot and heavy and breathless and every bit as affected by me like I was him made me change my mind again. \"In a little bit.\" I kissed him again, wrapping my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist, as he carried me over to another wall and braced me against it. His lips trailed slow kisses across my cheek, jaw and neck, and I gripped the back of his shirt with one hand and attempted to find purchase on the wall behind me. \"This is so bad,\" I whispered to myself mostly. \"But it feels so good.\" I brought his lips back to mine, and our mouths moved almost feverishly against each other, making my brain virtually useless, as I didn't realize that we had moved until my back was pressed into my couch cushions and Tuck's warm body hovered over mine. Tuck pressed hot kisses against my throat, giving me time to come to my senses. \"Okay, Tuck.\" I said, taking my hands away from his face. \"Mm-hm?\" He murmured against my skin. \"Tuck. Tuck, I'm sorry,\" I said, as I pushed us into an upright position. \"I'm not this kind of girl.\" \"I know exactly what kind of girl you are, Rachel. And that's why I've completely fallen in love with you.\" Tuck said, his blue eyes seeping into mine and melting my heart into a useless mush. Why did the British accent make that sound so much better? I caressed his cheek and pressed my lips to his softly. Tuck was in love with me and it enabled me to admit, not out loud but inwardly, that I loved him too. So I kissed him and showed him. At headquarters, FDR was lamenting the loss of his bugs around Rachel's house. As he hypothetically stabbed FDR in the back, he had gone round her house and stomped on all of his bugs while he stuck his tongue down Rachel's throat. And now he had told Rachel that he was in love with her and FDR knew Rachel well enough to know that love was what she wanted. FDR was angry at Tuck, slightly at Rachel, but also at himself. Maybe if he hadn't of slept with her first, Tuck would have honored their agreement himself, but now he was having sex with the woman that FDR loved too. \"Damn. I think that's the new British Invasion what just happened there, that's what that was.\" Bothwick said, as he stood, leaning against the desk, not having anything to do now that all the bugs were destroyed and all the monitors blank. FDR didn't respond to the technician's words. He just sighed and put his head in his hands. \"I think I'm having a panic attack.\" I said, as I paced back and forth in Lauren's living room. Trish and Lauren were sitting on her couch, watching me as I freaked out. \"Just breathe. Breathe in and breathe out and come sit down.\" Lauren suggested, and I followed her instructions, taking deep breaths before plunking myself down in between her and our kooky, blonde friend. \"Do you think it's possible to love two people equally?\" I questioned, my eyes flickering from side to side as I waited for one of my friends to answer me. \"Love, yes. Be in love, no.\" Lauren replied, and Trish nodded agreeing with her. I sighed, looking down at my hands before I asked my next question. \"What do you do when you don't know what to do?\" \"I ask Bob.\" Trish replied, much to my surprise. \"Your husband, Bob?\" I asked. I'd met Bob and he was not the brightest spark. Not the sharpest knife in the draw, if you catch my drift. In fact, Trish had once told me that he was about as useful as a chocolate spanner…she was going through this weird English Phrases phase at the time. \"'Bob' Bob?\" Lauren questioned, backing me up, probably as surprised as me. \"Yeah. I mean, I know he's fat and ridiculous, but he's my fat and my ridiculous. And I like the way that I am with him,\" Trish answered, bring a smile to both mine and Lauren's faces. I did not know that Trish had this love-y dove-y side to her and it was nice. \"Don't choose the better guy. Choose the guy that's gonna make you the better girl. Right?\" \"Right.\" Lauren agreed. And I thought about it for a moment, before I came to the conclusion. I knew who would make me the better girl. At work the next day, I spent half of the morning deliberating whether or not to unpack my stuff. I mean, I had made up my mind, hadn't I? I knew who I wanted to be with, so I could just go back and work with the guys again. Yet at the same time, I didn't want to leave my new security blanket of independence. In solo ops I only had to rely on myself and my own skills and my own mind, not anybody else. And that's the way I used to be when I was a kid, bouncing around from home to home, with no friends and no one to rely on. Sometimes, despite how happy and grateful I am towards Nana and Grandpa Foster for practically saving me from the mess my life could have become, I still miss the independence I had. I didn't unpack anything. Instead I slipped on my jacket, remembering to place the gun I always carry into an inside pocket and to drop an extra magazine into my boot, and left headquarters. I drove around for a while, before I stopped at the newest restaurant to open on Third. A waitress showed me to a table for two, asking me how long my guest was going to be. I told her I'd check, which was enough for her to walk away to serve someone else. That's when I called him. Tuck had just finished bickering with FDR, confirming that no matter who Rachel chose their friendship was over, when his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket and smiled as Rachel's picture popped up onto the screen. He quickly answered it, pressing the phone to his ear. \"Rachel,\" He said, slightly louder for FDR's benefit. \"How are you? Are you well?\" \"Hi. Oh, I'm pretty good.\" \"Good.\" He said, as he sat down. \"Are you busy?\" She asked, already knowing he probably wasn't. \"No, no. I, uh, just finished some of my paperwork.\" He said, telling another white lie. His eyes trailed over to the small pile of papers that he had yet to complete. \"Good. Do you know that new place on Third? \" \"Oh, I do! I do. I know it very well.\" \"Great. I'm here now. Do you think you can meet me?\" \"I can be there in half an hour.\" Tuck answered her, smiling down the phone. She'd called him and wanted to see him. \"Okay. I'll see you for lunch then.\" \"That would be lovely.\" \"All right, I'll see you there.\" \"All right, my love.\" \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" Tuck hung up the phone, staring at FDR as the man watched him, his old friend's face tinged with barely concealed sadness. \"She called you.\" FDR said. Tuck just stood, pulling his suit jacket off the back of his chair and grabbing his tie from a drawer in his desk. \"Gotta go, mate.\" \"Have to pack up anyway.\" FDR replied, very sullen, which was unusual for him. Tuck just walked away, saying nothing as he headed to a lunch date that could possibly make him a very happy man. FDR watched Tuck leave, but turned his attention back to packing quickly. She had called Tuck. He would just have to live with her decision. He wasn't the guy she wanted after all. Well, at least she'd helped him be a better man. FDR could thank her for that much at least. Once his desk was packed up, surprisingly filling only one box (Rachel's had filled about four, but maybe it's because she had so many souvenirs and goodies from all the places that they'd been stuffed away in her drawers), he headed to one of the recon rooms to collect the couple of things he'd left there. \"Lucky water bottle.\" He said, picking the object up and placing it into the box he'd placed on the desk. Dickerman was sitting in front of the monitors, and when FDR heard Tuck's voice, he looked up and spoke. \"What are you doing?\" He questioned. \"Watching last night's surveillance video on Tuck and Rachel.\" Dickerman replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen. \"Time to close the books on that one, Dickerman. She got away,\" FDR said, placing the lid on his box of belongings. \"All right, Dick, I'll see you when I see you.\" He was about to walk away when he noticed something suspicious on the screen. Tuck's voice still ebbed into the room, but FDR's eyes trained in on something that was in the background, behind Tuck's car. He put the box back onto the desk and leaned in closer to Dickerman so he had a better view. \"Scroll back a second,\" He instructed the technician, who did as he was told. \"Now zoom in.\" \"There?\" Dickerman questioned, as he zoomed in on Tuck's car. \"No, no, on the background,\" FDR replied, and watched as Dickerman worked his magic, zooming in on a car across the street from Rachel's apartment building. \"Freeze that and enhance.\" Dickerman did as instructed and FDR waited until his suspicions were confirmed. \"That's Heinrich,\" He said, forgetting his belongings as he turned and raced out of the room. \"He's here. I have to get to Tuck.\" Rachel and Tuck were in danger, and FDR was the only one who could help them. If Tuck would still let him, that is.[Chapter 11] Tuck and I were sitting next to each other, already having greeted each other and exchanged slightly awkward pleasantries. \"I'm really glad you called. I didn't expect you to. It was a surprise.\" Tuck said, and I felt bad. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Yeah. Which is great, because you know I love surprises.\" I smiled at him, shaking my head. \"And you know how much I hate them. Usually, they turn out more bad than-oh, God,\" I cut myself off, as I spotted FDR walking towards us. I really didn't want to this conversation in front of both of them. This made it harder. \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" FDR replied, his eyes on me until Tuck stood up and they kind of squared off. My eyes flickered between them, until I stood myself. They both turned their heads to look at me, and I stuttered out an excuse to escape. \"Would you guys excuse me? Just a minute?\" I questioned, stooping down to grab my purse and jacket, before I turned and started to ascend the staircase that leads to either the exit or the bathrooms. \"Order me a drink! In a shot. I'll be right back.\" I headed to the ladies room, and stood in front of a mirror, trying to stop a full scale panic attack before it happened to me. I breathed in deep, slow breaths, and when that didn't work, I tried to coach myself into being able to leave the bathroom and deal with the mess I had a part in creating. \"You can do this. You are a strong, confident woman, who can kick ass when it comes to dealing with conflict,\" I said to my reflection, before I felt slightly dizzy. \"Oh, fuck, I'm gonna pass out. Sure, you can deal with twenty armed men with nothing but a semi-automatic and a length of rope, but you can't deal with your two best friends who are in love with you. That's pathetic.\" I took another deep breath, realizing that insulting myself was not helping me at all, and started coaching myself again. \"Get out there. Tell them your decision. They have had moments of rationality before. They could stay friends if you worked hard enough to rebuild their relationship with them.\" I murmured to myself. I was retouching my lip gloss when I heard a crash, which immediately sent alarm bells ringing in my head. \"Please, God, let that be an army of hungry vermin that are trying to overrun the restaurant and not Tuck and FDR killing each other. Please.\" I grabbed my stuff from beside the sink I was standing in front of. I walked out of the bathroom and back to our table and my jaw dropped at the destruction I saw. And, slightly less surprising, Tuck and FDR lay in the middle of it. I guess God was busy today and didn't hear my plea for help. \"I should have killed you in Kandahar when I had the chance.\" FDR hisses at Tuck, pathetically tossing a fork in his direction. \"What? Were you having a laugh, mate?\" Tuck asked. \"I was the only thing that kept you alive in Kandahar, mate. Me and Rachel are your only friends. Rachel picked me. You lost.\" Tuck groaned, as he turned to face FDR and I quickly spoke before they could continue their conversation. \"Lost?\" I hissed, stepping down one more step so they could see. They both started stumbling over their words, but I continued. I was fueled by rage and hurt. \"What was this? Some sort of bet? Some sort of game? To see who could get the girl first?\" \"Let me explain.\" Tuck said, trying to get up onto his feet. \"No, let me explain.\" \"You've done enough, mate.\" Tuck replied. \"Rachel, listen-\" FDR started before Tuck cut him off. I just stared at the two men coldly, waiting for some sort of pathetic apology or excuse or something, but the two assholes just carried on interrupting each other. \"Shut up.\" \"I trusted you.\" I said, staring at them both before I walked away, back up the stairs. I was going to get in my car, leave, head to headquarters, hand in my resignation, and move to a different country. I'm thinking Thailand. Or New Zealand. New Zealand is beautiful. Tuck and FDR climbed to their feet, wincing and groaning as pain shot through them with each movement. FDR, who had momentarily forgotten why he'd even burst in on their date, was suddenly aware that Heinrich could easily take them both out right now. \"That was really classy, mate. Really good stuff,\" Tuck mocked, as he shook off shards of glass from his clothes. FDR saw a red spot appear on Tuck's jacket, and he looked up, trying to find it's origin. Tuck remained oblivious. \"Don't talk to me, man. Don't you ever, ever talk to me again.\" \"Tuck,\" He pointed towards Tuck's chest, but Tuck slapped his hand away. FDR simply raised it again. \"No, Tuck.\" Several more red dots appeared on his chest, and on FDR's too. \"Hands up!\" Someone ordered them, and as they were clearly outnumbered and would be shot faster than they could say \"Rachel\" if they tried anything, the two CIA agents raised the hands above their heads. I unlocked my car, and tossed my purse onto the other seat before I climbed in and slammed the door behind me. I knew someone was in there with me immediately, but I knew it would be useless pretending I'd forgotten something and attempting an escape. \"Guten Tag, Heinrich, wie schön, dich zu sehen .\" I said, turning my rear view mirror so I could see his face. He smirked at me as he raised his gun towards me. \"Drive.\" \"You know if you wanted a ride somewhere, it's called a taxi, but as you're here, where to?\" I asked, turning my car on and putting my seat belt on at the same time. He gave me an address, and because I knew that he had his men collecting Tuck and FDR and would most likely have them take them to the same location, I went along with it, though I could have killed him by now. I pulled into an abandoned warehouse, rolling my eyes as I did so. I mean, life threatening situation aside, have evil criminals given up hope for originality? It's always an abandoned warehouse! Shaking those thoughts out of my head, I climbed out of my car, frowning as one of Heinrich's henchmen stepped forward and patted me down, searching for weapons. Finding the gun I always have hidden under my clothes, they shoved me forward to a chair, and then tied my hands in front of me. He's an international criminal, but he still doesn't see me as a real threat because of my sex? Stupid mistake. Two men with black sacks over their heads sat on chairs in front of me, and I assumed that they were Tuck and FDR. It was confirmed when they started bickering. \"I told you this would happen. You never listen to me.\" FDR hissed quietly at Tuck. \"You threw a knife at me.\" Tuck whispered back angrily. \"Guys, would you shut up?\" I asked, speaking at a regular volume. \"Rachel?\" They both questioned at the same time. \"No! It's the Easter Bunny! Of course, it's me, you idiots!\" I growled at them, before I turned to Heinrich. \"Heinrich, old buddy, during our car ride, I feel we bonded, so what do you say? Let us go?\" \"You're a funny woman. And so pretty, but not enough to save your boyfriends. You all work for the CIA, did you really think that asking me was enough to change my mind?\" He questioned, two men yanking the hoods off of Tuck and FDR's heads. They both blinked at the sudden light, but soon focused their eyes on me. \"No, but a girl's gotta try.\" I smiled grimly up at him. \"She didn't kill Jonas. She's got nothing to do with this.\" FDR said. \"Why don't you let her go? It's us you want, isn't it?\" Tuck asked, and it was sweet that they were trying to save me, but I wasn't a damsel in distress. I didn't need two knights in shining armor to save me. \"No. It's only one of you I want. Jonas was not just my brother. He was my best friend. You took that from me. And I'm here today…to return the favor One of you will kill the other,\" Heinrich revealed, and my gaze flitted from Tuck to FDR and back. I tried not to show it but I was panicking. Heinrich leaned towards me so our faces were barely two inches apart. \"You choose.\" \"What?\" I whispered, realizing that my worst nightmare was just coming true. I had to choose, but this time it wasn't who I wanted to be with really. It's who I wanted to save. \"You choose who dies.\" Heinrich informed me. \"I can't do that.\" \"Well, if you can't, I have to kill all of you.\" \"Or just me,\" I countered. \"I'm their best friend too. Kill me, and let them go.\" \"Rachel-\" Tuck started to protest. \"Shut up, Tuck!\" I hissed at him. Heinrich scrutinized my face as I stared up at him, and he seemed to consider it, but still dashed my hopes. \"I wish to cause you all pain. You choose who dies. Now.\" He ordered, and I glared at him, looking away from him and back at Tuck and FDR, who were exchanging glances. They were formulating a plan, I could tell. \"I can't do that. Don't make me do that.\" I spat back at him. \"You have five seconds.\" \"Rachel!\" FDR's voice brought my attention to him. \"Pick me. Choose me.\" Both him and Tuck kept trying to get my attention, but all I could hear was Heinrich's countdown booming in my head. It was like time had slowed down, and the only sound I could hear was a solitary ticking clock counting down to the death of someone I loved. \"Two.\" Heinrich said. \"Rachel, choose me.\" \"Everything will be fine, Rachel.\" \"One.\" \"FDR!\" I shouted, with my brief moment of panic over. I worked out the plan the boys had made, or why FDR was so eager for me to choose him to die. It wasn't because all of a sudden Tuck and FDR had kissed and made up and FDR wanted to save his best friend. \"That wasn't so hard. If you didn't look so in pain, I would assume that you were heartless.\" He said, before he ordered his men , in German, to untie FDR and Tuck and to make them stand up. I watched as Heinrich removed all the bullets from the magazine in his Glock, then he slowly stalked towards Tuck and handed him the gun. Tuck took it, glaring at Heinrich, as the German held up a bullet. \"It's just one bullet. Don't miss.\" \"Oh, I won't mate.\" Tuck replied, taking the bullet. I watched as Tuck placed the bullet into the firing chamber of the gun, and chambered the round, before aiming it at FDR. I moved my eyes to the man in question and he gazed back at me. \"I'm sorry.\" I said, quietly but loud enough for him to hear me. \"I love you.\" He mouthed to me, before nodding at Tuck. I watched Tuck's hand trembling, before he squeezed the trigger, and the gun fired. FDR fell to the ground and I let out a convincing scream. \"Bulls-eye.\" Heinrich announced, enjoying the whole thing way to much. Tuck stared down the barrel of the gun a moment longer, at the seemingly dead body of his once best friend, before he lowered it. \"You two have a nice life together,\" Heinrich said to me, and I pretended to flinch at his words, before he turned to Tuck. \"Keep the gun as a souvenir.\" Tuck glanced at him, before he tossed the gun away from him. It landed near FDR's 'lifeless' body, and Heinrich frowned. He turned away and gave an order to one of his men as he stormed away, leaving us in the warehouse to be killed. A henchman hit Tuck in the back with a shotgun, forcing him to his knees, and I gasped involuntarily. It was a hard blow. Without drawing attention to myself, I slowly reached down into my boot and pulled out the knife I kept there and began cutting away at the rope around my wrists. \"You made the right choice, Rach.\" Tuck said, a split second before FDR burst back into life and took three men down with the bullets from the extra mag he always keeps in his top left pocket. I jumped out of my seat, the rope falling away, and tossed my knife forward, not watching as it flew through the air and sunk into the chest of another of Heinrich's associates. I rushed forward, falling into a cartwheel so I could grab a gun I spotted on the floor, and when I was upright, I shot two guys behind Tuck. \"Well, would you look at that? Gymnastics always comes in handy.\" I muttered to myself, before running behind a wall as Heinrich reappeared, firing at us. Tuck and FDR were right behind me, giving me covering fire. We turned left and sped down a runway, occasionally one of us would turn and take down a guy that was following us. We ended up in a parking garage, and Tuck was pushing me towards the open top Jeep Wrangler. \"Jesus, Tuck, just hot-wire the thing and I'll worry about myself. God.\" I said, shoving him towards the driver's side and jumping into the passenger seat, twisting myself around so I was facing the entrance we just came through. \"Rach, just in case we die, I am really-\" \"I don't want your apologies right now, FDR, just get in the damn car.\" I said, pulling out the magazine in my gun and tossing it away. I reached down into my left boot and plucked out the spare magazine I had put in there this morning. I pushed it in to the gun, and chambered a round into position. FDR couldn't argue with me as two men appeared and fired at us, but he quickly took them out, and ran out of ammo in the process. He climbed onto the back of the Jeep, as Tuck started it, and pulled away. FDR leaned out of the car, and swiped a gun off of the floor, firing it at one of the guys who'd gotten up and tried to chase us with a wounded leg. It was mildly amusing actually, but I was too pumped full of adrenaline to actually laugh. We got out onto the highway before I noticed two Chevrolet Suburban's on our six. \"We've started a conga, boys. Two black Chevrolet's on our six.\" I informed them. \"Rach, take the wheel.\" Tuck ordered me, and though I wanted to protest, I swapped places with him, with a little effort on my part to make sure our Jeep didn't spiral out of control, as he started firing at the incoming vehicles. Between him and FDR, they took out one and I watched it fade into the distance as the remaining one sped up. \"I missed you.\" FDR grinned at Tuck. I couldn't believe that I was seeing this out of the rear view mirror. Now? We were being chased by an international criminal hell and his goons who were hell bent on killing us and they were making up now? \"I know. I've missed you too.\" Tuck replied. \"I love you man.\" \"I love you too.\" \"We're back!\" FDR practically shouted, and I stumbled onto a realisation. \"Oh, my God. I've become Yoko.\" I lamented, as the remaining car sped up alongside us. Tuck stood up in his seat, a tire iron in his grip, and smashed the window of the Chevrolet, sticking the tire iron in the steering wheel and spinning it around. With the driver unable to gain control in time, the car sped off the road and smashed into a cement column of an overpass. I watched, as it blew up in my rear view mirror, with a grin my face. The grin was wiped off my face as another two Suburban's appeared, and forced me onto the 310 Freeway, which I'm pretty sure if incomplete. Well I assumed it was incomplete due to the fact I had to drive through an orange and white barrier. I kept driving trying to figure out how much road was left, and not paying much attention to what the boys were doing behind me. I just heard gunfire and an explosion, and suddenly I could see the end. I braked hard, causing the Jeep to spin round once, before I gained control…just as we were about to go off the edge. I gripped the steering wheel hard, as Tuck peeked over his door and noticed the steep drop I had just saved us from. We were all breathing heavily, and I was trying to catch mine back again, when FDR went on the offensive. \"I hope you can forgive Tuck, Rach. He's the best man I know.\" \"Bollocks, mate. The pair of you…you two belong to each other. You really do, you belong to each other.\" Tuck said, in reply, turning in his seat to address FDR. They were talking to each other as if I weren't there, but I was too busy trying to figure out if we'd killed Heinrich to scold them for it. \"Tuck! No, thank you, Tuck, but she's already made her choice.\" FDR replied, shaking his head. \"No. No, I didn't.\" \"You didn't?\" They both questioned in unison. \"What?\" FDR asked alone, while Tuck just repeated the question he had already asked. \"No, I mean, I did, but in light of everything, I'm even more-\" The screeching tyres of an approaching car cut me off, and we all jumped out of the Jeep quickly, raising out guns as we stood waiting for the car to get closer. FDR and Tuck started firing at it, but their bullets just bounced off of Heinrich's car. \"It's bullet-proof,\" I told them, crouching down, aiming at the headlights and waiting for my shot. \"The lights. Shoot the headlights. I remember Lauren telling me something about front-impact airbag deployment in models of this car after 2006.\" Both guys listened to my lightening quick explanation and followed my lead, crouching and we all fired once, taking out both headlights. I stood, and watched as Heinrich was knocked out by his airbag, and the car lost control, hitting something that was in the road. The engine exploded and the car flipped over, heading towards us like a fiery wrecking ball. Tuck and FDR ran to either side of me, and furiously gestured for me to go to them. I kept looking back and forth between the two, and then at the car as it careened towards me. Time had slowed down again and I could hear my heart thumping in my chest as the car got ever closer and I dived out of the way. I kept my eyes closed tight as arms wrapped themselves around my waist and tucked me under a warm body to protect me from any falling debris as the car flew over us. I had moved in the nick of time, and narrowly missed being squashed to death. I heard the loud explosion as the car and our Jeep impacted with the freeway below, and I sighed, sitting up and looking into blue eyes that were scanning my face to see if I was in pain. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah.\" I said, breathing hard and trying to forget that I had the most cliché movie moment and saw my whole life flash before my eyes before I had dived out of the way of my probable death. \"Good.\" FDR replied, cupping my cheeks with both of his hands. \"I'm okay.\" I felt like I could sing. I had just narrowly avoided death and was now in the arms of a gorgeous man I was in love with. I stared into FDR's eyes for a beat longer, before I turned to face Tuck, an apologetic expression residing on my face. He nodded at me slightly, before he climbed to his feet. \"Yeah, alright, get a room.\" That's when we all heard the news helicopter flying above us. This was going to be hard to explain away. Tuck's son, Joe, and his mom, Katie, were sat in the front room of their house watching the news avidly. Katie's jaw was practically hitting the floor, but her son had a small grin on his face. \"I don't think he's a travel agent.\" He said excitedly, as his mom shook her head, and pulled him to her. No, she thought, he certainly wasn't a travel agent. We were now surrounded by ambulances and fire engines. Tuck and FDR had made sure I was seen to by a paramedic first, though I don't know why. All I was experiencing was cuts and bruises, and those would heal quickly. I was even given a warm blanket to drape around my shoulders. Tuck was sitting in the back of an ambulance, and I left FDR's side to go and talk to him. As I approached, he stood up and kissed me on the cheek, before he pulled back. \"I was gonna tell you. That's why I asked you out.\" \"Yeah, it's okay. Um…it's good. It's good. I understand.\" Tuck said, smiling at me. \"You'll always be my best friend and partner, Tuck. That won't change,\" I replied, holding his hand and squeezing it tight. \"And you'll always be my favourite British guy. No matter how many Pierce Brosnan movies I watch.\" That made him chuckle and brought a smile to my face. \"You should probably call Joe and Katie. They're probably watching on this on the news as we speak.\" I told him, gesturing at all the mayhem that we were surrounded with. \"I should-I should probably head off.\" Tuck replied. \"Okay. Tell them I said hi.\" \"Will do.\" Tuck gave me a small smile, before he started to walk away, but was stopped by FDR calling his name. I smiled at Franklin as he jogged past me, and I stepped further away from them so I wouldn't be tempted to eavesdrop. A grin spread across my face as they hugged, and separated, with Tuck walking away and FDR sauntering over to me. \"So…\" Franklin said, as he pulled me towards him. \"So when I added it all up and I crunched all the numbers, it was a-\" I started to explain why I'd picked him, but he cut me off by shushing me. \"No more thinking.\" He said, before he kissed me. I smiled into the kiss, before we both pulled away a moment later. I smiled up at him and shook my head. \"You're gonna make me regret this, aren't you, Franklin?\" I questioned, gazing at those beautiful blues. \"For the rest of your life.\" FDR replied, and I pressed my lips to his, dropping the blanket around me as I wrapped my arms round the back of his neck and pressed my body against his. This was the perfect kiss, the perfect ending and I figured that I wouldn't regret my decision. I loved both of my best friend's, but I guess I'd always been in love with FDR. My heart just didn't figure it out fast enough. A few months later… FDR and Tuck were getting ready to jump out of a plane, to quite literally drop in on a meeting of a couple of international drug lords, when FDR's phone rang. Tuck glanced at his partner as he answered, knowing who the caller would be, before he focused his attention back on to securing his parachute. \"Hello?\" FDR shouted down the phone, trying to be heard above the noise of the plane's engines. \" Hey babe! I just thought I'd call and thank you for leaving me here at Nana's while you go off and do what we love to do .\" Rachel's voice sounded very sarcastic down the phone and brought a grin to FDR's face. \"Hey, it's not my fault that you're benched from field duty!\" \"I'm two months pregnant. Technically, it's partly your fault, genius. \" \"Hey, it's the contraception company's fault! Who makes a product that's only 97% effective?\" FDR argued. \"I know, babe. Anyway, Nana wants me to remind you about dinner tomorrow night. Don't forget to tell Tuck to bring Katie and Joe. \" Rachel reminded him. FDR grinned as he remembered that Tuck had gotten back together with his ex-wife and had his small family back. It made him feel less guilty for the fact Rachel chose him. FDR turned round to face his partner-in-justice, pointing a finger at him. \"Nana's tomorrow night, huh?\" FDR asked him. \"That's not Nana you're talking to, is it?\" Tuck asked. \"No, no.\" \"Did you tell him yet? You begged me not to tell him so you could, and I just told Nana, so you keep up your end of the bargain. You got out easy, baby, believe me. Nana is now going bat-crap crazy over her future great-grandbaby. \" Rachel said, and FDR could hear his nana's voice in the background, scolding Rachel for being rude, and hearing Rachel protesting that clubbing her with a rolling pin would harm her unborn child. \"I'm just about to.\" FDR replied. \" Good luck .\" Rachel teased him, knowing he was slightly nervous about telling Tuck. \"I love you, baby.\" \"I love you, baby. \" She replied, and FDR could picture the smile on her face as she said those words that he loved hearing. \"Bye.\" FDR said, before hanging up. He couldn't be anymore in love with Rachel Simmonds than he was now. They'd moved in together about a month after she had chosen him that day on that incomplete freeway, and now she was pregnant with his kid. FDR Foster was going to be a father, and he couldn't be any happier. FDR walked over to Tuck, and his partner immediately started safety checks on his parachute. \"Brother.\" FDR said, getting Tuck's attention. \"Yo.\" \"Rachel and I are having a baby.\" He said, deciding to be blunt about it. \"Yeah?\" Tuck shouted, happily. Although he had loved Rachel a lot, he was very happy with Katie now. It was better than the first time, and he loved that he had his family back. He and Joe spent more time together and everything was looking better. \"Will you be his or her godfather?\" FDR questioned, and Tuck's loud, happy sound of agreement almost deafened him, but he joined in because it was exciting news. The gangway lowered which meant it was time for them to jump. \"Jump run!\" \"Hey, you're good.\" Tuck told him \"I know it's a little awkward with you having slept with Rachel and everything, but I just think it's poetic justice, right?\" FDR said, quickly checking Tuck's gear before he moved to the open hatch. \"What is?\" \"Well, I've been meaning to tell you this for a while, but I slept with Katie. Once. Long time ago. Before you guys even knew each other.\" FDR informed him, trying to explain it in a way that Tuck might not get mad at him. \"You slept with my wife?\" Tuck questioned. \"She wasn't your wife. You didn't know her.\" FDR argued, seeing that Tuck was a little angry about it, which he hadn't actually expected. \"You slept with my wife?\" Tuck repeated, outraged that his best friend had done that and then kept it a secret for years. \"It was a long time ago, man.\" \"But I never even slept with Rachel!\" Tuck shouted. \"What?\" FDR asked, feeling confused. \"I never slept with Rachel! No, I only let you think that, right? Think that, to make you jealous.\" Tuck explained, angrily pointing to his head to gesture 'think' as he spoke the words. FDR looked stunned. He hadn't even asked Rachel if she and Tuck had slept together, he just assumed it was better not asking. She'd probably kill him for asking. \"You never slept with Rachel?\" FDR questioned. \"You slept with my wife!\" Tuck yelled, launching himself at his partner. Both Tuck and FDR fell backwards out of the plane, with FDR trying to push his best friend off of him so they could eventually pull their chutes and not fall to their deaths. I sat in the living room at Nana's. After I'd finished helping Nana in the kitchen, I came in here to sit and contemplate. Franklin and I were starting a family. Of course, we had messed the order up a little. You're supposed to date, move in, get married and then have children…but where's the harm in a little originality? But, in spite of how happy I was with my life now, with FDR, my job, our 12 year old dog with the milky eye and now our unborn child, I still felt incomplete. I pulled the slightly crumpled picture of me and my potential mother out of my purse and stared at it. Who was this woman really? And if she was my mother, why did she leave me? Especially with my father who had no parental instinct at all and preferred to use his daughter as a foot rest or punching bag than to love and support her. I just didn't understand how a woman could carry a child within her for nine months, give birth to a beautiful daughter and not love her enough to stay. I couldn't imagine doing that to my own baby, and I wouldn't. I couldn't let my baby grow up without a mother like I had. Yet, I don't think I'd ever be able to get over what my own mother had done and make sure I could correct the mistakes of the past, without finding her and finding out the truth. \"What are you planning, young lady?\" Nana asked me, sitting down next to me and placing a cup of tea on the coffee table in front of me. \"I'm not planning anything, Nana,\" I said, placing the photo back in my purse, and staring at the tea. \"That is not coffee.\" \"You can't drink coffee anymore, dear. Now don't try and change the subject. What are you planning?\" She questioned, raising a small, thin, grey eyebrow at me as she waited for a truthful reply, which, after I sighed and inwardly debated with myself, she received. \"I want to find my mother. I don't think I can ever be one hundred percent happy without knowing the truth.\" I explained to her. \"If that's what you need to do, sweetheart, that's what you need to do. Now, let's talk baby names.\" I grinned at Nana, shaking my head. I was going to find my mother and then I'd be a better mother and wife than she ever was, I vowed, as I listened to Nana list names she thought were adorable. Little did I know that finding my mother would be a lot more difficult than I anticipated. This is the end, my friends. But once I am done with my exams, I may write a sequel to this if there is enough want for one, called 'Damaged History' which basically follows Rachel as she looks for her mother, which involves diving back into her childhood and trying to unlock the secrets buried within her past. FDR and Tuck, ever the loyal best friends and partners, will, of course, be there to help her and protect her now that she's pregnant :) Did you guys like that twist? I didn't want to follow the movie's ending that closely so I changed that aspect of it. Well, thank you for reading 'Collateral Damage', I hoped you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it :)[Chapter 12] A/N Hi guys! Just to let you know that I've been editing this story. Now it's much longer, and hopefully better. I've yet to decide whether or not to switch up the ending, because I'm not sure I like the whole pregnancy thing, but if you guys like it, it stays, if not, then I'll change it. I'm also working on the sequel, \"Damaging History\", this summer and that will hopefully be posted soon. Let me know what you think of a sequel and what you want to see in it, and if I like what you suggest then I'll make sure to incorporate your ideas! You guys are awesome and thank you for following and favoring this story! It means a lot. Anyway, lots of love, Sophie. ","Summary":" \"Mission is a go. Repeat, you are green to go. Intercept and apprehend the Heinrich brothers. Secu"},{"Movie":"This Means War","Title":"Eloquently Running","Author":"A Bit Blocked","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501845","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This first chapter is a bit of a filler just to give a sense of how they interact with each other and where relationships stand. I assume you know this but I don't own This Mean War in any way, shape or form. I do, however, own Jessica, Stuart and anyone else who might pop in that you don't know. Feedback either by review or PM would be much appreciated because if I don't know what I'm doing wrong I can't fix it. Summary: Jessica was brought up with FDR – he's like her brother – and this is how she squeezes herself into the film. With her feelings for Tuck being less than platonic but not romantic enough to act on, Jess flows into the story but only changes it slightly. Tuck/OC…in due course but drama aplenty! With stalkers, explosions and things for appearance's sake life will never be easy when your associated with the CIA. Read, enjoy and…review? Much love and thanks, Liv. I sat with my back against a tree on the cool grass staring out at the ten perfectly set tables on the lawn and the people sitting at or running between them. Family, that's who these people were and the two men with their backs currently to me were the ones I was closest to. Well, Tuck wasn't actually family and I didn't think of him like that but to FDR he was. I had been forced into a dress for the occasion – a horrific piece of fabric that was like a tight black t-shirt at the top connected to a flowing white skirt – with my unruly brown hair tied loosely at my neck. \"Why the heck are you two sittin' over here all by yourselves?\" I heard Nana ask and focused my attention to the table a few feet away from me. \"You're not going to make me any great-grandbabies this way!\" Un-oh, that talk again! I stood up and tried to inconspicuously slip away. \"It is a family gathering Nana; I don't think you want us making any great-grandbabies today.\" FDR quipped. \"To be fair,\" Tuck added \"I have already provided you with a wonderful great-grandchild.\" That was true, Joe was amazing. \"Yeah but that doesn't count because you screwed it all up!\" Nana replied. \"Ouch.\" Tuck said at the same moment I thought it. \"And don't think you can slink off Missy!\" Nana called making me cringe and turn around. \"You are no closer to children than these two lumps!\" Said two lumps grinned at me and stood up. \"Hey Jessie.\" FDR said as he hugged me. \"Hey.\" I replied after kissing his cheek. \"Hi Tuck.\" I said and repeated the process with him. \"How've you been love?\" he asked me as I sat down next to him. \"Same old.\" I said with a smile. \"You two? Been keeping out of trouble?\" It was my subtle way of asking if they had nearly been killed lately. \"Not really but it keeps life interesting.\" he replied with an adorable grin. I had found out seven years ago that they both worked for the CIA because, really, when you find a false wall hiding a small armoury in your brother's house, the truth is the only explanation that will wash. When you look at the Foster family tree it will tell you that Franklin Delano Roosevelt Foster and Jessica Jane Foster are cousins – my mum and his dad – but we both grew up with Nana and 'cousins' simply doesn't cover how close we are. \"Well?\" Nana asked. \"Nana you know how much I want a family! I've just never dated a guy that's worth having one with.\" I said truthfully. \"Have you at least met someone who is?\" she pushed. Now, I could just be paranoid but I'm pretty sure that when her eyes swept over the three of us they stayed on Tuck for a beat too long before looking pointedly at me. If the guys noticed though, they didn't say anything. I simply raised my eyebrows in response, silently telling her that I was not answering that one, though I did start to bite the inside of my lip. Nana always said that \"honesty's the best policy\" so I wasn't going to lie. After a few seconds of silence I lowered my eyes to the tablecloth. \"Come on Louelle,\" I heard my Grandpa's gravelly voice say and looked up from the uninteresting design to see him giving Nana a kiss. \"Let's show these kids how it's done, huh?\" they both gave us meaningful looks before he escorted her to the dance area. \"It's kinda gross when they kiss.\" FDR complained and I nodded but Tuck didn't seem to notice. \"God I love that kid.\" he continued, oblivious to his friend's stupor. I let out a soft chuckle as my young cousin Daniel fell to ground with a blue bucket on his head. \"S'goin' on?\" he finally asked Tuck through a mouthful of cake. The latter-mentioned had been staring at our grandparents since they had started dancing. \"Hey, Mister Deep-in-thought.\" he said prodding Tuck with his fork. He replied with an absentminded 'hmm?' and FDR asked \"Wanna talk about it?\" After a couple of failed attempts to form words Tuck finally said \"Nothing, I just think it's lovely isn't it? It's really lovely.\" I glanced back at the older couple dancing and conceded that he did have a point – to be able to have someone like that: to have loved and been with someone for all those year and to still be able to share simple things like a dance and to get lost in each other's eyes… \"What's lovely?\" FDR asked and I rolled my eyes – he was so dense sometimes. \"Well I love the way they look into each other's eyes like that.\" Tuck explained with a hint of awe in his voice. \"I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.\" FDR said and I suppressed a snort. \"Okay look, you asked me a serious question didn't you?\" my attention was piqued by this. When FDR nodded in affirmation and made a vague noise of agreement Tuck asked \"Right, so what, do you want a serious answer?\" \"Do you want me to put the cake down is that…?\" \"Yes please, thank you.\" \"The cake is down, talk to me.\" He said, turning in his chair to face his best friend. \"Right, seriously, man show,\" Tuck began. \"What am I, spare ribs?\" I interrupted making both spies jump – I didn't think it was possible so I gave myself a mental pat on the back – they had forgotten me! \"No! I-uh…\" Tuck stammered. \"It's fine.\" I assured him. \"I'll see you guys later.\" They both looked apologetic which made me smile as I stood up. I kissed both of them on the tops of their heads as I passed them and wound my way through masses of my family. I heard Tuck begin \"I trust you. I know you'd do anything for me, I'd do anything…\" Another smile worked its way onto my face, I loved those guys! TmWtMwTmWtMw \"Hey you two.\" I called as I make my way from the bar. After receiving two kisses on the cheek I hopped onto one of the pool tables that wasn't being used – Tuck had his back to me. \"So let me get this straight: you've put your personal, private details on a very public website?\" FDR asked in bewilderment. \"Yes.\" Tuck sighed, turning to shoot me a glare – I had choked on my beer at FDR's question. \"Are you insane?\" FDR and I asked. \"No.\" he replied. I'll admit, the way he said it made my toes curl and my mouth twitch into a grin. \"What're you talking about anyway?\" I chimed in. \"Tuck's registered with an online dating service!\" FDR crooned. Queue me choking again. \"Where are taking her?\" FDR smirked. \"Don't do that to me!\" he said but I could hear the prominent smile on his face. Then something hit me. Tuck had put his details on a dating website. He was looking to date someone. There is one thing you should know about my relationship with Tuck Hansen: I like him. It's a complicated like though because I've known him for ten years and we've always been close. But my feelings aren't 100% platonic; most of the time they're more like…60% though that can shift a bit. Which is enough for my heart to beat just a wee bit faster when he's around and a smile to be on my face most of that time and for some of the small, almost insignificant, things that he does to make my insides squirm pleasantly; but not enough for me to want to jeopardise our amazing friendship. When he'd met and married Katie I was fairly okay with it; though my average mood level did drop by a fraction and I'd find myself in need of a pint of Ben and Jerry's at odd times. \"You're such a cheese ball!\" FDR exclaimed in a voice a few octaves higher than normal – I'd have to thank him later for pulling me out of my thoughts. \"What?\" Tuck asked bashfully. \"Look, here's how it's gonna go down: you're gonna go on this date and I'm gonna go on this date with you.\" FDR stated. At this point I forsook my beer – I was getting pretty tired of snorting it up again – and gave my attention fully to the two men in front of me. The mood had just turned serious. \"No you're not!\" Tuck declared. \"Yes I am! I'm scared for you man: you haven't done this in a long time. This girl could be all sorts of crazy.\" he defended which made Tuck laugh. \"And besides, half those girls pee standing up Tuck, and the other half are on one of our watch-lists!\" \"It's just a date.\" I tried when Tuck sighed – why was I sticking up for this? \"Well lucky for you I'm free tonight.\" FDR continued. \"I'm gonna bring the binoculars, I'm gonna bring the hand cream-\" \"Franklin!\" I warned. \"I'll keep a hundred-yard radius – it'll be sweet stuff.\" \"Or you could just let the poor bugger go on his date alone! There is this thing called privacy.\" I suggested. \"Thank you!\" Tuck said. \"Besides, I'm not comfortable with you watching me date, it's wrong. It's just wrong mate.\" Tuck said reaching for his beer and taking a swig of it. \"Fine, I'll be around the corner on ringtone; I'll be at the video store. One ring means you need an extraction, two means you need a cleaner, three means I can get home.\" he compromised. Tuck considered this. \"Two hundred yards.\" he stated. \"Sold!\" The two friends laughed and I joined in but felt the need to voice \"This could end badly you know.\" \"Ah, you worry too much.\" FDR said. \"To dating!\" he toasted and we chinked bottles. I caught sight of the clock on the far wall and swore – verifying with my watch I leapt off the table. I'd only have an hour to get ready! \"Shit, I'm late!\" I said. \"I'll see you guys later.\" I tossed over my shoulder as I shot out of there to hail a cab. I heard vague calls goodbye as I overanalysed every item of clothing in my wardrobe to figure out what to wear on my date. I had been planning to tell them about it but after hearing that FDR was planning to recon' Tuck's I had decided not to. Stuart seemed like a nice guy – we'd met briefly a few times at work (we were both doctors) so I'd seen no harm in accepting a date. Hindsight is great thing though. What do you think of Jessie? How is my characterisation? Did you like it/love it/hate it? Please let me know! Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 2] I tugged nervously at the end of my navy-blue top and glanced around the street again. It transpired that having only an hour to get ready wasn't a problem for me – I'd changed into a nicer pair of black jeans, found a decent top and struggled to buckle a pair of heels, touched up my make-up and hair then I was ready with a whole twenty minutes to spare! I was five minutes early showing up at the café where we were supposed to meet and FDR's offer of being on ringtone for Tuck was feeling like a fantastic idea; why had I not told them? Why had I accepted this date? Stuart was a pretty nice guy – not bad looking, nice height and a good doctor – but saying 'yes' had been a spontaneous decision: there was no attraction on my part and I was only realising that as I sat waiting for him. As soon as I started contemplating leaving and calling him to say I was ill, I felt a hand on my back and jumped. Stuart's bobbed hair entered my peripheral vision; a second later he was sitting in front of me. We ordered coffee, discussed recent patients (leaving names out), there was some awkward silence then we exchanged trivial and clichéd information, after some more quiet we talked more about work then left with a parting kiss on the cheek. It was boring. I managed to keep smiling and civil but by the half-way point my fingers were itching to call Tuck or FDR for an extrusion – no extraction, they called it an extraction. As I walked home I promised myself one thing: never again. I would lie and make feeble excuses, make brilliant excuses and possibly even tell him I was gay to get out of ever going on a date with that man again. Once I was inside my home I noticed I had two new messages and when I listened to the first I felt instantly guilty: Tuck had called. He was worried because I'd left the bar so quickly and wanted to confirm that we were still going to the carnival on Friday. I resolved to phone him after the next message. Stuart. He explained with relative ease that he had really enjoyed the date and couldn't wait to see me again; he tagged on at the end that he thought my eyes were \"the most beautiful blue oceans I've ever seen and I would happily drown in them!\". I gave the answering machine a distasteful look and cleared the inbox. Tuck didn't answer his phone when he called so I left a voicemail: \"Hey, it's me. I'm sorry I ran out on you guys, I had a- a thing to do but I'll tell you later. And yeah, of course I'm up for going to the carnival! I've only been looking forward to it for three weeks! Besides, I want to see what this \"surprise\" you've set up is. Anyway…yeah, talk soon.\" I was such a spaz when it came to leaving messages! I wondered if he was on his date. That thought alone was enough to make me start biting my lip – something Tuck and FDR had both pointed out I only did when I was upset. It was during times like this that my platonic feelings for Tuck took a back seat. I let myself get jealous or wonder what it would be like if we were together: holding his hand, lying together on the couch, just being close to him; my thoughts were disciplined not to stray anywhere near kissing him in fear of…well, I knew without a doubt that if I started fantasising about that it would have an impact on our friendship. When I told him about my date would he be jealous? Would he get the same unplaceable ache taking up root in his body? I knew that mine was still there. Urgh, I needed ice-cream! I spent my night watching Marvel films, not noticing my phone light up more and more frequently, and fell asleep on the sofa. TmWtMwTmWtMw The new day welcomed various things including twenty-seven texts from my new stalker, one missed call from Tuck (I wondered how long this game of phone tag would last) and an aching shoulder. Stuart had started off complimenting me then asked if I was free on Saturday night. By about text thirteen he was wondering if I was okay – why wasn't I replying? – and by twenty had concluded that I was intentionally ignoring him. He wanted to know what he'd done wrong and if we could work it out. Mentally noting that I should show FDR or Tuck as soon as I saw either of them, I sent a quick reply saying that I had my phone off last night, was busy on Saturday and I wasn't ignoring him. Holding onto the fact I was only in work for six hours that day I was cleaned, dressed, nourished and out the door with my travel mug of coffee in a respectable time. I listened to Shinedown for the twenty minute drive to CIA headquarters – I worked in the medical centre there two days a week thanks to FDR putting in a good word for me (I didn't ask him to!). I was through building security, one floor underground, changed and clocking in for six-am. Fridays were a popular day to be injured it seemed. It reminded me of the ER in Mission Hospital where I normally worked but the explanations for the wounds were always more colourful here. Instead of someone slicing open their hand with a letter opener you get an agent who deflected a Samurai sword; falling down the stairs wasn't an accident it was the only way to avoid the cascade of bullets. Every CIA agent that walked – or limped or was wheeled – through the doors was wonderful. No matter what their ailment was they had a joke or even just a smile for me and the others; it is hard not to see the funny side of pulling a bullet out of someone's backside though! My usual twelve hour shift was short today because I had covered for someone the week before and she was returning the favour so at quarter past twelve I was heading up to the second floor. I wandered through the maze of glass and cubicles to the office at the back and leaned against the clear wall. Tuck was typing rapidly, his eyes scanning the screen with an uncharacteristic scowl on his face. FDR was nowhere I could see. \"Knock knock.\" I called and his eyes smoothly slid to me. \"Hey Sweetheart, how're you?\" he asked as he sat the keyboard on the desk. \"Same old.\" I said with a shrug, seating myself behind my brother's desk. \"Is FDR around? There's something I needed to talk to you guys about.\" \"I'm not sure where he is at the moment actually, is everything alright?\" \"Yeah yeah, it can wait.\" I assured him with a smile. \"How're you by the way?\" He let out a huff of air and leaned back so he was facing the ceiling – this wasn't the reaction I'd been expecting. He was silent for some length of time. I knew that there was something that he wanted to get off his chest but he was struggling with whether or not to tell me. It made me get up from FDR's desk and perch on the edge of his. \"FDR's dating Lauren.\" he said in a monotone. Lauren? I scrolled through the names of Tuck's ex's in my head; it was a short list but held no Lauren's. \"Who's Lauren?\" \"The girl I had a date with yesterday.\" Ah. Wait, what? \"I didn't know FDR had a girlfriend, are you sure they're dating?\" I questioned. \"They met at the video store after our date.\" I hated how emotionless he was being. \"And you're sure she agreed to go on a date with him? You know what he's like!\" I said. \"Yes.\" he almost snapped. \"We have a 'Gentleman's Agreement'.\" he told me cynically. \"That, you know, would require Franklin to actually be a gentleman.\" I said hoping to make him smile. The best I got was a small twitch from the left side of his mouth. \"So what's this agreement?\" \"Simple: we don't tell her that we know each other; we stay out of each other's way; no hanky-panky and if it affects us then we walk away.\" he listed. \"Would you like me to point out the flaws in this plan? Namely that it's already affecting your friendship.\" I said incredulously. \"It is not!\" he retorted. \"And when she finds out?\" I said. \"She won't!\" \"What about Joe?\" I persisted. He opened his mouth to reply but paused to think before asking \"What about him?\" in confusion. \"What if – not this whole thing but just dating Laura-\" \"Lauren!\" he interrupted. \"Sorry! What if dating Lauren affects your relationship with Joe?\" I asked gently. \"It. Won't!\" he ground out as he sat up to look at me. \"Please, just promise me that if it does you'll walk away.\" I said seriously – family was vital to me. Sensing my distress Tuck's features softened. \"I'll walk away.\" he vowed. \"Thank you.\" I all but sighed. He gave me another smile that did peculiar things to my insides and glanced at his screen, looking guiltily back at me. \"I'll let you get some work done.\" I laughed. \"But we're still on for the carnival tonight, right?\" \"Oh.\" The smile glided off my face and was replaced by a look of confusion – guilt covered his. \"I uh…I'm working tonight: Collins wants a lot of paperwork done for tomorrow.\" I have no training in profiling or micro expressions but I knew he was leaving something out. Trying my best not to look as dejected as I felt I said \"It's cool. I know you had some surprise worked out but…it's fine, really. We can go another time or I'll just go by myself.\" \"Don't!\" he said quickly. \"I mean, I really wanted to go with you. Can we just wait until another time?\" \"Sure.\" I said. \"I'll see you around.\" I slid off the desk and accepted the hug he offered when he stood up. I could feel how tense he was but with his head on top of mine he sighed and relaxed slightly; I tightened my arms around his waist and focused on the feeling of his heartbeat under my cheek. He smelled like he always did: pine needles, soap and just…Tuck. \"You'll be fine.\" I murmured as I pulled back reluctantly. Tuck smiled and kissed my forehead. \"Bye Jess.\" he said absently as turned to leave. \"Hey!\" Catching my wrist gently, he asked. \"What was it you wanted to talk about?\" \"It's nothing.\" I said, waving it away. TmWtMwTmWtMw At about half past six that night my phone rang. I paused the episode of Supernatural – the one about the traveling carnival – and answered. \"Have you heard from Tuck?\" FDR asked. \"Hello to you too. And no, he's got paperwork to do tonight – how'd you get outta that one?\" I joked. \"Easy,\" he replied smoothly. \"we didn't have any. We were supposed to have a movie night but he hasn't replied to my calls for the last few hours…well, the last hour and a half.\" \"Well he was busy: we were supposed to go to the carnival tonight but he had paperwork to do. He cancelled movie night this earlier week, didn't he?\" I explained. \"We've been grounded for four days, our paperwork's up-to-date. Maybe-\" he argued. \"He wouldn't lie to me!\" I interrupted stubbornly before hanging up on him. Despite my words doubt crept up on me before I could stop it. Would he lie to me? If he didn't want to go all he had to do was say…unless he didn't want to go with me . Would he take Lauren? As I made for my freezer – my new best friend it seemed – my phone began to vibrate in my pocket: I was popular tonight. My first instinct upon seeing Stuart's name was to hit 'decline' and I was about to but…I was kind of mad a Tuck now and maybe he wouldn't like me dating Stuart. \"Hello?\" I asked neutrally. \"Hey babe.\" Ugh, cringe. \"Um, hi.\" I said lamely. \"So, it's short notice but I was wonderin' if you're free tomorrow? For coffee or a movie or…?\" he trailed off to let me answer. \"Sure!\" I said too brightly. \"Em, yeah we could go see a movie.\" Hadn't I already told him I was busy? \"Great! I'll pick you up at one.\" he told me and promptly hung up. Sighing, I thunked onto a chair, letting my head fall forward to painfully connect with the kitchen table. What. An. Idiot! I thought. Then again, we wouldn't need to talk during a film…. While my anger at Tuck was still detectable I texted him: Honesty's the best policy. Deciding that a shot would do me more good than ice-cream I collected a glass and a bottle of Jack Daniels before resuming fulfilling my addiction to Dean and Sam. A good distraction, that's what I needed! Well, that and a life. Turbulence between Tuck and Jess :( I know it was short and still a bit filler-ish but the next chapter is where things start to develop, I promise. Any thoughts? Advice? Constructive criticism? Abuse? I'll take anything! Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 3] When I awoke the next morning – blessedly without a hangover – I texted Stuart to tell him I'd meet him wherever he was planning to go but he replied adamantly that he'd be at my place at one. I didn't like that (not that I told him so). I had a strict rule: no guys at my house. By guys I mean nobody I'm dating so that if anything happens I know that my home is a safe place. Stuart knowing where I lived without me even telling him set off a bump in the back of my mind that told me to be careful. A knock on the door downstairs brought me out of my brooding and a once-over in the mirror told me that I looked acceptable: hair down, chequered shirt, jeans…you get the picture. Stuart was in similar attire but I forced myself to really…look at him. His hair was tied back, a sandy blonde colour and possibly in need of a wash. He was tall (6'3\" maybe) and leaning heavily towards being too thin with handsome features overall; his murky green eyes and months' worth of stubble weren't to my taste though. I gave myself brownie points for not cringing away when his unshaven face scratched my cheek as he kissed it. \"How did you know my address?\" I asked as I locked the door and followed him to his car. \"I know lots of things.\" he replied with a wink as we got in. The Avengers: Assemble at the Fiesta Twin Theatre was our choice – I'd seen it with Tuck and FDR but had no qualms about watching it again! – and everything was fine until about half way through. He clumsily executed the clichéd yawn-and-stretch to put his arm around the back of my seat. I let this slide. When it curled around my shoulder, I took a deep breath and bared it – this was my fault and Karma was nothing if not fair. As we left he took my hand in his too-warm, clammy one but luckily the couple in front of us stopped abruptly so I dodged the other way and slipped my hands into my pockets. My reasons for not wanting any more contact with Stuart were mockingly coming back to me: awkward silence, general creepiness… \"Wanna grab a coffee?\" he questioned when we were back in his car – it could have used a wash and clean out but maybe I was being overly critical. \"Actually I have a lot of stuff I need to get done, sorry. Could you maybe drop me back at my place?\" My answer seemed to irritate him somewhat but he made no verbal complaints as we drove away in silence. I ignored my phone when it vibrated to tell me I had a text and ten minutes later Stuart was switching off the engine and turning in my direction, obviously waiting for me to say something. \"Look Stuart, I had a nice time and all but I domtfin-\" I started but my words were smothered by his lips. They felt foreign against my own, like cool slugs trying to merge with my face. He was moving his head in small circles in front of mine creating a bizarre sensation as he forced his hand into my hair. Utterly perplexed, it was quite a few un-enjoyable moments before I could bring my hands up to shove him away. \"Don't!\" I burst out before I thought it through. \"I was trying to say that I don't think this will work: I didn't the first time we went out but I thought I'd give you the benefit of the doubt. You just proved why I was wrong! God, just leave me alone, please.\" As I strode towards my front door I heard a car door slam and footsteps following me. Reaching for my phone, I didn't have time to do anything before a strong hand grabbed my upper arm and dragged me to face its owner. \"You played me!\" Stuart accused. Anger and mortification had morphed his usually-hansom face into something quite grotesque; it reminded me of a hairy gargoyle. \"I-I didn't I-\" Trying to defend myself vocally wasn't working because I was so damned confused by his personality change so I did the only other thing a girl can do: I introduced my knee to his crotch. He produced a satisfying cough/groan/splutter sound that I had no time to revel in because I had noticed a fundamental flaw in my plan: he still had a hold of my arm. As I struggled to release his grip he gathered his senses. One look at his face as he straightened up told me what was going to happen next; his right fist, complete with some sort of fraternity ring, slammed into my face just below my eye. The impact caused tears to cloud my vision and the pain registered somewhere but he had let go of me so I managed to avert a fall and propel myself towards the house, unlocking my phone and attempting to call FDR all the while. When I realised that my door was still locked and nowhere near as easy to unlock as my phone I focused hit hitting 'call' and turned to face my attacker with my back to the door and my phone to my ear. This made Stuart pause. \"Hey FDR, you busy at the moment?\" I forced a normal tone when my brother answered; Stuart began backing off. \"Em…no not just now, why? What's up?\" he asked distractedly. \"Jessie?\" I hadn't answered as I'd been watching Stuart drive away. Letting out a breath I said \"Nothing, I'd just heard about this whole Lauren thing and wanted to chew you out about it. It can wait though, I gotta go.\" I hung up and quickly locked myself inside my house. Three shots of Jäger later I ventured close enough to a mirror to inspect the damage. A rough circle had been cut lightly into my cheekbone only a couple of centimetres from my left eye and I could see through my foundation that a bruise was beginning to appear. My goal until it left: avoid Tuck and FDR. My goal for the moment: ice. TmWtMwTmWtMw Avoiding FDR proved an easy task (I think he was rather focused on this Lauren chick) but Tuck was more of a challenge: the text in the car had been from him, asking what I'd meant. I'd childishly not answered and spent Sunday lazing about and planning excuses for my face and avoiding the cause of it. I came up with this: \"My eye? Oh god I feel like suck a klutz! I tripped over my shoes that I'd left in the hall and caught my eye on the door handle. Seriously! I was so mortified but laughing at myself at the same time. I'm such a spaz, really!\" I had the week off from Mission hospital so a proper excuse could wait until I felt more creative because the tripping explanation was paper-thin at best. I was , however, working at the CIA on Tuesday and those guys knew a punch when they saw one. I decided on my way there that morning to just tell them the truth; my bruise was changing from blue to brown so it was impossible to conceal anyway. \"Who did that ?\" my supervisor, Gemma, asked the minute I emerged from the changing room. She looked impeccable as usual: her dark skin and hair (which was perfectly done) contrasting with her white coat and her ever-present smile enough to make most men weak at the knees. \"A guy I work with at Mission.\" I grumbled. \"And you got Tuck and FDR to kick his ass, right?\" she said in astonishment – my association with them was common knowledge around there. \"Get us to kick whose arse?\" I heard before I could answer. \"Thanks!\" I whispered darkly to my friend as I turned to face another. He had some dried blood on the left side of his face but seemed more concerned about scanning mine so I looked pointedly down and to the left, indicating the bruise. He closed the gap between us to get a better look. \"What happened?\" Tuck asked quietly as his fingers ghosted over my cheekbone. I shrugged him off and took a step back if only to have space to think and breathe: two things it seemed I couldn't do when he was that close. \"It's a long story that ended with him leaving.\" I said coolly. \"I've got time.\" he argued. \"Yeah, for Lauren. But whatever, I don't: I'm working.\" I snapped and turned to leave. When he caught my upper arm I flinched and inhaled even though his grip was soft; he released me immediately but I turned to face him. He pointed to his injury though his worry for me was very clearly showing. I rolled my eyes and nodded towards a curtained-off room, heading to the filing cabinet to get his records. \"What is it this time?\" I asked when I returned. \"A bump on the head and my shoulder isn't right.\" \"You did this yesterday!\" I accused. \"Why are you only being looked at now?\" \"I had recon' work to do.\" he defended but when I raised my eyebrows and he added guiltily \"at Lauren's.\" \"You bugged your girlfriend's house ?\" I said incredulously, forgetting that he was a patient at the moment. \"What's wrong with being British?\" he asked, changing the subject. \"Nothing,\" I said caught off-guard. \"But I went to two boarding schools and a university in Scotland so I can't judge. Why?\" \"True.\" he said absently. \"Just something Lauren said. Anyway, what happened ?\" he repeated and I knew what he was asking. I didn't think I'd like Lauren when I met her. Helping him take off his shirt, I began to explain my situation but avoided telling him exactly who Stuart was. I slipped my right arm out of my white coat at one point to show him the bruise there and he remained patiently quiet during my monologue. \"Why did you even agree to a second date?\" he asked when I finished, his frustration was just beneath the surface of his words. Luckily I had my back to him at that point so he didn't see me cringe – I had really been hoping that he wouldn't ask that question. I stopped writing and said quietly \"You lied to me.\" \"When?\" he said, matching my volume. Lacking the willpower to turn around, I continued with my back to him. \"You didn't have any paperwork; you took Lauren to the carnival.\" \"Jess I-\" \"Don't!\" I interrupted. \"Don't lie to me again or make crappy excuses! We promised we wouldn't lie to each other! Nine years on and I haven't once lied to you.\" \"I didn't mean to Jess.\" he said calmly. I let out a strangely choked laugh and, while shaking my head, bit my lip. \"You'll heal fine if you rest.\" I told him and walked out. Tuck called after me but the main doors were thrown open and an agent with her left arm all but hanging off was supported in, saving me from him. I resolved that when things with Lauren had played out I'd talk it out with him, not before. TmWtMwTmWtMw I'd avoided Tuck and FDR's attempts to contact me for a couple of days. When I'd been at work on Wednesday, Gemma – who was dating Boyles, a guy on \"Team Tuck\" – told me the latest gossip about some paintball fiasco involving Tuck and that FDR had adopted a dog (he wasn't exactly an animal person). I listened as little as possible. They had made that bloody agreement and it was lying in ruins! On Friday I'd been called into Mission hospital for a few hours and as I was about to leave something uncommon happened: my phone rang. \"Hello?\" I asked, my phone trapped between my shoulder and my ear as I noised around in my purse. \"Hey Jessie.\" the young voice answered which made me immediately devote all my attention to the phone. \"Joe, what's wrong?\" He never called me during the day and his voice was too controlled. \"I was wondering if…. If you're not busy then…. Could you…\" \"Joey what is it?\" I asked gently. \"Dad forgot me.\" he mumbled. \"I'm at school; he was supposed to pick me up and if I called mom then she'd be mad at him so I figured if I called you then she wouldn't need to know.\" he explained. \"I'll be there in fifteen Joe, don't worry.\" I pacified. \"Thank you.\" he said quietly before hanging up. I was out of there and driving in less than a minute; seething and mad at Tuck. I was calm by the time I pulled up at the school. It took me a few minutes to find the seven-year-old a hope had been sparked that maybe his dad had remembered. Alas, I found him dejectedly sitting on the steps – the only kid still there and a teacher hovering near the door behind him. It was heart-breaking. \"Hey Joe, whaddaya know?\" I called gently. He looked up rapidly and a grin transformed his face though disappointment still lurked around his eyes. \"Hey Jane, how's the game?\" he answered as he dashed to meet me. Heading back to my car after a hug, we exchanged tales of how we had been since we last came across each other. All the way to my house he kept up a constant chatter about school, home, Karate etc. and began to lose the sadness that had been clinging to him. When his homework had been done, dinner had been eaten and I had left several messages on both Tuck and FDR's phones, we settled down to watch AI: Artificial Intelligence. Joe fell asleep half an hour before the end (which was a good thing because I always cry at it!) so when everything was shut off I gently shook him awake. \"Bed time.\" I whispered as he groggily blinked at me. I guided him to the stairs and sat him down. \"I just need to close the doors.\" I explained. When you walked into my house there were doors immediately to your left and right leading to the living room and kitchen/dining room respectively. About a meter from the kitchen door the staircase began which narrowed the hall leading to the ground floor toilet and the utility room. Upstairs the first door on your right was my bedroom and the bathroom took up the top right corner of the floor with a study next to it and the spare room to the left. Once all the doors were closed I returned to Joe who was looking slightly more alert and asked \"Why d'you do that? Uncle Frank does it too.\" \"Close the doors?\" He nodded. \"When we were kids we both lived with Nana even though I went to school in Scotland. I was six, he was ten and there was a fire there. Lots of precious things got destroyed but Nana had closed the door to the dining room where all the family pictures were and they survived almost perfectly. It was a habit everyone got into after that.\" I explained as we went upstairs. He nodded and mulled it over while I helped him into the PJ's he'd brought – apparently he didn't have any at Tuck's that fit him anymore – and settled him into my spare bedroom. \"Are you too old for a kiss goodnight?\" I asked. He smiled sleepily at me and shook his head so I kissed his cheek as he snuggled under the covers, already drifting off. I readied myself for bed as I tried Tuck again and, again, got his voicemail. \"You bastard!\" I whispered-yelled. \"Your son was miserable when I picked him up from school today because you forgot him! It's Friday you utter moron ! You told me how excited you were to have Joe for the weekend then went and bloody forgot him because you are too busy competing with FDR over this Lauren ! You promised me that you wouldn't let it affect Joe! And he didn't even want to call his mum because he knew she would be pissed at you !\" I ranted. \"I swear to God that if you don't call me back the second you hear this I won't ever speak to you again. How could you do this to Joe you-\" A small beep told me that I'd run out of time. With a huff I slammed the device onto my bedside table and turned out the light. Making sure my phone was loud I closed my eyes and calmed myself down, eventually finding sleep after planning all the things I was going to yell at a certain moron. I awoke in the pitch black coughing. My eyes quickly caught a hazy orange glow creeping in through the gap below the door. Memories consumed me but one thought fought through them: get to Joe! Dun, dun, dun! Let me know how this was? Good? Bad? Too short? Too long? How's my characterisation? Is there anything you want to happen, see more of? Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 4] My bedroom door handle wasn't warm when I grabbed it. Keeping my pillow pressed against my face, I squinted to try and make out anything downstairs but flames made it an impossible task: they had consumed the front hall, crept up a quarter of the stairs and scorched the walls. Joe stirred when I slammed the door. I crouched beside him and said in a calm voice \"There's a fire downstairs. Take my phone,\" I pressed it into his palm. \"and call nine-one-one. Tell them my address and that we can't get to the door. Can you do that?\" He nodded – beautiful brown eyes widened by terror and a touch of childish excitement – and repeated everything back to me. When he had the phone to his ear I moved to the other side of the room. The carpet beneath my feet was warm from the fire below. Stored on the top shelf of the wardrobe for nostalgia's sake was a coil of rope from my climbing endeavours. Keeping one ear on Joe's steady but scared voice, I cursed in spite of myself when I looked out the window: flames were escaping from the broken lounge window and licking the wall below this one – we weren't getting out that way. Joe listened while I instructed him to keep his pillow over his mouth and nose. The fire department were on their way but I had decided that if we stayed in that room then we wouldn't make it out. With the rope over my back and Joe in front of me I tapped him on the shoulder once…twice…three times then jerked the door open. The heat had doubled in intensity and the fire had devoured its way two thirds of the way up the stairs; snakes of a brilliant orange were striking out at our feet as we propelled ourselves into the bathroom. \"Listen to me Joey,\" I began. Kneeling next to him, I started tying the rope just at his waist then looped it around both legs and secured it at his waist. \"I need you to hold on here,\" I positioned his hands in front of him. \"and not let go until your feet touch the ground.\" The window opened outwards and I lifted Joe onto the sill, kissing his forehead before retreating back a few steps. \"Hold on.\" I wrapped the other end of the rope around my foot once to secure it. \"Now lean back a bit.\" When there was enough tension I said \"Just walk down the wall Joe. You'll be okay, I've got you.\" The heat from the hall had melted any excitement from his face; he was close to tears now. \"Jessie.\" he cried, his chin quivering as his shoulders slipped out of my view. \"You'll be fine.\" I soothed. It took three-hundred-and-seventy-six seconds for Joe to reach the ground. With every minute my right hand became more raw and numb. Each second added heat and noise from the fire to the room. And the next moment always brought further certainty that I was going to die. I was coughing so hard that keeping a grip on the rope became a laborious task. Joe wouldn't be able to undo the knot I'd tied so climbing out was my only option and I knew I wouldn't be able to. I manoeuvred myself onto the counter and threw the rope down so Joe could move away. \"Stand as far away…from the…from the house as you can.\" I shouted down to him between coughs. \"Use the phone to…call your dad – if he doesn't answer try Uncle…Frank – and tell him what's…going…on!\" \"Okay!\" he called back and I saw his figure retreat by the light from downstairs. The cool night air didn't do much to abate the effect the smoke was having on me and it was difficult to get any as smoke was heading out the open window and contaminating it. I tried to gage the distance between the window and the ground to work out if I could lower myself down but thinking was becoming harder. Distant sirens sounded as Joe shouted up to me \"They didn't answer!\" in a distraught voice. \"Help is…coming Joe. Go to the…front of the…the house.\" The bathroom was indistinct now; smoke was pouring in from the gap above the door that I'd always put off fixing. I couldn't take two breaths without coughing and my head lolled to the side: I no longer had the strength to hold it up. I think I remember hearing Joe shouting before deeper male voices joined in but then nothing. TmWtMwTmWtMw Blue and red flashes decorated my vision. Everything sounded fuzzy. Something uncomfortable was covering my mouth and nose and a rough blanket covered my body. When I found the motivation to open my eyes I found a low ceiling above me with cupboards covering the wall. My observation only made it that far because a mass of blonde hair interrupted me. \"You're awake!\" Joe exclaimed in relief and excitement. I could only nod as he hugged me. A paramedic interjected at that point; she made me drink nearly two litres of water as she checked me over. The whole time I watched the fire crews bring the last of the blaze under control. The hazy sky was being touched by dawn and a light spray of rain was falling. I vacated the gurney when I was given the all clear – if I had any trouble breathing I was to go straight to hospital – and settled Joe on it, making him as comfortable as possible so he was soon asleep. Lyn, the paramedic, promised to keep an eye on him as I wandered towards what used to be my home. Both lower front windows were smashed and had thick layers of soot surrounding them which headed upwards. The door was the worst. Now open, it was like a black hole. I couldn't make out anything inside; not the stairs or the hall or the window at the end. A fireman warned me to keep back and I numbly nodded, wrapping my arms around myself after wiping away a tear that had escaped. \"Jess? Jess!\" I turned in time to make out Tuck's face before his shoulder was all I could see. \"What happened? I had an alert put of your address ages ago and when I got a call…\" he trailed off and hugged me tighter but I shoved him away. \"Where the hell where you?\" I demanded. Unfortunately I sounded a lot less aggressive than I had intended to due to my hoarse voice but I continued anyway. \"Where have you been for over twelve hours that you couldn't check your phone?\" \"I…the fire was less than an hour ago. What are you talking about?\" he said perplexed. Instead of answering him I grabbed his shoulder and turned him to face the ambulance. \"Your son. It's Friday…was Friday, you were supposed to pick him up from school! He could have been killed. Where have you been ?\" \"No.\" he breathed. \"That was today: after my date with Lauren I was going to…\" he rubbed his palm over his face. \"but the apartment was flooded so I cancelled yesterday and…oh God, Joe.\" Damn my feelings for him but my anger melted away. As I drew in a breath to say something comforting someone else shouted my name. \"Jessie, I'm so sorry I got here so late, I was…busy. What happened?\" FDR said quickly as he hugged me. \"A tranqu' dart, really Tuck?\" he hissed over my shoulder. \"Wait, what?\" I rasped, pushing him away. It didn't take them long to shamefully admit the events of the last couple of days. \"What the…hell has gotten into the pair of you? Never mind, it's bloody Lauren.\" I said with contempt. \"Do you have any idea how much this has affected the people around you? Do you see the damage this whole thing has done in in less than two weeks? It's like you don't care about anything anymore except who wins Lauren.\" \"Jessie you know how much you mean to me!\" FDR insisted. \"You're my little sister; we're the orphans that stick together.\" My laugh – more of a sob if truth be told – turned into a coughing fit and I waved the guys away when the both took steps towards me. \"My parents didn't die you idiot!\" I snapped. Upon reflection, this was a really bad way to tell them the truth. \"They left me! Nana told me when I turned twenty-one. I'm not an orphan FDR, I'm just unwanted. I was born in Scotland, they were young…\" Another coughing fit shook me. \"They won the damn lottery and decided they wanted to travel rather than raise a kid so they…they left me with Nana and Grandpa with the paperwork sorted, the money to raise me and instructions for schools and stuff and took off! They haven't heard from them since. Your parents loved you FDR - you know that. You got to meet them, to know them; mine jumped at the first opportunity to get rid of me.\" They took some time to process what I'd said and a realisation dawned on Tuck. \"When you turned twenty-one?\" I nodded. \"And you ran away to Scotland so your Nana phoned me and had me track you down. God, we never did figure out why you left.\" He ran his hand over his face – pain was written there and I could tell that he wanted to say something more or to hug and comfort me. I'd be lying if I say I didn't want that just as much. \"Jessie-\" FDR started but I shook my head. \"No! I'm done with both of you! You knew how much I depended on you both for stability and you lose your heads over a woman. You let it corrode your friendship and you ,\" I pointed at Tuck. \"let Joe suffer for it. I'm through with it all…I'm just through.\" As I walked passed them Tuck called after me, \"Jess, where are you going to stay?\" \"Grandpa's coming down to pick me up: he actually answers his phone.\" I told them without turning round. Seeing that Joe was still asleep I walked around the ambulance and sank down onto the sidewalk. With tears of loss, abandonment and self-pity streaming down my face I sat in the rain until the old beige car showed up. Nana didn't talk to guys but came straight over to me. Clinging to her like I used to when I was a kid, I let her bundle me into the car. I couldn't bring myself to look out the window and see the two men watching us drive away. The only thing I was sure of was that I'd never felt as alone and helpless since I was twenty-one: staying in a youth hostel in Scotland after finding out that my parents had abandoned me. But back then Tuck had found me, he'd saved me; this time he was the reason my heart was in tatters. Sorry this one was so short. As always: R ead, enjoy and…review? Much love, apologies and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 5] A light breeze brushed gently against my face, cooling the tear stains on my cheeks. My right leg, tucked underneath me for comfort, began to protest the lack of blood flow so I set it free and enjoyed the familiar tingle of pins and needles as the circulation was restored. It was late afternoon but the winter sun was already beginning to set, painting the sky a soft pink. The rain from earlier had created a mirror on the old paved streets giving the whole scene a delicate blush. Buildings that had been standing for centuries loomed around me in silent understanding and comfort while the people of my favourite city rushed towards their destinations with a tenacity driven by the cold. Having never been particularly religious, it's a surprise that sitting opposite the St. Giles Cathedral always brought a tremendous amount of comfort to me. Then again, I'd always loved architecture and craftsmanship in any building. I watched as the evening sun played on the stained glass windows and hid in the contours of the delicately carved stone that encased them. The massive building had so many features that I never tired of staring at it. \"They sure don't make them like this anymore.\" an Englishman said quietly as he sat next to me on the wooden bench. \"They do not.\" I agreed, lost in a particularly pleasing curve above a small set of doors. \"You could spend all the time you wanted looking at the architecture in this city and never have enough; you could get lost in it.\" \"Clearly I didn't do a good enough job of the lost part.\" I sighed. I'd been content to ignore how familiar his voice sounded when he'd joined me but his second remark had hit too close to home for my blissful ignorance to stick around. \"How'd you find me?\" I asked. \"I'm a spy, darling.\" he replied. I let out a breath of air that was either a scoff or a laugh, maybe both. \"We sat here – on the Royal Mile – four years ago when you were homesick. We sit here every time I visit you. If there was one place you'd be in Edinburgh, Jess, it's here.\" Tuck amended. \"Are you okay?\" That time I did laugh. I shook my head and rubbed my hands together for warmth and to buy time. \"No.\" I said honestly. \"I'm getting there but…I just need to get some things straight in my head. It's figuring out what to do with what you know, you know? I can think here, it's peaceful.\" I explained. Knowing it was a bad idea to push the subject, Tuck settled back against the bench and let silence dance between us. \"FDR called you?\" I asked after a while. \"It was your Nana actually. She knew I was over here for a while and thought I'd be the best person to find you. She's worried, Jess, we all are.\" \"I'll be fine, I'm always fine.\" I insisted quietly. Tuck leaned forward and clasped his gloved hands lightly. \"I know, but what happened to make you…not fine?\" Tuck prompted. \"I can't talk about it yet, Tuck. I'm not ready.\" I told him. \"Will you look at me any time soon?\" he asked. Reluctantly, I pulled my gaze away from the ample distractions in front of me and made eye-contact with my best friend. Light stubble covered his chin and jaw and disappeared beneath the upturned collar of his grey jacket. \"Feeling the cold?\" I asked lightly. \"Ha ha.\" Tuck drew out sarcastically. Content to let me change the subject he asked: \"Where are you staying?\" \"A youth hostel in Grassmarket.\" I told him. \"It's ten minutes away.\" \"Come on,\" he said as he stood up. \"we're going to get your stuff then you're getting on a train with me back down to London. You can stay until can't stand me or are ready to go home. How does that sound?\" If anyone could help me work through what Nana had just told me – about my parents leaving me and still being alive – it was Tuck. Things seemed to shift into perspective better when he was around. \"Sure, why not?\" END FLASHBACK I was breathing slowly. The cloudless day allowed the sun to stroll through the window and settle on my faded jeans, warming my legs pleasantly. Lying on my bed at Nana's house on the Sunday after the fire, I let tears negotiate random paths down towards my ears. The discomfort it brought – namely the uncomfortable tingling behind my nose – mixed with the trouble I was still having with my breathing brought my mood to rock-bottom. Grandpa and Nana had made a few arrangements to secure my house and assured me that the damage wasn't as bad as it had looked. Tuck and FDR were both respecting my want for them to stay away although I knew that FDR was visiting today with Lauren. I was planning to stay in my room to avoid the likely scenario of me slapping Lauren so hard it'd leave a permanent mark. Nana didn't know how stupid the boys were being and it wasn't my place to tell her. The doorbell rang downstairs and caused my emotions to well up again. For as long as I could remember, whenever I was upset or hurt I had always called either Tuck or FDR to comfort me; now FDR was just downstairs and not rushing to him was causing me almost physical pain. A sob escaped my mouth and I began to cough. When FDR swiftly but cautiously opened my door I was sitting on the edge of my bed finishing off a coughing spree. \"You okay?\" he asked without thought. My only response was to glare at him as I stood up to go the bathroom to get a drink. FDR didn't move out of my way. Instead, he offered me the glass of water he was holding and gave me a pointed look. Despite the fact I was still mad at him I took the water and eagerly sipped it so I didn't start choking. \"Shouldn't you have stopped coughing by now?\" he asked softly. \"I'm the doctor, remember?\" I said sharply and headed back over to my bed and sat down. \"It can take a while for the lungs to clear.\" After I place the water on the nightstand I tucked my right leg underneath me and leaned back against the wall. I was planning to head to the hospital the next day just to get a second opinion. With a sigh, FDR came and sat next to me. \"Nana's pissed at me.\" he admitted. He pinched the bridge of his nose as I said quietly: \"You're bringing her here – to the place where we were raised – just to win some stupid rivalry with Tuck; the man who was your best friend in the world. Do you have any idea how disgusting that is?\" \"I know that's what you think Jessie,\" he began. \"but I really care about her. Do you really think I'd bring her here – to Nana – if I wasn't serious? Hell, I might even love her but I'm not sure yet.\" In a way it sounded like he was talking to himself. I didn't think he was that heartless but couldn't find the words to say it. \"You should get back to her.\" I told him. Chuckling, he said \"Nana's showing her around and you know there's no arguing with her! I don't even wanna think about what she's telling Lauren.\" I laughed softly. FDR frowned and cleared his throat. \"The fire wasn't an accident Jessie. We're looking into Stuart Park but no one knows where he is and he hasn't been at work since the fire. I'm sorry…there aren't any leads but we'll find him, I promise.\" he said. \"Are you sure it was him?\" I asked quietly. I knew he was mad at me but trying to burn my house down? Then again, I hadn't thought he'd strike me either. \"Well, are there any other stalkers you've got on the go?\" he joked which made me laugh again and bump my shoulder against his. FDR sighed – like he was giving up on something – then shuffled over and put his arm around me. Swallowing as my throat tightened, I leaned into his embrace and hugged him as he kissed my head. \"I'm sorry for everything.\" he whispered. \"Me too, but that doesn't mean you're off the hook.\" \"…And I'm sorry about your parents.\" \"Don't be, I buried that hatchet five years ago in Scotland.\" I assured him and to avoid him asking me anything else I said \"Should we go downstairs?\" Not wanting to risk me changing my mind, he smiled and stood up; giving me a proper hug once he'd dragged me off the bed. Pulling back so he could look me squarely in the eyes like he always did when he was serious, he said quietly \"I love you sis.\" \"I love you too.\" I said. We both had the Foster eyes – clear and bright blue – which constantly remind me of the bond we shared. \"Now let's get this over with.\" \"Don't hurt her.\" he warned on our way down the stairs. \"No promises.\" I replied brightly, entering the kitchen. Outside I noticed Nana and another woman leaving the stables and heading back towards the house. Lauren's white dress and blue coat fit her nicely – her figure was fantastic and made me reasonably jealous - and her blond hair seemed to sit exactly how mine never would: perfectly. No wonder my brother and Tuck were falling over each other and themselves for her. I closed my eyes and took a steadying breath in. I was no competition for Tuck's affections. \"Hey, what's up? You're doing the lip thing.\" FDR asked worriedly. \"Nothing…I just…. She looks lovely.\" I said. He couldn't press any further because the back door opened and Nana walked in with Lauren behind her. She smiled sadly at FDR and I realised that he probably hadn't told her about his parents. \"Lauren I'd like you to meet my sister – well, cousin – but my sister Jessica. Jessie this Lauren.\" He introduced proudly. \"It is so nice to meet you.\" Lauren said. \"Likewise.\" I lied shaking her hand. \"This place is beautiful.\" Lauren said to FDR as she wrapped her arm around his waist. They continued to talk quietly and Nana came over to me. \"What's wrong Sweetheart?\" she asked in whisper. I looked at the woman who had raised me and realised that she could read me better than FDR or Tuck ever could. \"It isn't my place to tell you Nana, I'm sorry.\" \"Has it to do with whatever's going on between Franklin and Tuck?\" I studied her questioningly and it made her chuckle. \"I raised you both; I know when something's not right. Frankly hasn't mentioned Tuck once and we both know that's unusual. He sent me a message asking us not to mention him so I'm following his lead but I expect to be told sooner or later.\" \"They're both being incredibly stupid but I'll let him know that you need to be told.\" I said. She smiled at me then left to sort out lunch. I made sure the table was set and talked to my Uncle Robin, Aunt Marie and cousin Lavender for a few minutes. Lav was only five. With a brilliant stock of orange hair and smile that would break hearts in the years to come, she stood out in a crowd and got on surprisingly well with her older brother Daniel – the bucket kid. A few minutes after FDR and Lauren entered the room I heard her ask \"What's the envelope on the mantle?\" Everyone else heard her too and the room quieted. FDR looked uncomfortable and Lauren looked mortified – probably thinking it was someone's ashes or something – but Nana's soothing voice answered her question. \"We don't know. A letter – we think – written by my darling husband ten years ago.\" she explained, giving Grandpa a loving look. \"Frankly brought home his best friend for the first time – Jessie was here, and the two of us – and after a couple of hours George got up and left the room without saying anything. He came back twenty minutes later and put that sealed envelope right where you see it and said that no one was to open it until the time was right.\" \"What time is that?\" Lauren asked cautiously. \"He won't tell us!\" Nana laughed. \"But the time will come!\" Grandpa defended. \"Though right now I suggest we eat.\" Lunch was delicious and the stories of FDR's childhood were flowing freely – I was in most of them but remained quiet for the majority of the meal. I laughed at the Superman costume story and smiled fondly when Nana said \"…remember Frankly: there are no mistakes.\" Lauren and FDR didn't stay for long after that but as they were leaving he pulled me to the side and asked what I thought of her. \"She's a bitch for dating to guys at once…but she seems lovely. I can see why you're both fighting hard for her.\" I admitted grudgingly. \"I'm glad you like her.\" he said before kissing the top of my head. \"I wouldn't go that far!\" I muttered. \"Nana should know by the way, what's wrong between you and Tuck. I didn't tell her but she knows something's going on.\" FDR sighed then groaned. \"Will you tell her? I gotta go and she'll take it better from you. Plus, by Tuesday Lauren'll have made her decision.\" When I asked what he meant he briefly explained about Lauren giving herself a deadline. \"I don't like her.\" I stated. \"But I'll tell Nana what's going on.\" Choosing to ignore my first statement FDR thanked me and kissed my cheek. I said goodbye to Lauren and headed to the kitchen to help Nana with the washing up. \"She seems nice.\" Nana said while I scraped the leftover food into a bucket that would be fed to the pigs. I made a noncommittal noise and handed her the plate to stack. We continued the dishes in silence then I headed outside for some fresh air and to think. I sat on a bench that overlooked the surrounding fields and almost found it hard to believe that Los Angeles was sprawled just behind the beauty of the hills. \"What's on your mind young one?\" Nana asked as she sat next to me some time later. The sun would soon be setting and was taking the day's warmth with it. As Nana draped a blanket around my shoulders I said \"Would you trust Lauren?\" \"What a strange question.\" she chuckled. \"But if you have reason to ask it then no, I wouldn't. You've always been the best judge of character that I know.\" she told me. \"The rift between Tuck and FDR – she's causing it. She had a date with Tuck then bumped into FDR at the video store and agreed to a date with him. It didn't take them long to find out and they set ground rules and said they'd let her choose but it's torn them apart.\" I said and was surprisingly close to tears when I finished. \"And seeing Tuck fall for another woman is hurting you. Again.\" Nana added quietly. I was unable to hide the surprise on my face which made her chuckle. \"Oh Sweetheart, I've watched you watch that boy since you were sixteen years old. I saw you try to shrug it off as a childish crush and my heart broke with yours when he said his vows to Katie. Some people know when they meet someone special; others take their time to see it. Your grandpa says he fell the first moment he looked into my eyes but it took me longer to realise. Trust him, he'll see it. He'll see you.\" She wiped the tears from face but they were soon replaced by more. \"He won't Nana. I was a kid to him when we met and now I'm like a sister. He's loved Katie and now he loves Lauren. I won't make it onto that list. I'm just too…plain for him.\" I cried. \"Now you listen here!\" Nana said sternly. \"I haven't ever seen you question yourself and you will not start now; I won't hear such self-pity from you. You don't see it – few people do in themselves – but you are so beautiful and have such an amazing smile.\" she lectured. \"Your personality could use some work though.\" she added then nudged me with her shoulder. I laughed through my tears, sniffed in a very unladylike way and wiped my face. \"Sorry Nana.\" \"Don't you worry, Dear. Just wait until I see those boys though, I'm gonna smack their heads together. And then have a word with Mr Hansen about looking and actually seeing what's in front of him.\" \"Nana don't!\" I pleaded but her expression told me she'd keep my secret. \"I love you, young one.\" \"I love you too Nana.\" I told her as I leaned against her. We watched the sun set and I felt like my troubles were sinking away with it. Taking in a deep breath, I realised a weight had been lifted from my chest. As always: R ead, enjoy and…review? Much love, apologies and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 6] By Tuesday my coughing had all but gone and I was feeling a lot better about…well, everything. Nana and Grandpa had gone out to a dance class or something so I was doing what any self-respecting twenty-six-year-old single woman would be doing – watching Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café and eating popcorn. I was wearing an old pair of jeans and a hooded sweatshirt with my hair thrown up in a ponytail to keep it out-of-the-way. Just before the commercials finished Breaking News flashed across the screen and footage of a car chase currently happening was shown. The reporter was talking about the 310 freeway when the shot tightened to show a red jeep with three passengers in it. I knew all three. Lauren was driving and clearly shouting while FDR and Tuck were shooting and ducking and I didn't see much more because I ran to get my car keys. As I sped towards the city I scanned the radio stations until I found one talking about the chase. \"They appear to be shooting at the headli- they've shot the headlights and now…oh my god! The SUV is flipping towards the three…why isn't she getting out the way? The woman isn't moving…oh my, did it hit her? There has been an explosion; both the SUV and red jeep have tumbled to the busy road below bu- Wait! The smoke has cleared and all three seem to be unharmed. We're unsure of the cause of...\" She had made her choice. Lauren had chosen either my brother or the man I loved (I had come to terms with that). No new or useful information was reported as I headed towards where I assumed the 310 freeway was. As I drove, my stomach knotted at the thought of what I'd find when I got there. I wondered who Lauren had picked. Would I be happy if she chose FDR and broke Tuck's heart? Would I be able to handle seeing Tuck and Lauren get married and have kids? I wasn't sure which would be harder. Police cars had blocked the entrance of the unfinished road so an officer approached me as I pulled up. \"Miss you're not allowed up there. There's been an incident and-\" he explained but I interrupted him. \"It's my brother. FDR Foster, Agent Foster, whichever. He's my brother.\" I said as calmly as I could. \"Um…what's your name Miss?\" he asked. \"Jessica Foster.\" I said. \"Just a minute,\" he walked a few steps away and talked on his radio for a minute or two before he came back. \"You'll have you leave your car down here but you can head on up.\" he said. \"Thank you.\" I said as I got out of my car and locked it faster than I'd ever done before. The road was steep and I walked quickly which meant that when I approached the ambulances I was out of breath. A blond paramedic was examining FDR when he caught sight of me and he quickly detangled himself from her attentions. \"What're you doing here?\" he asked as he hugged me. I ignored him and asked \"How badly are you hurt?\" as my eyes scanned over him for signs of other injuries. \"Bumps and bruises.\" he shrugged. \"Tuck?\" \"Bumps and bruises.\" he repeated. \"…Lauren?\" \"Bumps and bruises.\" he sighed and his face told me all I needed to know. \"She picked you.\" I stated, not knowing if I was relived or saddened by this. \"Yeah.\" he breathed, clearly still taking in the fact. I nodded slowly and swallowed to by myself time. \"Congratulations I guess.\" I said hesitantly. \"Look Jessie, I know you don't like her but could you make an effort, for me?\" he pleaded. I sucked my lip between my teeth and bit down, frowning. \"What happened then? With all this, I mean.\" I changed the subject. FDR sighed and ran his hand over his face. \"Lauren was targeted to get back at Tuck and me for a mission a few weeks ago. I can't really talk about it Jessie.\" he apologised. I nodded and studied the side of the ambulance to my right. \"How did Tuck take it?\" I asked quietly. Sadness crossed FRD's face. \"Like the gen'leman he is.\" \"FDR?\" someone called and we turned to see Lauren nod to her left, indicating something neither of us could see. \"Give me a minute?\" he asked. At my nod FDR walked over to Lauren to see what she meant. I trailed after him and emerged from the tunnel created by the ambulances to see him approach his best friend; at least, I hoped they were still friends. I didn't pay any attention to Lauren until I heard her quietly say hi; there were so many things I wanted to say to her. As I tried to figure out where to start she asked softly \"Did you know? That they knew, I mean.\" I simply nodded. \"And you couldn't have given me a heads-up?\" she laughed. \"You didn't have the decency to tell them about each other.\" I stated. She looked a bit taken aback by my bluntness but said \"I guess I deserve that. Look, I-\" She didn't get a chance to finish whatever she was going to say because I slapped her. Hard. I would like to say that I felt guilt, even the slightest bit of remorse, but I didn't. I still don't. I raised my hand again but it was caught by one of the two men that were suddenly at our sides; FDR asking Lauren if she was okay and Tuck steering me away gently but resolutely. \"Really Jessie?\" FDR called. As I took in a breath to respond and began to turn round, Tuck tightened his hold on me and said quietly \"Just leave it.\" He walked me half way down the road then silently released his grip. I couldn't look at him. Instead I sat against the concrete wall and stared out at the LA horizon. Tuck joined me and we sat in silence as the first of the emergency service vehicles began to leave. \"Are you okay?\" I asked him eventually. \"Ah, just a few scrapes. I've had worse.\" he said. When I gave him my don't bullshit me look he continued. \"He's a good man and he'll be good to her. It was her choice.\" \"That doesn't mean you're not hurt.\" I said gently. He cleared his throat and joked \"Yeah well, we can't win 'em all, can we?\" I chewed my lip to stop myself from saying \"Tell me about it!\" \"About the fire,\" Tuck began. \"Jess...it wasn't Stuart. FDR looked at nearby security footage again and saw one of the SUVs that Heinrich was travelling in.\" I assumed he had something to do with the car chase and kept quiet. \"We think he had one of his guys track you down. I am so sorry Sweetheart. If we'd known that you were in danger we'd've-\" \"It's okay.\" I interrupted. \"I wasn't hurt and my house can be fixed.\" \"Are you still staying with your grandparents?\" he asked. \"Yeah, I've got people starting work on the house tomorrow but it'll take a while.\" I explained. \"You could stay with me.\" he offered. I went still and quiet, just looking at him. \"Or not, it was a suggestion. I have a spare room and it'd be closer to the hospital and to your place for when you're sorting it…\" He trailed off and looked at his shoes. \"Thank you,\" I said quietly. \"but no. Something was broken here Tuck and it's gonna take time to fix it. I don't even know if you remember that promise but I've never broken it – I've never lied to you – and-\" \"I remember.\" Tuck interrupted. \"You were seventeen, I was visiting you at university and when you went back to your flat you found your best friend with your boyfriend.\" He told me to prove it. \"You called me because you couldn't stay there and the thing that got to you the most was her boyfriend. You were so worked up about whether or not to tell him.\" FLASHBACK \"He needs to know!\" I said loudly with my hands in the air. \"But how do I tell him? They'll deny it and why would he believe me?\" I ranted as I continued pacing. \"But he has to know.\" I stressed. \"Oomf!\" I had collided with a twenty-one-year-old. Blue-grey eyes stared into mine until he was sure I was giving him my full attention. \"Take a breath Jess.\" he ordered softly. I inhaled slowly for four seconds then breathed out. Look at his eyes. His eyes, not his lips. Focus on his eyes. I thought. Each beat of my heart was strong and hammered the inside of my chest; I wanted to glance down to see if it looked like it did in cartoons. He was the only one who called me Jess – no one else had before and no one was allowed to now. His hands were lightly resting on my shoulders but the heat from them must have been to blame for redness creeping up my neck. \"Talk to Jen and Mark first. Tell them in no uncertain terms that Dave has to know and ask them how they want to go about it. Make it obvious that you're doing them the favour by talking with them at all. Stay cool; don't get emotional or angry about it. They're the ones that lose in this situation, remember that.\" Tuck coached me. I nodded. Say something, don't stand here like an idiot! I chastised myself. \"I'm sorry.\" \"It's alright Sweetheart.\" Tuck said with a laugh. \"Thank you for putting up with me.\" I groaned. \"Don't be silly. It's what I'm here for; it's what friends do.\" he told me. With a light tug I was in his arms and hugging him. One of his hands held my neck and the other my waist; both of mine securely wrapped round his torso. With a smile on my face, I tried to memorise the feeling of being held like this – like I was the only one who mattered. It was a genuine smile, the kind that takes over your face before you can stop it and you feel tugging on your heart strings. It didn't matter that his feelings for me were platonic; he cared for me as much as I did for him. Later that night – once the lights had been switched off and I thought Tuck had fallen asleep – I felt a tear slip down my face. Another leaked out then I couldn't stop them. I was lying as still as possible (Tuck had pointed out that we were both mature enough to share the hotel bed without getting weird) and trying my best not to sniff every other second. I bit my lip so hard that the taste buds near the front of my tongue began to pick up the salty notes from my blood. Slipping out of the bed, I retreated to the bathroom as quietly as I could. Not willing to risk or particularly wanting to switch the light on meant I sat on the cold tiles in near blackness. My thin pyjamas offered little resistance to the chilly surface so I was shivering in moments. A light tapping on the door made me jump. Tuck didn't wait for an invitation and wordlessly opened the door. A lamp was now on in the main room so light filled the small area. He lowered himself onto the floor next to me. His arm brought welcome warmth when it draped across my shoulders and slid me to his side. With my head against his neck and his on mine, we sat until I stopped crying. \"It isn't even the cheating,\" I choked out finally. \"it's just the lying . I hate people being dishonest with me. Things like this make it hard to trust anyone .\" I admitted. Tuck digested this while absently running his hand up and down my arm. \"How about we make a pact?\" he proposed. \"What if we promise never to lie to each other, about anything, ever?\" I sat up and repositioned myself to face him. I sniffed hard to clear my nose. \"Seriously?\" I asked. \"Seriously.\" To illustrate his point he spat into his right hand and offered it to me. Unable to help myself, I laughed. For half a minute he sat with his hand offered as I giggled uncontrollably. When I managed to composed myself I reluctantly followed the ritual then placed my hand in his. We shook firmly and I glanced at my hand with distaste. \"That is a very binding contract, you know.\" he said. \"Then I'll honour it faithfully.\" I said with pretend seriousness as we wiped our hands on our respective pyjama pants. \"You'll be okay Sweetheart.\" Tuck promised. Looking at him in the dim light from the other room, I nodded. \"I know.\" END FLASHBACK I was quietly stunned as he recounted the night almost perfectly. It seemed like he needed me to realise how serious he was. \"I promise Jess that is the only time I've slipped up. I didn't want you to have to take sides and thought it'd be better if you didn't know. I'll make it up to you, I swear.\" Tuck said and took my hand to emphasise his seriousness. The man sitting in front of me – the one who had been with me through everything for the past ten years; who made me smile when no one else could and supported me wholeheartedly whenever the chance came; who had kept my heart the whole time, even as others thought they were winning it – silently begged me for forgiveness. \"Okay.\" I said softly. \"Thank you.\" Tuck sighed. He leant forward and kissed my forehead. \"C'mon: I need a shower and then I have a dinner date with my best friend to start apologising, if she'll have me.\" It took me a second to realise that he meant me then I laughed and nodded. \"I suppose it would be a start.\" I said. \"Wonderful.\" he said standing up and offering me his hand. When he pulled me up we let the momentum guide me into a hug. \"I'm sorry I let you down.\" he whispered into my hair. I just nodded and hugged him tighter for a second before releasing him so he could see my reassuring smile. \"We make it through everything.\" I told him. \"Yeah, we do,\" TmWtMwTmWtMw Apparently Joe missed me. That was the thin reason for me being at his Karate lesson on Friday – I'm sure he did miss me but I think Tuck just needed an excuse to keep mending our friendship. Tuck and I had picked Joe up from school and he was so excited because his dad – who was now really cool – had taught him some moves so he \"wouldn't get creamed anymore\". When it was Joe's turn to fight – against son of the coach – I sat on the benches and crossed my fingers. He executed the move quicker than my eyes could follow and when the other kid tapped out Joe jumped up and ran straight into his dad's arm, grinning from ear to ear. \"Did you see that? Did you see that? It worked!\" he shouted. \"Of course it did.\" Tuck said. \"What did I tell you, hmm? Are you happy?\" Joe nodded vigorously. \"Right go and get your sneakers, go on.\" He put Joe down and the seven-year-old ran up to me. \"You did great.\" I told him as I helped him put his shoes on. In my peripheral vision I noticed Tuck talking with the coach who was making strange noises and seemed to be having difficulty breathing. Joe ran over to his mother and I heard the coach mutter \"...weakness…leaving the body.\" I looked to Tuck and he shrugged innocently but he couldn't quite hide his smile. It faded slightly when he saw Katie so I quickly jumped off the bench and made to leave the hall. \"I'm going to see how things are getting on at home. I'll see you later.\" I said to Tuck. \"Hi Katie.\" She nodded at me – we'd never been friends – as I walked past and headed to the bathrooms. I was walking out again when I saw Tuck leaving with Katie and Joe. I smiled sadly. Tuck put his hand on Katie's back to guide her through the door – an unconscious gesture that epitomised his gentlemanly nature – and I remembered all the times he'd done that with me. Katie's head tilted a fraction to her right and she said something that made Tuck falter for a second. Typical Katie: everything had to be on her terms. Tuck glanced at his hand in confusion and frustration before he followed her out the door. \"She just doesn't get you.\" I whispered to the empty space. As always: R ead, enjoy and…review? Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 7] In the two weeks since Tuck and Katie had decided to give it another shot I had been busy with a lot of things. I'd given my statement to the police about Stuart assaulting me when he was arrested for a similar offence against another woman from a local coffee shop. My regular shifts at Mission hospital and the CIA had started again. My house had been gutted – the ruined furniture and fabrics thrown out, the floors ripped up and one ceilings down; the stairs were taken out and the walls stripped. It was an expensive and traumatic job but it was being done and I had savings. The one thing I had to cling to was Tuck. Even as he was patching things up with Katie, he continued putting a lot of effort into making things up to me. We'd had lunch three times, dinner twice and coffee more times than I could keep track of. He – like FDR – was grounded while the CIA tracked the exposure of the car chase to see if there was any hope of them remaining covert. As a result he had time to drop by and see how my house was doing and allow me to cry on his shoulder – literally – when it got too much. \"How much is it gonna cost?\" I sighed as I ran my hand through my hair. \"We're looking at an extra one, maybe two thousand.\" The contactor told me with feigned guilt. \"Okay, fine.\" He walked back to his guys and I walked out the door. My front garden would never have won awards before the fire but I'd always kept it neat. Now a skip was sitting on the drive, the grass had been trampled mercilessly and debris was littered everywhere you looked. I picked up a pair of gloves and began gathering things to be put in the skip – very distracting and perfect if you don't particularly want to think for a short time. I didn't pay and attention to a car as it parked on the street but when the man called my name – not for the first time if his expression was anything to go by – I looked up and wiped my hair out my eyes. \"Manual labour Jess?\" he asked. He offered me one of the Starbucks cups he was holding – though I'd have preferred a cool bottle of water at that point – so I pulled off the gloves and thanked him. I took a sip and savoured it: strong, black, two sugars. Just how I like it. \"I've heard it's good for you but I'm not convinced.\" I joked. \"Any news from work?\" \"Not yet,\" Tuck said. \"but I reckon Collins is just dragging her feet to punish us.\" I nodded absently. \"How's the house?\" \"Expensive.\" I moaned. \"They now think one of the supporting beams isn't structurally sound and it's another couple of grand. Hooray.\" Tuck stepped forward and gave me a one-armed hug. \"Your day has been as good as mine then.\" he said lightly. I leaned back and frowned. He just said: \"Katie. Long story. How's about we grab dinner and try to salvage the day, huh?\" \"That's the best suggestion I've heard all day.\" I said with a smile. Grabbing dinner turned into heading to Tuck's and cooking spaghetti bolognaise. I joked that he just wanted to see me make a mess of myself – I maintain that there is no dignified way to eat and properly savour the dish. He told me about the hassle of drying the place out after FDR turned on the sprinklers. \"So, what happened with dear old Kates?\" I asked after a mouthful of spaghetti. Tuck rolled his eyes at my use of her most hated nickname. \"A fight,\" he said. I took a sip of wine and waited for him to elaborate. \"about everything. Me lying about my job, her hinting to her friends about the CIA, past fights we've had, groceries, sex, marriage…you name it, we fought about it.\" \"How did you guys leave it?\" I asked cautiously. \"Not well.\" He took a mouthful of wine as he thought about what to say next. \"She thinks I'm spending too much time with you. Apparently it will confuse Joe, God knows how.\" He scrubbed a hand over his face frustration. I sat my fork down. \"I've always been around, not that she's ever liked that. Why now?\" \"He…he told Katie that he didn't mind Lauren but he'd rather I married you.\" Tuck admitted. I choked on my wine and Tuck looked faintly amused. \"I'm flattered but he's seven, Tuck. He's knows me; he'd rather you married me than a stranger. Katie always cares too much about what other people will think. You're back together on her terms, I shouldn't see Joe because it might make people talk but not in the way she wants.\" Why Tuck, why her? I wanted to ask. \"I know, Jess. Believe me, I know.\" He looked pretty worn out by the conversation so we ate the rest of the meal with distracting conversation. \"Should I open another bottle?\" Tuck asked as I washed one of the pots – it had taken some convincing and tactical threats to let him let me do it. Glancing at the clock on the microwave, I hesitated. \"I should be getting back to Nana's. You'd think I was still sixteen the way she worries when I'm out late.\" I said with a sad smile. \"Then stay over.\" There was something about the way he said it – quietly and without hesitation – that made my heart beat faster. He was leaning against the counter, on the shorter stretch of the L shape it made, holding a bottle of red wine that was resting on his thigh. The soft expression on his face said that he needed company to take his mind off things and I was the only person that could do it. With his sleeves turned up and the top few buttons of his shirt undone he looked the picture of ease and indisputably sexy. I don't think I could have denied him anything at that point. \"Okay.\" I breathed. \"You open the wine, I'll let Nana know.\" If he noticed that my voice shook or that my hands did too then he didn't say anything. He just smiled. And I wondered if he knew just how my insides reacted in that moment or that the grip I had on the cloth tightened or that my thoughts had fled down paths more dirty than some of the streets in LA. I nodded at him and left the room, not realising that my hands were still covered in dishwater. After drying my hands on my jeans I pulled my phone from my bag. The best reception in Tuck's apartment was by the window so I leaned against it as I let my grandparent's know I was safe and wouldn't be back that night. The call didn't last long but I stayed by the window, enthralled by darkness that was creeping over the city below and the lights that blinked on to compensate. Movement reflected on the glass warned me of Tuck's approach and stopped my from starting when silently offered me my glass. \"I don't think I'll ever tire of this view.\" he said quietly from behind me. And I mean behind me – I could feel the heat from his body and his shirt occasionally brushed mine. \"I still miss the UK though.\" I said. \"Yeah, me too.\" he sighed. \"We should go back for New Year.\" I suggested lightly. \"There's nothing like Hogmanay in Edinburgh.\" If you're not spending it with your wife and child I added silently. \"Maybe.\" Tuck said. I felt his hand on my hip then the pressure of him kissing the back of my head before he walked over to the sofa. After a steadying breath, I joined him. We avoided heavy topics after that. He told me that Joe was excelling at Karate now and I mentioned that FDR and Lauren had been back to visit Nana and Grandpa. He didn't seem too upset about that. The hours ticked by until one o'clock when we decided that bed was a better idea than another bottle. Even a good meal wasn't enough to ward off the effects of a whole bottle of wine so I swayed slightly as we stood up. Tuck laughed and we made a show of steadying each other on our way to the bathroom. Tuck went to change and get me a t-shirt as I went through my nightly routine. He reappeared as I stepped into corridor. He was shirtless. I couldn't think. Somewhere, the rational part of me was saying that I was a doctor and used to seeing shirtless men and I'd seen him shirtless before but my goodness he was hot. Swallowing thickly, I muttered a \"thanks\" when he held out the dark green t-shirt. It was difficult to stop the onslaught of memories of every time I'd seen him wear it. Completely forgetting to say goodnight, I headed to his spare bedroom to avoid blatantly staring at his shirtless form. I pulled my top – now with a lovely red stain from the spaghetti sauce – over my head and threw it on the floor. It was followed quickly by my jeans and socks before I pulled Tuck's t-shirt on. I kind of hated that it smelled like him. Or maybe I disliked how many times I had imagined myself wearing something like this. In a vain attempt to distract myself from the smell I shook my hair down then re-tied it. Where's my phone? I wondered. Table! Quietly opening the door, I padded through to the living room and spotted what I was looking for. When I turned to head back to my room Tuck was standing there. Still shirtless. Now staring. The wine clearly had an effect on his subtlety because he didn't even try to hide the fact that his gaze lingered on my bare legs, then his shirt, then my face. Heat crept up my neck and stained my face. \"My, uh, phone.\" I said lamely. I held it up as if to prove my intentions and this seemed to bring Tuck back to reality. \"Sorry, um…yeah.\" he faltered. \"What is it with guys seeing women in their shirts?\" I laughed, trying to ease the tension. His face darkened slightly and embarrassment covered his face. Then confusion. \"You've worn another man's shirt before then?\" he said. It almost sounded like a light-hearted jib. Almost. I could hear the strain just under his words and it irritated me quicker than it should have. Alcohol; damn you alcohol. \"I'm not the innocent virgin you met ten years ago.\" I said with the same faked lightness and a teasing grin. He tried to laugh and to his credit it sounded pretty real. He shook his head and said: \"On that note…\" before walking over to hug me. His bare skin was warm on my cheek and arms as we hugged. With my eyes closed I focused on his hands – one wrapped around my waist, the other my shoulders – and the exhalation of his breath on my neck. I don't think I had ever had this much contact with his skin and it was definitely the first time he had seen me less than fully clothed. \"G'night Tuck.\" I whispered as we pulled apart. \"See you tomorrow Sweetheart.\" I walked down the short hall past the bathroom to the spare room. As I settled into bed and turned out the light I wondered if my feelings for him would ever go away... TmWtMwTmWtMw The fire was painfully hot as it struck out at my feet. None of the doors on the landing would open so I was trapped in the corner as the fire stalked towards me. I tried to slow my breathing and brace myself against the wall because the floor seemed to be sloping down towards the fire. The smoke burned my eyes but didn't hinder my breathing. It seemed to whisper my name. The fire crept closer. The angle of the corner behind me slowly decreased, forcing me towards the flames. A tendril of fire struck out and curled around my ankle, branding me but not letting go. It began to pull me in; to pull me closer to the inferno, it was calling my name. \"Jess it's just a dream.\" I sat up quickly and Tuck's reflexes saved us both from a collision. \"You're alright. Whatever it was, it wasn't real.\" he soothed while he rubbed my arms. \"It's not like you to have nightmares.\" Tuck observed with concern. \"Since the fire.\" I said. My mind was a bit confused still but I was breathing normally. \"They started after the fire.\" I explained. Tuck drew me into a hug and rubbed my back as I rested my head on his shoulder. We stayed like that for a while with neither of us saying anything. \"Would you like me to stay?\" he offered. \"No, it's okay.\" I said. \"It might take me a while to sleep again and I'll be restless until then.\" He withdrew from the hug and looked at me seriously. \"Would you sleep better if I was here?\" he asked. I just shrugged. The answer was yes but I didn't want him to feel obligated to stay. He kissed my forehead and stood up. I though he was going to leave so I smiled at him in thanks but he walked around the queen sized bed and pulled back the sheet. Once he was under the covers I switched off the bedside lamp, swallowed lightly and laid back down. I wasn't sure what to do so I stayed stock still for about a minute before his chuckle broke the silence. \"I won't bite y'know.\" he said. I laughed and relaxed and focused on my vision adjusting to the darkness. I could make Tuck out relatively clearly and realised he was looking at me. \"C'mere Sweetheart.\" he said gently. He lifted his arm slightly and I shuffled over and rested my head against his shoulder. His arm settled on my waist and he brushed his thumb back and forth in a soothing gesture. Nestling into him, I focused on every point of contact between us from my cheek down to our feet. To me it felt right or at least it sure as hell didn't feel wrong. \"Thank you.\" I whispered. \"Anytime, Jess.\" he breathed back. Read, enjoy and…review? Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 8] The hypnagogic state is the medical term for the place you are when you're not quite asleep but not awake yet either. Dreams and reality combine - what you hear might just be in your head; a touch merely your mind playing games. If you're used to sleeping alone but find yourself sharing a bed, the foreign movement of another person can bring you to this very place. Just like it did to me. My arm wasn't comfortable. For as long as possible I dozed and ignored the slight protest from my arm about being trapped underneath me at such an awkward angle. I chatted with my brother and a strange redheaded woman about the reliability of picture frames (very unreliable and scarcely polite!) and took a convoluted walk through both Edinburgh and LA. I realised that something wasn't right. I shifted from my left side onto my back then onto my other side. The streets solidified around me again as I sat in the LA sunshine admiring the St. Giles Cathedral. It seemed perfectly natural to me. A hand lightly brushed up and down my left arm so I closed my eyes to savour the feeling. A content sigh slipped from me and I smiled, enjoying the warm sunshine on my skin. Was I lying down? Something soft pressed against my forehead while I tried to think about where I was. As the footsteps of the people around me began to fade, foreign movement brought me to the brink of being awake and I slowly opened my eyes in time to see Tuck close the door behind him. Maybe I was dreaming. Maybe I needed more dreaming. The bed was still warm where he had been so I shuffled forward and closed my eyes as the warmth of the bed lulled me back to sleep. TmWtMwTmWtMw Waking up in an unfamiliar bed is disconcerting. With a dry mouth and a stiff neck, I squirmed and stretched as I recalled the previous night and my unreliable memory from the morning. Had Tuck ran his hand over my arm as he watched me sleep? I stopped mid-stretch to consider this. I could distinctly remember the light brushing of skin against my own. No. No, he wouldn't have. Even if he did it would have been in a brotherly, friendly, platonic kind of way. Definitely. And the kiss he placed on my forehead was like that too. For sure. I was sure. Maybe. I really needed water. I slid my jeans on and rolled my neck and shoulders. A yawn escaped me as I padded down the short corridor to the main expanse of Tuck's apartment. When I removed my hand from my face I could detect the lingering smells of coffee and toast in the air. I couldn't see Tuck but one of the drawers in his tool cabinet had been left open so I figured he wouldn't be away for long. I headed to the kitchen, helped myself to a glass and filled it with water. Leaning against the counter, I took a sip and swirled it around my mouth to refresh myself. The water was pleasantly cold and I could feel it travelling down my throat into my stomach. It sent a shiver through my body. As I refilled my glass I heard the familiar metallic scrape of a key in a lock. I watched Tuck slip through the door and fully depress the handle so it wouldn't slam when he closed it. It made me smile. He made me smile. Contrary to his actions, he didn't startle at the sight of me in his kitchen. I became conscious of the fact I'd forgotten to put my bra back on and as a result I greeted him with a slightly forced smile. \"Hello love, how'd you sleep?\" Tuck asked; his voice gentle and warm. \"Pretty well, thanks. No more nightmares.\" I reported with a genuine smile. \"I'm glad.\" He met me at the entrance to the kitchen area and moved straight in for a hug. Have I mentioned before how good Tuck Hansen is a giving hugs? For a start, he is very fit – not to mention strong – so it's a proper tight hug (though not crushing) with one arm securely around my waist, the other my shoulders. This means that every soft inch of me is flush against every toned inch of him. These hugs drive my hormones crazy. He always rests his cheek against my head and often lets out what I take to be a contented sigh. He's warm and his t-shirts (or shirts) always impossibly soft. With a scent as intoxicating as his it's a wonder I ever manage to let go. It seemed like I didn't need to worry about that last point though: Tuck was in no hurry to release me either. We stood in a tight embrace for longer and longer. I readjusted my head so my chin was further up his shoulder and I could reach cooler, fresher air. He kissed my head, I kissed his shoulder. His hand was running up and down my back so he had no illusions about my state of undress. I felt my pulse slowly gain momentum and I used a lot of my concentration to keep my hands from exploring his back…and more. \"I've been thinking….\" Tuck began. When he didn't say anything for a few seconds I felt the need to say \"Uh-oh!\" in a light tone to put him at ease. He chuckled softly so probably missed me swallowing thickly. What had he been thinking? Was it about Katie, had he decided it wasn't worth another shot? Did he think he should have fought harder for Lauren? Was it about me ? \"Jess, I think we could find your parents.\" he said. My back tensed. My entire body tensed. My breathing slowed and I focused all my attention on the corner of the television. I didn't need to think about what he'd said. I wasn't going to think about what he'd said. I wasn't going to think about the thudding of my heart or the bands that had constricted around my stomach. I wasn't going to think. \"Jess, Sweetheart, say something.\" Tuck coaxed. I shook my head. He sighed. \"It's been almost twenty-six years, Tuck. Why would they want to see me now? They know where I've been; how to get in touch.\" I said and hated that my voice shook. \"This isn't about them, Jess.\" he told me. \"This is about you: finding answers, getting closure, knowing where you came from. If you want that, I might be able help you get it.\" How could he make everything sound so simple? Like we could just find an address, swan up to their front door and demand answers. Who knew where they were? They were probably on some exclusive island, on a beach with barely a notion of the baby they'd once left or the woman she's turned into. I didn't need to see how well their lives had developed without me. I told Tuck as much which made him sigh again and pull back to look at me. He studied me silently for a long time. Doing my best not to get embarrassed by his scrutiny, I raised my eyebrows in a feeble attempt at a challenge. He mockingly raised his back and that caused my mouth to unwillingly twitch up into a smile. \"You've turned out so…amazing Jess.\" he said quietly. \"You're unselfish, caring, smart, funny, beautiful – don't give me that look, you are . Your parents gave up the chance to know you – one of my few favourite people on the planet – and I think that's bonkers. But, Jess, it was their loss; their mistake. If you want to meet them then don't let your fears stop you.\" \"I have all the family I need.\" I told him honestly. He smiled at that so I forged on. \"I have Nana and Papa – better parents than I bet mine could have ever been. If they'd raised me in Scotland I wouldn't have FDR – a better brother than I can imagine anyone ever being.\" I took a breath and added quietly. \"And I wouldn't have you.\" I hadn't realised that Tuck's hands were still on my waist until he pulled me in for another hug. \"I know that they could be part of my future but I…I think I deserve better than that. Does that make sense?\" \"It does to me, Sweetheart.\" Tuck murmured. \"Okay, matter closed.\" he said dramatically as he held me at arm's length. Though he couldn't stop himself from adding \"But if you ever change your mind, you only need to ask.\" \"Thank you.\" I said sincerely. I thought that the moment would be over after that; that maybe he'd squeeze my shoulders and we'd move on to talk about the weather or breakfast or…well, anything. But it wasn't; he didn't move. His hands were resting lightly on my shoulders and we were smiling at each other: open, genuine, heartfelt smiles. I felt my smile tone down to an affectionate tugging of my lips but Tuck's seemed to falter and his hands tightened their grip slightly. These two tiny gestures changed the atmosphere entirely. I focused on not letting my breath catch as his eyes searched mine for something and I swallowed nervously. His right hand moved slowly from my shoulder to my neck where he let his thumb trace my jawline. I thought about how he would be able to feel my pulse racing and began to blush in spite of myself. I wanted to break eye contact, I really did, but I couldn't. Tuck took a small step closer to me. I realised that he was controlling his breathing the same way I was. My lips parted as I sucked in a breath to say something but nothing came out and all it served to do was divert Tuck's attention from my eyes to my lips. Maybe I was still dreaming. I thought about pinching myself but somehow couldn't move enough to do it; I settled for digging my fingernail into my thumb. Real. It was all real. Tuck's eyes slid back up to mine and I knew what he was looking for this time: reluctance. I was certain he wouldn't find any. There was a moment – a blissfully fantastic moment – when he began to move his head towards mine. My heart was thudding almost painfully in my chest and I held my breath. Tuck broke our eye contact to look towards my lips. My eyes wanted to close but I kept them open. Then the noise interrupted. Someone wriggled a key into the lock of Tuck's apartment door and we pulled back from each other. Tuck – clearly not expecting anyone – moved me behind him and tensely watched the door. I turned my back to him, put my hands on the counter to steady myself and let out a quiet but shaky breath. Closing my eyes, I took several deep breaths to stop any tears from falling – I would not cry over this. As the door opened, I picked up my glass of water and took a long swig. Tuck sighed as he recognised the person but when he said their name, waves of sadness and guilt washed over me with such force that I had to squeeze my eyes shut again. \"Katie, what're you doing here?\" Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 9] \" Katie, what're you doing here?\" A long, awful silence stretched out as Katie dissected the scene in front of her and slowly drew her conclusions. A woman was in Tuck's t-shirt, at his house after clearly staying the night and (because as women we have a sixth sense about this) she was not wearing a bra. This didn't bode well. I had no doubt that when she saw I was the female in Tuck's home, she would be extremely pissed off. To try and look less guilty, I turned and gave Katie what I hoped was a neutral smile. Her eyebrows rose in poorly concealed shock but she managed to force a smile in return. \"Jessie, what a surprise to find you here.\" Not a good one if her tone was anything to go by. \"What brought on this impromptu sleepover?\" \"Nothing happened.\" Tuck ground out a bit too defensively. I shot his back a withering look and bit tongue so I wouldn't inform him that I was more than capable of answering for myself. Katie pretended to look surprised and let out a laugh. \"I didn't say anything did. How are you, Jessie?\" \"I'm fine, thank you.\" Sound nicer, sound less guilty I though. \"How're you and Joe?\" \"We're fine.\" Katie's voice was clipped and she quickly found a reason to ignore me. \"Tuck, honey, I was really hoping that we could grab breakfast and talk about yesterday. I really wanna put it behind us as soon as we can; for us and for Joe .\" Everything about that sentence made me prickle: she'd never use terms of endearment like that with Tuck – \"honey\" was for my benefit to prove he was hers; she'd probably wanted another chance to fight her side but since I was there she could let this argument blow over and she sounded too sincere, too upset by it. But the thing that annoyed me the most was that she was right – Tuck was hers. He wasn't property but there were officially making another go of being a couple and I was seconds away from being one thing I'd never wanted to be – the \"other woman\". No matter what had happened a few minutes ago, no matter the feeling that was left in my chest and how painfully right it had felt, I had no right to kiss Tuck because he was dating the mother of his child. I sucked my bottom lip between my teeth and bit down hard. \"I'm sorry, I didn't realise-\" \"I was just going anyway.\" I interrupted Tuck. Even to my own ears my voice hard and Tuck turned towards me. \"Jess, you don't have to.\" he said. His brow furrowed as he clearly tried to tell me something without saying the words. I pretended not to notice and began to edge my way to the spare room. \"It's fine, I have work to supervise at the house and then a backshift at the hospital anyway.\" I said truthfully. I knew that Tuck couldn't protest anymore without risking Katie's wrath so I slipped out of the kitchen and walked towards to spare bedroom as casually as I could. I didn't look back at him. Damn him for putting me in that position! Damn me for letting him put me in that position! But, most of all, damn Katie for interrupting our position. I made a quick escape after making the bed and fully dressing. Tuck rose from where he was sitting on the sofa – from a conversation that was straining to keep its volume down – but before he could get close enough to give me a hug, or say anything without being overheard, I said a hurried goodbye and left. I could count on one hand the number of times I had left without saying a proper goodbye to Tuck so I couldn't un-see the hurt that flashed across his face. Past experience told me that Katie would want some form of retribution for what she's just walked in on and I would take it because it would be nothing compared to her reaction if she knew the danger Joe had been in. Walking down the stairs, I sent a silent thanks to the universe for Joe's thoughtfulness and insistence that we keep her in the dark about him being at my house on the night of the fire. TmWtMwTmWtMw Two hours later I was weeding my back garden in a vain attempt to feel useful while my builders hammered and sawed and scraped in an attempt to break my house down so they could fix it up again. The day had turned out to be a warm one; the sun causing sweat to run down my face and back. I had a feeling that the back of my neck would be quite burned when I finished. A pair of expensive leather boots walked into my field of vision to startle me out of my single-minded concentration. I knew who they belonged to but even as I looked up to meet her expectant and condescending gaze, I prayed that it wouldn't be Katie standing in front of me. Why did her clothes always have to fit her perfectly and her hair never look windswept? Making slow work of taking off my gloves and standing up, I tried really hard not to feel inferior in my own back garden. With the melanin that my Scottish ancestry denied me, Katie's skin was bronzing in the sun, not burning. \"What can I do for you?\" There was no point in trying to beat about the bush. \"It's quite simple Jessica – stay away from Tuck. We've had this discussion before and I won't have it again.\" she folder her arms over her chest and waited for me to deny her implications. \"I'll tell you the same thing I told you eight years ago – we're friends. We were friends before you even came into the picture and I will not back off from it because you feel threatened.\" Katie scoffed, just like she had done the first time she's warned me away from him. \"He is my best friend; I won't let you come between us.\" \"God, you're the same naïve girl aren't you? Nearly a decade later and you're still trying to pretend you're not in love with him.\" She shook her head in disbelief. \"When will you realise, Jessie? He won't ever feel that way about you. You were a child when you met and when he looks at you he sees his best friend's little sister. We were married for six years; don't you think I know how he feels about you? Maybe now he sees you as a friend in your own right now or as his own sister, who knows? But he'll never get past the fact that you're his best friend's sister. First impressions last. What can you give him that I can't? He gave his heart to me before and I'm going to take it back again.\" I hated her. I hated the smug look on her face and that every word had felt like a physical blow – hitting home with such resounding truth that I felt the fight being knocked out of me and a tremendous urge to sit down. But I steeled my face, stiffened my spine and looked Katie dead in the eye. \"Are you done?\" \"It's only a matter of time before Tuck and I are married again. Don't get in the way Jessica, you'll only get hurt. How many times has he broken your heart and not even noticed? Move on. Find another man because you can't have mine.\" With that parting shot she turned on her heels and headed for her car. I calmly placed my gloves on the grass, took a deep breath and walked to the utility room that had been mostly untouched by the fire. Slowly and methodically, I washed my hands and arms then I looked into the small mirror above the sink. Wisps of hair had escaped the bun I had tried to control my long hair into so I pulled the hair tie out and let my dark brown hair tumble to my waist. It didn't frame my face like they say in books, it just looked a bit untidy. My usually pale skin was flushed and coated in a sheen of perspiration; my eyes still held smudges of the makeup I hadn't properly removed last night. No wonder Tuck doesn't give me a second look I though bitterly. Without meaning to I recalled what he's said to me that morning \"You're unselfish, caring, smart, funny, beautiful…\" I sighed, utterly defeated, and let my head drop when holding it up seemed like too much of an effort. Tears gathered in my eyes again and I tried to remind myself that I was twenty-six, not six. Then something caught my eye. The blue handles had always fit so comfortably on my fingers, the blades reliably sharp whenever I needed them. I picked up the scissors and turned them over in my hands as thoughts churned in my head. I caught my own eye in the mirror and nodded once, my mind suddenly made up. Sliding a lock of hair between my fingers, I cut before I could back out of my own deal. The piece that fell into the sink was over a foot long. I grabbed more hair and snipped. Each time I cut I told myself that this was the beginning of a change. I was going to stop loving Tuck Hansen. I was going to lift my head up high and move on. I'd dance in the rain and with strangers; I would get on a train with no idea where it would take me, just for a day; I would use the money that my parents had left, that Nanna had invested and grown into a not-so-small fortune, and I'd actually live . Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 10] \"Well now, that's different.\" Nana said as soon as I closed the door. Her statement didn't sound like a judgement, simply an observation laced with curiosity. I could tell by the way she looked at me that she was waiting for an explanation but had probably figured most of it out. \"I needed a change.\" I told her honestly. \"I need a few changes I think and this seemed like a good way to start.\" Her eyebrows rose as she waited for more information. With a sigh, I dumped my bag on the hall table and walked to join her on the sofa. Then I told her everything. When I finished, Nana reached out and ran a lock of my hair through her fingers. It now only reached just above my shoulders and I could see the regret she was trying to hide – she had always loved my hair – but there was something else on her face too. \"Nana, what is it?\" I asked softly. As her eyes filled with tears she said, \"Oh my dear, you look so much like your mother – I remember the day she came in with her hair chopped off. Of course, she did it our of spite for me, not the love of a boy, so it didn't suit her the way it suits you. If you're sure about leaving your feelings for Tuck behind then I have to tell you – it won't be easy. You'll have to see him at your brother's wedding, whenever that comes, at my surprise birthday party next week….\" \"How did you know?\" I asked disbelievingly. \"Ah, child, your grandfather could never keep a secret from me. We can talk about the party later; right now I need to know how you are, really.\" Her concerned gaze touched my heart and I reached for her hand. \"I know that it'll be hard but it won't be any more difficult than the last ten years have been. This is the first time I really have been committed to giving him up. I can get through this Nana, I know I can.\" TmWtMwTmWtMw I could hardly believe my Nana was turning eighty. Eighty! I was busy in the kitchen – usually Nana's domain but she had been banished for this occasion – and our friends and family would be arriving in less than an hour. The kitchen was filled with delicious smells ranging from savoury to sweet, from chicken to frosting. With the sun gracing us with its presence and the guy on TV that morning promising it would be a cloudless day I was hugely relieved: it meant FDR and Grandpa could set up the tables outside rather than me having to clean inside. Earlier, when FDR arrived with Lauren, I was decorating Nana's cake so we shouted our greetings through the door – no one was allowed to see it until it was finished – but he still hadn't seen my new hairstyle. I was excited about his reaction but also nervous. As I worked piling sandwiches, sausage rolls and various other buffet foods onto huge plates, I listened to Nana and Lauren talking in the next room. They were chatting and laughing and, admittedly, making me rather jealous. I pulled my lip between my teeth and bit down. My brother was happy and I tried to tell myself that that was all that mattered but a part of me still resented what she had done to him and to Tuck. And there he was again, Tuck, finding his way into my thoughts no matter what I did. I hadn't realised what an integral part of my life he was until I started trying to cut down on him; he was an addiction. The smallest things reminded me of him. Whenever I thought about him I thought about the almost-kiss and when I thought of that it made me want him all over again. Not seeing him and, for the most part, ignoring his phone calls was helping – I was getting better at controlling the rush of emotions that swelled whenever his name flashed up on my phone. The Universe though, it seemed, was conspiring against me in whatever ways possible. \"It's only us.\" a stressed but achingly familiar voice called as the front door opened. \"Marvellous.\" I muttered. I heard Tuck, Katie and Joe greet Nana and Lauren. They spend a few minutes catching up which, for the most part, I ignored as much as I could, focusing instead on the tasks at hand. Suddenly, as I carefully removed the quiche from the oven, there was a firm knock on the kitchen door which caused me to jump in fright. The quiche flew forward and luckily landed flat with a loud thud on the counter; I lost my grip on the baking tray which allowed it to slide up to rest on my forearm before falling to the floor with a loud clatter harmonised by my cussing. \"Jess are you alright? Sweetheart, let me in.\" Tuck said from the other side of the locked door. Suppressing a groan of pain I replied \"No one's allowed in – the cake isn't finished. It's just a burn, I'll be fine. Besides, you shouldn't have scared me like that.\" \"Jess-\" \"I said no Tuck\" I interrupted resolutely. He sighed and mumbled something I couldn't catch but raised his voice to ask Joe to go into the garden with him to help. As I ran my arm under cold water I brushed some stray hair from my face – it was just long enough to tie out the way but not every strand quite made it. The cold water began numbing my skin and soothing the painful sting. Where did Nana keep the first aid kit again? I already knew I wasn't going to keep my arm cooling for the recommended time: two minutes and some aloe vera would have to do. Patting my arm dry, I was crouching to look through the cupboard under the sink when the door leading outside was slammed open. This made me jump again and hit my head on the counter top. \"For f…ouch!\" I said, my voice taut with pain and frustration. I turned, fully expecting to shout at my idiotic brother for scaring me half to death, and was faced with a dumbfounded Tuck; which left me dumbfounded. I was the first to recover and spoke while I rubbed my now throbbing head. \"Twice in ten minutes? Thanks.\" I bit out sarcastically. \"Jess, I am so sorry love. I didn't mean to scare you…again.\" His eyes were jumping between my red arm and my hair. \"What did you…?\" Without finishing his question Tuck closed the gap between us and reached behind my head. A gentle tug was all it took for my hair to fall around my face. \"Jess? …. When? …. Why?\" A profound frown took over his forehead as he tried to take in the difference. \"Last week,\" I admitted quietly. Unexpectedly, I felt embarrassed by my rash decision and his current scrutiny. I forgot all about the pain lacing my head and the fact that I was wearing ratty clothing covered in everything from honey to flour. \"I just…I need to change some things and thought this would be a way to start that.\" \"Please please don't tell me this was after…what happened at my apartment?\" Tuck asked. He boldly reached his left hand out and ran it through my hair; it remained resting on my neck with his thumb just by my ear. I tried to scoff, to tell him that it wasn't, but our promise made me hold my tongue. I focused on the buttons of his black shirt to avoid his eyes. \"Jess?\" Tuck coaxed. The distress in his voice reminded me how to talk. \"It was an impulsive decision. The scissors were right there and everything that Katie said was running round my in h-\" \"Katie?\" Crap. I hadn't meant to let that slip. \"Is she the reason you've been avoiding me or is it the other...thing?\" Honesty is the best policy. \"It's both. I'm female Tuck: I can't handle things like that. As Katie rightly pointed out: you two are back together and making a go of things. You've wanted your family back together for as long as it's been apart and I…I couldn't get in the way of that.\" I admitted. \"God, Jess, I'm sorry.\" He was hugging me before the first tear slid down my cheek. \"I shouldn't have put you in that position and I'm sorry it hurt you. It isn't a choice between you and Katie, Jess, and I can't lose you from my life. \"I know.\" Was all I could manage to say. The light blue frosting on Nana's cake caught my attention and gave me the perfect excuse to avoid the place our conversation was surely heading. I stepped out of Tuck's embrace and folded my arms, wincing slightly when the pain reminded me it was burned. \"You have to close your eyes and leave – Nana's cake isn't done and you can't see it.\" I told him. To my surprise, he laughed. Affection danced on his face and he leaned forward to kiss my cheek before dutifully closing his eyes. Not even one protest though that should have been an indicator that he had other things on his mind. Biting back my own smile, I laid my hands gently on his arms and steered him to the door. \"No more frights, okay?\" I said as I gave him one last push into the courtyard. \"I can't promise that. Oh! I forgot to say – I love your hair.\" I sighed as I closed the door behind him. TmWtMwTmWtMw \"… Happy birthday to yooooooou.\" We all finished at different times and in many different keys but Nana was smiling as brightly as the tears shining in her eyes. It took four tries for her to blow all eighty candles out. When you have a family as large as ours it requires a cake large enough that that many actually fit quite nicely. As everyone clapped and Nana was offered a knife to begin serving her cake, someone behind me gave a lock of my hair a sharp tug. \"FDR grow up.\" I sighed. I knew it was him because he had already done the very same thing a dozen times. When I'd walked down the stairs in my new dress (which Gemma had been drafted in to help me find) my brother didn't manage to say a word for almost two minutes – a record, we all thought. Lauren jumped in straight away with a compliment as we had come to a silent understanding that we would try to leave certain things in the past; namely the slap which I had never apologised for. FDR eventually recovered enough to tell me that I suited the old style better but, hey, this one wasn't too bad either. \"I really have no idea what you're talking about.\" FDR said before he bumped my shoulder lightly with his. \"You know, for a spy you really are a shockingly bad liar.\" I commented. \"I love you too.\" \"Mmmm-hmmm. I'm gonna clear some of the plates. Save me some cake?\" I asked. \"I'll do my best.\" FDR replied jovially. He'd had a few beers so he threw his arm around my shoulder for a hug and kissed the top of my head. \"You're amazing.\" \"I know!\" I chirped. I detangled myself and walked away to the sound of his chuckling. TmWtMwTmWtMw The house I grew up in isn't small: there are lots of big rooms, hallways and multiple entrances into some rooms. Sound also travels well in it. A long hall stretches from the garden to the living room and from there you can go into the kitchen. Balancing a few serving dishes and some empty bottles wasn't easy or quiet but the noise didn't interrupt the two people arguing in the room ahead of me. \"…having a good time here. What reason are you going to give for leaving? Don't spoil his day too Katie, leave him here.\" \"Fine! I hope you enjoy the rest of the little party with your \" family \" – they always did come before Joe and me.\" Katie snapped a few moments before the front door slammed. I stood frozen in place as Tuck muttered more curse words than I could ever remember him saying, Katie's car door closed and the sound of the engine disappeared down the gravel drive. Unable to do anything else, I counted to one hundred before taking a deep breath and continuing up the corridor. Tuck was sitting on the sofa but didn't look at me when I walked in. \"How much did you hear?\" he asked. He sounded weary but not angry. \"Just her leaving. Sorry, I have to put these down.\" My arms were beginning to shake because of the weight. After the dishes were on the counter I turned to go back to Tuck but he was already in the doorway. I jumped. \"You're going to give me a heart attack!\" I joked. His lips twitched at my attempted humour so I probed. \"Do you want to tell me about it?\" \"There isn't much to tell really, it's over.\" He came to lean on the counter next to me. \"What was it about?\" I asked tentatively. Tuck sighed and ran his hand down his face. \"You.\" he admitted. Fully taken aback, I was about to deny it and ask for the real reason but things began to fall into place. Tuck wouldn't have just let Katie away with trying to come between us. I pushed myself off the counter and began pacing. My mind was buzzing but all the thoughts weren't good ones. \"Did I not tell you just hours ago that I didn't want to come between you? Tuck this isn't even the first time she's warned me away from you! Before you were even married she told me to stay away but I ignored her. She isn't the reason I've been avoiding you this week, hell! for months!\" \"Jess please, I don't want to fight with you too.\" He caught my hand lightly and turned me to face him. \"Oh, bite me!\" I snapped in frustration. Fully intending to resume pacing, I was taken aback when Tuck's arm wrapped securely round my waist and pulled my back firmly against his chest. The shock expelled the air from my lungs. The fingers of Tuck's left hand brushed my temple then slowly down towards my neck, gathering my hair and pulling it aside. That, combined with the way his breath played across my exposed shoulder, raised goosebumps over my entire body. I couldn't keep my eyes from closing. My mind was fuzzy as his body shifted behind mine, his head lowering gradually towards my exposed neck. I couldn't think; I couldn't move; I couldn't breathe. Slowly, so very slowly, he bit down on my neck. His canines were sharp but not painful and the pressure combined with the warmth made my knees go weak. I inhaled sharply and let the breath out shakily. His lips closed over my skin, warming it instantly and just as quickly he released me. His heartbeat matched mine – I could feel it on my back as we stood, unmoving, figuring out what to do. \"Is that what you had in mind Sweetheart?\" Tuck whispered. His lips were barely a millimetre from my ear and brushed against it as he spoke. I was so used to his voice – I thought I knew all its variations – but I had never heard him sound like that. It was deeper than I'd known before, with an uncharacteristic hint of gravel that wasn't usually present. I forced myself to swallow whatever feelings were rising within me. \"I-I...I need to go...do...a-a thing. The party. I need to…uh…get back to the party.\" I stammered. He didn't resist as I pulled away from him and walked to the door without a particular destination in mind. I threaded both my hands through my hair and shook my head. \"You can't do things like that to me.\" I blustered. \"You have no idea... God why can't I just get over... Why have I always been so damn in-\" I scrubbed my hand over my face to stop myself from talking. \" God Tuck, seriously?\" \"So damn what?\" Tuck asked quietly. I froze. Having practically forgotten he was there I felt instant panic over what I'd been about to say. I began backing out of the door. \"Jess, what were you going to say?\" Tuck said louder this time. \"It doesn't matter!\" I insisted. \"Like hell it doesn't, what were you going to say?\" Tuck responded whilst following me into the living room. \"Nothing, I didn't mean anything.\" I said. I was about to open the door to hall that would lead to the garden – just seconds away from escaping – when Tuck caught my hand and trapped me between him and it. I had nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide. My eyes began to sting and I bit down hard on my lip as I looked determinedly at his chest. He wasn't letting me off that easily though; I realised this when his index finger and thumb gently grasped my chin and forced me to meet his gaze. He was so damn close! His left hand was still holding mine and he gave it a reassuring squeeze. His right arm rested against the door just above my head. \"What was is Jess?\" he whispered. I closed my eyes and sighed. This was it. Once I told him how I felt things would change between us, no matter how much we didn't want them to or what promises we made. Gathering my courage, I looked into his steely blue eyes and thought about how I'd always considered them to be more blue than grey. How many times had I looked into those eyes and wished I could say what I was about to? \"Why can't I just get over you? Why have I always been so damn in love with you?\" Much love and thanks, I hope this has been worth the wait. Liv.[Chapter 11] A/N: warning there is an f-bomb in this chapter. My leg bounced nervously as I checked my watch for the umpteenth time. Where was he? One o'clock meant one o'clock but as the minute hand crept closer and closer to half past I got more agitated. Nana was cooking dinner – even just thinking about her Sunday roast could make my mouth water – and the rich smell wafted all the way to the window seat on the landing of the stairs. After forty five minutes it was pretty uncomfortable but I kept my vigil waiting for a car to turn into the driveway. I had been away at school in Scotland for the past four months and for the three prior to that FDR was out training on a cruise ship. Not seeing my brother for that long left me a little on edge and desperate to see him. I couldn't fathom the reasons that led to him spending months on end stuck on some huge boat – he'd always been so energetic and active – but he enjoyed it and that was what counted. Wait was that a car? I sat stock still with my eyes glued to the black car that was slowing down on the road running parallel to our house. It turned into the driveway and crept past the large green fields on either side. Was it him? I'd never had great vision so the dark convertible was slowing to a stop before I could make out the distinctive features of my brother in the driver's seat. \"HE'S HERE!\" I yelled repeatedly as I launched my sixteen-year-old self down the stairs two at a time. \"He's here! He's here! He's here!\" The rug at the bottom slid alarmingly as my foot made contact with it and for a terrifyingly long second I teetered on the edge of falling. Balance restored, I wrenched the door open and ran straight for the car. FDR managed closed the door milliseconds before I threw my arms around him. He staggered back against the car with an \"Oomf!\" but laughed as he hugged me back as tightly as I was squeezing him. \"You're back!\" I cried. My statement was neither a laugh nor a sob but I'm sure it was somewhere in between. \"Yeah, Kiddo, I'm here. Let me look at you! How can you have got so grown up in seven months?\" he asked in disbelief. He was teasing me, of course – I hadn't changed but during my early years at boarding school there were times when I had grown a whole foot between our visits. \"You're mad.\" I accused. \"But I'm so so excited to see you. It isn't like you to be tardy, everything okay? Oh, and your hair looks horrendous by the way – did you join a boy band?\" I babbled exuberantly. \"Horrendous? What the heck does that even mean?\" he asked but he could guess enough from the context to look mildly offended and not bother with the rest of my statements. As I took in a breath to reply someone said, \"Bloody awful, mate. Terrible, unpleasant, hideous, abhor-\" \"Thank you Tuck, I get it.\" I was startled when I realised that someone else had exited the car and the amazement continued when I actually looked at him. He wore a boyish grin as he teased FDR that instantly had my face warming and my insides turning gooey. His face was young – probably of age with my twenty-year-old brother – and, combined with his casual blue top and black leather jacket, had my hormones out of control before he'd even finished speaking. Swallowing my overreaction, I skirted the car to introduce myself. I was still giddy from seeing my brother and the effect of his gorgeous friend so I didn't bother thinking when I wrapped Tuck in a hug. I'd belatedly noticed that he was readying to shake my hand but he managed to move it out of the way and, rather surprisingly, hugged me back without reservation. \"I'm sorry! I'm Jessie. I didn't realise Frankly was bringing anyone and you must think I'm so rude now.\" I said as I pulled away. \"Oh, don't be daft, it's fine. You should never apologise for being happy to see someone. Though I'm wondering: your accent isn't entirely American is it?\" he asked. I was caught off guard by how mesmerising his eyes were – neither blue nor grey though maybe more blue because of his t-shirt and so gorgeous that I had to shake my head after a moment to get my thoughts on track. \"Good ear. I've been back here long enough to pick up the American again but I've spent so much time in bonnie Scotland that it can go either way. English?\" I replied. \"Yes ma'am.\" he said cheekily and I didn't fight my own grin. FDR cleared his throat pointedly so I skipped over to him where he stood by the open trunk. \"Yes big brother?\" I asked mockingly. \"As you so helpfully pointed out: we are late. Wanna grab a bag and take it inside?\" He didn't give me an option because he held out a large duffle and let go of it without giving me any choice but catch it. Childishly, I stuck my tongue out at him before hefting the bag towards the house. \"Did you pack the kitchen sink in here too?\" I threw over my shoulder. TmWtMwTmWtMw Three hours later we were all sitting by the fire and chatting as if Tuck had always been a part of our tightknit family. He was charming – so Nana liked him instantly – and engaged in the conversation no matter what tangent it took. I spent a lot of my time watching him. Not in a creepy way (for the most part) but because I found him fascinating from the get-go. Tuck instinctively knew when to take a back seat in the discussions – when family things came up or someone was particularly passionate or knowledgeable about a subject – which, I noticed, gave him time to observe us too. He caught me looking at him more than once but made no effort to make anything of it; he'd just offer a casual smile and focus back on the conversation. We learned that Tuck's parents still lived near London – they spoke and visited but weren't a close and affectionate family like ours – and that he was splitting his time between London and LA. He spoke openly and eloquently but I couldn't shake the feeling that we were missing something, something that only FDR seemed to be clued in on. Maybe it was just the overwhelming curiosity that had arisen in me since his arrival. My eyes drifted to the mantel piece again and a different itch of curiosity sprang up. What on earth had Grandpa sealed in that envelope? As Nana and I were clearing the table, Grandpa had slipped out. When he joined us in the living room a short while later he placed the envelope where it was still sitting and sat himself down as if nothing happened. Naturally, we bombarded him with questions but he was utterly adamant that it was not to be opened. I was still sulking about it. \"Jess?\" I was drawn out of my pondering by someone calling me by an unfamiliar name. \"Huh?\" \"Sorry love, you were miles away. I was asking if you've ever climbed to the top of Arthur's seat? Your Nana said she remembers doing it when she was young and that you go to school near there.\" Tuck explained. \"Oh, yeah I've been up with my friend Mark. We climbed it just before I came home for Christmas break. The view of Edinburgh from there is stunning.\" I said. We continued talking for hours after Nana and Grandpa went to bed. I sat squeezed between Tuck and my brother as we looked through some family photographs and ones that FDR had taken since we'd last been together. It was difficult to focus on the pictures when Tuck put his arm casually around my shoulder so he could get a better look at the photos FDR was holding. A little after two in the morning I switched my bedside lamp off and snuggled under my blankets. Thoughts of Tuck played through my head for a long time but as I drifted off I told myself it was a harmless crush, it would pass. END FLASHBACK TmWtMwTmWtMw I closed my eyes and sighed. This was it. Once I told him how I felt things would change between us, no matter how much we didn't want them to or what promises we made. Gathering my courage, I looked into his steely blue eyes and thought about how I'd always considered them to be more blue than grey. How many times had I looked into those eyes and wished I could say what I was about to? \" Why can't I just get over you? Why have I always been so damn in love with you?\" My statements swirled in the silence around us like a tangible fog. Tuck's eyebrows pulled together then relaxed every other second as he digested my confession and his lips were parted ever so slightly while he tried to form words. This close, the smell of his cologne surrounded me; usually I revelled in it but at that particular moment it felt like I was being suffocated. I was acutely aware of the warmth coming from his skin and the trace of alcohol on his breath. His grip on my hand never faltered. \"Jess…?\" he whispered. \"Don't. Please, just don't say anything.\" I begged. A familiar sting behind the bridge of my nose warned me a second before my eyes filled with tears and though I clenched my jaw, I couldn't stop my lip from trembling. My eyes quickly searched for the floor and the muscles in my neck became taught. All the while I knew Tuck's eyes were trained on me. He's confused, you could make it to the washroom before he realises I thought. I squirmed against the door. It looked like I was just uncomfortable but I was repositioning myself to run. As if forgetting his hand was in mine, I raised my right hand to wipe my eyes. Tuck let go of me and I didn't hesitate. I slipped to my right and headed straight for the small room by the stairs. As the door clicked closed and the lock snapped into place I let out a choked breath. I felt sixteen, not twenty-six: hiding in a bathroom because a guy knew I had a crush on him. \"Idiot.\" I whispered. I rested my forehead on the door and curled my hands into fists to keep my emotions in. \"Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot!\" I hissed under my breath. Tears dripped from my nose onto the floor, some catching on my hair on their descent. Each breath I took shuddered as I tried to stop myself from sobbing outright and the room around me seemed to tilt and sway. I heard Tuck's footsteps approaching and each step he took brought a constricting pain to my chest until I could no longer breathe properly. He stopped on the other side of the thin wood separating us. Nothing was said for what seemed like a long time but in reality only a couple of minutes probably passed. \"Jess will you let me in?\" he asked quietly. It sounded as if he too had his head pressed to the door. I knew he was smart enough to realise his own double entendre. \"I can't.\" I whispered back. \"I have to let this go; I need this to change. I'm sorry but please, please just go back to the party and forget I said it. Tuck, I'm not strong enough for this.\" I admitted. \"Jess I….\" Tuck trailed off and sighed heavily. \"I'm sorry.\" he whispered. The sound of his shoes faded slowly. I wiped under my eyes and sniffed hard – a very unladylike action as my Nana would jokingly tell me. Turning my back to the door, I slid down until I was sitting on the floor. Had I wanted him to walk away? I couldn't find the answer. Taking soothing breaths was something to focus on and after a few minutes I was calm again. A quick look in the mirror showed me that my mascara had run slightly but it was nothing that couldn't be sorted. If only it didn't feel like I'd been kicked in the chest. FDR and Lauren were hovering close by when I walked back into the glorious but slightly irritating sunlight. With a quirk of his eyebrow he asked if I was okay. Putting on my best poker face I nodded, smiled and found a spare plate of cake to console myself with. I resolutely did not look for Tuck. \"Y'know, Mr Hansen was wearing a similar look when he came back. There's also a distinct lack of Katie anywhere I can see. Any ideas?\" Nana's approach had been stealthy so I couldn't escape. \"She left. They're over. He knows.\" I mumbled. When I remembered that it was Nana's celebration I rearranged my features. \"It's for the best, all of it, now go and enjoy your party. You only turn eighty once!\" I could tell she was about to pursue it so I cut her off. \"I'm fine and he'll live. Now go and enjoy. Please.\" I put my plate down and hugged her. Reluctantly, she left. I caught glimpses of Tuck throughout the rest of the party but he was one of the first to leave. He stood awkwardly as Joe enthusiastically hugged me goodbye then, upon Joe's encouragement, kissed my cheek before they quickly left. It wasn't long after that everyone else left en masse and the tidying occupied my mind for some time afterwards. I made my excuses early and headed upstairs to go to bed. It's a testament to how bone tired I was that I didn't think it strange that my bedroom light was on. Seeing a man standing by the window sent me into a startled spasm for the fourth time that day. \"I swear I'm not going for a record.\" Tuck joked feebly. \"Tuck I am way too damn tired to do this now.\" I sighed. Contrary to my words, I walked to the head of my bed and sat down heavily. I drew my legs up and a pillow onto my lap. Tuck kicked his shoes off and sat facing me with his legs crossed underneath him. His crisp shirt and jeans from earlier had been replaced by a well-worn version. A five o'clock shadow graced his jaw. \"Do you want to start from the beginning?\" Tuck asked eventually. \"What is there to say?\" I shrugged. \"It's just a crush I've never managed to get over. Katie saw right through me and told me to back off just before you got engaged and then again last week. I decided enough was enough and I cut my hair as a reminder that I couldn't wait around forever.\" I summarised. He was quiet for a short while before saying, \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"Really? Really? And risk a friendship that means more to me than any other based on what? Feelings there is no way you return? I was an overexcited kid when we first met. You're smarter than that, don't ask stupid questions.\" I snapped. \"Oh, if only you knew.\" Tuck chuckled without humour. It piqued my interest. \"Enlighten me.\" \"Jess, I was constantly reminding myself that you're my best mate's sister. You were sixteen going on thirty when we met; with all the emotional intelligence Franklin lacked. I spent half my time thinking about you and the other half trying like hell not to think about you. Do you have any idea how much I wanted to kiss you when you were standing there in my apartment wearing my t-shirt? Then it took everything I had for me to be a gentleman that night when you were in my bed. To have you right there after all those years, with all those feelings coming back and still not being able to do anything again because of the choices I'd made? It drove me mad!\" I was rendered speechless by his confession but then my temper reignited. \"They were your choices! You chose other women over me time and time again. God fucking dammit Tuck what do you want from me? I've been here the whole time and, yeah, I'm FDR's sister but what better choice could he make for his sister than his best friend, someone he trusts? I have spent ten years of my life pining after you and now you choose to tell me it wasn't one-sided? No. Nope, sorry but it's too late. The door is closed on this one and I think you should leave.\" I stood up and drew myself to my full height. I would not relent with this. When Tuck made no move to leave I let out a restrained scream of frustration and turned to storm out. \"Screw this.\" I heard. Before I could realise what he was about to do, Tuck caught my wrist and tugged me back to face him. Then he tangled his hand in my hair and kissed me. He kissed me in a way I had never been kissed before. It was forceful, unyielding and hungry; he had a point to prove. My shock didn't last long and years of pent-up feelings wouldn't let me remain motionless. I kissed him back and realised that my back was now firmly pressed against the wall, Tuck's hand still gripping my neck. I finally knew what it was like to run my hands anywhere I wanted on him. I knew how his lips tasted and how well we fit together like this; perfectly, every line on his body resting against mine, every contour finding a home. My whole body was heated, my skin dancing with tingles wherever Tuck's free hand roamed, and I was blissfully lost in the best kiss of my life. The kiss was clearly having the same effect on Tuck as it was on me – there was a very distinct force pushing just below my waistline. One of us moaned but I'm honestly not sure which. No one interrupted us. I became lightheaded – whether from the kiss or its oxygen depriving properties I'm not sure – just before Tuck's lips moved away from mine. I didn't have time to miss them: he slowly kissed my cheek, my jaw, down my neck to my collarbone and back again as I sighed and tried to catch my breath. Tuck kissed me softly again, slowly winding down the kiss until we were standing with our foreheads resting together. It was a long time before either of us spoke. \"Is that what you had in mind Sweetheart?\" Much love and thanks, Liv.[Chapter 12] I was dozing; lost in a half-dream about being warm and content. Tuck's chest rose and fell steadily under my back as I lay between his legs on the wide sofa. I felt his arm move, felt his fingers gently move my hair aside so he could kiss my neck. \"Tickles.\" I murmured with a smile. It had been four months since our first kiss. Four months since we both laughed ourselves sore at my poor imitation of the phrase Tuck had said to me only hours earlier. Four months when I couldn't remember ever having been happier. Tuck, FDR and I had also celebrated our birthdays and FDR proposed to Lauren. \"Sorry.\" Tuck replied but I could hear the amusement just below his words. It was only the two of us in his apartment – as it was most of the time and we'd hinted around the idea of selling my house when the finishing touches had been made – where we'd spent the last two hours shedding light on things from our years of friendship. I told him the whole story about my breakup with Mark – his hurtful words about the feelings I clearly had for Tuck – and Tuck reluctantly admitted that he had had a \"little chat with him about how to treat a lady\". I'd asked him if he realised that he was the only one allowed to call me Jess and my answer was a soft chuckle. Tuck reminded me of his first time visiting my university and that my boyfriend at the time had clearly picked up on the nickname. Apparently my reaction to Mark calling me Jess hadn't been as well hidden as I'd planned and I hadn't been particularly subtle when I asked him not to do it again. Small actions or conversations, now viewed with a different perspective took on whole other meanings, and we often wondered aloud how on earth we could have missed the signs. FDR refused to admit if he'd known about our mutual attraction and appeared to be happy for us. I'm sure he took Tuck aside to give him the obligatory \"don't hurt my sister\" speech but neither of them would confirm it. I was brought back to the present by Tuck's watch clattering into the solid floor. \"Sorry love.\" he said as he stretched to pick it up. Once it was deposited on the table he laced his hands on top of my belt buckle and I shifted slightly to get comfortable again. \"It's fine.\" I told him. I repositioned my head to look up at him and was rewarded with a chaste kiss. These moments with him were my favourites; especially since he was back on active assignments with FDR. We'd quickly established that we both preferred the small gestures to grand declarations of our feelings. \"Hey, Jess? We've known each other for a long time, haven't we?\" Tuck asked. I answered with a vague affirmative noise, too comfy to do more. \"And I spent most of that time not plucking up the courage to say what I really wanted us to be.\" he continued. \"You and me both.\" I said and began to slowly run my hand up and down his arm. \"Yeah but it got me thinking and I…I don't want to risk anything because of something I couldn't find the words to say.\" He sounded like he was struggling and suddenly I was concerned about what was coming next. Was he having second thoughts? I looked back at him and didn't try to hide the worry on my face. \"What are you saying then?\" I pressed. \"I'm not saying anything, Jess, I'm asking.\" Tuck gave me a slight nudge and nodded for me to turn back around. In Tuck's hand was a small velvet box. It was opened to reveal a gorgeous, simple ring – a platinum band with a beautifully clear sapphire flanked by two diamonds. I gasped softly and my heart began thundering in my chest. \"Will you marry me?\" His quiet voice by my ear sent a pleasant thrill down my spine. My eyes stung and my face broke into a smile so wide it hurt my cheeks. \"Yes! Yes, of course I will. Yes!\" I laughed and cried at the same time. Tuck removed the ring and gently worked it onto my finger. It was a perfect fit. I directed a querying look at him and he rolled his eyes. \"I'm a spy, darling.\" My emotions being in a state of turmoil cause me to laugh louder and for longer than was necessary but Tuck didn't seem to mind. I sat up properly and turned to hug him and kiss any part of his face I could reach. Eventually I moved back enough to look him in the eyes. A sombre mood passed between us and he gently cupped my cheek. \"I love you, Jess.\" Tuck said quietly. \"I love you too.\" In the span of our dating we had never actually said those words to each other, except for when I first confessed. I knew I loved him, I always had, but I didn't know if it would survive through an actual relationship. There was a part of me waiting for it to fade, like it had done with my few boyfriends before, but it grew stronger with each day. I loved him and, for the first time, I realised he loved me just as much. TmWtMwTmWtMw Miss Jessica Jane Foster and Mr Tuck John Hansen request the pleasure of your absence at their marriage in March 2013 I stood staring at the invitation in my hand as Tuck nervously fidgeted in front of me. I reread it again to find a different explanation for its significance. This was not something I wanted to see eight weeks before my wedding. \"You know where they are, don't you?\" I asked though it felt like my throat had closed up. \"I do.\" he told me honestly. I nodded but remained quiet. \"They're in-\" \"Tuck!\" I interrupted sharply. \"I don't want to know. I don't need to know and I don't want to send this either because requesting their absence could be as good as ensuring their presence! Why send it? Why goad them when we can leave them well enough alone?\" I was furious and emotional. \"Jess, please calm down.\" Tuck said soothingly causing me to give him a scathing look. Something passed over his face that looked dangerously like humour but before I could pull him up on it he continued. \"I left out the location so they wouldn't think it's actually meant for them to come. If you don't want to send it then we don't need to. I just thought that you should have the option and…they should know you're taking the next step in your life without them, like you always have.\" he explained. \"Literally.\" I said bitterly. \"Tuck, I wasn't even six months old when they brought me to LA. The money they left Nana was significant enough to raise me well into adulthood but that doesn't even begin to make up for not being there. They haven't once called; they've missed every birthday and Christmas, every award and graduation and illness. Why should they know I'm getting married? Why should they care? Nana helped me pick out the dress, choose a bouquet and humoured me while I whined about what to do with my hair. Grandpa will walk me down the aisle and give a speech that will probably make me embarrassed, laugh and cry. What do I need Liam and Charlotte for?\" I crossed my arms stubbornly and Tuck sighed in defeat. \"My love, I'm sorry I interfered.\" He pulled me into his arms and hugged me tightly. I nodded, unable to trust myself to speak. That night, as I lay in the bed that I could now call my own, I was perfectly unable to sleep. The sale of my house had gone through two weeks before Christmas and I officially (honestly, how many people do you have to remember to tell you're changing your address?) moved in with Tuck. A month later and there were only fleeting thoughts of having my own space that passed through my head. Tuck turned onto his back in his sleep and the movement prompted me to slip out of bed. I pulled one of the large leather armchairs right over to the window and sat resting my chin on my knee and staring out at the sparkling lights of LA. My camisole and shorts were fine when I was in bed with Tuck but sitting so close to the window had my skin chilled only minutes later. I didn't really mind. Thousands of lights were brightening the city below and I tried to assign each one a problem that was keeping me awake. Where were my parents? Should I send them the non-invitation? My feet were too cold (literally, not figuratively!). I'd passed Katie on the street and she'd looked at me with an expression designed to kill. Did I want my parents at my wedding? What shoes was I going to wear? Should I have asked Gemma to be a bridesmaid? Did I want to see my parents again? Had I counted that light already? I sighed and wiped at the tears forming in my eyes. The stress of even a small wedding was getting to me and making me emotional. I heard our bedroom door open and Tuck softly pad through to find me. No doubt he'd felt how cold the bed was and knew I had been away for a while. I watched his reflection as he approached then took his time draping a blanket around my shoulders. He sat on the arm of the chair and placed his arm around me, hugging me to his side. The warmth and familiarity of the action broke me out of my melancholy thoughts and I snuggled closer to him. \"Where are they?\" I asked quietly. \"Just outside of London. They travelled for a while, best as I can tell, and moved back to the UK when they were running out of money almost twenty-three years ago.\" he said. Bracing myself, I asked the one question that I was most afraid of. \"Kids?\" \"…Two sons.\" Tuck admitted and hugged me tighter. I nodded and surprised myself when the expected pain of betrayal didn't come – there was a twinge of something but nothing compared to what I had been prepared for. \"That's all I need to know. I still don't want to send them the card but you were right, I needed to know that. Thank you.\" I said. Tuck used his thumb to gently tilt my head towards him so he could kiss me softly. \"If you ask me, they made the worst decision of their lives the day they gave you up. Though if I wished it hadn't happened then we might not be here right now and that is about the farthest thing from what I want. C'mon love, try and get some sleep.\" he said as he stood and helped me to my feet. He began to walk away but I stayed put and our joined hands made him realise this when he was met with the resistance. A lightly questioning frown adorned his forehead as he walked back to me and I just smiled at him without saying anything for a few moments. \"I love you.\" I told Tuck seriously. \"You, Jessica Foster,\" he said as he encircled me in his arms \"are the best thing that has ever been in my life, you and Joe. I love you – I really, truly do – and I always will.\" Much love and thanks, Liv.

The boss's voice came over my ear piece. \"Alright remember, this mission is covert. Apprehend the Heinrich brothers and retrieve that device,\" Collins ordered. I glanced at my two partners and we turned. We headed inside the club and I noticed every woman eyeing Tuck and FDR. I rested a hand on my hip and headed towards the bar. I sat down with perfect posture and surveyed the scene. FDR had already found two girls and Tuck looked annoyed. I chuckled. Tuck was always annoyed with FDR. Frank loved women a bit too much. I heard a helicopter and glanced at the door through lowered lashes. The two Heinrich brothers got out and headed towards us. \"Get ready,\" Frank murmured. I caught the younger brother's eye and winked. He flushed and stumbled in his step. The older brother glanced at him then turned to me but I had already turned my back and was taking a sip of my drink nonchalantly. \"Your powers over mere mortals are truly astounding,\" Tuck murmured amused. Too bad they don't work on you, I thought sadly. Tuck, FDR and I had been partners for four years and I had fallen in love with Tuck on our very first mission. My hand found the simple crystal bracelet he had bought me in Japan. \"Shots fired, six agents down,\" Collins suddenly spoke. I glanced over at Tuck and FDR. \"Let me handle this guys,\" I said hurriedly as the Heinrich brothers came back out. \"Hurry,\" FDR told me. I stood and moved through the crowd. I caught the younger brother by the arm. \"Dance with me,\" I told him batting my lashes and putting on a thick alluring accent. He smiled and moved closer to me. \"Jonas, come on,\" his older brother snapped. \"It's just a dance,\" I drawled to him slinging one arm around Jonas's neck. The older brother grabbed my arm in a bruising grip. \"If you want a dance, fine,\" he growled. He dragged me towards the helipad. \"Ok, plan B,\" FDR said. I stumbled behind Heinrich praying that Tuck would get close enough to get the package and me out of there. Just because I was a professional spy didn't mean I never got scared. Heinrich suddenly growled and I saw Tuck's reflection in the grass. He turned yanking me to the side and shot into the air. \"And the screaming starts,\" I muttered. He looked at me and his grip tightened. \"You're one of them,\" he snarled dragging me outside. This stupid dress kept me off balance and him dragging me wasn't helping at all. Suddenly he threw me into another man's arms. \"Throw her off the edge,\" he snapped. My breathing hitched but I kept a clear head. The man pulled me to the edge. I waited until I caught my balance then slammed my elbow into the man's gut. I spun and kicked his knee out. He yelled and collapsed. \"Hey, these heels are useful,\" I murmured surprised then headed for the Heinrich brothers. I yanked my dress up and stepped out of my shoes. They were useful but hard to balance in. I grabbed one of their men who lunged for me and kneed him in the groin. He groaned and fell to his knees. I moved past him as Tuck kicked Jonas out of the helicopter. I headed for the older brother. I threw a punch. He dodged. He kicked out at me and I leaped back stepping on my dress. I fell but arms caught me. I was yanked up and turned around. I froze as the cold metal of a gun barrel pressed against my temple. \"Stop or I blow her brains out,\" Heinrich yelled. Silence fell and Tuck and FDR glared at Heinrich. \"Jonas, get the cases,\" he ordered. I shifted and the barrel dug in harder. \"Don't move,\" he growled into my ear. My heart was racing in my chest and my mind was spinning frantically. \"Let her go,\" Tuck ordered. Heinrich laughed. \"I don't think so,\" he replied. I focused and slammed my heel into Heinrich's toe. His grip loosened and I dropped kicking his legs out from under him. The gun went off and I scrambled out from under him. I whirled and grabbed at Jonas. FDR was back in the gun fight and I had to get those cases. Tuck slammed into Jonas and the case with the money fell, springing open. Money began to fly everywhere and I saw the older brother preparing to leap off the building. \"Kill them,\" he shouted to Jonas and leaped. I lunged for him and lost my footing. I tumbled towards the edge and grabbed onto the side. My body slammed into the building and I hissed. My arm muscles screeched at me and I pulled myself up onto the building. I rolled away from the edge and rested for a bit. FDR came over and helped me up. \"Next time, you get to wear the dress,\" I told him brushing myself off. He laughed. \"Collins isn't going to be happy,\" he said to me. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Jonas is dead and Heinrich escaped,\" he explained. \"Wow,\" I mouthed. Tuck came over. \"Are you alright?\" he asked holding the black case. I nodded. \"I'm worried about Heinrich though. He probably isn't very happy,\" I said with a shrug. \"I'm more worried about the boss,\" FDR interjected. I laughed and we headed off into the club. \"Hey, you think those girls are still here?\" FDR shouted. Tuck and I glanced at each other with a smile. \"No,\" we yelled back at the same time.[Chapter 2] Part Two The next day we walked into the agency. We headed across the foyer joking and laughing. \"Tuck, FDR, Rayne,\" Collins called her voice echoing throughout the big space. I winced and turned towards her. She jerked his hand towards her office. \"We are so dead,\" I muttered to both of them. \"Agreed,\" they mumbled back. We walked up to her office and sat down. \"This mission was clearly ordered to be covert,\" she started bluntly, \"And look at this.\" She slapped down a picture of Jonas dead on top of a car. \"Well to be fair, we did…\" Tuck was cut off. \"Shut up Tuck,\" Collins snapped. Tuck shrank back. \"Shutting up, me shutting up now,\" he muttered. I gave him a sympathetic look. \"Because of you three idiots I now have a huge mess to clean up and all three of you are grounded,\" she ordered. My eyes widened sharply. \"Grounded?\" Tuck questioned in shock. We all groaned. We walked back down to our shared office and plopped down in our chairs. I started tapping my fingers on my desk. FDR joined in with a more complex rhythm to balance out my simple taps. Tuck started spinning his gun adding a new melody into it. That night, after the most boring day in the office, I headed for home. I opened my apartment door. \"Hi Angel,\" I greeted my black and white cat. I scratched her ears for a moment before hanging up my jacket and purse. I sighed and went to my fridge. I grabbed some leftover fried chicken and popped it in the microwave. \"Are you hungry Angel?\" I asked. I always talked to my cat like she was a person. I made sure her bowl was full then took my fried chicken and a beer to the couch. My phone rang as I sat down. It was Tuck's ringtone. I growled and stood back up. \"Tuck, I just sat down with food. This had better be good,\" I told him. \"FDR wants you to come to Nana's tomorrow,\" he told me. I heard background music and assumed he was at his house. \"Sure, I like Nana's,\" I replied. \"Alright I'll tell him,\" he said hanging up. I sighed sadly and put my phone down. He never called just to say hi or to see how I was. My appetite vanished and I put the chicken back in the fridge before going to my room. I sat down on the floor by my bed and pulled out a shoebox. I opened it up and smiled at all the trinkets there. We had made a tradition of buying little things every single mission we went on. I had little statues, swatches of embroidered cloth, clasps, jewels, a few dream catchers, wooden flowers, perfumes that I never wore but kept and a small wooden figurine of a sphinx. I pulled the sphinx out and smiled. Egypt had been an easy but fun mission. I put it back and slid it under the bed. The next thing I pulled out was a photo album. That was our other tradition. We took a picture on every mission together. \"Egypt, Kenya, Bangladesh, London, Rome,\" I muttered flipping through it. I loved looking through these. They reminded me of how close we were. I smiled as I came upon our first mission. It had been in Hiroshima. We had been apprehending a mob boss that had been hiding there. This picture had been taken in front of a river bridge. A kind gentleman had taken it for us. I was sitting on the bridge railing with Tuck and FDR on either side of me. I smiled and brushed my fingers across my bracelet. It wasn't smart keeping these, but I couldn't bear to get rid of them. The bracelet was cool under my fingers. I hadn't taken it off since that mission four years ago. The next day Tuck and FDR picked me up early in the morning. I wore my favorite light green and gold summer dress and my hair was in a fishtail braid. \"You look nice today,\" Tuck stated. \"Why do you sound so surprised?\" I teased. He chuckled and we headed off. At Nana's I jumped out. I loved coming to FDR's family gatherings. My mother had abandoned me when I was ten to an abusive father so I loved being part of a non-dysfunctional family. \"Hi Nana,\" I called giving her a hug. \"Hello dear, it's so nice to see you again,\" she replied. I smiled at her and went to the backyard. I waved to several people as music filtered through the air. Tuck and FDR soon joined me at the table I had picked out. \"I brought cake,\" FDR cheered. I laughed and smiled at him. \"I can't believe you Rayne,\" grandpa told me. I arched an eyebrow. \"What are you doing with these two lugs eating cake when you could be dancing with me?\" I laughed and set my plate down. \"Well how can I refuse?\" I said with a laugh. I winked at Tuck and FDR then took grandpa's hand. He led me out to the clearing where people were dancing. We began to dance. \"When are you planning on telling Tuck?\" he asked. I smiled sadly. \"Never,\" I told him, \"I can't ruin our friendship.\" \"That's a crap excuse and you know it. You're just scared that he doesn't feel the same,\" he replied. \"I think that's a very reasonable fear,\" I said with a smile. \"You need to tell him before someone snaps him up,\" he told me firmly. I looked away towards the two men. The song ended and I stepped away. \"We'll see,\" I told him sadly moving away. I walked over to them my mind racing. Should I tell him? Could I? How would he respond? \"Now imagine all that but with a woman,\" Tuck was saying. FDR looked confused. \"I can't,\" he said honestly. I sauntered up and plopped my elbows on their shoulders. \"So what am I, chopped liver?\" I teased. \"Course not, but you don't exactly act like a woman,\" FDR replied. I knocked him upside the head but my mind spun. It was true. I didn't act like most girls. I wore comfortable clothes that were often stained or ripped from missions. My hair was usually in a simple pony or braid. I only wore dresses or skirts for special occasions or missions. I fought like a man and wasn't afraid to get my hands dirty. I knew I didn't act like a lady but it had never bothered me before he had pointed out. Was that the reason Tuck had never expressed an interest in me?[Chapter 3] Part Three The next day I was at home in front of the TV with a punching bag. I slammed my fist into the bag as soft music poured from the TV. I glanced over. It was an ad for a dating site. I stopped punching and wiped the sweat from my forehead. I watched the commercial as I unwrapped the cloth from my hands. \"Huh,\" I muttered. I might have to try that. I quickly shook my head. \"What am I thinking?\" I asked a second later. I shook my head again and went back to punching the crap out of my bag. Friday rolled around and I went to the bar we always went to on Fridays. I walked in and found Tuck and FDR playing pool. \"You're insane,\" FDR was saying. \"Why is he insane?\" I asked resting my elbows on the pool table. \"He put all his personal info on a dating site and he actually got a date,\" FDR explained. I felt my heart clench but gave Tuck a smile. \"I agree with FDR,\" for completely different reasons , \"You're crazy.\" Tuck laughed. \"It's just a date,\" he said. \"Ok, look here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to come on the date with you,\" FDR said. \"Yeah, we could double with you,\" I interjected. \"No, no I'd like some privacy,\" he replied shaking his head. \"100 yards,\" FDR offered. Tuck shook his head but he was hesitating. \"I'll stay in the video store around the corner. One ring, you need an extraction, two rings, a kill squad and three rings means I can go home,\" he said. I raised my eyebrows. \"200 yards, no visibility,\" Tuck finally agreed. FDR and I looked at each other and smiled. The next day we drove to the movie store. \"Do you think it'll go well?\" I asked getting out. FDR shook his head. \"Nah, Tuck hasn't been in the dating game. It might not be horrible but I doubt it'll be fantastic,\" he replied. I hid a smile. I didn't want it to go really well. \"I'm going to grab something eat. I'll meet you here later,\" I told him. He nodded and headed for a small café. If it happened to be across from the bar where Tuck was having his date, I would never admit to anything. I sat down outside and ordered a sandwich. My phone rang. I bit my lip. Once, twice, three times, it stopped. My head clumped down onto the table. You are such an idiot! I was screaming at myself. Why did I do this to myself? I sat up and looked over at Tuck and his date. They were laughing and I felt tears prick my eyes. I really was an idiot. I looked at the woman. She was blonde, blue eyed, and perfect. She acted like a woman and looked like a lady. It was hopeless. My sandwich came and I chewed it mechanically without tasting it. After I finished eating I stood and left the café. I had to get out of here. I walked away my mind spinning. Suddenly a bright spot of movement caught my eye. I blinked and looked toward the road. A bright red ball was bouncing into the busy street. A child was following it. \"No!\" I shouted lunging forward. I bolted out into the street, wrapped my arms around the kid and rolled. I landed on the sidewalk squeezing the kid to my chest. He was crying. \"Shh, it's ok,\" I murmured sitting up. I cradled the child in my arms. \"Oh my god,\" a woman shouted. She ran up and pulled the child from me. She hugged him tightly. \"Thank you so much,\" she told me. I nodded and stood up brushing myself off. I noticed a sharp pain in my hands. They were cut up and scratched and dirty. I winced looking at them. \"Rayne!\" Tuck called running up. \"I'm alright,\" I told him. That didn't stop him for making sure. \"Come on, let me take care of those hands,\" he told me holding my wrist gently. He led me to his car and we got inside. \"I can take care of my own injuries,\" I said without thinking. Why did I say that? A woman would be grateful and like that he's protective. I cursed myself. \"I know you can. I'm just going to do it for you,\" he replied. I glowed on the inside. I was happy that he wanted to take care of me. A few minutes later we were in front of his house. We walked inside and he pointed at the couch. I chuckled and sat down. He came back with a first aid kit and a wet rag. He sat down and began to gently wash my hands. \"What about your date?\" I asked remembering. \"She had left before this happened,\" he replied. I nodded as he tenderly rubbed some anti-bacteria cream on my cut up hands. He began to wrap my hands. \"Thanks,\" I told him. \"No problem,\" he replied with a charming smile. I loved his smiles. This was a smile he reserved for only me. I had never seen him give that smile to anyone else. I loved it. When he finished he kissed both my hands and I started doing girlie shrieks in my head. \"Well you're all patched up,\" he said packing away his kit. \"Thanks again,\" I told him. \"You'd do it for me,\" he replied with a wink. I smiled then frowned. \"Crap, FDR brought me. I don't have my car. Would you mind taking me home?\" \"Why don't you just stay here? You still have some clothes in the guest room don't you?\" he asked. My heart soared. \"Thanks Tuck.\" He smiled at me. I went to the guest room and looked for a pajama shirt. \"Hey Tuck,\" I called, \"Can I barrow a shirt?\" He popped out of his room and tossed me one his old flannels. \"Thanks,\" I said with a wink. I shut my door and changed into his shirt. I inhaled loving his scent. He smelled like wood smoke and unique cologne. The shirt fell to the tops of my thighs. I sighed happily and slipped under the covers. I fell asleep instantly my dreams filled with British accents and charming smiles.[Chapter 4] Sorry this is short. Part Four The next morning I walked into the kitchen yawning. I opened the fridge and peered inside. I pulled out the eggs and some bacon. I started cooking making scramble eggs and warm bacon. \"I smell bacon,\" Tuck called. I laughed. \"That's because I'm making some,\" I called back. He walked in and stopped. His blue grey eyes raked over my body. I remembered that I was wearing his shirt. \"Oh sorry, I'll put on some pants,\" I told him walking to my room. You idiot. Normal woman would have stayed and tried to seduce him. I cursed myself again and pulled on some jeans. I was horrible at being a girl. The day passed quickly with nothing exciting happening. At home I played with Angel for a while before going to bed. The next day I was woken by FDR's ring tone. I blinked groggily and picked up the phone. \"What?\" I growled. It was four in the morning. I was not ready to be up. \"I'm bored,\" he demanded. \"What?\" I growled again. \"We should hang out today,\" he explained. \"Go away,\" I ordered hanging up. I closed my eyes. My phone rang again. I answered it. \"Go away,\" I snarled. \"But we haven't talked in so long,\" came a voice I never wanted to hear again. I bolted upright. \"Dad,\" I whispered.[Chapter 5] Part Five \"Hello Rayne,\" he greeted in his cold voice. I began to hyperventilate. \"How did you get my number?\" I asked in a panicked voice. \"I have my sources,\" he replied. \"Well I have to work,\" I said quickly pressing the end call button. I dialed FDR's number. \"I need you and Tuck over here now,\" I snapped into the phone. Exactly seven minutes later my door opened and Tuck and FDR walked in. I was curled up on the floor between my couch and the wall with my cat in my lap. \"What's wrong?\" they both asked coming over. \"My dad called,\" I whispered. I knew I was pale and freaked out. They exchanged angry glances. They hated my father for abusing me as a kid. \"It's ok. You're a professional spy, you are an excellent mixed martial artist, you have two best friends who won't let anyone hurt you and you have narrowly escaped death many times. Everything will be fine,\" Tuck told me firmly. I nodded and uncoiled from around Angel. She leaped off me and they both helped me stand. \"I'll be fine,\" I muttered. At work I was happy with doing reports. They kept my mind busy so I wouldn't think about my father being able to call me. Every time the phone rang I jumped. I was tapping away when Tuck and FDR spoke up. \"What were you doing on the computer?\" FDR asked Tuck. \"Looking at a picture of my girl,\" Tuck replied. I looked up feeling my heart clench. \"I was doing a background check on mine,\" FDR announced. I rolled my eyes. \"That's kind of creepy FDR,\" I told him. He waved his hand at me. \"Want to see her?\" he asked Tuck. \"Sure, want to see mine?\" they agreed. I waited with bated breath. They counted to three and flipped their computers around. My breath stopped as I stared at the two pictures. \"Lauran Scott?\" they both asked. It was the same picture of a blonde haired blue eyed woman. I stood and walked between their desks wondering what was going to happen. \"You know what, you date her Tuck,\" FDR said. I bit my lip hoping he would refuse. \"Besides if I got in the picture it wouldn't even be fair,\" he continued. I closed my eyes and shook my head. \"What's that mean?\" Tuck asked. \"I'm going to get some coffee,\" I interjected. \"Well, you aren't out there as much as me,\" FDR explained. \"Do you guys want some?\" I asked in vain. \"Well why don't we just let her decide?\" Tuck asked. \"That's a bad idea,\" I said. They ignored me. \"Fine,\" FDR agreed. \"Guys, two guys who know each other dating the same girl is a recipe for disaster,\" I told them praying they would back out. \"I think we should put up a few rules,\" Tuck said. I threw my hands in the air. \"I think we should,\" FDR approved. \"Rule one, we shouldn't tell her we know her.\" \"Guys, please don't do this,\" I begged. \"Number two, let's stay out of each others way.\" \"FDR please, stop this now,\" I pleaded. \"Three, if it affects our friendship we back out.\" \"Trust me it's going to mess with our friendship,\" I said. They both looked at me. \"We weren't talking about all three of us,\" Tuck told me. I stared at him feeling like a knife had just been thrust into my chest. Tears pricked my eyes but I swallowed them down. \"Right,\" I mumbled fleeing the room. That night I replayed that over and over again in my head. What? Did they think this wouldn't affect me? My two partners and best friends were fighting over a girl and they thought I wouldn't be affected. I turned angry now. How could they be so selfish? I turned and buried my head in my pillow. I wanted to cry but I was seasoned hardened spy. I never cried, not anymore.[Chapter 6] Part Six The next day Tuck ran to my desk. He looked excited and very happy. \"What's up?\" I asked wearily. I hadn't slept very well last night. \"I had a date last night with Lauran. We went to the carnival,\" he told me. I blinked at him. \"I thought we were going to the carnival together,\" I blurted. We had made plans for it a few weeks ago. \"Oh, sorry I forgot,\" he said. I felt my heart hurt. \"Its fine,\" I told him lying through my teeth. \"Ok great,\" he cheered moving away. I watched him go feeling like someone had punched me. FDR suddenly pranced up. \"I have a date with Lauran,\" he sang. \"Great,\" I grunt going back to my reports. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. I looked up with a sigh and smiled. \"Nothing, just a bit stressed and tired,\" I told him. He sat down on my desk. \"Don't worry about your dad, nothing will happen,\" he said reassuringly. I nodded feeling sick to my stomach. I hadn't thought about my dad in light of this problem with Tuck and FDR. He walked away and my head thudded onto my desk. That night Tuck called me into the mission room. Agents Bothwick and Boyle were with him. \"I'm doing recon on FDR's date,\" he told me. \"And? Why am I here?\" I asked. \"I want you to watch with me,\" he said. I stared at him and quickly shook my head. \"No way Tuck. I'm not getting in the middle of this,\" I told him leaving as fast as possible. I raced home feeling a strong desire to hit something. Once home I changed into my gym clothes and ran to the gym near the apartment. \"Hey Rayne,\" Hec greeted. I didn't reply too furious to speak. I stomped to the punching bags and glared at them. I punched one and the dam broke. I began to beat the crap out of the bag feeling every bad feeling coming out with every punch. I began to punch faster the thud of my fists becoming the only sound I could hear. Someone tapped my shoulder. I turned and slammed my fist into his jaw without thinking. \"Ouch,\" we both yelped. My fist hurt. \"Jeez Rayne,\" Tuck complained. \"I'm…\" I cut myself off. Now that I focused I realized that I wasn't sorry for punching him in the face. \"What's wrong? You only come here when something is terribly wrong? Is it your dad?\" he asked. I sighed and shoved my hair from my face. I was sweaty and gross. \"Yes, it's my dad. I'm worried that he'll find me.\" I was worried but that wasn't the reason I was here. \"I've told you not to worry,\" Tuck started but I cut him off violently. \"Well Tuck I'm sorry but I can't just turn it off. He abused me as a kid, mentally, physically, emotionally and sexually. I can't just not be worried because you said so. I'm sorry your magic powers of ordering worry away aren't working,\" I yelled. I felt strung out and ready to kill. I needed an assassination job. He was silent as he stared at me. I instantly felt ashamed. Why should I? He's being a jerk. I thought angrily. I crossed my arms and blew a strand of hair away from my eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" he said quietly, \"I'll just go.\" My anger dissolved. I grabbed his arm. \"No, I'm sorry. I'm just stressed right now and scared that my father will find me. I shouldn't have yelled at you,\" I apologized. Tuck smiled slightly and hugged me. I sighed and relaxed into his arms. It was probably just my imagination but we fit together perfectly. \"Why don't you take turns staying with FDR and I? You might feel a little safer,\" he offered. I was tempted, oh so tempted to take his offer but I shook my head. \"No, I couldn't. What if you want to bring Lauran home or something? I'll be fine,\" I told him with a confident laugh. He smiled and nodded, never seeing the panic and sorrow below the surface.[Chapter 7] Part Seven The next morning I was once again woken way too early by FDR's ringtone. I growled and slapped the phone to my ear. \"This had better be good,\" I growled. \"Ok, Lauran is so confusing. First she hates me, then she kisses me, then we get along for some reason,\" he told me quickly. \"Why are you telling me this? I'm not getting in the middle of this,\" I replied tiredly. It had been another restless night. \"Well what does that mean?\" he asked. \"It means you were a jerk then something happened to make her kiss you and she decided to give you a second chance. If you ever wake me up again I will kill you,\" I explained hanging up. I set my phone aside and sat up blearily. It was only four but since I was already awake I might as well get up and get a jump on the day. I fed Angel, did an early work out and ate some breakfast. By six I was ready for the day. I drove to the agency and went to my desk. I waved to Tuck before sitting down. \"You reconned my date,\" FDR burst out. I glanced up noticing that he was pacing. Tuck looked sheepish. \"Yeah,\" he replied quietly. \"And if something had happened? What were you going to do? Send in a hit squad? Shoot me on site?\" FDR was fuming and I could tell this was turning deadly. I stood ready to intervene. \"No, I wasn't. Look how about we just have a rule bout no hanky-panky,\" Tuck offered. I looked at him with an arched eyebrow. \"Did you really just say hanky-panky?\" FDR and I asked at the same time. He flushed looked embarrassed but determined. \"Fine,\" FDR agreed sitting down. I did as well. \"Look I really like this girl,\" Tuck began. My heart squeezed. \"So do I,\" FDR replied. I cheered him on in my head. \"No, I mean I really like Lauran,\" Tuck pressed. I scowled into my reports. FDR looked up. \"So do I,\" he repeated. Please win FDR. \"So you aren't backing off?\" \"Nope.\" Tuck looked annoyed then smug. \"Well just so you know. Lauran and had a great time on our date and we shared a kiss,\" he said with a dreamy look in his eyes. I wanted to throw a book at him. FDR chuckled. \"So did we lover boy,\" he told him. Tuck glared at him then went back to typing. Later that day I went to Tuck's son's dojo where he was learning karate. I was supposed to meet Tuck here but I didn't see him. I cheered Joe on though. He was like my nephew anyways. \"Come on Joe,\" I called. The other kid tackled him and began punching at him. Luckily Joe was protecting his face. I winced with every blow though. \"Great job son,\" the other dad called. I sighed as they parted. Joe came over to me looking miserable. \"I got creamed,\" he said sadly. \"No you didn't get creamed. You just need a bit more practice is all,\" I told him kissing his forehead. He sat down and I went to grab his bag. \"Where's dad?\" he asked. I looked at him sadly. Tuck was learning all about Lauran right now. \"He's busy at work,\" I told him with a smile. Suddenly a hand smacked my butt. I straightened and turned to find the other dad. \"Pain is just weakness leaving the body isn't it?\" he asked with a joking grin. I smiled and took his wrist in a gentle grip. He smiled at me. I grinned and pressed my thumb into a nerve there. His face went white and he about collapsed. \"Don't ever touch me again,\" I told him cheerfully. I grabbed Joe's bag and slung it over my shoulder. \"Come on Joe,\" I called. \"That was awesome,\" he told me. I laughed. We walked outside and I saw Katie waiting for us. I opened the door for Joe ad handed him his bag. \"See you kid,\" I told him. He waved with a smile. \"See you later Katie,\" I called with a wave. \"Where was Tuck?\" she asked. \"Work,\" I replied with a shrug. She nodded, waved and left. I sighed and wondered what I was going to do now. Being grounded meant that I didn't have anything to do at work and I wasn't used to that. A cold prickle down my neck made me tense. My hand automatically found the gun in the waist band of my jeans. And everyone wonders why I wear long shirts. I looked around recognizing the feeling of being watched. My quick eyes found a car I had never seen but I didn't focus on it. Maybe I was paranoid but it felt like the eyes were all around me. \"Hey Rayne,\" a voice called. I turned and saw Justin, one of the karate teachers at the dojo. \"Hi Justin,\" I greeted my voice tense. \"You left this behind,\" he told me handing me my cell phone. I did a quick check of my pockets. I was surprised when they were empty. \"Oh, thanks Justin,\" I told him with a smile. He smiled back. \"No problem. Hey I was wondering if maybe you'd like to go out to dinner tonight?\" he asked quickly. A hopeful light entered his eyes. He looked like an eager puppy. I was about to refuse but changed my mind. \"Sure, I'd like that,\" I told him. He breathed a sigh of relief. \"Great, how about I pick you up around seven?\" I nodded and he bounded off. He was like a puppy and I thought he was kind of cute. I smiled and went to my car. Tuck's ringtone jingled from my phone. \"Hey,\" I greeted. \"Hey, can you bring chips tonight?\" he asked I bit my lip. I had forgotten that tonight was movie night at FDR's place. \"I'm sorry but I have a date tonight,\" I said. There was silence on the other end. \"Tuck?\" \"You have a date? With who?\" \"Justin from Joe's dojo,\" I answered. Another long silence. I rolled my eyes and got into my car. \"It's not like I've never gone on a date before,\" I snapped. \"But you don't date,\" he stated. That made me angry for some reason. \"Well apparently I do. I have to go. Goodbye Tuck,\" I said shortly hanging up. \"Stupid boys,\" I grumbled leaving the parking lot.[Chapter 8] Part Eight That night I wore a simple black dress and some heels. My hair was curled and in a bun with two locks framing my face. I had called Justin earlier and gave him my address. I examined myself in the mirror one last time. I was pretty when I decided to be with long black hair and pale grey eyes. I had clear tan skin and a slender athletic build. I sighed and went into the living room as there was a knock on my door. \"Bye Angel,\" I called grabbing my purse and my jacket. I opened the door and smiled at Justin. His longish brown hair fell into clear green eyes and he wore a nice button up shirt and some black slacks. \"You look beautiful,\" he told me honestly. I felt my cheeks warm and I smiled. \"Thank you,\" I replied. We walked down to his car and he opened the door for me. \"I'm glad to know gentlemanly behavior isn't dead,\" I told him with another smile. He chuckled and shut the door behind me. He got in and started to the car. A beautiful song came on. \"Oh I love Nightwish,\" I said humming along with the music. \"Really? What's your favorite song?\" he asked. \"It's too hard to decide between I Want My Tears Back and Turn Loose the Mermaids,\" I replied with a smile. We spent the ride discussing Nightwish songs. At the restaurant he once again opened my door for me. I smiled at him. We walked inside and the hostess led us to a booth. I thought she looked familiar but dismissed it. \"So, what do you like to do?\" Justin asked as we looked over our menus. \"Read, swim, jog, play with my cat,\" I listed deciding to pick the Fettuccini Alfredo. \"You like cats? I do to but I have a dog,\" he replied. We talked about animals for a while, ordered and in a small lull I looked around. I spotted a man in suit that looked familiar. I was trying to place him when none other than Tuck and FDR walked in. It dawned on me. The man in the suit, the hostess, the couple in the corner, they were all spies. Tuck and FDR were reconning my date. \"You ok? You look a little out of sorts,\" Justin asked. I smiled at him but my blood was boiling. \"I'm ok I just have to use the bathroom real quick,\" I replied standing. I grabbed my purse and walked to the bathroom. Once there I ripped my cell phone from my purse and dialed Tuck's number. \"Hello,\" he greeted. \"You, buddy boy, are in so much trouble. I cannot believe that you and FDR are actually spying on my date,\" I whisper shrieked into the phone. \"We just wanted to make sure everything was going smoothly,\" came FDR's voice. I growled. \"I swear that tomorrow I am going to kick both of your asses. How dare you spy on me?\" I snarled. \"We're your friends. We want to make sure you're safe,\" Tuck said in a soothing voice. \"In case you don't remember, I can take care of myself. So here's how tonight is going to go. You are going to call out your team and tell them get the hell out. Then, you are going to eat as fast as you possibly can and leave. Am I understood?\" I snapped. \"Yes ma'am,\" Tuck replied in a meek voice. \"Good,\" I shut my phone off and slammed it back into my purse. I took a few deep calming breaths. \"Jealous ex-boyfriends?\" a woman I hadn't noticed before asked. \"Worse,\" I muttered, \"Over protective best friends.\" She gave me a sympathetic look. I calmed myself down; made sure I looked alright in the mirror then went back outside. I shot Tuck and FDR a glare then put on a smile for Justin. \"Hey, sorry about that,\" I told him sliding into my seat. \"No problem,\" he replied with that easy smile of his. We kept talking about book, movies, music and animals. Justin was so easy to have a conversation with and he was always interjecting compliments that made me smile and blush. It was nice to be appreciated and thought of as an actual woman. After we ate I didn't want the night to end. I really enjoyed Justin's company. \"Why don't we go for a walk?\" Justin suggested. I was all too happy to agree. We went to a little park and began to walk around it. \"So, I'm sorry if this is a weird question, but how is it that you're single?\" Justin asked. I chuckled. \"I'm serious. You're funny, smart, beautiful. I don't understand,\" he continued. I shrugged. \"I travel a lot for my job so I don't get a chance to meet many guys and the two guys I work with see me as their best friend and one of the guys, you know?\" I explained. We reached his car once more. \"Well they're blind,\" he told me. He drove me home and walked me to my door. \"I had a really good time tonight Justin,\" I told him honestly. \"I did too. Maybe we can do it again sometime,\" he replied with a smile. \"Definitely,\" I told him. His smile grew wider and I hesitated. Was I supposed to kiss him? I kind of wanted to. Should I? Suddenly he leaned in and pressed our lips together. There were no fireworks but the kiss was nice. His lips were soft and his hands were gentle on my arms. We parted and I breathed again. \"Goodnight,\" he whispered. Before I could reply he walked down to his car whistling. I unlocked my door and went inside sinking against it. It had been a wonderful night. \"Angel, I had a great time tonight,\" I told her peeling off my jacket. I hung it up and turned. \"Glad to know it,\" came my father's voice from the couch.[Chapter 9] Part Nine I froze. My apartment was dark. I hadn't turned on the lights but I could see the shape of my father standing up. \"How did you get in?\" I asked my voice weak and small and quiet. \"I have my ways. Now Rayne, you are in trouble,\" he replied. My head began to spin and I heard roaring in my ears. That's what he always said before a beating. This was too much like my childhood, the dark lights, his broad shouldered form coming for me. \"You shouldn't have run away,\" he growled. He lunged and I fell back panicked. I scrambled back to my feet and bolted for the door. \"Rayne!\" he roared but I flung the door wide and raced out into the street. My heart was galloping and only one thought pounded in my brain. Survival. I had to get away. I bolted down the street hearing a car start. I pushed myself even faster but a heel broke and I tumbled to the pavement. I tore the shoes off, jumped back up and bolted once more, leaving the shoes behind. I ran. I couldn't stop running. A car suddenly flung in front of me. \"No!\"I screamed as a door opened and hand pulled me inside. I kicked and thrashed and bit. I heard yelps. \"Rayne, Rayne, calm down, it's us,\" a familiar British voice broke through my panic. I stopped and stared into Tuck's grey blue eyes. I was in FDR's car. He was driving. My father hadn't gotten me. I collapsed against Tuck in relief and began to cry into his shirt. I was shaking and I clenched my hands into fists. I clung to him and he held me. \"What happened?\" FDR asked gently. I felt him rubbing my back soothingly. \"Dad, house, came, ran,\" I stammered unable to string a sentence together. I was shaking and crying too hard. \"Take a deep breath and try to calm down,\" Tuck told me in a tender voice. I took several deep breaths but my heart continued to race and tears continued to stream down my face. \"My dad was in the house,\" I finally managed. I closed my eyes, memories of my childhood flickering on my closed lids. \"We're going to go to your apartment and grab you some clothes and then you are coming to my house and we are all going to stay there tonight,\" FDR told me. His voice shook with anger. I nodded still clinging to Tuck. I heard FDR move then felt the car start up. Tuck kept murmuring random nothings in my ear trying to calm me down. My father was gone when we got back. I held FDR's and Tuck's hands as we walked inside. There was no sign of him in the living room. I avoided looking at the couch and went to my room. The sight that greeted me almost made me collapse. There was sign he had been here after all. The only way the apartment remembered he had been there was the fact that Angel lay dead on the ground with blood on her claws.[Chapter 10] Part Ten I sat on FDR's couch with him and Tuck on either side of me. The TV was on but I don't think any of us were watching it. I kept seeing flashes of him beating me and dragging me upstairs. I flinched and buried my head in the pillow I was squeezing to my chest. FDR rubbed my back and Tuck rested his hand on my knee. I took several shaky breaths then looked back up. I still couldn't quite believe that my father was here. FDR's phone rang. I jumped at the sound. \"Oh hey Lauran,\" he said getting up and moving away. I bit my lip watching him. \"Sure, no problem. Ok, I'll see you tomorrow,\" he said before hanging up and coming back over. \"What was that all about?\" Tuck asked jealousy in his voice. \"Lauran wanted to see me tomorrow,\" FDR replied mildly. I sensed that Tuck was about to say something else. \"Please don't,\" I started with a sigh, \"Please can we just put aside Lauran tonight?\" They both looked at me. Surprisingly I didn't feel selfish for asking them to focus on me for a change. \"Of course,\" Tuck said. \"Yeah,\" FDR agreed. We all shifted around and I was able to rest my back on Tuck's chest and my head on his shoulder with my feet in FDR's lap. FDR began to rub my feet and Tuck wrapped his arms around me. I knew Tuck's actions were only those of a best friend but I allowed myself to pretend, just for tonight, that we were together. Pain ripped through my back as dad kicked me. He picked me up and threw me into a wall. I woke with a gasp and Tuck immediately rubbed circles into my back. I had been moved to the bed. I calmed down and went back to sleep. Dad pounded into me and I screamed in pain. I jolted upright with a scream. FDR began to massage my shoulders and murmur assurances in my ear. Dad laughed as he slapped me. I saw stars and he began to punch me. And so it went on. All night I was woken by nightmares and every time I did Tuck or FDR was there to calm me down and put me back to sleep. In the morning both of them were exhausted. I felt guilty for keeping them awake so I decided to make them breakfast. I made them breakfast burritos and poured them freshly made coffee just how both of them liked it. They came downstairs yawning but smiled at me. \"I'm really sorr…\" they cut me off. \"Don't even think about apologizing,\" they both told me. I sighed and ate my food. FDR and Tuck both went on dates with Lauran. Tuck took her driving in a cool car that he rented and FDR showed her painting that he fake owned and I worked on the Heinrich case. \"Great, I have to go to a stripper joint,\" I muttered as I talked with Collins. \"Make sure Tuck and FDR are ready to go with you,\" she told me before walking away. \"Yeah right,\" I muttered. The comradeship they had two days ago was gone. It made me sad and happy that I was the reason they had decided to put aside Lauran for a day. I was happy because it proved once more how much they cared about me and I was sad that it took my father showing up to make it happen. \"Guys Heinrich has a friend named Ivan who'll be at a strip joint tomorrow night. Get ready. I'm going to be first and you two are going to be my bodyguards,\" I told them slapping down the files on their desks. They had been having another whose bigger contest. \"I'll see you guys tomorrow,\" I finished grabbing my bag and walking out to my car. My phone rang and I saw Joe's name light up my screen. \"Hey Joe, what's up?\" I asked. Joe hardly ever called me. \"Can you come pick me up? Mom is working and dad was supposed to pick me up,\" he said. I blew out a sigh. \"Ok, I'll be right there,\" I told him. I started to drive and dialed Tuck's number. \"I'm picking up your son and taking him to Katie's,\" I bit out. I hung up before he could stammer out any excuses. I parked outside of Joe's school and got out. He was waiting for me on the stone wall. \"Hey Joe,\" I greeted hugging him. \"Hi,\" he greeted in a sad voice. I smiled at him trying to lift his spirits. \"Come on, I'll take you to Katie's and stay until she comes home,\" I told him. He nodded and we went back to the car. I drove him to his mom's house and he grabbed the key from under the mat. We walked in and I headed for the kitchen. \"Do you want something to eat?\" I called. \"Mac and cheese,\" he called from the living room. I smiled and pulled a pan out. I grabbed a package and began to cook it. I heard the TV playing. \"Thank you Rayne,\" he told me. Something nagged at me. \"Hey Joe, why do you always call Frank uncle but you never call me aunt?\" I asked. He looked at me with wide eyes. \"Because I keep hoping I'll get to call you mom,\" he replied. He skipped off as I stared at the place he had been. Tears pricked my eyes but they were tears of happiness. I had at least one vote of support.[Chapter 11] Part Eleven I was about to add the macaroni to the boiling water when I heard Joe scream. \"Joe!\" I cried running out of the kitchen. What I saw chilled my blood. My father held Joe in his arms with a gun to his head. \"Let him go,\" I said in a tightly controlled voice. \"I will if you decide to come with me,\" he replied. \"I will go with you. I will, just let Joe go and don't hurt him,\" I told him. He nodded and people behind me and they grabbed my arms. \"Rayne,\" Joe cried. \"Don't worry Joe, I'll be fine,\" I told him. \"Mom,\" he stammered. Everything froze as dad's eyes glinted. \"I see why you are so protective now,\" he taunted with a cold smile. I could barely breathe as he examined the situation. Suddenly he shoved Joe forward. \"Take them both,\" he ordered. A man grabbed Joe and my brain calculated the odds. If I disabled the two men holding me under five seconds then I could get to my dad in seven seconds by jumping over the couch. By that time he would have drawn his gun and I would have to disarm him while not allowing him to hurt me. I did these calculations in five seconds and began my plan. I slammed my foot into one guy's shins and spun around punching the other guy. I bolted for the couch leaping over it and using my momentum to launch myself into my dad. I slammed my hand into the gun and applied force to his throat. I felt his hands grab at me but I kneed him in the groin. I kept applying pressure until I heard Joe yell. I panicked and applied to much. Dad coughed and passed out. I spun around grabbing dad's gun and threw it without thinking. The butt of the gun slammed into the last man's forehead and he was knocked unconscious. I ran over and grabbed Joe. \"Are you ok? Are you hurt?\" I asked in a panic frantically checking him over. \"I'm ok. Who was that?\" he asked. \"He doesn't matter,\" I replied hugging him tightly, \"Now I want you to do exactly as I say. I want you to go upstairs and get changed for bed. I'll bring you up some food later and do not tell you mom, dad or Uncle Frank about this ok?\" I told him. He nodded and ran upstairs. I whipped out my phone. \"Collins I need a clean up squad at 458 Newman,\" I snapped into the phone. \"Sending one right away,\" she replied. I dragged the men nearer to each other and began to watch them making sure that none woke. One did I quickly sent him back to unconsciousness with a frying pan slammed to the face. Finally the clean up crew got here. \"I don't care what you do with the others but keep this one alive and ready for questioning,\" I told them. They nodded and grabbed the men. Within seconds they were gone and I went around making sure nothing was out of place. I took a deep breath and made Joe and peanut butter and jelly sandwich. \"Here you go Joe,\" I told him. He ate in silence. \"You won't tell anyone right?' I asked to make sure. \"Nope,\" he replied. I breathed a sigh of relief. My phone rang at midnight. I blinked groggily and pressed the phone to my ear. \"What?\" I asked groggily. It was Tuck and for a minute I was terrified that Joe had broken his promise. \"Can you become friends with Lauran?\" he asked. I stared at the wall for a moment. \"Pardon,\" I replied feeling my voice grow cold. \"FDR and I need someone we can trust and talk to,\" he said. I blinked. \"I told you that I'm not getting into the middle of this,\" I said. \"You wouldn't be. you would just be finding out who she likes better,\" he replied. \"That would be getting in the middle of this. No,\" I finished hanging up. Tuck called again and then FDR called but I just shut my phone off and went back to sleep. They deserve it.[Chapter 12] Part Twelve The next day I spent the day at work getting ready for tonight. I picked out a short black and blue party dress and heels that I could step out of quickly. I curled my hair and did my makeup so I looked like an elegant tramp. Finally I put on the clothes and walked out to meet Tuck and FDR who were once again arguing. \"Guys, get your heads in the game,\" I told them shortly. They glanced over and stopped. Another agent passing by wolf whistled. \"Damn Rayne,\" he said, \"You look good.\" I gave him a flirty smile. \"Thanks Brian,\" I replied with a wink. I saw Tuck look away and rolled my eyes. He was such an overprotective friend. We reached the club with them arguing over who was going in first. I whirled on them. \"I'm going in first,\" I snapped. I turned back to the bouncer and put on a thick accent. \"I'm a friend of Ivan's,\" I purred. The bouncer gave me an obvious once over before letting us pass. I sauntered through the club swaying my hips. I pushed open the door and rested a hand on my hip while giving Ivan a sultry look. \"Hi,\" I greeted in an alluring voice. His eyes raked over my body. \"Well hello,\" he replied. I stepped forward and saw his eyes harden on Tuck and FDR. \"Oh pay them no mind. They are just my bodyguards,\" I told him with a toss of my hair and a laugh. I moved over to him and wrapped an arm around his neck. I hated the feel of him close to me but I had to get him outside. I put my lips next to his ear. \"Why don't we get away? From my bodyguards, from your friends?\" I breathed. \"I'd love to,\" he replied. I giggled and felt his hand slid down my back to rest on my butt. My face showed no expression but suddenly he was wrenched away from me. Tuck spun him around and slammed a fist into his jaw. \"Tuck,\" I screeched. Guns came out and bullets flew. I felt a stinging pain but it was quickly pushed aside as Ivan bolted. I raced after him jumping out of my heels. He jumped onto the stage but I just ran alongside it. When I reached the end I veered and used my momentum to push off from the bar and I grabbed one of the pools. I kept my body straight as my momentum spun me around and smashed my heels into Ivan's face. I slid to a stop and took a deep breath. I hitched up my dress and grabbed my handcuffs. I handcuffed his wrists together. I stepped back and was suddenly aware of a sharp burning pain in my arm. I looked down and saw blood pouring down my arm. A bullet must have nicked me. I clapped my hand to it trying to stop the blood. \"Rayne, are you alright?\" Tuck cried. I spun around glaring daggers at him. \"No Tuck, I'm not. I just got nicked by a bullet because of your stupid over protectiveness. You almost ruined the mission,\" I snarled. A backup squad came in before I could say anything else. \"Come with us,\" they told me. I followed them out to the ambulance they had brought. I sat down in the back and they began to patch up my arm. I was still fuming from Tuck's poor decision making. Ever since Lauran had broken into our lives things had been ruined between the three of us. I made a choice as I sat in the back of the ambulance. The next day I stepped into Collins's office. I shut the door and looked her square in the eye. \"I want to be transferred.\"[Chapter 13] Part Thirteen I was passing Tuck and FDR's recon room when I heard Lauran talking to her best friend Trisha. I stepped inside, a morbid curiosity driving me inside. \"They're both amazing,\" Lauran was saying. \"Come on, you're complaining about how amazing these two guys are? Come on, give me some flaws,\" Trisha replied. Lauran thought for a moment. \"Ok, FDR has these tiny jazz hands,\" she told Trisha. I bit back a laugh but Tuck didn't. He burst into laughter and FDR glared. \"Well you know that means he has a mike and ike for a penis,\" Trisha told her. I almost didn't manage to control my giggles. \"You know I don't. You've seen it,\" FDR shot at Tuck. \"And Tuck,\" Lauran started. Tuck stopped laughing and we both looked at the screen. \"He's British,\" she finished. Trisha shook her head. \"What does that have to do with anything?\" Tuck asked the air. I rolled my eyes and slipped back out. Later that day I began to pack up my desk. I had been transferred to solo operations. I picked up the lamp FDR had gotten for my birthday last year and a funny thought occurred to me. Tomorrow was my twenty fifth birthday. I stopped packing feeling weird. I hadn't even thought about it. I was sure that there wouldn't be a celebration like usual. Tuck and FDR were too busy fighting each other and if I hadn't remembered it then I knew they hadn't. I shook my head and continued packing as the two men in question came in shooting death glares at each other. \"Look, I don't care anymore who Lauran chooses but this between us is over FDR,\" Tuck said suddenly. My hand clenched around the pencil holder I was packing. \"Agreed, I'll go ask Collins for a transfer tomorrow,\" FDR replied. I finished packing my box and hoisted onto my hip. This was my last box. Something caught my eye before I moved away. I had brought my photo album and box of trinkets to the office after dad had attacked me. I set my box back down and grabbed both. \"Guys,\" I cut through their babble. They both looked at me. \"I want you two to have these,\" I said handing them the box and album. They both looked confused until I picked up my packed box again. \"What's going on?\" FDR asked warily. \"I've been transferred to solo ops,\" I told them. They both looked shocked and immediately began talking. \"We'll go talk to Collins,\" FDR offered. \"We'll sort this out,\" Tuck continued. \"I asked for this,\" I said softly. They both fell silent. I shifted my box and started for the door. \"Why?\" they both whispered. \"Because if I die in this job, I don't want to die because someone I trust makes a mistake and you two have been making mistakes that have gotten me hurt. I can't do it anymore,\" I replied before walking out.[Chapter 14] Part Fourteen I set my box on my new desk and blew a string of hair out of my eyes. I pulled the lamp out and set it on the corner. Suddenly my door burst open and FDR ran in. \"Heinrich is here,\" he blurted. \"What?\" I shrieked. \"I saw him on camera. We have to go get Tuck. He's with Lauran right now. She chose him,\" his voice turned quiet and my heart clenched but I grabbed my jacket. \"Show me and then we'll go,\" I said. He took me down to the recon room and showed me the picture. It was a bit blurry but I knew it was Heinrich. \"Let's go,\" I snapped. We parked outside of the restaurant and both of us ran inside. I took a deep breath and pointed out Tuck. We walked up to him and I gave him and Lauran and effortless smile even though my heart felt like someone was driving a stake through it. \"FDR, this is my friend Tuck,\" Lauran introduced with a nervous laugh. She looked at me. \"I'm Rayne,\" I said quickly knowing that didn't explain anything but not knowing what else to say. \"Well I have to go to the bathroom. Order me a drink and a shot please,\" Lauran told us before getting up and scurrying away. \"Tuck, Heinrich is here,\" FDR told him. \"You couldn't lose like a man could you?\" Tuck growled. \"Tuck, he's telling the truth. I saw the picture,\" I interjected. \"Rayne, shut up. FDR and I have stuff to handle,\" Tuck cut me off. I stared at him for a moment then growled and punched him. He turned with shock in his eyes. He swung at me but I ducked and he hit FDR. That didn't go over so well. They began to fight and even though I had thrown the first punch I knew they needed to stop. \"Come on guys, stop,\" I called. Tuck was sent rolling over a table and FDR grabbed a knife. \"No,\" I screeched as he threw it. Luckily he missed and it landed in the chair where Tuck's head had been. The fighting continued and I moved out of the way. \"Stop,\" I cried. With a lunge they both careened for me and all three of us were falling over the balcony. There was a moment of weightlessness and then my back slammed into a table. I yelped and rolled off onto broken glass cutting up my hands and face. \"Thanks guys,\" I groaned painfully pushing myself up. \"I should have killed you in Morocco when I had the chance,\" FDR groaned at Tuck. \"I was the only thing keeping you alive in Morocco mate,\" Tuck replied. I noticed something and bit my lip. \"You two know each other,\" Lauran shrieked. They both fell silent. \"You two know each other,\" she repeated. She shook her head and spun around to leave. \"Wait Lauran,\" Tuck called. \"I can explain,\" FDR shouted. Their voices began to overlap and they began to argue once more. I rolled my eyes and I ran after her. Apparently I was the only one who could handle this situation. \"Wait Lauran,\" I called outside. I ran and grabbed the side of her friend's little yellow bug. \"Please, just wait. They're both really good guys and you don't know me but I can promise you that they are both great guys,\" I told her. \"Yes they are,\" a voice said from behind me. I spun around. \"Heinrich,\" I gasped. His fist slammed into my jaw and I reeled backwards falling into the back of Lauran's bug. I was seeing stars and felt the car move. \"What's happening?\" I asked once I had regained my senses. We were surrounded by big black sedans. \"How do you know Tuck and FDR?\" Lauran called to me. \"I work with them,\" I replied pulling the gun out I had slipped into the waist band of my jeans. \"Is that a gun?\" Lauran shrieked. Suddenly a red jeep pulled up with Tuck and FDR in it. \"Hand off,\" FDR shouted. I nodded and grabbed Lauran. I pulled her to the back and FDR grabbed her. \"Sorry Trisha,\" I told Lauran's friend. I yanked the steering wheel to the side and jumped. FDR caught me and settled me in the back seat. \"Thanks buddy,\" I told him with a smile. He smiled back and Tuck swerved. We drove down into a parking garage. \"Tuck you didn't lose them,\" I called. \"Lauran I need you to take the wheel,\" Tuck told her as FDR and I prepared ourselves. She did, her face pale and scared. Suddenly and without warning she spun the wheel. I saw Tuck almost fall out. \"FDR,\" I shouted shooting at the car coming up beside us. FDR grabbed Tuck and yanked him up. Tuck and I both shot taking out the two people in the front. We all looked at each other for a long moment. \"I've missed you guys,\" I told them. \"We've missed you to,\" they shouted back. We jumped back on an actual road and a new car joined the chase. I looked around for something to use against them. I spotted a red canister of gas. \"Tuck, FDR,\" I shouted. I pointed at it and we all grinned. FDR grabbed it and we all knelt. He threw the canister and it got lodged under the car's tire. We shot at it and it exploded. \"Yes!\" I cheered. Lauran suddenly spun to a stop making me go toppling. I coughed and wormed my way out of the awkward position I had landed in. \"Lauran I'm sorry. You and Tuck deserve each other,\" FDR said. \"No,\" I whispered. \"No, you deserve her,\" Tuck replied. \"Yes,\" I murmured. \"Tuck, she's already made her choice,\" FDR countered. I shook my head sadly and pushed myself out of the jeep. \"No I haven't,\" Lauran's words made me stop, \"I mean I did but then after finding out everything I have now, I don't know.\" I sighed and heard a loud noise. \"Guys,\" I shouted, \"Heinrich is back.\" We all jumped out and the three of us walked down the road shooting at the glass. \"It's bulletproof,\" Tuck shouted. \"Great,\" I shouted back. \"The headlights,\" Lauran suddenly shouted. We all glanced back at her. \"The airbag deploys in all new models with damage to the headlights,\" she explained. I looked at the boys and nodded. They knelt and I ran back to Lauran. \"Be prepared to run,\" I told her as the car came around the corner. Tuck and FDR shot and suddenly Heinrich's car was slamming into the first car and flipping. \"Lauran,\" I shouted. She grabbed my arms. \"I don't know who to pick,\" she told me weakly. Everything seemed to slow down as the car flipped towards us. \"Lauran, your life depends on you choosing now. Go with the choice you made before all this happened because I swear that they are both the same good men,\" I told her as fast as possible. She nodded and bolted. I heard a shout. I was still standing in the path of the car and it was too close. I gasped, closed my eyes, heard a crunch, and then silence.[Chapter 15] Part Fifteen I coughed as black smoke cleared from the area. I was in warm strong arms that pressed me tightly to a well-muscled chest. I pushed myself up and looked into Tuck's grey blue eyes. He gave me a tight smile and I looked over. Lauran was in FDR's arms. She turned and gave Tuck and apologetic look. I pushed out of Tuck's arms and stood up. \"This is a big mess,\" I muttered moving away so they could have some privacy. I examined the burned blackened out car and realized that Heinrich and the jeep were probably at the end of the drop. \"Oh get a room,\" Tuck groaned. I glanced over as he stood and walked over to me. I sighed and ran a hand through my messy hair. We both heard a whirring noise and turned to see a chopper. \"Um, this isn't good,\" I murmured. \"Agreed,\" Tuck muttered back. We looked at each other and burst into laughter. Later I was sitting in the ambulance with Lauran getting checked out by the paramedics. It was amazing how many injuries I seemed to have that I hadn't felt while in the car chase. \"So all three of you are CIA?\" Lauran asked. \"Yeah, you can understand why they didn't tell you now right?\" I replied. \"Yeah, I guess that wouldn't have been smart of them,\" she said with a laugh. I laughed as well and saw Tuck. I sighed and looked away. I didn't know how he would be after this. \"I saw that,\" Lauran told me in a sing song voice. \"What do you mean?\" I replied giving her a skeptical look. \"Please, I'm a girl. I know when another girl is madly in love with a guy and I can tell that you are madly in love with Tuck,\" she explained. I rolled my eyes but didn't deny it. \"So, why haven't you told him?\" she prodded. I threw my hands up. \"Because I'm scared alright. Men have hurt me a lot and I just don't want to get hurt again and I don't want to wreck our friendship and I don't even think he feels the same way,\" I told her. She gave me a sympathetic look. \"Alright, you're clear,\" a medic told her. She patted my shoulders and stood up. I wrapped the blanket they had given me tighter around my shoulders and watched her talk to Tuck. I wondered what she was saying but shrugged. Pain flashed through my shoulder form one of my various cuts and I blew out an exasperated sigh. Collins would ground us until we healed. \"Hey, how are you feeling?\" Tuck asked. I glanced up realizing that he was done talking to Lauran. \"I'm fine. How are you?\" I replied. \"I'm doing well.\" I arched an eyebrow. He chuckled and stared down at his hands. \"Physically I'm ok, emotionally I'm wrecked,\" he told me. I rubbed his back feeling sorry for him but glad he wasn't taken. \"How long?\" he suddenly asked quietly. I gave him a confused look. \"How long have you been in love with me?\" I blinked and pulled away from. I shot a glare at Lauran who bluntly ignored it. \"Tell me,\" he prodded gently. I took a deep breath and held out my wrist. \"Since Hiroshima,\" I told him. He looked down at the glittering bracelet. \"That's why you never took this off,\" he stated with new understanding. I nodded. \"I've been blind,\" he muttered running a hand through his hair. I chuckled and stared down at my hands. His hand suddenly covered my own. \"Rayne,\" he started but then FDR ran up. \"Buddy,\" he cried pulling Tuck into a hug. I laughed as Tuck hugged him back. \"I'm sorry,\" FDR said. \"I'm sorry too,\" Tuck told him. They looked at each other then turned to me. \"We are both incredibly sorry,\" they said in unison to me. I laughed and hugged them both. \"Just don't let it happen again,\" I teased. \"Trust me, it won't,\" FDR told me glancing back at Lauran. I smiled at his happiness. \"Well I better go explain this to Joe,\" Tuck interjected. I nodded and FDR gave him another hug. \"You're family. That'll never change,\" I heard him whisper. \"I love you man.\" \"I love you too.\" \"Yeah, my family's back together,\" I cheered. \"Are you going to transfer back?\" FDR asked. I gave them a mischievous smile. \"What?\" they both asked. \"I never officially transferred. Collins and I wanted to see if it would get you guys to be friends again,\" I told them with a wink and a smile before I sauntered away. My hand still felt warm where Tuck had held it.[Chapter 16] Part Sixteen The next few days passed in a blur of reports. Tuck kept trying to talk to me but either I avoided him or I was too busy to talk. I was signing out another report when Tuck slapped his hands down on my desk. \"We need to talk and you are not getting away from me this time,\" he told me. I gave him a look. \"Actually I am. I'm scheduled to question someone,\" I told him putting my report in my desk. I stood and gave him a small smile before leaving the room. Joe called me asking if I could come to karate match. He told me Tuck had been teaching him new moves to use. \"I'll be right over,\" I told him with a cheerful smile. I drove to the dojo and walked inside. Tuck was there and Justin. \"Hey,\" Justin greeted warmly. \"Hi,\" I replied glancing at Tuck. He looked tense. \"You looked a little battered. Are you ok?\" Justin asked. \"Yeah, just tired from work,\" I replied, \"Go Joe!\" He took down his opponent with a talented move I recognized as one of Tuck's signature take downs. 'I'll be right back,\" I muttered to Justin. I trotted over to where Joe was hugging Tuck. \"Congratulations Joe, I'm so proud of you,\" I told him. Tuck had turned away to talk to the other dad. He gave me a high five. \"Thanks, I'm really glad dad's an agent,\" he replied. I laughed and hugged him. \"Hey Rayne, can I talk to you?\" Justin asked. \"Sure,\" I told him standing up. I gave Joe another high five and walked over to the corner. \"I wanted to know if you wanted to go on another date with me,\" he said. I bit my lip hesitating and glanced at Tuck. He looked fine but I knew him well enough to see the anger in his eyes. I took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry Justin but I can't. Work is really hectic right now and things are…complicated.\" He smiled. \"It's Tuck right?\" I blinked. \"We all know. I just never saw you two actually together so I thought I would try,\" he told me with a shrug. \"I'm sorry Justin. You really are a great guy and I loved spending time with you. Maybe we still can just not as a date,\" I said. He nodded and smiled. \"You really are great Rayne. Tuck's lucky to have someone like you love him,\" he told me. I smiled and we hugged each other tightly. \"Thank you for understanding,\" I whispered. \"No problem,\" he replied. We pulled away and I walked back over to Tuck and Joe. Katie was waiting for them. \"Mom, I won,\" Joe told her excitedly. \"Congratulations honey, I'm so proud,\" she told him hugging him. I smiled. \"Hey Tuck, I was wondering if you wanted to get a bite to eat,\" Katie said standing up. Joe looked up at me. I gave him a tight smile. \"I'm sorry but I can't,\" Tuck stated. I looked at him surprised. Katie looked surprised as well. \"Well, ok, I guess I'll see you later,\" she took Joe's hand and left. Before he went outside Joe flashed me a thumbs up. I chuckled and grabbed my purse. Before I could fully straighten up Tuck had a hand wrapped around my wrist and was pulling me along behind him. \"Tuck, what are you doing?\" I hissed as he pulled me into an empty room. He shut the door and with a click it locked. \"You've been avoiding me and it's time for us to talk,\" he told me firmly. I bit my lip. \"Tuck,\" I started but he shook his head. \"No getting out of it.\" He placed his hands on either side of my head. \"You love me and I've loved you all this time but have been too big of a dummy to see it,\" he said in a low voice. I blinked at him. \"Tuck, I-I don't know what to say.\" \"Say you forgive me for being an idiot and say that'll you'll give me a chance,\" he pleaded. I stared at him unable to fully believe that this was happening. But it was. \"Tuck, I'll always forgive you and I'll be happy to give you a chance,\" I told him with a huge smile. He smiled back and gently pressed our lips together. It was short and sweet and chaste and the best kiss I had ever had.[Chapter 17] Part Seventeen A month later we were on a plane getting ready to jump out. I helped Tuck strap on his parachute harness. I heard FDR talking to Lauran on the phone and I smiled. \"Do me,\" I shouted over the roar of the plane. \"With pleasure,\" Tuck called back with a wink. I punched his shoulder but grinned at his perversion. He started strapping me up his hands lingering in certain places longer then was strictly necessary. \"Guys, I have an announcement,\" FDR shouted. We looked over at him. \"Lauran and I are getting married.\" I cheered and hugged him tightly. \"Tuck will you be my best man?\" FDR asked. \"Of course I will,\" he roared slapping FDR's back. We all moved to the jump zone. \"Tuck I should tell you something,\" I heard FDR say but then we were standing directly over the ocean and I couldn't hear what was being said. I fumbled for my earpiece but it seemed I was too late. Tuck tackled FDR into open air. I laughed and plugged my water proof ear piece in. \"Thank goodness Rayne, we've been trying to get a hold of you for a while now,\" Collins came on over the piece. \"Sorry Collins, what's up?\" \"Rayne, I'm so sorry to tell you this, but, your father escaped jail. He's back.\" Dun, dun, dun...and so ends This Means War. *Evil laugh* ","Summary":" Part One The blood red dress clung to my body as I stared out across the city.

Hope you will enjoy it :D Chapter 1 She slowly walked towards him with a smile on her face and slowly laid her hand on his left shoulder. He turned his head towards her and saw that beautiful enchanting smile on her face. He couldn't hold himself back anymore and caressed her left cheek with his right palm; Eliza leaned into his touch and closed her eyes. Henry stood up, moved closer to her but his hand never left her cheek. He now stood very close to Eliza, let his left arm wound around her waist and pulled her close. Eliza wounded her arms around his neck and laid her head on his shoulder. Henry felt his shoulder wet and carefully pulled back so that he could have a better look at her face. He looked at her and saw tears streaming down her cheek. Henry used his thumb to wipe her tears away and she shyly smiled at him. Henry took her face in his hands, moved her face towards his and kissed her. He kissed her with all the love he felt for her. When he pulled back he could see Eliza blush. \"I…. you…. Why...\" She stammered. \"Eliza it's all right, I'm…. I'm sorry\" Henry said and began to turn to leave the room. \"No wait!\" Eliza said quickly and grabbed his hand to stop him from leaving. Henry turned towards Eliza whom still held his hand. \"Eliza if you want we can just forget what happened. Of cause I made a total fool of myself but I think I can live with that.\" \"But I don't want to forget.\" Eliza demitted quietly. Henry's eyes lit up, he moved closer. So close that their lips nearly touched and asked her in a in a low voice \"Why don't you want to forget?\" \"Because I'm…. I'm…. I'm in love with you and…. \" Before she could say more Henry captured her lips with his. This kiss was different, it was deeper, more passionate and longer much, much longer. When Eliza and Henry broke the kiss both were left breathlessly. They still stood in an embrace when Henry told her in a husky voice \"I love you too\". Eliza's head shot up form Henry's shoulder where it had rested and kissed him again. Henry nearly stumbled backwards, because the kiss surprised him. \"You really love me?\" She asked after the kiss ended. \"Well…. Yes I do love you Eliza Doolittle.\" Henry told her. Eliza smiled up at him and the asked \"And where do we go from here?\" \"Well I don't know where you want to go but I think I'm going to have some dinner.\" He joked. \"Henry why can't you just once be serious?\" she asked with a strict voice. \"I'm sorry. I only know that I can't have you walk out on me again!\" He stated firmly. \"Oh Henry I promise that I will never do something like that to you again.\" She confirmed him. \"That means you're staying here with me?\" \"Where else should I stay? Any suggestions?\" She asked jokingly but a little annoyed. \"How the devil should I know?\" He nearly yelled. \"Henry Higgins don't you dare to yell at me! Where the devil is your problem?\" She yelled back. \"Where my problem is? I'll tell you…. I…. You…. We…. Marriage….\" He stammered. \"Marriage? Henry what exactly are you trying to tell me?\" She asked with a confused expression on her face. Henry looked from the ground up into her eyes, he took a deep breath, got on his knee, took her left hand and then asked her with a trembling voice \"Eliza Doolittle would you do me the honer of becoming my wife?\" Eliza looked down at him with tears of joy in her eyes. She cleared her throat an than tried to say 'Yes' but nothing came out so she nodded her head in a 'Yes', threw herself in Henry's waiting arms and showered his face with kisses while tears of joy where freely streaming down her face. tbc and please Review =)[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 After what seemed to be an eternity the couple brook apart, Henry stepped back straightened his cloth and told Eliza in a quite cold and distanced voice \"I shall buy you a ring tomorrow. You go and tell Mrs. Pearce that you are back and that she shall help you to rearrange your room and I'm going on a walk. I suppose I'll be back for dinner.\" The confusion on Eliza's face was obvious, she didn't know what changed his mood so quickly just a moment ago he was happy and even romantic, which was totally unusual for Henry Higgins and now he was back to his old self if not even a little grumpier. Sure she hadn't expected him to change, but she had hoped that he would maybe just a little open up to her. Eliza took all her courage together and nervously asked him \"Henry what's the matter? Did I do something wrong? Have you changed you mind? Did you just realize that I'm not good enough for you? \" Henry could see the fear in her eyes \"No, gods no you didn't do anything wrong and I haven't changed my mind\" her tried to assure her. \"But I'm not good enough for you? Is that what you are trying to tell me. I mean I know that I'm not one of those society ladies and that it's not proper for you to marry someone like me….\" Eliza started to babble until Henry interrupted her. \"Eliza stop it! You silly girl that is not true! You are more than good enough for me, but I can't tell you!\" \"You can't tell me? Henry if we are to be married you should tell me everything!\" she yelled at him. \"And what if I don't want to tell you? What if it's non of your business?\" he yelled back, getting mad at her for not leaving him alone. \"Damn it! Don't you get it? Your business is going to be my business! But if you go on acting like an idiot I'm going to break up this hole thing and leave you, than you don't have to share your business with me!\" Eliza couldn't remember that she had ever been so mad and so hurt at the same time. \"You really badly want to know what is going on? I'm telling you! I'm a confirmed old bachelor and you are a young beautiful and … well very attractive woman who deserves better than me. You could have every young man you would like to have. What if some day you realize that I'm not good enough for you and run of with one of those young men\" Henry who first had yelled confessed his last sentence like a little boy who had broken a vase while playing. Eliza looked shocked, she had never thought that he had such a problem with their age difference. He had no reason to believe that she would run of with a younger man, while she was living with him she had never had shown any interest in an other man. Sure there had been Freddy but she never was interested in him. \"Henry I didn't know you had such a problem with our age difference. How can you think that I would run of with another man? I don't care about the fact that you are older than me!\" Eliza tried to assure and understand him. \"Eliza I don't really think that you would run of with another man, but well … what if I can't make you happy enough? I'm not romantic and I don't show my feelings, but you deserve a man who shows you that he loves you every day, who worships you and treats you like a Queen.\" He confessed. \"Oh Henry, I new from the moment I fell in love with you that you are not the romantic on and even if you don't show me that you love me every day, I will always know that you love me and you will worship me and treat me like a Queen every day.\" Eliza replied got nearer to him, took his face in her hands and gave him a light kiss which quickly deepened. They both were so busy kissing that they hadn't realized the three people standing in the doorway of Henry's office. tbc and thanks for reading[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 When the couple didn't seem to notice their viewers. Mrs. Higgins was the one who took the liberty to interrupt the couple. \"Henry Higgins what the devil do you think you're doing with that young girl?\" She asked in a shocked voice. She had never thought that her son would use poor Eliza for his own pleasure. Henry and Eliza immediately sprung apart. They were shocked and embarrassed that they where discovered engaged passionately kissing. While Eliza was highly embarrassed a suddenly found her shoos very interesting, Henry tried to calm down his breathing. \"Mother! What the devil are you doing here?\" Henry asked his mother and tried to use his normal voice. \"What I am doing her? I came here to look if Eliza arrived well, but now I find you here kissing Eliza! How long have you used this poor young thing?\" asked Mrs. Higgins Eliza got more and more uncomfortable. What must Mrs. Higgins think of her? She probably thought that Eliza would do or had done something improper with Henry. \"Mother! How can you think that Eliza would do anything which isn't proper?\" Henry was furious by now. He looked over to Eliza who looked very ashamed. But why did she look ashamed? They hadn't done anything improper and they were engaged after all. \"Henry after what we just saw I don't know what to think anymore! Colonel Pickering you are living here, did you know anything of this hole affaire?\" Mrs. Higgins now badly wanted to know what and how long this had been going on. The Colonel who looked very uncomfortable stammered, \"Well I don't know anything about this affair.\" Now Mrs. Pearce linked herself in \"I know that Eliza is in love with professor Higgins, but I didn't know that they had an affair.\" The three of them began to gossip. Eliza and Higgins stood there while the others were gossiping. Eliza couldn't hold back her tears anymore. How could they think that they had an affair? Eliza had always been a good girl. Henry who noticed that Eliza cried had had enough. He took her in his arms; Eliza buried her head in his chest and began to snob openly. Mrs. Higgins, Colonel Pickering and Mrs. Pearce who heard the snobs turned into the direction where they came from and saw Henry who had his arms safely wrapped around Eliza, he nuzzled his head into her hair and they saw that he whispered something to her. When Eliza had calmed down a bit Henry turned his head into the direction where the three were standing, but still had Eliza in his arms and said, \"How dare you three to talk like this about me and my fiancée?\" All three had stunned looks on their faces. Mrs. Higgins was the first one who had found her voice again and asked with the most startled voice \"Fiancée? You mean you two are engaged?\" \"Yes mother Eliza and I are engaged.\" He answered while stroking Eliza's hair to make her feel better. \"But since when?\" Mrs. Higgins wanted to know she was still shocked by the news. Not that the news where not pleasant, but she had never thought that her son would ever marry and that she would ever see him in such a caring and gentle way as she did right now. \"We confessed our love for each other when Eliza came back this afternoon and then I asked her to marry me.\" He stated and looked down at Eliza who was totally calm now that the others new that they were to be married. Eliza slowly stepped out of Henrys embrace, took a step back and then took Henry's hand and held it in her hand. Pickering was the one who took the first step, walked over to the pair and congratulated them. The next was Mrs. Pearce who was very happy about the engagement, shook Henrys hand and pulled Eliza into a short hug and than stepped aside. Mrs. Higgins didn't move. Henry was confused he had always thought that his mother had wanted him to marry, why the devil wasn't she happy then? \"I am sorry for suspecting such improper things. I am very happy for the two of you.\" She said while walking over to the couple and pulling Henry into a thin embrace. Then she pulled back and pulled Eliza into a hug. Eliza was relived that Mrs. Higgins was happy for them. For a moment she had feared that Mrs. Higgins wouldn't approve of her and Henry's relationship. Mrs. Higgins pulled back from their hug and then said with a cheerful voice \"That is a reason to celebrate. We are going out for dinner tonight. Colonel you are going to accompany me aren't you?\" Pickering nodded and then responded, \"It would be an honor Mrs. Higgins. But maybe we should ask the happy couple if they want to celebrate. Do you?\" He asked Henry and Eliza. Eliza looked at Henry who nodded at her, so she answered, \"Yes we would like to go out with you tonight. Mrs. Pearce would you like to come too?\" Mrs. Higgins looked surprised and answered \"No, but thank you Miss Doolittle.\" Eliza just wanted to convince her when Henry said, \"That's alright Mrs. Pearce, but you have free tomorrow, you have done more than enough for us.\" Mrs. Pearce was confused by Henry's sudden kindness, \"Thank you Sir. Could I also have free tonight so I could visit my sister?\" asked and hoped that she didn't ask for too much. Eliza was the one who responded first, \"Oh, you want to visit your sister? Henry couldn't she have free over the weekend to? Then she would be able to spend more time with her sister.\" Before Henry could answer, Mrs. Pearce interrupted, \"That wouldn't be possible! The cook and the maids have free this weekend who would cook for you?\" Henry nodded, but again was not fast enough to answer. \"Mrs. Pearce I can cook and take care of everything. You go and have a nice time with your sister.\" Eliza answered. \"Would that really be possible?\" Mrs. Pearce asked Henry hopefully. Henry who originally wanted to say 'no' looked over at Eliza who had a begging look on her face and a weekend alone with Eliza (or nearly alone) sounded very appealing, so he changed his mind and answered, \"Yes Mrs. Pearce you can go tonight, but please be back on Sunday night.\" Mrs. Pearce thanked the couple and then left to go packing. \"Well I have to go home to change, but I will be back at eight o'clock. Is that alright?\" Mrs. Higgins asked. \"Sure mother untill then.\" Henry answered and Mrs. Higgins left. Pickering was the next one who left the couple alone in Henry's study, because he wanted to take a nap. When Eliza and Henry where alone again, Henry pulled Eliza closer to him and asked her with a concerned voice, \"Is everything all right?\" Eliza smiled at him and only nodded a 'Yes', wounded her arms around Henry's waist to be even closer to him and the couple just stood there in Henry's study neither saying a word. tbc ...[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 After some time Henry started stroking and kissing Eliza's cheek and then wander down to her jaw line. Eliza felt her body tingle at his touch, it was incredible and scaring how her body reacted to his touch. She had never felt anything like this before. Her body was on fire and to be honest Eliza liked the feeling. Henry, who was now kissing her neck, had a hard time controlling himself not to go to far. He didn't want to scar her or push her to far, but he was glad that she didn't push him back it rather seamed like she enjoyed his caressing. When Henry's lips moved up again and he kissed her right below her ear, Eliza felt like her knees would give away under her, so she gripped Henry's shoulders for support. Henry felt her felt Eliza's grip and carefully pulled back to look at her face. He was afraid that he had gone to fare with his actions and she would now be scared or mad at him. \"Eliza, I am sorry I shouldn't have pushed you that far.\" Henry said in a guilty voice. \"No! You didn't push me too far, it's just I do not now these kind of feelings and they made my knees go weak and I was afraid that they would give away under me.\" Eliza admitted. Henry had to smile and even was a bit proud of himself for being able to make her knees turn week. He looked at the grandfather clock and the suggested, \"Eliza why don't we both go to our rooms and change for tonight.\" \"Do you mean to tell me, that you think I need that much time for dressing up, because I look so ugly right now?\" She asked in a teasingly. \"No! That is for sure not the reason I suggested it. If you must know,\" Eliza nodded a big 'Yes', \"I suggested it, because I do not know if I would be able to control my actions any longer. You must know, you are a very attractive and very beautiful woman and that makes it rather hard to resist you. It's not that I do not want to, but we have to wait till we are married, for the simple reason that you are an utter lady.\" Henry confessed. Eliza was taken aback. She had never thought she could have such affection on any man let alone Henry Higgins, but she was proud that Henry was pleased with her or at least her appearance. \"If that is the reason I think you should walk the lady to her room, because you're an utter gentleman.\" She said. Henry offered Eliza his arm, which she immediately took and walked her up to her room. When they were in front of Eliza's room Eliza released from Henry's arm, gave him a peak on the cheek and opened the door to her room. As she was about to enter the room, Henry grabbed her upper arm, turned the towards him, gave her a loving kiss on the lips and then said, \"Now you can go into your room. I will meet you downstairs at eight.\" Eliza only nodded and went into her room. She heard Henry's footsteps walk into the direction of his own room. With a heavy sigh she sat herself on her bed. Eliza couldn't believe what happened this afternoon. Yesterday night she ran away with a broken heart and now she was going to marry the man she loved. 'Yes' she thought 'the man she loved. Sure he was older than her and normally didn't show his feelings or wasn't even nice to people, he was sometimes grumpy and could drive her crazy, but she still loved him. She loved him for being intelligent, for being caring, loving, for always wanting the best for her and she loved him for being jealous of Freddy (even thought he would never admit it).' Eliza got up went into the bathroom to make herself ready for tonight. Down the hall Henry sat on his bed and like his fiancée he thought about today's events. 'I am damn lucky!' He thought 'Eliza agreed to marry me, a confirmed old bachelor like me. I have to treat her well and show her that I love her and be romantic. Romantic? I have no idea how to be romantic and I don't want to be too different from what I am normally like. She is going to get along with me, yes she definitely is. We are going to be happy, I hope, but why shouldn't we I love her and she loves me. What else does she need?' Henry was ripped out of his thoughts when he heard the doorbell ring; he looked at the watch and rushed to change into evening clothes. tbc...[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 When Henry came down the stairs his mother and Colonel Pickering already stood there waiting for him and Eliza. \"Henry darling, there you are! I got us a reservation at the restaurant we have been at your birthday last year, is that alright?\" She asked. Henry hadn't listened to his mother, because Eliza came down the stairs. She looked unbelievable beautiful, enchanting, like an angle and very, very attractive. Mrs. Higgins seemed to notice that her son was distracted and looked in the same direction he looked, where she saw how beautiful Eliza looked tonight, she turned to look at her son's face and had to smile. He looked at Eliza in a mixture of excitement, fascination and even a little unbelieving that he was going to marry such a beauty. Eliza who now stood in front of Henry felt terribly precarious. She wanted to satisfy Henry with her appearance, but he just didn't say anything. \"Eliza you look beautiful.\" Mrs. Higgins said, which eased her tension. \"Thank you Mrs. Higgins.\" Eliza shyly responded, turned back to Henry and looked him deep in the eyes. \"You look pretty.\" Henry stated coldly which Eliza made very precarious again. \"We have to go now or we are going to be late.\" Said Mrs. Higgins and together with the Colonel made her way towards the door. Henry offered Eliza his arm, which she gladly they were about too leave the house Henry stopped, turned Eliza to face him, gave her a kiss on the cheek and whispered into her ear, \"You really look very beautiful tonight and I am very proud of the fact that you are my fiancée.\" That made Eliza feel relived and a blush crept up her cheeks. They left the house and joined the others. Dinner was lovely. Everything was just perfect. The only thing which bothered Henry was the fact that every man whether old or young were bewitched by Eliza's beauty. Sure she was very beautiful, but the others shouldn't care she was his fiancée after all! When Henry, Eliza and Pickering came home again Pickering excused himself for bed. Now only Henry and Eliza where left who sat on the divan in Henry's study. \"I enjoyed or dinner. It was nice wasn't it?\" Eliza tried to start a conversation. \"Mhhh…\" was the only answer she got. It appeared like Henry was deep in thoughts. \"What are you thinking about? Did I do something wrong?\" she asked with fear in her voice, which made Henry snap out of his thoughts. \"No you didn't do anything wrong. You were perfect and very beautiful!\" He told her trying to take her fear away of having done something wrong. \"But something is bothering you Henry.\" She now really badly wanted to know what was wrong with him if she hadn't done anything wrong what did then go wrong? \"Woman why can't you just leave me alone?\" He asked her annoyed. \"I can't and won't leave you alone because I am you fiancée! So you better tell me or we are going to stand here yelling at each other for the rest of our lives!\" She now nearly yelled. \"You want to know so desperately? I'll tell you! I didn't like it at all that no man could take his eyes of you.\" He declared. \"But I didn't mean to! The only man that was suppose to look at me was you.\" She told him. \"Well I did look at you, but I am not the only man who thinks that you are attractive.\" He explained her. \"You really think I am attractive?\" She asked unsure of herself. \"Yes.\" He admitted, but he could see from the look on Eliza's face that she still didn't believe him. \"You don't believe me?\" He asked and Eliza shook her head 'No'. \"Than I have to show you just how attractive you are.\" He simply said. Before Eliza could respond her lips where captured with his. Henry let his hands gently wander up and down her back, while Eliza wounded her arms around his neck to be closer to him. Just when Eliza let one hand wander down to his chest and Henry wanted to run one hand down her side someone rung at the door. The two parted, smoothed their cloths and Eliza went to the door whit Henry only a few steps behind her. She opened the door and her face fell. \"Darling! How are you? I have missed you!\" Freddie Eynsford-Hill asked. \"Freddy! What are you doing here?\" Eliza asked who was very over challenged. tbc...[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 \"Darling is everything all right?\" Freddie asked concerned because he noticed that Eliza's face fell. \"What the devil do you want here boy?\" Henry who had stood behind Eliza now asked. \"Professor Higgins I am here to see my fiancée.\" Freddie stated. Henry now had enough. What right did that boy think he had to call Eliza his fiancée? She was his fiancée. She was going to be Eliza Higgins. \"She is not interested now go and never come back.\" Henry countered angrily and wanted to slam the door close but Eliza stopped him. \"Henry stop! Freddy why don't you come in, I think we have to sort a few thinks out.\" \"Sure darling.\" He said and followed Eliza into Henry's study. Henry, who still stood in the hallway with the doorknob in his hand was a bit startled. 'Why had she asked him to come in? Why hadn't she just let him send that boy away?' he just didn't understand her. Closing the door Henry went into the study, but what he saw didn't please him at all. He saw Eliza and that boy sitting on the divan and that stupid Eynsford-Hill boy was sitting very close to Eliza, it looked like he was trying to kiss Eliza. Freddie's face was moving closer and closer Henry didn't like that at all and didn't see a reason to hold himself back. \"Back away boy or you're going to regret it!\" Henry warned him in a dangerous voice. Freddie backed away, stood up, walked towards Henry and only asked in a confident tone, \"Who do you think you are to tell me what to do with my fiancée? If you would be her father or her uncle I would understand, but you don't have a right to say anything!\" Eliza who now stood, looked a little afraid. She could see anger rise in Henry's face and didn't now what he was going to do with Freddie. \"Your fiancée? Eliza is not your fiancée!\" Henry now couldn't hold back his anger anymore and he also didn't want to. \"What are you talking about Eliza certainly is my fiancée. Aren't you darling?\" Freddie asked Eliza so that she could assure him, but she didn't. Freddie turned to face her and realized that she wasn't going to say what he wanted to hear. \"Freddie I am sorry, that is what I wanted to talk about. I have never agreed to marry you and even if you would ask me now I wouldn't be able to say 'yes', because I am already engaged.\" Eliza told him and felt terribly sorry for him. \"But whom are you engaged with?\" Freddie asked with a sad voice. \"Well with me you stupid boy!\" Henry stated, he didn't feel sorry for the boy. Why should he? \"You are engaged with that old bachelor?\" Freddie asked Eliza unbelieving and Eliza only nodded. \"You stupid boy I will not let you insult myself in my own house. Now you go home to your mother and leave me and my fiancée alone.\" Henry told him with a stern voice. Freddie ignored him, went over to Eliza, took her face in his ands and kissed her. Eliza immediately backed away and slapped him across his cheek. Freddie stumbled back and nearly fell but he could hold himself on the divan. \"Freddie how could you?\" Eliza asked shocked. \"But I love you!\" Freddie exclaimed and again moved closer to Eliza, but this time Henry was quick enough to stop him from coming to near to Eliza. Henry grabbed Freddie at the collar of his shirt and dragged him away from Eliza, \"You are never in your hole live going to touch her or even come close to her again or you are going to regret it! Do you understand me?\" Henry told him furiously and all Freddie could do was nod. Eliza didn't know what to do, she could see that by now Henry was really furious and she was afraid that he wouldn't be able to control his anger any longer. Henry looked at Eliza and saw that she was scared. He looked a Freddie and without saying a word he dragged Freddie out in the hallway towards the door. Eliza followed them unsure of what Henry would do next. She was relieved when she saw Henry open the door and throw Freddie out. Freddie stumbled backwards down the stairs and landed on the pavement. \"You better never come back here or you know what will happen.\" Henry warned him and shut the door with a loud bang. tbc...[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Eliza didn't say a thing; she only stood next to the door and watched Henry as he walked back into his study. Eliza hesitated a second and then followed him. Henry stood in front of his bookshelf and looked at it. He didn't move he only stood there and the only sound that was heard was the breathing of the couple. \"I am sorry.\" Eliza honestly said. She didn't know what else to do. \"What are you sorry for? Maybe for the fact that he thought that you agreed on marrying him or for the fact that he kissed you in front of me, your fiancé?\" Henry asked and turned to face Eliza. \"I am sorry for the fact that he insulted you and for the kiss, but I also feel sorry for him. He loves me and thought that we had a future together and I just broke his heart.\" Eliza honestly replied. \"You can feel sorry for him as much as you want to, but you will never see that stupid boy again! Do you understand me?\" Henry told her. \"You have no right to tell me who I am allowed to see and who not.\" Eliza told him with anger in her voice. \"I have every right if that bloody boy is trying to steal my fiancée!\" Henry told her, his and just like Eliza with anger in his voice. \"You are jealous of him aren't you? I tell you what Henry; I can go where ever I want to go when ever I want to and if I want to meet Freddie you are not going to stop me.\" Eliza's voice was now filled with anger. \"Good go and meet him or better run of with him!\" Henry now yelled. \"Yes I might run away with him! At least he is not a confirmed old bachelor like you! \" She yelled back. \"Very well woman go and run a way with that boy, but than never come back!\" He yelled and storm out his study, up to his room. Eliza who just realized what she had said followed him and called after him, \"Henry wait! I didn't mean it that way!\" She now stood behind him at the door of his bedroom. Henry waited a second, opened the door and without saying a word went inside. Eliza stood in front of the now closed door and didn't know what to do. She had hurt him and that without even thinking about it. When she didn't hear anything from Henry's room she went to her bedroom and into bed, but she had to adjust things in the morning. The next morning Henry woke up before his alarm rang, which was a rarity. He dressed and went downstairs for breakfast. At the dining table Eliza already ate her breakfast. When she noticed Henry she smiled. \"Good morning Henry, Pickering is visiting a friend in the north and he wanted to stay the hole weekend, so he went this morning, then he has hole Saturday.\" She told him helplessly, she didn't now what to tell him. \"Morning Eliza, good for him.\" He stated uninterested, sat down and began to eat. After some time, where neither of them said anything Eliza had enough. \"Henry I am sorry, I didn't mean what I said. It slipped out.\" She tried to assure him. \"Is that so. You sounded quite serious, but then my ears aren't that good anymore. You know the age.\" Henry remarked sarcastically. \"Damn Henry you know that I didn't mean it! I was mad at you and wanted to make you angry.\" She explained him, but saw that he didn't believe her. \"Henry please don't do that. Don't shut yourself away.\" She said under tears. When Henry realized that she was crying he felt bad. He took Eliza's hand in his and tried to calm her, \"Eliza, I know that you didn't mean it, I only got so mad because I might have been a little jealous.\" Eliza looked up with a smile on her face, \"You know that you don't have any reason to be jealous.\" She assured him. \"Good, now we can have a nice breakfast. You said Pickering has gone away over the weekend?\" Eliza nodded \"Then we will be all alone in this house, after all the staff has of over the weekend too. Do you think it's a good idea to leave the two of us alone?\" He asked her teasingly. \"Why Professor, do you plan on doing anything improper with me?\" She asked flirting. Henry looked at her with a grin on his face, \"Well Miss Doolittle if you go on behaving like that, I might get weak.\" \"Behaving like what Professor? I don't know what you mean.\" She asked innocently. \"You little vixen you know exactly what I mean.\" Henry told her but he just couldn't wash that grin of his face. He liked that they where playful around each other, but of cause he would never openly admit it. When they were done with breakfast Henry was lost in his thoughts. \"You have an appointment at 1 o'clock.\" Eliza told him. Henry's head snapped up, \"How did you know what I was thinking about?\" he asked stunned. \"You always have a funny look on your face when you try to remember something.\" She told him. \"I certainly do not!\" Henry defended himself. \"You certainly do, darling.\" Mrs. Higgins told her son. Henry and Eliza turned toward her. \"Mother! What the devil are you doing her?\" Henry asked his mother annoyed. \"Nice to see you too son. I am here to take Eliza out for some shopping.\" She answered not caring about the annoyance of her son. \"Oh but Mrs. Higgins I don't have any money.\" Eliza said disappointed. \"That's no problem. Henry is going to buy you your things, right darling?\" Mrs. Higgins asked. \"Why the devil should I? She doesn't need more clothes she has enough of them!\" Henry replied. Eliza got even more disappointed, \"Your son is right I have enough clothes, but I would have enjoyed it very much.\" Henry realized that she would really like to go, so he gave in, \"Alright woman, you can go and waste my money on stupid clothes, but don't overdo it.\" Eliza's eyes lit up. She had to hold herself back from rushing into his arms and shower his face with kisses. Mrs. Higgins had to smile. She still couldn't believe how soft Henry was around Eliza, she didn't know that Henry even could be like this. \"I am going to wait for you in the study.\" She told Eliza and Eliza only nodded. When Mrs. Higgins disappeared I the hallway Eliza rushed to Henry, pulled him into a thin hug, gave him a sweet kiss on the cheek and whispered, \"Thank you.\" In his ear. \"What ever for you silly thing?\" He asked already knowing what for but he wanted to hear. \"For letting me waste your money on stupid clothes.\" She answered with a knowing smile and disappeared in the hallway. Henry went into the study to wait with his mother. After some time Henry couldn't ignore the silly smile on his mother's face. \"What is the matter mother?\" Henry asked uninterested. \"You really love her don't you?\" She asked back. Henry looked at her and said with an uninterested and cool voice, \"No mother I only use her. You know she is such a pretty little thing and is going to be a good wife.\" \"Henry can't you just once in your life talk about your feelings.\" She scolded her son. Just as Henry wanted to say something Eliza walked into the room. \"We can go if you like to.\" She told Mrs. Higgins. \"Alright. Good-bye son. Eliza I am going to wait outside, please don't take to long.\" She told them and went outside. Eliza walked over to Henry kissed his cheek and told him, \"Don't forget your appointment at 1 o'clock. Good bye.\" Henry nodded and she turned to leave, but Henry took hold of her arm turned her back to face him and gave her a short kiss on the lips. \"Now you can go, but don't spend all my money.\" He told her and let her leave. tbc[Chapter 8] Thanks for the good reviews :D Mrs. Higgins took Eliza to one of her regular shops. \"Hello Mrs. Higgins what can I do for you today?\" The saleswoman asked. \"Hello Miss Everett, I am here today with my future daughter in law and we would like to have some new gowns for her.\" She replied while Eliza stood beside her and looked around. \"Daughter in law? I didn't know that your son is going to marry.\" She turned towards Eliza, \"Congratulation. I would have never thought that Henry would ever get married. Am I allowed to know what your name is; after all you got Henry to ask you to marry him. You must be something special. \" She told her with a jealous voice. Eliza realized this and put a smile on, \"Thank you Miss Everett. My name is Eliza Doolittle. I assume you know my fiancé; after all when you talked about him you used his first name?\" she asked with a polite smile. Miss Everett was taken aback by Eliza's directness. She blushed a little and then answered in an embarrassed tone, \"Well yes… we met once ore twice.\" Mrs. Higgins smiled amused; she would have never thought that Eliza could handle Henry's admirer so well. She cleared her throat, \"Miss Everett do you think that you could show us some of your new evening gowns.\" Miss Everett nodded and excused herself for a moment to get some gowns. Mrs. Higgins smiled at Eliza and than in a motherly way asked, \"Is everything alright?\" \"Yes.\" She confirmed her. \"It doesn't bother you at all?\" \"I knew that Henry had a life before me and he is a man after all.\" Mrs. Higgins had to smile, Eliza for sure was an unusual girl, \"If you don't mind asking, but you love my son very much don't you?\" \"I don't mind and yes I do love him very much.\" Just as Eliza answered Mrs. Higgins, Miss Everett came back with an arm full of gowns. \"Miss Doolittle just yesterday we got new gowns I think some of them would suite you perfectly.\" Miss Everett said and showed Eliza the gowns. Eliza was stunned she had never seen so many beautiful dresses. Eliza picked out three, which she tried on. The first two didn't look bad but she wasn't sure so she tried on the third, which looked incredible beautiful. \"Eliza this is the perfect gown, Henry is going to love it.\" Mrs. Higgins exclaimed. Miss Everett stood beside Mrs. Higgins and looked jealously at Eliza, because she really looked beautiful and it fitted her perfectly. When Eliza had changed back into her own gown she gave Miss Everett the gown, \"I would like to buy this gown.\" She told her. \"Yes.\" She nodded and then mumbled, \"With Henry's money.\" \"What was the last part Miss Everett?\" Eliza asked although she understood her perfectly. \"Oh nothing Miss Doolittle, I am going to wrap you the dress. I assume that I should send the bill to Henry's address?\" She asked and smiled. \"Yes please, you want me to write down the address?\" Eliza answered \"No, I know the address.\" Miss Everett answered naturally. Now Mrs. Higgins cut in, \"Miss Everett where do you know my son's address from?\" she asked very interested. \"Oh… ehm… He once or twice came here and bought a suit.\" She answered a little bit caught and went away. \"Mrs. Higgins did you have to embarrass that poor woman like that?\" Eliza asked her. \"Yes I had to! That awful woman should realize that Henry isn't interested in her; after all he is your fiancé. Doesn't it bother you at all?\" She asked back. \"Yes it bothers me, but I trust Henry.\" She stated shortly, not only because Miss Everett came back but rather because she thought that thinks like those should not be discussed in public. Eliza and Mrs. Higgins said Good bye and then left. At the same time a few shops further Henry Higgins for the first time in his life entered a jewellery store. He felt terribly uncomfortable and stupid. \"Sir how can I help you?\" Asked a Clerk. \"Well … I need an engagement ring for my fiancée.\" Henry admitted. \"What about her size?\" \"I don't know but I have one of her rings with me.\" Henry said and handed him the ring from Brighton. \"Alright, those rings here are engagement rings, do you see one which you like?\" Henry looked over them and wasn't sure but had the feeling that they all looked the same. Henry had nearly given up all hope of finding a ring when he saw the perfect ring. It was a simple golden band with a diamond in the middle of it. \"I want that one.\" Henry exclaimed \"Of cause excellent decision, but the ring is quite expensive.\" The Clerk said. \"Oh the price for sure does not matter.\" Henry told him with a little pride. \"Yes sir, just a moment I will get everything ready.\" And with that the Clerk went into the other room. When Henry was finally home again he was totally exhausted, he would have never thought that shopping could be so exhausting and annoying. Henry sat himself into his favorite armchair in his study and wondered when Eliza would finally come home; after all it was 6 o'clock (pm) by now and she went out around 11 o'clock (am). Just as he started to read a book he heard the door. When Eliza and Mrs. Higgins came home they were both exhausted, after the first shop the two of them went into several other stores. They gave their bags to the servants and Eliza asked one of them, \"Where is Professor Higgins?\" \"He is in his study.\" He answered. Eliza nodded and she and Mrs. Higgins went into the study. Henry still sat in his armchair and pretended to read when they entered. \"Hello Henry.\" Eliza said and he turned his head toward them. \"Hello Eliza, Mother.\" He replied and the two women went to sit on the divan. \"I have heard that the two of you are going to be alone over the weekend, is it save to leave you alone?\" Mrs. Higgins asked. \"What is that for a stupid question Mother?\" Henry shot back with in an angry voice. \"Henry don't be so rude to your mother.\" Eliza scolded him. \"Eliza it is non of her business what we do or not do!\" Henry shouted at her \"Don't you shout at me Henry Higgins!\" She shouted back. \"Stop it you two! I don't want you to fight. Eliza Henry is right it is none of my business what you do or don't do. I am going now and leave the two of you alone, so do not fight too much.\" Mrs. Higgins told them, said Good bye and left. When Eliza, who had escorted Mrs. Higgins to the door, came back she laid her hands on Henry's shoulders. \"Do you know a Miss Everett?\" She asked innocent. \"Ehm… Miss Everett you said?\" He asked hesitating. \"Yes Miss Everett.\" She stated matter-of-factly. \"Oh yes, I know her we met once or twice. Why do you ask?\" He asked with his normal clam voice. \"She sold me a dress and seamed to know you quit good, are you sure you only met her once or twice?\" She asked with a knowing smile on her face. \"What do you want to hear? Yes I know her from previous events, but that doesn't matter anymore.\" He told her. \"So you admit that you slept with her.\" Eliza asked, now getting a little jealous. \"Eliza! I… well… yes.\" He sprung up but then softly admitted it. \"I know. You know she was quite jealous of me, because I got cold, ignorant Henry Higgins to ask me to marry him. She still has a thing for you.\" Eliza told him and let her hand flatly rest on his chest. \"Oh, I didn't know that, are you jealous?\" \"Do I have a reason to be jealous Henry?\" \"Of cause not! You are fare more beautiful, more intelligent and you are going to be a much better mother.\" He assured her. \"Mother? You want to have children?\" She asked a little shocked. \"Well I thought you would want to have children, but if you don't it's perfectly right with me.\" Henry replied. He was now unsure of himself. He had always thought that Eliza would want children and that she would make a perfect mother, she was loving, patient and all the other thinks that it took to be a good mother. \"Oh Henry! Of cause I want to have children with you.\" She threw herself in his arms and mumbled in his shoulder, \"I never thought that I would be as happy as I am right now.\" Henry smiled, let caressed her back with his hand and mumbled into her hair, \"I know what you mean.\" They stood there in a loving embrace and didn't want to let each other go, till Eliza raised her head and kissed Henry. It was a gentle kiss at first, but it quickly got passionate, very passionate. Henry let his hands wander up and down her back while she wound her fingers in his hair and pulled him even closer. Their embrace got more heated and Henry let his hands move over her backside. Eliza felt thinks that she had never felt before and she didn't want this feeling to end. It was just too good to let it end and Eliza couldn't stop herself from moaning. tbc...[Chapter 9] Sorry for not Updating sooner. I hope you like it XD Chapter 9 The fact that Eliza moaned assured Henry that he wasn't pushing her to far. They slowly walked backwards, but never breaking their kiss. When they stood in front of the divan Eliza lay down and pulled Henry down with her, so that he lay on top of her. One of Eliza's hands roamed over Henry's back, while the other rested on his neck and held him from backing away. Henry let one hands wander up and down her side. He slowly broke the kiss only to start caressing her neck with his lips. Eliza couldn't hold herself back anymore, moaned loud and let her hands wander over his rear. When Henry realized that he couldn't control his desire any longer he abruptly pulled back and stood beside the divan trying to cool down. Eliza sat up and started to rearrange her hair, which had fallen from her bun. Henry who had clamed down spoke first, \"I think we should get married as quickly as possible, what do you think?\" \"I totally agree with you, but we are going to be married so we don't have to stop the next time … you know.\" She admitted, but couldn't bring herself to look at Henry. \"NO!\" Henry objected and Eliza looked almost guilty at him, \"It's not that I don't want, but it is not proper before we are married and you have always been a good girl, right?\" \"Yes certainly Henry.\" She assured him. \"Oh yes, before I forgot I have something for you.\" Henry said and took the ring out of his poked, walked over too Eliza and slipped the ring on her finger. Eliza looked stunned at the ring, she would have never guessed that Henry would buy her an engagement ring and honestly she hadn't missed it. \"Oh Henry!\" Was all she could say. \"So you like the ring.\" He asked her not sure what to think of this reaction. \"Like it? I love it!\" She exclaimed, sprung up and ran into his arms. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you.\" She said between kisses. \"I'm glad you like it and now go up and change in your new gown we're going out tonight.\" Henry told her. Eliza stepped out of the embrace and asked him with a happy smile on her face, \"Really? Where are we going?\" \"That my dear is a surprise.\" Henry answered with a grin. \"But Henry I really badly want to know. Please tell me.\" She pled. \"Be patient Eliza and now go up and change.\" He told her. She nodded happily and went upstairs into her room. Henry who still stood in his study had to chuckle. It was amazing how thrilled Eliza was about such trivial thinks, but he was thankful for it, because then it would not be so hard for him to make her happy. When the clock struck seven Henry went up into his room with to change. Around eight Henry was down again and waited in his study for Eliza. He would never confess it, but he liked going out with Eliza. He liked being seen with her, man around him was jealous of him for having such a beautiful, young, intelligent fiancée. He liked that they were jealous and hoped that it was clear for them that she was his only his and nobody else's. Deep in thoughts Henry didn't realize when Eliza came down the stairs into his study. She stood in the doorway leaning against the doorframe just looking at him. She liked looking at him when he was lost in thoughts or when he was grumbling about something, when he was reading and most of all she liked looking at him when he was working. He looked so intelligent and very sexy when he was working hard. Somehow Henry noticed Eliza and was left speechless. She looked stunning; the dress was light blue and suited her perfectly. \"You know this would be the right time to say something.\" Eliza softly told him. Henry tried to find the right words, \"Eliza I don't know what to say. You look really look beautiful, stunning, like a princes….\" He just couldn't find the right words. Eliza had to smile she couldn't believe it that Henry was speechless. \"Well thank you. I would have never thought that you, the man whose best friends are words doesn't know what to say. I think that is the greatest compliment I will ever get.\" She teased him. Henry smiled, \"Well go on teasing me and I go out on my own.\" \"Oh no Henry, you would not leave me here when I dressed up for you.\" \"Well it really would be a shame not showing you off, but I have to pay attention not that some other man steals you from me.\" He teased back. He liked it that they could be so playful around each other. \"Well then you just have to hold me tight.\" She told him with a grin. \"That sounds very tempting and I think we should go now or we will be late.\" He told her and went to get their coats. Eliza followed him, \"Late for what? Henry please tell me.\" She pled and Henry only shook his head. \"Henry please. I really want to know.\" She now begged. \"Eliza stop, you are starting to annoy me.\" He told her and wanted to help her into her coat, but she took it from him, slipped in and walked towards the door. \"Eliza stop sulking you really badly want to know don't you?\" \"Yes I really want to know.\" She pouted. \"I'll tell you, first we are going to a restaurant and then we are going to the opera. Are you happy now?\" He asked and could already see the answer. Eliza's face glowed with happiness and she nodded. She finally had her answer and was very pleased with it. Henry went to her, offered her his arm, which she gladly took and they left. tbc...[Chapter 10] Thanks for the Review I am very glad you like my story =). hope you will enjoy this chapter. Do not read if you don't like Sexual connection. Chapter 10 Once seated at their table in one of the most fancy restaurants in London Eliza was glowing with happiness, but she also was a little bit nervous and insecure she didn't know how much affection Henry wanted her to show and how much he wanted to show himself. Henry for his part already was annoyed by all the attention Eliza got from the other men who admired her or were left speechless by her beauty. The women gave her jealous looks and some of them even were mad at her for drawing the attention of their husband, fiancé or lover to her. When Henry had enough he simply took Eliza's hand, which rested on the table, in his and kissed it. Eliza was relived that Henry took the 'first step'. She had feared that he would still be his old self that he would be could and distanced. \"Do not be afraid no other man is going to steal me. They are fare to afraid of you.\" She teased him. \"What the devil is that suppose to mean? You don't want me to hold your hand, good then I at least don't look like a love struck idiot.\" He replied and immediately let go of her hand, not getting the fact that she was only teasing him. \"Henry I was only teasing you! Please hold my hand in yours again it felt so good and everybody was able to see that we care about each other.\" She said honestly. Henry struggled a moment, but then he took her hand and held it in his again. That action earned him a big happy smile from Eliza, which made it worth looking like an idiot in love. They had a lovely dinner, Henry explained Eliza what she was eating, because they ate in a French restaurant, which naturally meant that the menu was in French. When they were done they went to the opera house and Eliza was very excited about the opera. Of course it was in French and after Henry realized that Eliza probably didn't understand a word he translated her the basics. He enjoyed it that Eliza was so fond of the play and he even liked translating everything to her (a thing he had never liked before). When they returned home again and were seated in the study Henry realized that one of Eliza's gloves was missing. \"Have you lost one glove?\" He asked her. \"Yes I just couldn't find it.\" She admitted. \"Why didn't you say anything? I would have helped you searching for it.\" \"Well I just didn't want to spent the hole time searching for a stupid glove, it was such a nice play.\" She responded. Henry chuckled; it was unbelievable that Eliza was so different from all other women he had met, but somehow more feminine than all of them together. \"So you enjoyed the opera?\" He asked hopeful. \"Yes very much although I did not understand every word and thank you very much for translating.\" She answered with a big smile. \"Well if you like it I will take you to such events now and then.\" He told her, but felt proud that his fiancée was so interested in these kinds of things. \"Oh thank you Henry.\" Eliza leaned over and gave him a sweet kiss on the cheek. \"I think we should go to bed now.\" Henry told her, because he knew that if she sat that near to him a while longer he would not be able to control his actions any longer. Henry took Eliza by the hand and escorted her to her room, where he gave her a short kiss and wished her a good night. Henry's bedroom door opened and a slim figure slipped inside the room. The figure went straight towards the bed, slipped inside and lay down on the right side. The figure moved closer to Henry and began to stroke his cheek. Henry softly stirred but didn't wake up, so the figure moved even nearer and kissed him. The kiss made Henry wake up; he sprang out of bed and turned on the light, to see the person who now sat on his bed. \"Eliza what the devil do you think you are doing here?\" He asked trying not to sound angry he just was very surprised. \"I was could and I thought you might be cold too, so I thought…\" She trailed of. \"So you thought you could crawl into my bed?\" He softly asked. Eliza only nodded slightly feeling ashamed of herself. \"Eliza you can't sleep here, we are not married and this would be totally wrong.\" He told her and sat down on the edge of the bed. \"But we are to be married or don't you desire me?\" She asked afraid of the answer. \"God no! I desire you, you can't even imagine how much, but it would not be proper.\" Henry tried to explain her. Eliza didn't respond she only moved closer again and kissed him. First it was a gentle kiss and Henry thought it was some kind of good night kiss before she left, but then she moved her arms around his neck and deepened the kiss. Henry tried to pull away, because his mind told him it was wrong, but his body had a different opinion and his body won. Henry let one hand rest on her hip and the other moved up and down her back, while Eliza's hands played with the buttons of his pyjama. Henry broke the kiss and began to kiss her jaw downwards and caressed her neck with his lips. Eliza had already opened all the buttons of his pyjama top and let her hands now wander over his bare upper body, while he still caressed her neck and started to open the buttons of her nightgown. When Henrys hands than finally touched her bare back Eliza couldn't hold back and pushed him backwards so that he lay flat on his back. She moved over him to kiss him and that made her nightgown slip of her shoulders and revealed the beginning of her breast. Henry couldn't take his eyes of her and was very surprised by the confidence she had, he had guessed that she would be shy, but apparently he had been wrong. Eliza who moved her hips against his wanting him, but she didn't know what to do. Henry must have realized that or felt the same, turned them over so that he lay on top and slowly moved her nightgown down her arms and upper body. Henry tried to kiss every inch of her gorgeous body but wasn't patient enough and neither was Eliza, whose hands gripped the sheets cause she couldn't stand this unbelievable sensation anymore and she also couldn't understand how Henry had the nerve to worship her while he desired her so much that Eliza could clearly feel it. When Eliza couldn't suppress her moans any more she moaned that loud that probably every other person in the house heard her, but truth to be told neither of them cared. When Eliza finally was totally naked Henry couldn't help but just admire her for a moment. Henry had been with other women before Eliza but none of them looked nearly as perfect as Eliza. He pushed of his pants and lay down between her legs. He loving stroke her cheek, \"Are you sure you want this? We still can stop.\" He told her not wanting to push her too far. All Eliza could do was nod. Henry kissed her and slowly entered her. The feeling of him made Eliza cry out. Henry suddenly woke up. None of his dreams about Eliza (since he knew her he dreamed about her) had ever been so real. He swept the sweat of his forehead. He couldn't believe it how much he desired his fiancée, if she naked only looked half as good as in his dreams he would be very grateful. Henry shook his head turned around and fell asleep again. Hope you liked it TBC...[Chapter 11] Thanks for the Reviews I am glad you like it. Chapter 11 The next morning Eliza woke up and her glance immediately fell down on her engagement ring. It really was a beautiful ring and she liked it even more that it showed the others that Henry really is going to marry her, the little flower girl from Covent Garden. She quickly dressed and went down to the dining room, where Henry already sat and ate his breakfast. \"Morning Henry.\" She greeted him and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek. \"Morning.\" He replied and acted very distanced. Eliza sat down on the opposite side of the table and began to eat. When she couldn't take the silence any longer she cleared her throat. \"Are you sick?\" Henry asked alarmed. \"No I am feeling wonderful, I just wanted you to notice me.\" She answered. \"I did notice you.\" He said, continued to eat and when Eliza tried to grab his hand Henry quickly moved it away. \"Henry what is the matter? Why don't you want me to touch you?\" She asked not understanding what was wrong with him. \"Just let it be. I am perfectly fine and now eat or it will get cold.\" He said in an untouchable way. \"No! I want to know why you are acting so distanced.\" She told him with a stern voice. \"Just because I don't acted like a love struck idiot the hole time doesn't mean that something is wrong. You know how annoying it is that I now have to share everything and that you are around the hole time.\" He now nearly yelled. \"You think I am annoying? Well then Professor you won't have to bother with me anymore.\" She yelled at him, went out of the study and the next thing he heard was the door banging close. Henry still sat in the dinning room not quite sure of what had happened. He had hurt Eliza and all of this because of a stupid dream. He thought that if he would be more distanced to her he would not desire her that much and all he now had from his glorious idea was that Eliza had left him. Eliza sat crying in Mrs. Higgins sitting room. Mrs. Higgins sat beside her and pated the poor child's back, she didn't know what her stupid son had done, to make her cry. When Eliza had clamed down Mrs. Higgins carefully asked, \"Eliza what did Henry do to make you cry like this?\" \"Oh we went to dinner an opera yesterday and I was so happy and when we had breakfast this morning he was so distanced and when I asked him what the matter was he told me that I was annoying him.\" She sobbed. \"He told you that you are annoying him?\" Mrs. Higgins asked unbelieving. Eliza only nodded and began to cry again. When to door rung Mrs. Higgins got up and went to the door. \"Mother is Eliza here?\" Henry asked in panic. Mrs. Higgins first didn't want to answer but her son seamed scared, \"Yes she is here.\" She simply stated. \"I have too see her, I need to explain myself.\" He told his mother desperate. \"Henry I don't think…\" Mrs. Higgins started but was interrupted by Eliza who had followed her. \"It is alright, can we use the sitting room?\" Eliza asked her and she only nodded. Henry followed Eliza quietly. He had realized that her eyes were red, which meant that she had cried. He had made her now even felt worse than before, how could he act like a complete idiot, he could have explained Eliza everything she surely would have understood. \"Why are you here?\" Eliza asked him with a thin voice. \"I am here because I want to understand why I have acted so stupid this morning and I am here because I want you to come home with me again.\" He told her and waited for a respond. When Eliza didn't say anything he continued, \"Well you know that I love you and when I am honest I have never loved anybody or anything more then you. I love you even more than Phonetics. You are perfect and that makes it hard to resist you.\" Henry confessed. \"Hard to resist me?\" She asked not getting what her meant. \"Yes hard to resist the urge to make love to you. I have been dreaming about you since you moved in with me, but yesterday night I dreamed in the most improper way of you and I thought that if I would spend less time with you I wouldn't desire you so much.\" Henry surprised by the easiness the words came to him. \"What do you mean with improper?\" She asked, having no clue of the 'love making dream'. \"Do I really have to tell you?\" He asked uncomfortable and Eliza only nodded. \"Well you see… we did… you did… I tried… well we were making love.\" He only whispered the last part, feeling ashamed. \"Oh!\" was all Eliza said and this time Henry nodded. \"Well I once dream of something similar.\" She confessed, \"But that is no reason to be distanced. We are engaged and I for my part would like to marry as soon as possible.\" \"I think getting married soon is a excellent idea. Does that mean that you come home with me?\" He asked hopefully. Eliza moved towards him and answered his question with a passionate kiss. Henry rested his hands on her hips, while hers went around his neck. The kissed grew deeper and Eliza thought that she would not be able to stand any longer. Henry pressed Eliza against the wall behind her and let his hands wander up and down her body. Eliza couldn't move even if she had wanted to, she was trapped between Henry and the wall. When one of Henry's hands moved over her breast Eliza couldn't stop herself from moaning into Henrys mouth. The both of them were so occupied with each other that they didn't realize that Mrs. Higgins stood in the door. She had been there quite a while and listened to them (although she knew that she shouldn't have, but she just couldn't hold herself back), but when Henry began to touch Eliza and Eliza began to moan she had to stop them. Mrs. Higgins quietly walked backwards into the hall and then walked toward the sitting room, \"Eliza is everything alright?\" She asked with a faked concerned voice. Eliza and Henry immediately sprung apart and straightened their clothes. \"Yes Mrs. Higgins everything is perfectly fine. We have talked about everything and I am going back home with Henry.\" She politely answered still a little out of breath from the whole kissing. \"That is wonderful.\" Her glance fell down on Eliza's ring, \"I see my son bought you an engagement ring. Have you already been thinking about the wedding?\" She asked her soon to be daughter in law. \"We want to marry as soon as possible.\" Henry simply stated. \"Well it will not be possible to marry as soon as you wish to, it might take a while.\" Mrs. Higgins told them. \"But why?\" Eliza asked concerned. \"You see Eliza we have to buy a wedding dress, we have too make an appointment with the Bishop, we have to find a location to celebrate after the wedding, we have to invite all the people, make the seating arrangements, we have to select the menu and so many other things.\" Mrs. Higgins explained. \"That is awfully lot to do.\" Eliza said with fear in her voice. \"If you like I can help you.\" Mrs. Higgins offered. \"You would? Thank you very much.\" Eliza said relieved. Henry stood beside them and when he had enough he took Eliza's hand, \"Mother I am sorry but we have to go. We will see each other.\" The pair said good bye and walked out the house hand in hand. Mrs. Higgins hand to smile, her son was going to marry she still couldn't believe it. Yes Henry was getting married and he really loved his future wife, she didn't only see it because he took her hand or that she saw them kissing, no it was the way he looked at her. She couldn't remember the last time Henry had looked at something with that much admiration and she also couldn't remember that Henry had ever been so open to anybody in his entire life. Mrs. Higgins knew that the marriage of her son and Eliza was going to work. Thanks for reading and please Review =) TBC...[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 They walked down the street, Eliza's arm liked with Henry's and they were simply enjoying being together. \"Henry do you want to walk to whole way home?\" She stopped and asked him. \"I would have, but if you don't want to I could hale us a cab.\" He offered. \"No that's alright with me.\" She smiled at him and they continued to walk home. Eliza sat in the study on the divan and red a book, while Henry was going over some reports. Eliza was lost in the book and Henry just couldn't keep his eyes of her. He liked it that his fiancée was so interested in books and that she by now even liked Keats and Milton, but what he loved was the way she looked when she red. She looked so beautiful and intelligent. When Eliza realized that Henry was watching her she looked up from her book and met Henry's eyes with hers. \"Why are you watching me?\" She asked amused \"Don't but yourself to high girl, I was certainly not watching you.\" He answered caught. \"Henry don't deny it I saw you.\" She told him. Henry struggled for a second, \"What do you want to hear? Yes I watched you happy now?\" He asked her annoyed by the fact that she caught him. \"Not quite. I still want to know why you watched me?\" She told him with a knowing smile. \"I watched you because you ... because you look damn beautiful when you read.\" He simply told her returning back to his work. Eliza smiled, got up, walked up behind Henry and wrapped her arms around him from behind. \"What do you think you are doing?\" He asked with a smile on his face, which luckily Eliza couldn't see. Eliza's only responded by nuzzling her neck between his shoulder blades and pulled him closer. Henry laid his hands over hers, which rested on his stomach. Eliza smiled into Henry's back and kissed it. Henry took a deep breath and turned around, so that she faced him. He stroked her cheek and kissed her forehead. Eliza rested her head on his shoulder, \"Henry?\" \"Hmm?\" He mumbled into her hair. \"I really quickly want to marry you.\" She confessed. \"That is good, because I don't know how long I can resist you.\" He told her loving. Eliza smiled and kissed his neck. They stood like this for what seamed to bee hours when Henry broke the silence. \"You do realize that we can't stand here for ever?\" He asked her \"I do realize it, but I don't want to let you go.\" She simply told him Henry only nodded into he hair and pulled her thither and let his hands run up and down her back. Eliza responded by letting her hand wander downwards over his behind. Henry gasped in surprise, he by now new that Eliza liked physical contact but he still was surprised that she liked to show it that much. Suddenly Henry's stomach rumbled and Eliza had to laugh. \"Don't laugh woman it is nearly dinner time and I hadn't had lunch.\" He stated self defending. Eliza pulled out of their embrace and seriously asked him, \"Why didn't you have lunch?\" \"Because I was thinking about you and tried to find the best way to apologize to you.\" He confessed \"Henry were you afraid that I could have left you?\" She asked him \"Well yes... I mean you had a good reason and I and after all I am just a grumpy old man.\" \"Henry Higgins you stop that right now! I would never again run away from you and you are surly not old and grumpy.\" She told him with a stern voice \"And I wish that you never again insult your self or think that you are not worthy to be with me. You understand that?\" \"Yes.\" Was the only thing he said. \"Now that we have talked about this we might want to talk about dinner.\" she told him and walked away and sat down on the divan. \"I think we have to go out because the staff has of what means that we have nobody to cook.\" He told her as he sat down in his armchair. \"You think that I can't cook? Well Mister I can, you know a flower girl can't afford a cook.\" She replied. \"Well that is great! My fiancée is going to cook me dinner.\" Henry stated and rested his feet on the table. \"And what are you doing?\" She asked with a raised her eyebrow. \"I am going to sit here and wait till you call me for dinner. So start dinner woman your husband to be is hungry. \" He ordered. \"Oh no Mister! You are going to help me cooking our dinner. Now get up and follow me into the kitchen.\" She told him and stood up. Henry indignantly stood up, \"Eliza you can't be serious! Cooking is for women!\" \"Trust me I am serious, you want something to eat so you have to help me.\" She told him took his hand and pulled him with her into the kitchen. \"What do we have for dinner?\" Henry asked annoyed. \"I don't know what would you like to have Master?\" She asked him teasing. \"I don't know how about some sandwiches?\" He suggested. \"Henry sandwiches are no dinner!\" She looked around in the kitchen and than had a better idea, \"How about some roast beef and potatoes?\" she suggested. \"Sounds good, but are you sure you can cook something like this.\" He asked not quite sure of her cooking skills. \"I can. Would you pleas peel the potatoes?\" She asked him sweetly. Henry raised his eyebrows but then pulled up his sleeves, walked to her, took the knife she was holding for him and began to peel potatoes. Eliza made the roast beef and when Henry was done with peeing the potatoes she put them in a pot. Henry was proud of himself and his work was rewarded with a sweet kiss from Eliza. \"Would you be so nice and please set the table?\" She asked him but when he didn't respond she added, \"And then you can go into your study and do what ever you want.\" \"Alright.\" He said and did as he was told. When dinner was ready Eliza went into the study and found Henry asleep in his armchair. Eliza laid her hand on his shoulder and softly whispered into his ear, \"Henry wake up dinner is ready.\" Henry immediately woke up and followed Eliza into the dining room. When they were done with dinner Henry helped Eliza carrying the dishes into the kitchen, where Eliza did the dishes. Henry stood behind her, \"I must admit that your cooking is really good.\" He complimented her, wrapped his arms around her from behind and began caress her neck. \"Henry stop it, I have to finish this.\" She laughing told him, but Henry didn't stop he now even let his hands wander over her stomach. \"Henry Higgins I think you had to much wine.\" Eliza pulled out of his embrace and put the dishes away. When she was done she came back to Henry who leaned against the counter. She caressed his cheek with her hand, \"Henry have could it be that you have drunk to much wine?\" \"NO! Maybe a little to much.\" He admitted and again began to nuzzle her neck. \"Henry stop!\" she pulled away, \"I am going to bring you up to your room now.\" She took his hands and led him up to his room. Upstairs she gave Henry a kiss and waited till he was in his room and then went downstairs into the study, sat down in Henry's armchair and began to read a book untill the clock struck ten. TBC...[Chapter 13] Sorry for not updating earlier but I just couldn't find the right words ;D. Now there is the new Chapter I hope you'll like it. Enjoy reading :D Chapter 13 When the clock struck 10 (am) and Henry still wasn't up Eliza got worried and decided to go and look after him, she took a tray with Henry's breakfast and went upstairs. Before she entered his bedroom she knocked, but when she didn't get an answer she went inside. It was dark so she carefully turned on the light and went over to where he lay in his bed. She sat the tray down on his nightstand, \"Henry… Henry wake up.\" She carefully touched his shoulder. Henry stirred but didn't wake up. Eliza leaned down and kissed his cheek, \"Henry, darling wake up.\" This time he woke up, slowly opened his eyes and smiled dreaming at her. \"Eliza what are you doing here.\" He asked her with a pain filled voice. \"It's 10 and you are still in bed, so I got worried.\" She explained and sat down on the edge of his bed. \"I have a terrible headache.\" He stated and sat up \"Hmm I see you brought me my breakfast.\" He leaned forward and thanked her with a kiss. \"I will go down you take your time.\" Eliza told him and stud up, but Henry grabbed her hand, turned her to face him, \"Eliza would you mind if I sleep a little longer maybe my headache will fade a little.\" \"I wouldn't mind, but I told you that you should not drink so much wine.\" She told him with an 'I told you so' look. \"Alright you were right and I was drunk now leave me alone or at least be quiet I want to sleep.\" He told her grumpy. \"I am leaving. Sleep well and get better.\" She gave him a short kiss and left. Around 4 o'clock the phone rang and Eliza had to get it because still wasn't downstairs. \"Hello.\" \"Hello Eliza how are you?\" \"Oh Mrs. Higgins how nice to hear from you. I am fine thank you and you?\" \"I am well. I called to ask if you and Henry would like to come for afternoon tea a few friends and they daughters will come to. I thought it would be a nice way of making your engagement more official.\" \"That would be lovely we will be there, thank you for the invitation.\" \"My pleasure. Good bye dear.\" \"Good bye Mrs. Higgins.\" When they were finished Eliza immediately went up and, without knocking, stormed into Henrys room. Luckily Henry already was up, \"Eliza what is the mater?\" \"You have to get dressed we are going to have afternoon tea with your mother and finds of her.\" She told him out of breath. \"What? I never agreed to such a thing.\" He told her indignant. \"Henry please it would be a nice chance to make our engagement more official and I would enjoy it very much.\" She looked begging at him. \"Alright.\" He gave in. It was unbelievable how easily Eliza could wrap him around her little finger. When they finally arrived at Mrs. Higgins house, the other guests were already there. \"My dear friends I would like you to meat my son's fiancée Miss Eliza Doolittle.\" She intrudes Eliza to everybody and they immediately began to chat with her. All the chattering already annoyed Henry and he mentioned Eliza that he would go into the garden for a little walk. Neither of them noticed the girl who followed Henry outside. Henry walked and was lost in his thoughts 'I am happy for Eliza that they like her, but why had she to take me with her? I really don't like those old ladies and I don't like their daughters all they can do is talk. I just hope Eliza wont become like that.' A gentle touch on his shoulder pulled him out of his thoughts. He hopefully turned around but his hopes were failed. \"Hello Henry.\" A young, blonde, nice looking girl greeted him. \"Marry what the devil are you doing here?\" He asked her dangerously. \"Well your mother invited my mother and me. Aren't you happy to see me?\" She asked him with a mischievous smile. \"No I am not happy to see you and now leave me alone.\" He told her sternly. \"But you never wanted to leave me before, no you didn't want to let me go.\" She whispered seductive in his hear and let her hand wander over his back. Henry forcefully pulled away and took a step back, \"Leave me alone! I don't want you anymore! I have found the woman I love and I am not going to let you ruin it.\" \"But darling she never has to find out that you and I have a little fun together. I still love you and I know that you love me too.\" She offered him. \"First I am not going to lie to her, second the right form would be HAD and third you and I are over and I never loved you!\" He told her angrily. Marry chose to ignore what he said, stepped closer and forcefully kissed him. Henry was shocked and didn't know what to do but just as he got his mind to work he heard a cup break on the ground. He quickly pulled away, turned towards the noise and saw Eliza standing there with a shocked and disappointed look on her face. \"Hello Miss Doolittle what a pleasant surprise.\" Marry cheeky greeted her. Eliza didn't respond, went over to Henry and pulled him into a loving but passionate kiss, which showed 'He is mine and nobody else is allowed to touch him'. Henry willingly responded and wrapped his arms around her waist what allowed him to pull her even closer. Eliza broke the kiss, turned to face Marry but stayed in Henry's embrace. \"I would like it very much if you would stay away from Henry from now on.\" She told Marry and gave here a look that could kill. \"And what if Henry doesn't want me to stay away.\" Marry shot back and was sure she had won, but Henry didn't agree with her. \"I for sure don't want you to come near to me ever again.\" He told her and pulled Eliza closer to him. \"You heard my fiancé and now please leave us alone.\" Eliza told her triumphing and Marry offended left them alone. As soon as she was gone Eliza pulled away from the embrace, \"Anymore lovers I should know of?\" She asked him and he quickly realized, that she was really mad at him. \"There might have been more but I swear you none of them means anything to me and everything is over. You are the one I love.\" He tried to convince her. \"And why the devil do you kiss her if she doesn't mean anything to you and if it's all over.\" She looked him in the angriest way Henry could imagine. \"I didn't kiss her and if you wouldn't have come I would have pulled back.\" \"Of course.\" She said sarcastically. \"Demit woman!\" Henry now had enough, \"Do you think I would marry you if I would be interested in having other women? No I wouldn't! I am giving up bachelorhood for you, I am acting like an idiot in love, you even made me cook and I don't mind it at all. Sure I sometimes feel uncomfortable and silly, but when I see how happy it makes you I think it's all worth it. And that should be proof enough for you to believe me.\" Eliza was speechless she had never seen it from this point. Yes he had changed, he had become more caring, loving and he laughed so much, but she had never thought that it could make him feel uncomfortable or silly. \"I am sorry. I think I just was jealous.\" She apologized and stepped closer to him. \"I am sorry too I should have reacted quicker.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her cheek. \"I would like to go home.\" She whispered in his ear. \"Why don't you like it?\" He whispered back. \"It's all right but they talk to much and I would like to spend some more time alone with you before everybody comes back.\" She told him and he had to chuckle. He had had the same idea. Holding hands they went back to the others, said Good bye and left as quickly as possible. TBC...[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 Sitting in a tight embrace on the divan in Henry's study Eliza leaned her back against his chest, Henry put his arms around her waist and nuzzled his face in her hair. \"I never want to move again.\" Eliza mumbled into his neck. \"But you have to otherwise we can't get married.\" He kissed her forehead. Eliza turned her head to kiss him, which he gladly accepted. They sat there for what seemed hours kissing and caressing each other and neither of them noticed Colonel Pickering coming inside the room. \"Oh I am sorry! Higgins, Miss Doolittle I didn't want to disturb you.\" \"Then don't do.\" Henry snapped and pulled Eliza, who had pulled way, close again. Pickering was totally confused, left the study and closed the door behind him. \"Henry! That was totally impolite.\" Eliza pulled away \"What do you want woman? I wanted to be alone with you and if he doesn't get it.\" \"Henry he might thing that we did something improper.\" She told him softly. \"Well I don't care what Pickering might think.\" Henry told her, pulled her back into his arms and started to caress her neck with his kisses again. \"Henry stop it…\" Eliza tried to pull away but wasn't strong enough and if she was honest with herself she didn't want him to stop. \"No I don't think so.\" Henry mumbled into her neck, while she let her hands wander over his body. They were totally lost into each other when the door opened and Mrs. Pearce entered. Eliza and Henry immediately sprung apart. \"Sir I am sorry… I… I only wanted to tell you that I am back and that the rest of the staff is back too.\" She stammered and left again. Henry now looked really frustrated, which made Eliza laugh. \"There is nothing funny about this whole thing woman! I am damn annoyed that somehow nobody accepts our privacy. I am you are my fiancée and I have a right to spend some time with you alone.\" \"Oh my poor, poor darling.\" She smiled teasing and caressed his cheek loving. \"Stop making fun of me you stupid girl.\" He pushed her hand away and stormed upstairs into his room. Eliza hesitated a moment, but then followed him. She knocked at his door, \"Henry it's me can I come in?\" Henry simply opened the door and sat down on the edge of his bed, \"What do you want?\" \"I am sorry that I made fun of you, but you looked so frustrated and that was so funny.\" She tried to explain herself. \"Well I don't think it's funny, I was and still am damn frustrated. I think you don't know what effect you have on me.\" He told her and Eliza sat down beside him. \"Well you could show me what effect I have on you.\" She told him with a seductive smile. \"Well I certainly could but I don't think it would be a good idea.\" He softly turned her down and couldn't believe that he didn't take the chance. Eliza tried to suppress a yawn but just couldn't. \"Are you tired?\" Henry asked her. Eliza nodded, leaned her head on Henry's shoulder and snuggled closer to him. \"Eliza why don't you go into your room and lie down a bit.\" He suggested. \"No I don't want to leave you.\" She told him very sleepy, \"Can't I lie down here with you.\" She asked him with sweet smile. \"Eliza we can't.\" He told her softly and kissed her forehead. \"Henry I only want to lie beside you and cuddle a bit, please.\" Eliza looked begging at him. \"Alright woman, but all we will do is cuddle and nobody is allowed to know you were here because when they find it out they will think we did something improper.\" Eliza nodded, pulled her shoes of and slipped into the right side of the bed. Henry lay down on the left side and pulled Eliza into his arms, who immediately fell asleep. Mrs. Pearce had looked everywhere for the pair but just couldn't find them, then she and Colonel Pickering decided to go and look if Professor Higgins would be in his room. They knocked twice but didn't get an answer, so Mrs. Pearce softly opened the door and what they saw shocked them. Higgins and Eliza lay in together bed. Eliza's Head rested on Henry's chest and he had his arms wrapped securely around her. \"Higgins!\" Pickering shouted and woke the pair up. \"What are you doing here?\" He asked and sat up. \"We … we wanted to get you for dinner.\" Mrs. Pearce declared. \"We are coming.\" Henry told them and they left the room. Eliza had her face buried in Henry's shoulder. She was so embarrassed, what would they think of her? \"Eliza is everything alright?\" Henry lifted her head, so that he could look at her face. \"I am so embarrassed.\" She got out of bed and straightened her hair and clothes. Henry got up to and wrapped his armed around her from behind, \"That's not so bad.\" \"Not so bad? The probably think that we… you know… and that for sure is not proper. They are going to think that you only marry me because you got me pregnant.\" She looked ashamed. \"Well to hell with what they think! We didn't do anything improper and I didn't father a child.\" He told her and kissed her forehead loving. \"Henry I am hungry can we go and have dinner now?\" She asked him. \"Excellent idea I am starving.\" He offered her his arm and they went downstairs into the dinning room where Pickering already sat and eat. They sat down and Pickering couldn't look at them. He was embarrassed too, he had never meant to catch them in such a situation and he couldn't believe what he had seen. Henry realized the blush on Pickering's cheeks, \"We did not do what you think we did and now let's eat our dinner I am hungry.\" He looked at Eliza and saw her smile. TBC...[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 Eliza and Mrs. Higgins stared to plan the wedding immediately, so that Henry and Eliza could get married as quickly as possible. Of course she had been informed about the fact that her son and Eliza had slept in the same bed and she suggested that it might be the best if Eliza would move in with her until the both were married, but neither Eliza nor Henry had agreed with her, so Mrs. Higgins had moved in with them to be their chaperone. She was still amazed by the way her son acted around Eliza. He couldn't keep his hands of her, whispered loving words into her ear and he tried to protect her from everything of which he thought wasn't good for her. Henry let Eliza and Mrs. Higgins plan the wedding, of course he complaint about the fact that the wedding was going to be big and relatives he didn't even know he had were going to come. The only thing Henry totally was against was the fact that Freddy Eynsford-Hill and his mother were on the guest list. \"That stupid little boy is not coming to my wedding.\" He yelled at Eliza and his mother. \"He is going to come, because his mother is a good friend of mine.\" His mother told him patiently. \"No! His mother may come but not that stupid boy!\" He now was really angry and Eliza could clearly see it. \"Henry clam down, we can talk about it.\" Eliza tried to clam him. \"Eliza my dear, I there is nothing to talk about the Eynsford-Hills have to be invited.\" Mrs. Higgins told her future daughter in law. \"Dammit mother I don't want him to come!\" Both mother and son didn't listen to each other anymore they only yelled. \"Enough!\" Eliza screamed when she couldn't take anymore, \"Mrs. Higgins I am grateful for your help, but when Henry doesn't want to invite Freddy to our wedding he has a reason for it and I would like it very much if you would just accept it.\" Eliza tried to tell her in a clam voice. \"And what reason might that be son?\" Mrs. Higgins asked her son annoyed. \"Well maybe the fact that he kissed my fiancée and insulted me in my own home.\" Henry told her angry. \"He wouldn't do such a thing, he is such a nice boy.\" Mrs. Higgins couldn't believe what her son told her. Freddy had always been such a polite, nice young man with such good manners. \"Well he did!\" Eliza yelled and stormed out of the study. \"Well done mother!\" Henry scolded his mother and went after Eliza, who sat crying on the stairs. \"Eliza please stop crying.\" He begged her, sat down beside her and took her into his arms. \"I want everything to be perfect and now you are mad at your mother.\" Eliza said between snobs. \"You want to please my mother don't you?\" He softly asked her, while he tried to wipe the tears from her cheek. \"Yes I do. She is like a mother to me.\" She still sniffed but had clamed down a bit. \"Well then we are going to invite that stupid boy. You are just not allowed to leave my side and when he comes to near to you I am going to throw him out. Is that a deal?\" He suggested. \"Yes.\" Eliza smiled and kissed his cheek. They went back into the study and informed Mrs. Higgins of the agreement. Weeks went by, which meant that the wedding date was moving nearer and nearer. Eliza was nervous, but very relived because the stress would end and she and Henry could finally consummate their love. Even with Mrs. Higgins staying with them they had a hard time resisting each other, Eliza once even wanted to sneak into Henry's room in the middle of the night, but she had fallen asleep earlier than she had planed to. The wedding preparation was really exhausting, but the only thing she had not to take care of was the honeymoon, that was going to be a surprise because Henry had planned it all. Now was the night before the wedding and she lay in a bed in one of Mrs. Higgins guest room. Neither Henry nor Eliza had wanted Eliza to spend the night away, but Mrs. Higgins had insisted that at least one custom had to be stuck to. Eliza lay there and couldn't sleep because she was so nervous, excited and happy. Henry couldn't sleep either. He hoped that everything would go well and he desperately wanted to see Eliza in her wedding dress, his mother had already told him that she was a vision in it, but he wanted to see himself and he didn't want to wait till tomorrow. He hoped that he could make Eliza happy and give her everything she deserved, but truth to be told he was afraid of the idea of having a child or children. Eliza would make a wonderful mother but he wasn't so sure if he would make a good father, he had never really liked children and he had never spend a long time with a child. The longest period was half an hour and to his luck, the child had slept the whole time. On the other side the thought of a child with Eliza excited him, a little girl that would look as beautiful as her mother, but what excited him even more was the act of convincing a child. He knew that Eliza was a virgin and that meant that he had to be very careful, gentle and patient, but he desired and loved her so much that he would do everything to be with her in that way even if she wouldn't be ready then he would simply wait and not push her. He wanted to make her feel good, loved and desired. He wanted to satisfy her in every way he could. When he finally fell asleep over his thoughts he had a big smile on his face. TBC...[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 Sorry for not updating sooner, but I was too busy and a very big Thank you to vcatrashfiend for helping me. Hope you'll like the Chapter :D . \"Eliza dear wake up, today is your big day.\" Mrs. Higgins tried to wake a very deep sleeping Eliza \"No Henry let me sleep.\" Eliza mumbled into her pillow \"I'm sorry dear but I am not Henry and if you don't get up now you won't be able to marry him in 5 hours.\" Mrs. Higgins had to smile Eliza's head snapped up, \"Oh Mrs. Higgins I am sorry I have dreamed of...\" \"My son and I don't want to know what exactly about, but now you have to get up or you won't be ready for your own wedding.\" Eliza nodded go up and went into the bathroom to take a bath. Two hours later Henry woke up and when he realized what day it was he immediately got up and went into the bathroom. He would have never admitted it, but he was damn nervous. He fumbled with his tie when Pickering knocked. \" Enter.\" Henry shouted and threw the tie away. \"Everything all right Higgins? We should go now you are getting married in two hours.\" \"No nothing is all right. I can't tie that studied tie.\" He stated frustrated. Pickering nodded, picked up the tie and tied it for him. \"Thanks.\" Henry mumbled a little embarrassed. \"Now ready to go.\" Pickering asked him. \"I don't know.\" Henry simply stated, which earned him an asking look, \"What if something goes wrong? What if she changed her mind? What if I forget what I have to say?\" Henry began to babble. \"Higgins stop it! Everything is going to be fin. I am sure that she didn't change her mind, damn that woman really loves you or why else do you think she marries you?\" He tried to calm Higgins. \"I… I… I guess I'm a bit nervous.\" Henry confessed, \"But if you dare to tell someone you have a problem.\" \"I wouldn't dare to tell someone, but now we have to go or you won't get married at all.\" Pickering told him and walked out of the room. Henry took one last deep breath, then followed Pickering and they took a cab to the church. \"Eliza you look absolute beautiful, gorgeous, stunning.\" Mrs. Higgins couldn't believe how beautiful Eliza looked in her dress. Her hair was pulled up in a bun and her dress was exquisite. It was perfect for her and looked gorgeous on her. It basically was a typical wedding dress, but still it looked a little bit fancier than the others. \"Do you think Henry is going to like it?\" Eliza asked. \"Like it? He is going to love it. I wouldn't be surprised if he won't be able to leave his hands of you.\" Mrs. Higgins smiled. \"Mrs. Higgins!\" Eliza was indignant. \"My dear I might be old, but I am still able to notice that my son finds you very attractive and if I am honest I have caught you in more that just one passionate embraces and I think it is wonderful that he I able to show his feelings so open around you.\" Mrs. Higgins told her honestly. Eliza didn't know what to say. She had never thought that it was so obvious for other people. Of course they had shown affection in public, but they had never given people something to gossip about. \"Shall we go my dear? Or do you want to let Henry wait at the altar?\" Mrs. Higgins asked her. \"NO! But what if he won't be there? What if he changed his mind?\" Eliza let her nervousness out. \"Oh Eliza that is something you won't have to worry about and now come or we really will be late.\" Mrs. Higgins took her hand and pulled her with her. Henry stood at the alter and looked down the alley. He couldn't wait anymore and then he saw her. She was a vision. Henry had a hard time believing that she was really going to be his wife and suddenly he didn't care about all the people, who were sitting in the church, he even didn't care about that stupid Eynsford-Hill boy. All that mattered was Eliza and he. Eliza smiled at his and gladly took his arm. The ceremony was nice it wasn't too romantic, but for Henry Higgins it was quite romantic. After the wedding they drove to Mrs. Higgins house were the celebration was going to take place. \"Are you happy?\" Henry asked her. \"Yes very happy, but one thing is still missing.\" She smiled at him. \"What did I forget?\" Henry started to panic and Eliza simply took his head in her hands and kissed him. \"Now I am completely happy, husband.\" She told him and linked her finders with his. \"If that makes you, you are going to be the happiest wife in the whole world.\" He told her and leaned into another kiss. When the car stopped they pulled apart. \"Ready to face our lovely guests?\" Henry asked her with the hope that there still was a chance to avoid the stupid party. \"Yes, but only if you stay near to me. You know the tow lovely ladies from your past will be there and I am not interested in seeing some stupid, lonely girls throwing themselves at my husband.\" She told him firmly. \"Oh I will gladly be by your side the whole time this way I can save you from that stupid boy if he comes too near to you.\" \"Well then let's go Professor Higgins.\" She smiled happily at him. \"As you wish Mrs. Higgins.\" It was the first time that somebody had called her Mrs. Higgins and it sounded and felt wonderful. She smiled and kissed him. Henry first surprised by the force of the kiss quickly accepted it and they were lost in their own world. \"What is taking so long? The guests are waiting.\" Mrs. Higgins opened the door of the car. The two sprung apart and Eliza blushed. \"Mother what do you think you are doing?\" He asked her annoyed. \"What I am doing? What do you think you're doing?\" She shot back. \"I can do what ever I want with my wife.\" Henry told her and knew he was right. \"Of course you can do what you want with our wife, but please don't do it in a car which is standing in front of my house, or better don't do it in a car at all.\" Mrs. Higgins told him. Eliza and Henry got out of the car and Henry immediately went beside her and linked his fingers with hers, tighter they went into Mrs. Higgins ballroom where their guests were already waiting. TBC…[Chapter 17] Sorry for not Updating sooner. Hope you like it =) Chapter 17 They entered the room and all eyes were on them. The guests smiled and began to clap. Henry let his glance wander across the room and when he spotted Freddie he pulled Eliza closer to him. \"He won't do anything, after all I am Mrs. Higgins now.\" She whispered into his ear. \"I still like hold you close, so he won't do to dare something.\" He told her and they walked over to Pickering and Mrs. Higgins. \"Congratulations Higgins and Mrs. Higgins.\" Pickering said and gave Eliza a short hug. \"Don't over do it old friend, she is my wife and not yours.\" Henry teased him and Eliza had to laugh. After dinner, the couple had to open the dance floor. \"Eliza I don't want to.\" Henry whined. \"Henry please do it for me, the sooner we get done with this whole thing the sooner we can go.\" Eliza tried to convince him. \"Alright.\" Henry took her hand and they started to dance. Eliza was glowing with happiness and Henry, even if he acted like he didn't like it, loved it that Eliza was his wife and he loved to dance with her and show everybody that she was his wife. When the dance ended Henry went for a short walk in the garden. \"Henry, how nice to see you again so soon.\" Marry greeted him sweetly. \"What do you want?\" Henry asked her annoyed. \"Oh my dear I only wanted to know if you got my note?\" She asked with a seductive smile. \"What note?\" Eliza asked from behind her and walked over to Henry. \"The note where she offered me to be my lover even if I am married.\" Henry coldly told Eliza and pulled her closer to him. \"Oh really? I don't think that you will need a lover, do you?\" Eliza asked him while looking at Marry. \"Why the devil would I want an other woman if I have you.\" He told her, took her face in his hands and kissed her. Eliza wrapped her arms around neck and deepened the kiss. When they pulled away Eliza walked over to Mary, \"I will tell you this now for the last time. Leave my HUSBAND alone! He doesn't need you, he has me.\" She told her with a dangerous voice. \"Eliza shall we go back inside?\" Henry asked her. Eliza nodded, linked her fingers with Henrys and they walked back together inside. \"Henry why didn't you tell me about the note?\" Eliza asked him. Henry struggled for a moment, \"I didn't want to make you to get jealous or worried.\" \"Oh that makes sense, but if you dare to only think about meeting one of those little girls ever again I am going to….\" Henry interrupted her whit a loving, but passionate kiss. The guests were gasping at the sight. \"Don't worry about such things.\" Henry told her after they broke the kiss. \"Can we go now Henry?\" Eliza asked him with pealing eyes. \"We should or I am going to make love to you in front of our guests.\" Henry growled into her ear and let his hands caress her bottom. \"Henry stop this behaviour right now.\" His mother, who suddenly stood behind Eliza scold him. \"Mother I am not going to stop because we are leaving now.\" Henry told her, took Eliza's hand and they went home. \"Where is Higgins?\" Pickering asked Mrs. Higgins. \"He and Eliza left.\" Mrs. Higgins simply stated and walked over to some of her friends. \"Welcome to your new room.\" Henri murmured into Eliza's ear as they entered the bedroom. \"Well thank you very much.\" Eliza whispered and kissed him. Henry didn't waste any time and deepened the kiss. He moved them backwards, slowly lowered her until her back touched the blanket beneath them then pressed his chest to hers, the tenor of their kisses growing more passionate with each passing second. \"Henry.\" Eliza moaned as she felt him opening her dress and undressed her completely. \"You are so beautiful.\" Henry told her loving as she was trying to cover her naked body. Eliza only blushed. Henry began to trail kisses down her neck and ended at her tummy. Eliza felt an unbelievable desire and couldn't hold still. She wriggled herself, tossed her head from side to side and moaned. Her moaning got louder and louder and as much as she wanted she just couldn't hold herself back. Henry somehow had managed to undress himself. He lay on top of her, let his hands wander over her body and caressed her breasts with his lips. He positioned himself between her legs ready to enter her. When Eliza felt his erection she began to tremble. She didn't know much about making love, but she had been told that it would hurt. Henry realized that she was scared; loving kissed her forehead and whispered in her ear, \"It's going to be alright. I am going to be careful, but if you want we can stop now.\" \"No I don't want to stop. I trust you and I love you.\" She told him and Henry was that she meant it. \"I love you to.\" He told her and carefully entered her and Eliza gasped loudly. Henry held still and waited till she gave him the o.k. to move. When the pain faded and Eliza started to feel comfortable she nodded, which told Henry that he could start moving. Henry kissed her and started to thrust into her gently. Eliza started to moan a gasped and pressed her nails into his back as Henry moved faster into her. Henry buried his face in the hollow of her neck and began to move faster. Eliza felt a tingle sprawl through her body and pressed Henry closer to her. Henry who was close had a hard time holding himself back, but he wanted Eliza to climax first. \"Oh…OH… OH GOD HENRY!\" Eliza screamed as she came and buried her face in Henrys shoulders. \"Eliza.\" Henry growled as he climaxed shortly after Eliza and collapsed on top of Eliza. Eliza tried to catch her breath, smiled and smoothed Henrys hair. \"God I love you Eliza.\" Henry told her, kissed her loving and rolled of her. Eliza suddenly felt lonely as Henry pulled out of her, so she snuggled into his side and rested her head on top of his chest. \"Are you alright Eliza?\" Henry asked her gently as her wounded his arms around her waist. \"No, alright doesn't even come near to what I feel. I feel so many things I have never felt before and I really, really love that feeling.\" She confessed. \"Well I am glad to hear that, because I intend to make love to you very often.\" He told her and caressed her back. \"So I did… well… did I…. did I satisfy you?\" Eliza mumbled into his chest. \"Oh yes you did satisfy me very much.\" He told her and loving kissed her. Eliza yawed, \"Oh I'm sorry I think I might be a little tired.\" She apologized. \"Oh that's alright.\" He told her, \"We had a very exhausting day. Why don't we sleep, we have to get up tomorrow or we won't be able to go on our honeymoon.\" \"Where are we going?\" Eliza asked him. \"That is a surprise.\" He told her and kissed the tip of her nose. Eliza nodded, \"Alright. Good night husband.\" And kissed him- \"Good night wife.\" He responded and pulled her a bit closer to him. It didn't take long until Eliza had fallen asleep. Henry looked at his wife and couldn't believe how happy he was. He wouldn't dare to tell anybody, but today had been the happiest day in his life. The woman he loved more that anything else in this world had married him and they had finally consummated their love. Henry smiled, kissed her cheek and fell asleep quite quickly, with Eliza in his arms. Hope you liked it. TBC...[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 Slowly opening his eyes Henry saw the sleeping Eliza in his arms and had to grin. He had slept better than he ever had. It had felt so good holding Eliza trough the night, feeling her naked body against his when he wok up and now he was enjoying the view over her naked body. Eliza began to stir. \"Good morning my beautiful wife.\" Henry told her. Eliza stretched her arms above her had, that made the blanked fall from her chest. Henry couldn't stop himself from looking at her beautiful, perfect breasts. When Eliza realized what he was looking at she quickly pulled the blanked back up to cover herself. \"Oh don't be so prude. It's not like I haven't seen them before and you don't have any reason to be embarrassed.\" Henry told her and began to kiss her neck. \"Henry stop it, this isn't proper!\" She tried to stop his caress. \"What isn't proper?\" He asked her a little confused; he didn't understand what he she meant. He had thought that had liked their love making yesterday. \"Making love in the morning and it also wasn't proper that we slept naked.\" She explained. \"Who told you such stupid nonsense?\" He asked her annoyed, because he wanted to spend some nice time with her. \"Well your mother and her friends.\" She told him and turned her back to him. \"My mother!\" Henry just couldn't believe, it why the devil did his mother have to tell Eliza such stupid things? Henry gently pulled to look at him. \"Eliza there is nothing wrong with us making love when ever we want or did I hurt you yesterday?\" He asked getting concerned. \"No you didn't really hurt me, well I don't think that you did it intentional.\" She told him. \"So I did hurt you. Why didn't you tell me that I hurt you?\" He felt sorry; he had never meant to hurt her. He had tried to be careful and gentle, but it seamed like he wasn't gentle enough. \"Henry you didn't really hurt me. It only hurt at the beginning, but then it felt unbelievable.\" She leaned closer and kissed him. Henry was glad knew that she meant what she said. Henry gladly accepted the kiss. Quickly both were tangled in lovemaking. Henry tried to be as gentle as possible, but Eliza had other ideas, \"Henry… please… I swear… I'm not… OHOH…Henry… I am not going to break… OG GOD!\" Henry was first not quite sure if he should be more passionate and be rougher, but Eliza began to thrust her hips against his more impatient, wanting and demanding. Henry couldn't hold himself back anymore and let his desire go. Eliza moved beneath him and as closer she was the faster she wanted him to move. To feel him more intensive Eliza wounded her legs around his hips. \"God Eliza!\" Henry moaned as he slipped deeper into her. Eliza buried her face in his neck and dunged her nails into his shoulders. Henry began to thrust faster and harder into her, \"OHOHOHGOD HENRY!\" Eliza cried as she came and Henry followed her seconds later. A few minutes later Henry lay on his back and had Eliza cuddled against him. \"Do you still have something against making love in the morning?\" He asked her teasing. Eliza laughed and playful slapped his chest, \"Oh I definitely don't have anything against making love in the morning, now that we talk about it I wouldn't mind doing it again…. Now maybe...\" \"As tempting as this sounds we have to get ready or we can't go on our honeymoon.\" He told her, moving some hairs from her face. \"Oh yes our honeymoon. Where did you say we were going?\" She asked. \"Oh no that won't work, it's a surprise.\" He told her and got up. Eliza turned to look at him and couldn't take her eyes from the lower part of his body. When she noticed that Henry knew what she was watching him she quickly turned her glance away. \"I didn't mean to…\" She tried to explain to him. \"No need to excuse yourself.\" Henry told her as he saw that she blushed. \"Well now I know why it did hurt the first time.\" She mumbled and hid her face in the pillow. \"I really didn't mean to hurt you.\" He told her and pulled his robe on. \"Henry we have talked about this before, it didn't hurt much.\" She turned to him again and was glad that he was dressed (more or less). \"Well then get up woman we have to get dressed.\" \"Henry could you please hand me my robe?\" She sweetly asked. Henry nodded, went to bring her the robe, but when she grabbed for it he pulled it away. \"Henry give me my robe.\" She sat up and pulled the sheets up to her chin. \"Oh come on darling don't be so prude! You know there is nothing I haven't seen before.\" Her told her with a big grin. \"Henry!\" Eliza cried, sprung up, ran over to Henry and slapped his chest. \"Ouch! Well at least you got up.\" He smiled mischievously, pulled her in his arms and kissed her passionately. Eliza pulled away, grabbed her robe, put it on and went into the bathroom. Henry waited a second and then followed her. Now dressed and their luggage packed the couple sat at the breakfast table. \"Good morning Mr. and Mrs. Higgins.\" Mrs. Pearce said as she entered the room. \"Good morning Mrs. Pearce.\" Eliza answered her with the biggest smile. Henry who sat on the opposite side of the table also had a big smile on his face. Mrs. Pearce had to smile at the couple. She had never in her whole life seen Mr. Higgins as happy as he was right now. Eliza for sure was the perfect woman for him, she could handle him like no other and he was so kind, sweet, loving and caring. \"Sir your car is here.\" The butler came in. \"Alright we are coming, could you please load the luggage in we are coming in a second.\" Henry told and then turned to Eliza, \"Wife we have to go.\" \"Well then lets go husband.\" Eliza answered excited. They quickly went to get ready and when they were seated in the car Eliza laid her head on Henry's shoulder, \"Henry would you now please tell me were we're going.\" Henry looked down at her and smiled, he found it incredibly sweet that she was so impatient. \"My darling wife you are one of the most impatient creatures in the whole universe.\" \"Henry please tell me.\" She plead \"Alright we are going to the France Riviera.\" He told her smiling. \"Oh Henry! That's wonderful!\" She smiled and threw her arms around him. TBC[Chapter 19] Sorry for not updating sooner I just didn't have any ideas. Hope you aren't too angry at me. have fun reading :D Chapter 19 \"Eliza don't lean over the railing!\" Henry called out from behind. \"Oh Henry! I won't fall down.\" She told him laughing and went to him. Henry raised his eyebrows, wrapped his arms around her and kissed her forehead. \"That's good, because I don't plan on loosing you.\" He whispered into her hair. \"And I'm not planning on going anywhere.\" She told him. \"So you don't want to go into our room?\" He asked her teasing and let his hands wander further down her back. \"Alone? \" She asked back. \"No, I would keep your company.\" He told her with a grin. Eliza smiled, nodded and Henry took her hand and pulled her with him to their room. \"And what are you planning on doing now Professor?\" She asked him and let her fingertips wander down his jaw. Henry didn't say a word, he pulled her into a passionate kiss and they slowly lay down on the bed. \"Hmm.\" Eliza sighed. \"What's the matter?\" Henry let his hands stroke her bare shoulders. \"I'm thinking.\" She told him and nuzzled her face into his chest. \"Alright and about what? If I may ask.\" He wanted to know. \"About us.\" She smiled into his chest. \"Come on Eliza don't make me ask for everything.\" He told her impatient. \"Impatient aren't we?\" Eliza propped her head up on his chest to have a better look at him, \"I am thinking about us; how everything changed, how nice it is that you love me and how much I like it when you show me how much you love me.\" She smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the chin. \"Do you want me to show you how much I love you, again?\" He asked her and before she could answer him he manoeuvred himself on top of her and showed her just how much he loved her. \"Henry it's so beautiful!\" Eliza told him happily after she had seen the whole cottage. \"I am glad you like it, darling.\" \"I like it very much. Thank you Henry.\" Eliza threw herself in Henry's arms. \"Darling, can we go swimming tomorrow?\" She asked him after some time. \"If it's warm enough we can go. Do you even have a swimsuit?\" He asked her, trying to get out of going swimming. \"Oh yes!\" She nodded smiling, \"Your mother helped me selecting one before the wedding, I first didn't know why I would need one, but she told me that I might need him some day. Did she about our honeymoon location?\" \"My mother of course. Yes I told her because she didn't stop asking.\" He told her. \"I also didn't stop asking but you wouldn't tell me.\" She told him sulking and moved over to the big window. \"Eliza not again. It was supposed to be a surprise.\" He told her gently and wrapped his arms around her from behind. \"Henry?\" She asked sleepy. \"Hmm?\" He mumbled into her hair. \"I am tired.\" \"Well then lets go to bed.\" He suggested. \"I am to tired to move.\" Her head still rested on his shoulder. Henry didn't say a word, he simply stepped back and picked her up. \"Henry what are you doing?\" She squealed. \"I am carrying my beautiful wife to bed.\" He told her and carried her into their bedroom. \"Eliza wake up.\" Henry tried to wake her. \"No… Henry not now.\" She mumbled and buried her face in her pillow. Henry laughed lightly and gently began to kiss her shoulder. \"Henry stop!\" Eliza scolded him and turned to look at him. \"Well at least you are awake now.\" He laughed, \"Good morning my darling.\" He said and gave her a gentle kiss. \"Good morning Henry.\" She gently kissed him back, \"Why did you want me to wake up?\" She asked as she got out of bed. \"I thought we could spend some time together.\" He came up behind her and let his hands slip inside her robe, which she had just pulled on. \"Henry! Is that all you can think about?\" She asked him annoyed. \"What do you expect? I am a man.\" He joked. \"HAHA very funny.\" She said and went into the bathroom without another word. \"Oh damn! Why can't a woman be more like a man?\" Henry mumbled. \"Ok I give up! I'm sorry.\" Henry apologized. They had been sitting there having their breakfast and Eliza hadn't said one word to him. \"Oh really? I thought that it wasn't your fault, after all you're a man.\" She told him mad. \"Oh come on it was a joke!\" He tried to avoid a fight. \"Ok then tell me why did you want me to get up?\" She asked him. Henry knew that he had to be very careful. He was suppose to say what she wanted to hear. \"I woke you up because the weather is so nice and you wanted to go to the beach.\" He told her, proud of himself for choosing the right words. \"Oh really?\" She asked him, not quite believing him. \"Yes! You are my wife and if you wish to go to the beach I make your wish come true.\" He told her trying to make her believe. \"Well if that was the reason I think I am going to pack our things for the beach.\" She told him smiling and Henry knew that she knew that he was lying. \"Henry wait!\" Eliza cried after him as he stormed into the cottage and slammed shut every door behind him. \"Henry?\" She asked puzzling as he entered their bedroom. \"What do you want?\" He asked angrily. \"How about you tell me what happened at the beach and why did you punch that poor boy?\" She asked softly. \"Poor boy? That 'poor boy' was talking about you in the most improper way!\" He told her self-defending. \"Oh really and what was did he say that was so improper?\" She asked him. \"He told his stupid friends that 'the little sweet thing over there' was going to be the next lucky girl he would take and that after him no man would ever going to make her feel as good as he would. When I told him to stop speaking about you like that and that you are married to me, he laughed and told me that you only married me because of my money and that it wouldn't bother him at all and that he would get you into his bed!\" He told her furiously. \"And then you punched him.\" Eliza finished the story. Henry only nodded. \"Oh Henry! I swear I would never do such a stupid thing.\" She told him. \"I know. It was the way he spoke about you, no other an is allowed to speak or even think about you like this.\" He told her calming down. Eliza nodded understanding and sat down beside him on their bed. \"Henry?\" She asked gently after moments of silence. \"Yes.\" He answered just as gentle as she had asked. \"I would never in my whole life jump into another man's bed. Do you believe me that?\" Eliza tried to make sure he was sure of her faithfulness. \"Of course I believe you…\" He told her, but he didn't sound so certain. \"But…\" She tried to make him finish his sentence. \"I just don't like it when other men look at you or talk a bout you like this!\" He told her, ashamed about his jealousy. \"To be honest I find it quite attractive when you're jealous and protective over me.\" She told him and gave him a sweet kiss on the neck. \"Oh is that so?\" He asked teasing, wrapped his arms around her and then they showed each other just how much they love each other. TBC... and this time sooner then this Chapter :D[Chapter 20] Here is the next Chapter I hope you like it :D Chapter 20 \"Eliza, I am hungry.\" Henry whispered in her hair. \"Oh.\" She sighed disappointed. \"Why are you disappointed?\" He asked her not quite knowing what was going on. \"It's so cosy and I don't feel like going out.\" She told him and buried her head in his chest. \"Who said something of going out?\" He asked and gently stroked her back. \"But I thought you are hungry.\" She didn't quite understand him. \"Yes I am and you can cook.\" He smiled down at her. \"So my dear husband, are you asking me to cook for you?\" She asked him teasing. \"Yes I am and now get up. I am starving.\" He ordered. \"But only this once.\" She told him as she got up, \"I'll never again listen to any of your orders.\" \"I know I am damn lucky.\" He told her as she left the room, \"I really am damn lucky.\" Ten minutes later Eliza came back and brought a tray with her. \"Ah good! I thought you would never come back.\" He joked. Eliza laughed lightly and sat down on her bedside, setting the tray between them. \"Ah! You made sandwiches.\" He said happily and took one. \"Yes I hope you like them.\" She answered and also took a sandwich. When they were done with their 'dinner' Eliza brought the dishes back into the kitchen and then went back into the bedroom and lay down beside Henry and snuggled into his side. \"Did you like the 'dinner' I cooked you?\" She asked him with her head resting on his shoulder. \"Yes! The best sandwiches in the whole world!\" He teased her. \"Henry, don't make fun of me!\" She scolded him and hit his chest lightly. \"Alright I am sorry! But your sandwiches really were delicious.\" He told her, leaned toward her and gave her a sweet kiss. \"Good to know, but don't get used to me cooking your dinner or me bringing you your food.\" She told him and moved even closer to him. \"Eliza?\" Henry asked softly after a couple of minutes, but didn't get an answer. When he looked down at Eliza he saw that she was asleep. Henry smiled, pulled the covers higher and after a few minutes he too had fallen asleep. Eliza was the first one who woke let her glance wander across the room and wondered why it still was dark. She turned to look at the alarm clock and saw that it just was a little after five o'clock in the morning. Confused about her early waking up she watched Henry. He looked so peaceful and gentle when he was asleep, he looked like he couldn't harm anybody but that for sure was not true, yesterday had proofed it. She felt bad for what had happened even if it wasn't her fault. She was sad about the fact that such stupid talk could hurt Henry like this; it meant that he didn't thrust her completely and that hurt her. She also knew that he knew that she loved him very much, but he just didn't think that he was good enough for her, that he was to old, to grumpy and that he just didn't feel that he was worth to feel happiness. Deep in thoughts Eliza didn't realize that Henry has woken up. \"Morning.\" Henry told her drowsy. \"Morning Henry.\" She responded caught. \"Why are you awake so early in the morning?\" He asked. \"I just woke up, why did you wake up?\" She asked and moved into his arms. \"I had the feeling that somebody was watching me.\" He teased her. \"Oh really and who would that be?\" She asked playing innocent. \"I don't know, maybe the woman I hide in my closet.\" He joked. \"That's not funny Henry.\" She told him angrily and turned away from him. Henry moved closer to her from behind and kissed the back of her neck, \"Eliza darling, I was joking.\" He moved down and kissed her shoulder blade, \"I didn't mean it like this, why would I need another woman if I have you.\" He begged, gently turned her so that she was lying on her back, but Eliza crossed her arms in front of her breasts. \"Please don't be mad at me.\" He begged and tried to kiss her, but she turned her head away and the kiss landed on her cheek. \"Eliza, darling, sweetheart.\" Henry sounded desperate and that mad Eliza smile. \"See I make you smile, now please forgive me.\" He tried to kiss her again and this time she didn't turn away. She kissed him back and even deepened the kiss. When they broke apart a breathless Henry asked her, \"Does that mean I am forgiven?\" \"Yes but don't you dare to make a stupid joke like this again.\" She told him with a serious look on her face. \"I swear I will never do something stupid like this again.\" He promised and really meant it. \"Better for you or you would regret it one day.\" She smiled and let her hand run up and down his upper body. \"A wise woman once told me that I should never do something which I could regret later.\" He told her and moved closer to her. \"Oh really and who was that wise woman?\" She asked even if she already knew the answer. \"That wise woman was my beautiful, wonderful wife.\" He told her, took her into his arms and kissed her passionately. Henry let his hands wander over her bare spine and Eliza responded by letting her hands caress his chest and moaning into his mouth. Henry broke the kiss and let his lips caress her cheek, chin, neck every part of her body that they could reach. Eliza moaned and groaned and she let him have his way, every touch, and every kiss leaving her craving for more. It felt so good to know how much he wanted her. Eliza arched her back, trying to signal him to finally make love to her. Henry apparently got the message and seconds later they were making passionately making love. \"Maybe we should fight more often.\" Henry suggested. \"Oh and why? If I may ask.\" She asked burring her face in the hollow of his neck. \"Because I like it when we make up.\" He told her and kissed her forehead loving. \"Well yes the making up is good, but I really hate the fighting part.\" She mumbled in his neck. \"Then how about we only make up.\" He suggested and kissed her shoulder, \"We have a lot fights to make up for.\" He told her and disappeared under the covers. \"Henry.\" Eliza giggled seconds later. TBC...[Chapter 21] Sorry for not updating sooner, but I didn't have time and I also had no good ideas. I hope you'll like it :D And please review. Chapter 21 The rest of the two-week long honeymoon went by peaceful. They rarely fought and loved to make up. They often went to the small village, where they would sit in a small café, talk and simply enjoyed the time they spent together. Henry even once allowed Eliza to go shopping and that earned him a big thank you. \"Would you please get the luggage out of the cab and bring it upstairs to the master bedroom.\" Henry told one of his staff members as they entered their home. \"Oh Henry it feels so good to be home again.\" Eliza smiled happily. \"If you say so… \" Henry wasn't so happy to be back again, he had enjoyed their honeymoon and didn't want their togetherness to end. \"Eliza my dear.\" Mrs Higgins happily greeted her. \"Hello Mrs. Higgins.\" Eliza smiled and gave her a quick hug. \"Hello mother.\" Henry greeted her; annoyed that his mother always was there when she disturbed most. \"Hello son. It's so good to have you finally back, how was your honeymoon?\" She asked. \"It was wonderful the French Riviera is so beautiful.\" Eliza answered shortly, she didn't want her mother in law to know that they hadn't seen much beside their cottage or ti be more specific their bedroom. \"I bet you didn't see much of it.\" Mrs. Higgins told her with a grin on her face. \"Mother! I don't think that this is any of your business.\" Henry told her angrily knowing how uncomfortable it made Eliza feel. \"Of course son, I am sorry.\" Mrs. Higgins told them, but Henry knew that she didn't mean it. Henry shook his head, took Eliza's hand and pulled her with him into his study sitting down on the divan. Mrs. Higgins sat down on the armchair. \"I am glad you had a nice time in.\" Mrs. Higgins told them and smiled at the fact that her son didn't let go of Eliza's hand. \"Yes we had a very nice time.\" Henry answered cold. \"Henry don't be so cold to your mother.\" Eliza scowled him. \"I am sorry mother.\" Henry apologized even if he didn't mean it. \"I think it would be best if I leave now, after all you to must just came back and you must be quite tired.\" Mrs. Higgins told them and left. A few moments after she had left Pickering entered the study. \"Higgins, Mrs. Higgins you're back. I hope you enjoyed your honeymoon.\" He politely asked. \"Hello Colonel Pickering it's great to be back. We enjoyed our honeymoon very much.\" Eliza answered smiling while she tried to pull her hand away from his, but he was stronger then her. \"Well I leave the two of you alone. I am meeting an old friend of mine, you two have a pleasant night.\" He told them and left. As soon as Henry heard the door shut he pulled Eliza into his arms. \"Henry what's gotten into you?\" She asked him laughing. \"Nothing has gotten into me I simply want to be close to my wife. Do you have anything against that?\" He asked her and started kissing her neck. \"Oh I have nothing against that, but my we should… oh… we… god… we should…\" Eliza tried to tell him, but he was still kissing her neck and now he also let his hands wander over her body. \"We should what?\" Henry whispered into her ear with a husky voice. \"We should… oh Henry… move this into… oh… our bedroom.\" She moaned. \"Well if that is what you whish milady.\" He told her with a big grin. \"Oh I don't know maybe I should go up alone, I suddenly feel terrible tired.\" She teased him. \"Oh no you don't, you want me to go with you. Don't you?\" Henry asked her, pulled her closer and kissed her loving. \"You're right I want you to go with me and you know what? I also don't feel tired.\" She told him, took his hand in hers and pulled him with her to their bedroom. \"Woman I really love you.\" He told her as they entered they bedroom. TBC... and I hope you enjoyed it :D[Chapter 22] Chapter 22: Marriage Oh God it's been over a year since I last updated! I'm sorry for taking so long, but I just didn't feel like writing and didn't have an idea about what I should write! So I hope you're not mad at me and you'll still read the new chapter and I hope you'll enjoy it! Let me know what you think about this chapter and if you have any wishes about what should/could happen in the next chapter or the following onesyou're more than welcome to make suggestions! Have fun reading :D :D ! Chapter 22 Eliza stood at the edge of their bed and watched Henry closing the door. \"I really am happy to be back home.\" She sighed. Henry grinned at her, \"I could have stayed a little bit longer, if I had to. We certainly knew how to occupied each other and that quite well.\" \"Henry stop it!\" Eliza exclaimed, walked over to him and hit Henry's chest in a playful manner. \"No my dear, you never said that, you said or to be more exact you shouted the exact opposite. You always shouted, and I quote 'Don't stop Henry, I beg you Henry, please don't stop'.\" Eliza was about to hit his chest again, but Henry caught her hand before she could and kissed the inside of her wrist loving. \"Henry really you shouldn't talk about this.\" She told him in earnestly. \"Oh and why ever not?\" He asked her and began t kiss her neck. \"Because it isn't proper.\" She told him plainly and moved away from him. \"Oh yes right not proper, how could it be proper for me to make love to my wife?\" He asked her in a joking manner, walked to her, wrapped his arms around her and started to kiss the back of her neck. \"Henry why do you never take me serious?\" Eliza asked him and turned around in his embrace. Now face-to-face Henry didn't hesitate a second, leaned forward and kissed her. Eliza hesitated a moment, but then she returned the kiss. Henry who had rested his hands on Eliza's back, moved his hands down over her behind and pulled her even closer to him. Their kiss deepened and Eliza couldn't help and wounded her arms around Henry's neck. \"Oh God Henry.\" Eliza groaned breathless. \"Henry is enough my dear.\" Henry laughed softly and kissed her forehead loving. \"Very funny.\" Eliza replied in an annoyed manner, snuggled closer to Henry and rested her head on his chest. \"Oh that wasn't a joke, I'm serious Henry really is enough. People I love don't have to call me God.\" Henry told her and caressed her cheek loving. \"Ah! So you love me.\" She said in a teasing manner and gently stroked his chest. \"No I only married you because you're such 'a sweet little girl'.\" He told her and turned them, so he lay on top of her. He then began to place soft open mouth kisses on her neck while his hands wandered up and down on the sides of her torso. \"Yes …mmhh … that is what … oh … I thought… oh Henry.\" Eliza tried to reply in a serious manner, but failed because Henry started to move his hands over her breasts and showed her that she was much more than just 'a sweet little thing' to him. The next morning Henry watches Eliza, who lay sleeping peacefully in his arms. He looked at her, admired her face and played with her beautiful long brown hair. He loved playing with her hair, he had discovered what an relaxing affect it had on him during their honeymoon. He gently caressed Eliza's cheek and she began to stir. \"Morning Henry.\" Eliza greeted him drowsily. \"Morning my love.\" Henry replied happily. \"You're very happy this morning, aren't you?\" She asked him, snuggled deeper into their embrace and rested her head on Henry's chest. \"Well yes I am! Why ever shouldn't I be?\" He asked, smiling down at her. \"Well for one thing you are Henry Higgins and Henry Higgins is never happy and especially not in the mornings.\" She answered happily, moved up and gave him a loving kiss. \"Well if that is what I get for being happy in the mornings, I will from now on always be happy in the mornings and how ever could I not be happy, waking up next to such a beautiful woman?\" He replied and pulled her into a long passionate kiss. After quite some time Eliza had to pull out of their kiss, because she was put of breath, but Henry didn't stop. He simply moved downwards, kissed her along her jaw to the side of her neck, to her cleavage. While doing so he lifted the hem of her nightgown and moved his hand up her legs to her hip and pulled her closer. \"Henry, what's gotten into you?\" Eliza signed out of breath. \"Oh nothing has gotten into me, but I wouldn't mind getting into you.\" He mumbled into her neck and petted her backside. \"Henry really! You are acting like a randy young man.\" Eliza replied shocked and tried to push herself away from Henry, but didn't succeed. Henry looked up at her with a big grin on his face, \"Well I definitely am a man and you know that and I mean I wouldn't call myself randy, but I for sure enjoy our love making very much and it definitely is one of my favorite ways to spend my time. But now I have to fulfill my husbandly duties, so stop talking.\" He told her, moved back down to caress her neck with kisses and moved her nightgown up over Eliza's head and Eliza gave up fighting Henry's attempt to seduce her. Later they were laying side-by-side breathing hard. \"I thought the honeymoon was over.\" Eliza signed. \"Oh yes it is, but that doesn't mean that I have now lost interest in you.\" Henry told her as he got out of their bed. \"God to know.\" Eliza replied grinning. \"Now get up woman, I'm hungry and breakfast should be ready soon.\" He told her as he pulled his trousers on. \"Oh no I don't want to.\" Eliza whined and snuggled even deeper into their bed. \"Can't we just stay here?\" She turned over to look at him and asked him sweetly. \"No we can't and you know that, so pull yourself together and get up woman. \" He replied as he put his cardigan over his shirt, \"Oh and my mother left a note saying that she will come over in, wait.\" He turned to look at he clock, \"Half an hour, to have breakfast with us.\" Eliza looked startled and sat up, pulling the covers with her, \"What?! Why didn't you tell me this sooner?\" \"Oh well I had better things to do.\" He told her with a smug grin on his face. Eliza leaped out of the bed and ran into the bathroom. \"Eliza what the devil is your problem?\" Henry asked, clearly not understanding why she was so stressed. \"What my problem is? Is that an serious question?\" She shouted angrily from the bathroom. \"Well of course it's a serious question so answer me wife.\" He told her still not quite understanding what made her so worked up. \"Alright Henry Higgins I'll tell you what is wrong! Your mother is going to be her in less than half an hour and I look like I just got up! No Worse! I look like I just had sex!\" Eliza shouted at him as she stormed out of the bathroom to their closet. \"Well my dear we just had sex.\" Henry laughed. \"This is not funny Henry! I know that we just had sex, but that doesn't mean that your mother has to know it. She will think that I'm no good for you and that I'm keeping you from your work.\" Eliza rambled as she put on her dress. Henry could do nothing else but stare at her and wonder why she was going crazy. His mother loved Eliza, she thought that Eliza was the best thing that ever happened to him, which of course was true, but he would never admit it, at least not in front of his mother. \"Henry don't stare! Make yourself useful and help me with the buttons on the back of my dress, I can't reach them!\" Eliza barked at him. Henry hesitated for a second but then went over to Eliza and slowly buttoned up on button after the other, while he whispered against the back of her neck, \"I'm sorry my dear, I didn't mean to upset you.\" Henry stopped speaking when the dress was zipped up, plated a small, tender kiss on the back of her neck and continued speaking with a soft voice, \"My mother could never hate you, she thinks that you are the best thing that ever happened to me, an I have to admit that she is right.\" He again planted some loving kisses on her neck, wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her closer. Eliza immediately relaxed and rested her head on his chest. \"Henry the man I married would have never said something like this.\" She told him with trembling voice. It was obvious that she was deeply touched by his confession. She turned around to face him, put her right hand on his left cheek and continued speaking with a soft and loving voice, \"You aren't like the man I married and even less the man I got engaged to.\" \"Oh and what was the man you got to engaged to and later married like?\" He asked her a little bit afraid of her answer. \"Oh he was distanced, sometimes cold and also grumpy.\" She answered and planted a loving kiss on his cheek, \"But I don't mind that you have changed, because you are so much more loving and happier at least with me. I would have never dreamed of us being so happy and of us acting so much in love.\" Eliza caressed his cheek with her hand, moved forward and kissed him loving. Henry wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her even closer. They didn't know how long they stood there embracing each other, but neither wanted to let go. \"You know, I would have never thought that I would enjoy having a wife as much as I do.\" Henry mumbled in her hair, but didn't let go of her. \"I enjoy having a husband very much too.\" Eliza replied and planted a loving kiss on his chest. \"I know and trust me I'll do my very best to please you.\" He told her, moving one hand down from her waist to her backside and caressed it gently, when there suddenly knocked someone at the bedroom door. \"Mr. Higgins your mother just arrived.\" Rung out Mrs. Pearce's voice from the other side of the door. \"We will be down in a second, please escort her into the dining room.\" Henry answered. Eliza pulled out of their embrace, walked over to the mirror, checked her hair and turned back around to Henry. \"Well my dear it seams like we have to go down to my mother, no matter if we want to or not.\" Henry told her and held out his hand to her. \"Well then lets go.\" Eliza answered as she took his hand. Henry looked at her for a second, then he lifted their linked hands up, planted a loving kiss on the back of Eliza's hand and walked down the stairs with his wife by his side.[Chapter 23] Sorry that it took me so long to update! I just didn't know how the story would continue! daydreaming87 I hope you like the new Chapter and as I promised I was able to upload it within this week ;D everybody I hope you'll enjoy the new Chapter and I really would appreciate some reviews. If you have andy requests or ideas on how the story shall continue I'd love for some impulse. Chapter 23 As the weeks passed by, the newly married couple started to settle in a routine both of them quite enjoyed. They got up together in the morning, often after some, as Henry like to call it \"good morning love making\", got dressed and had breakfast together. Afterwards they would settle in Henries study, which over the last weeks had more or less become their study, where Henry would completely concentrate on his studies and Eliza would sit at her newly set up desk and do Henries paperwork. Normally about an hour or two after lunch Henry found it hard to concentrate on his work and far more enjoyable to spent his time distracting his wife from her work. Today was no different, like always an hour and a half after lunch Henry took a seat behind his wife, who was concentrated on the paperwork, and started to kiss her neck. \"Henry really!\" Elisa exclaimed laughing and leaned back into her husband. \"What ever is the matter my dear?\" Henry asked grinning into her neck and continued showering her neck with kisses. \"You are distracting me from doing your paperwork, my dear husband.\" She replied and turned around with her chair, so that she was now facing her husband. Henry paid her words no attention at all. He continued kissing her neck upwards until her found that spot sensitive behind her right ear that made her moan every time. As much as Eliza wanted to resist her husband she simply couldn't. Henry knew exactly what made her give into his advances. She moved to sit on the edge on her chair to be nearer Henry, wrapped her arms around her husbands neck and whispered \"Henry, darling please.\" \"Please what my dear?\" Henry asked her grinning as he stopped kissing his wife's neck and moved back to have a look at her face. \"Please don't torture me like that.\" She told him longingly, moved forward and kissed him passionately. As much as Henry would have enjoyed to torture his wife a bit longer, his longing for her was to strong to break their kiss. Henry wrapped his arms around Eliza's waist and pulled her to stand with him. Standing there in the middle of the study kissing wasn't enough for Henry. He grabbed his wife's butt and lifted her up. Eliza squealed but never the less wrapped her legs around Henries waist. With Eliza's whole body wrapped around him Henry walked over to his desk and sat Eliza down on it. Although Eliza was now sitting on the desk she didn't let go of Henry. \"Don't, just leave it.\" Eliza moaned as Henry tried to undo her dress. \"What ever you say my dear.\" Henry replied breathing heavily, set his hands on Eliza's legs, let them wander upwards and on the same time he pushed Eliza's skirt up so that it was now resting around her waist. Just as Eliza was unbuckling Henries belt they heard noises outside the study door, but neither of them paid much attention to them, because they were to wrapped up in each other. \"Oh my god Henry!\" A shocked Mrs. Higgins exclaimed. Hearing to voice of his mother Henry immediately took a step away from his wife, who was sitting on his desk breathing heavily, dress shoved up around her hips and panties moved slightly downwards. \"Well I guess Pickering was right. The honeymoon is far from over.\" She told both of them unable to hide the laughter in her voice. \"Mother what in Georges name are you doing here?\" Henry asked his mother angry and embarrassed at the same time. Angry that she had interrupted is afternoon love making to his wife and embarrassed that she had caught him as he was about to ravish his wife on his desk in his study. \"Henry don't be so rude!\" Eliza told him lightly slapping his arm. \"Mrs. Higgins how lovely to see you! What brings you here today?\" Eliza asked her mother in law. \"My dear I just wanted to see how being married to my son is becoming you, but as I was just able to witness, I have no doubt at all that you enjoy being married to my son very much.\" Mrs. Higgins told her immensely enjoying seeing how both her son and her daughter in law blushed to the darkest shade of red she had ever seen on anybodies face. \"Well you're indeed right Mrs. Higgins I quite enjoy being married to Henry.\" Eliza told her trying to cover both her and Henries embarrassment. \"Well if you continue like this I'll be a grandmother in no time at all! I don't want to disturb you both any further and wish you a lovely day.\" Mrs. Higgins said and without waiting for Henry or Eliza to reply, left. Henry turned to face Eliza who's gaze was fixed onto the floor. \"Well if that wasn't embarrassing.\" Henry said, trying to lighten the mood. Eliza didn't react. In fact Henry wasn't even sure if she had heard him, her gaze was still fixed onto the floor. \"Eliza? Darling? Is everything alright?\" Henry asked her, but Eliza still didn't respond or act as if she had noticed him. Henry simply tried again \"I know my dear that this was an very uncomfortable situation, bu…..\" \"I want to have a child! No! In fact I want to have children!\" Eliza blurt out finally looking up right into the face of a very shocked Henry Higgins. Henry didn't know what to do or what to say. They had never talked about having children, he hadn't even considered the possibility of having a child. Jet at the same time he had not even once done anything to avoid fathering a child. \"Henry? I know we never talked about this subject, but could you please just say something, no matter if its positive or negative?\" Eliza asked him softly while gently caressing Henries right arm. Henry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"Your right we never talked about the possibility of having a child or children.\" He said the insecurity visible in his voice. \"I guess you'd rather not have children?\" Eliza asked him afraid of his answer. \"Well I… I don't… I don't like children! They are loud, ask stupid questions and you have to spend very very much time with them.\" Henry told her and while doing so tears of disappointment formed in Eliza's eyes. \"But,\" He continued \"the thought of having children with you gets me excited. I imagine a little daughter or two that look just like you and maybe a boy to carry on the Higgins name.\" He told her with a beaming smile in his face. Tears of happiness and relive replaced Eliza's tears of disappointment. \"You really want us to have children?\" Eliza asked him not quite sure if what she had just hear was real. \"Well I a guess that we would have very intelligent and handsome children.\" Henry told her and wrapped her in his arms. \"I know that I am far from being the perfect husband and I really don't have the slightest idea how to be a good father, but I assume that if you are by my side to help me, I'll manage just fine.\" Eliza snuggled closer into their embrace as Henry kissed her forehead. \"Oh Henry you are the best husband I could ask for. We might not be the typical couple but that does not matter as long as we are both happy and you can not imagine how happy you have just made me.\" \"Well my dear you are not with child jet, which means that I haven't made your dream come true just jet.\" He told her smoothing over her hair. \"Well that doesn't matter. You want to and that is all that counts.\" Eliza replied and kissed his neck. \"You know my dear I really think we should start on our new project immediately. You know practice makes perfect.\" He looked down and winked at her. \"Oh! I think you are right Mr. Higgins.\" She told him, grabbing hold of lapels and pulled him into a passionate kiss. As they broke apart, after what seemed like hours, Henry was the first one to speak. \"As much as I would love to have you right here in the desk, I think going upstairs into our bedroom would be saver. We don't want to be interrupted again do we?!\" Eliza didn't say a word. She gave Henry a short kiss, turned around and went up the stairs without saying a word. Henry was unsure if he had done something wrong and simply stayed put, his gaze following his wife. \"Henry dear? Aren't you going to join me?\" Eliza had stopped midways after she had realised her beloved husband wasn't following her. \"I'm right behind you dear!\" Henry told her quickly walking towards with a grin spread across his face. TBC[Chapter 24] So after a very long time I have found the time to continue writing. I'm terribly sorry that I haven't been updating, but I didn't have the time to write and neither did I have a idea how to continue this story. I hope you like the new Chapter and enjoy reading it. Chapter 24 Henry would never admit it openly, but he loved the idea of becoming a father. A little girl to dot on or a son who he could teach all about phonetics. What he loved even more than the idea of a child, was trying to create a new life. Since Eliza and he had decided to try for a child, their love live had become even more active than before. They made love at least once a day. The only thing he hated, was the time of the month when Eliza was indisposed. Not because they than couldn't make love, but because Eliza got incredibly sad. They had been trying actively for a child for three month now and Eliza was becoming more and more concerned, because she still wasn't pregnant. Henry and Mrs. Higgins both had tried to reassure her, that it was perfectly normal for things like this to take time, but Eliza wouldn't hear of it. „Henry\" Eliza said one fine Sunday afternoon, as the two of them sat in the living room reading, „I think I should go and see a doctor.\" „What in Georges name for would you want to go and see a doctor for? Are you feeling unwell?\" Henry asked her looking up from his book. „Not unwell in particular, but we have been trying for baby for three month and I'm still not pregnant. I fear that there might be something wrong with me.\" Eliza confessed with tears slowly filling her eyes. „Woman! Have mother and I not told you that things like these take time.\" Henry replied white forceful, while standing up from his armchair. „Three month is no time at all for things like these.\" Henry started to wander up and down in front of his armchair. „Why can't you simply accept that it just takes some time?\" „Henry how can I not be pregnant by now?\" She asked him getting up from the chaise as well. „We have been making love at least once a day, most of the days twice or three times! I want to have a child and that as quickly as possible!\" „You're right woman! For a month we have been doing little else than trying to create the child you long for so much. I even had to cancel appointments more often than once!\" Henry told her, his anger starting to rise. „Now it is the child I long for so much? I thought you wanted to have children as well?\" She shouted at him. „And I'm sorry that making love to me so often, has been such a burden on you. Other husbands would be happy, if their wives would be as willing as me to fulfill their marital responsibilities in the bedroom.\" „Dammit wife! Don't turn my words on me! I did not say that I minded doing little else than making love to you. All I was trying to say that we are trying as hard as we can for a child, but you have to be a bit more patient!\" Henry shouted, not being able to hold his anger back any longer. He did not want to complain. A woman as willing in bed as Eliza, was probably every man's dream, but in the past months their love making often had felt more like a duty, than a pleasure. „Do not shout at me Henry Higgins! I am your wife, not some girl from the street you can treat as you are pleased!\" She shouted right back. „Then stop being so histericle and I will stop treating you like a random woman from the street.\" Henry told her. „Oh so now I am histerical?\" She asked him, her own anger now clearly showing. „Yes right now that is how I and probably everybody else would describe you!\" Henry turned to leave the room. „Henry Higgins don't you dare to leave me standing her, while we are in the middle of a fight!\" Eliza shouted in anger. „If you leave now, you are not sleeping in our bed tonight! I don't care where you will be sleeping, but definitely not in our bed!\" „Oh but you do realize, that this might make your plan of becoming pregnant as quickly as possible even more difficult, because if I wont be in your bed tonight who will try getting you pregnant then? Your dear Freddy Einsfrothill?\" Henry asked her sarcastically. „Oh what a wonderful idea! Maybe I should have gone and married Freddy instead of you. Who knows maybe than I would already be pregnant.\" Eliza replied sarcasm dripping from her voice. Upon hearing her words, Henry, who had turned too leave the room, turned back around. His face showing no emotions. Seeing his face, Eliza realized that she had gone to far. „Henry…\" She tried softly. Henry still did not show any emotions, only stared at Eliza with a mixture of disbelieve, hurt and anger. „You do know that I didn't mean what I said, don't you?\" Eliza walked towards him, halted just in front of him and took his left hand in her hands. At this Henry looked up, „You are my wife! Whether you like it or not! I know that I am far from the perfect, loving, foolish husband you might want and deserve, but I am trying my best.\" he pulled his hand from hers and took a step back. „I will be going for a walk, don't wait up for me.\" He turned, walked to the door and took his coat in passing. „Just so you know, if I could I would give you a child in a heartbeat, but unfortunately I can't control when we will be blessed with a child.\" He confessed and shut the door behind him. „Henry!\" Eliza shouted as she pulled the door open only to be met by the stunned face of the mother in law. „As you can see, I am not Henry, but might you be so kid as to explain, over a cup of tea, why my dear son nearly ran me over.\" Mrs. Higgins asked her calmly, while guiding Eliza into the sitting room.

Will their little family survive the Great War? Will Higgins ever forgive her? Author's note: This plot bunny has been nagging at me for over a half year, and I must bring it forth. It's a bit of a monster bunny, one that will not be resolved quickly. Let my usual readers be warned, this is Freddy/Eliza for at least the first part. Also, I will have the epilogue to \"A Hole in the River\" very shortly! This being the state of human affairs, what is Eliza fairly sure to do when she is placed between Freddy and Higgins? Will she look forward to a lifetime of fetching Higgins's slippers or to a lifetime of Freddy fetching hers? There can be no doubt about the answer. Unless Freddy is biologically repulsive to her, and Higgins biologically attractive to a degree that overwhelms all her other instincts, she will, if she marries either of them, marry Freddy. And that is just what Eliza did. -From epilogue of the play 'Pygmalion' by George Bernard Shaw Late Spring, 1912 \"Gretna Green? Why the blazes would she go to Gretna Green?\" \"Language, Henry! Eliza went to Gretna Green because she is barely twenty years old, and Mr. Eynsford-Hill does not turn twenty-one for another three months.\" Henry found himself back at his mother's residence, after storming home, despondantly listening to his phonograph, and realising that he could not do without Eliza. He had hoped that the girl had not have gotten far, or that his mother would be able to point him in the right direction. He now found his hopes being dashed with two fatal words that together formed the name of a destination popular for'runaway marriages'. \"The girl was bluffing, Mother; she isn't going to marry Freddy.\" \"Will she not? I gave her train fare so that she could.\" \"You did what?\" Eleanor Higgins chuckled, her eyes held a dreamy, faraway look. \"I think it is all very romantic; Freddy Eynsford-Hill is quite besotted with her, and with her background she could hardly do better.\" Henry's jaw dropped. \"After all of the work I put into that insect, she could do no worse! I did not waste six months of my life just so my creation could flit off to Scotland with a sniveling idiot whose equally idiotic mother suffers in genteel poverty at Largelady Park!\" \"Mrs. Eynsford-Hill is a very dear friend of mine, and I won't have you insulting her!\" \"Such a dear friend she must be, that you feel you have to encourage her son to elope without telling her.\" Eleanor opened her mouth in astonishment, but gave no reply. \"Why the secrecy, Mother?\" \"Henry, you know that she hopes for an advantageous match for her son. Unfortunately, the boy is very easily swayed by her, and I thought that it would be cruel to allow him to act against his heart in this matter.\" Henry raised an eyebrow.\"You are disgustingly romantic, Mother; when did this happen?\" Eleanor sniffed, and looked away. \"I was young once.\" \"Indeed, you were. It was to your advantage to marry Father, and you did - without thought to romance, I might add.\" \"Without that match, I would not have had you - you were my greatest, and only comfort in that marriage.\" \"I am sure the financial security was a comfort.\" Eleanor glared. \"You are your father's son, so I do not expect you to understand.\" \"Father was a very fine man, and I thank you for the comparison!\" A muscle twitched in Eleanor's cheek, and she pressed her lips into a thin, tight line. \"I do not wish to take this conversation any further, Henry. It makes me feel unwell, and I would appreciate it if you would go back to your own home, and sulk there.\" And that is just what Henry did. Several weeks later, and many miles away, Eliza was about to bid farewell to Doolittle, and greet the more elegant Eynsford-Hill. She and Freddy had just finished their twenty-one days' residence required for an 'Over the Anvil' wedding, and were saying their vows before a blacksmith. The wait had been a costly one, as Eliza had insisted on seperate lodgings. She thought it was bad enough that they were eloping, she would not further damage her reputation by sharing a room with a man who was not yet her husband. Freddy, always ready to oblige, had agreed whole-heartedly. Eliza's virtue was priceless to him, and he would protect it at any cost. They became as one later that night, in a shy, awkward fashion. Neither quite knew what to do, but instinct took over as it usually does in such cases, and the deed was done. Freddy was immensely pleased with himself, and keen for another go, while Eliza found herself wondering what all the fuss was about. \"I love you,\" Freddy declared, shortly after their introduction to the marriage bed. Eliza smiled at Freddy, and reached across the bed to caress his cheek. He was terribly handsome. If it were not for the good, simple humour that constantly played across his features, Eliza would have taken him for a rake with his dark, silky hair, high cheekbones, and intense blue-grey eyes that would have been piercing if they weren't constantly twinkling with merriment. \"You are so good to me, Freddy.\" Impulsively, she ran a fingertip along the bridge of his fine, straight nose. It was slightly aquiline, and again, were it not for his sweetness, would have otherwise given him the appearance of a predatory hawk. Freddy smiled, and leaned in to give Eliza a heartbreakingly tender kiss. \"I promise to be as such until the day I die, Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.\" Fortunately, the art of lovemaking soon proved to be quite nice for Eliza upon repetition; unfortunately, the young couple found that they barely had enough funds to travel home, and were loathe to depart from their little paradise. Once home, they immediately found three doors closed to them. Freddy's mother absolutely refused to receive her son and her daughter-in-law; Eliza's father was indifferent, and his new residence was undergoing remodeling; Henry Higgins had instructed a reluctant Mrs. Pearce to turn the pair away flat, but invited Eliza to try again in a few weeks, once Henry had time to allow his temper to even itself out. Mrs. Higgins immediately took the pair into her home. Colonel Pickering happened to be paying a call at the time, and he greeted both Freddy and Eliza with gushing enthusiasm, and a wedding present of five hundred pounds. \"Colonel Pickering, I cannot-\" \"Tosh! Of course you can. I will not accept a refusal to a perfectly reasonable wedding gift, nor to the flower shop I've already purchased for you.\" Eliza burst into tears. \"Come now, Miss Doolittle, do not cry. I consider it an investment,\" Pickering explained, as Freddy desperately tried to dab at Eliza's tears with a handkerchief. She waved Freddy away, and smiled at her benefactor through her tears. \"You are the greatest man I have even know.\" Freddy did not feel any pangs of jealousy over hearing his wife's statement, for he knew it was true. Such generosity was unprecedented, and the two of them would be indebted to the Colonel for the rest of their lives. Colonel Pickering blushed at Eliza's pronouncement of him. \"It really is nothing, my dear. There is even a charming little flat above that the pair of you can live in until the shop generates enough capital for better lodgings.\" \"Or you may live here, and let out the flat for more income,\" Eleanor offered. \"Oh, thank you, Mrs. Higgins, but I do believe the flat will do quite nicely. I do not think your son would like the idea of me living here.\" Eleanor was on the verge of declaring that her son could hang, but thought better of it. She was a lady after all, and was honor bound to set a good example for Eliza, who was very young. \"Very well, my dear. I am sure my son will come around eventually, once his pride stops stinging so.\" After several hours of pleasantries, Eleanor invited Colonel Pickering, Eliza, and Freddy to have dinner with her, which they all accepted. It was a very fine affair, and Eleanor even had her best bottle of wine opened for the occasion, which they all used to toast to the future. Eliza smiled glowingly at her new husband, and decided that it was very possible that she could come to love him. They had all the time in the world, after all.[Chapter 2] A Better Man Chapter One Settling Author's note: I am anxious for feedback on this little tale, as the plot bunny has been steadily chewing at my brain for a very long time, and I would have to say that it is a bit of a pet project of mine. 4 August 1914 Freddy Eynsford-Hill and his wife Eliza found themselves dinner guests at Eleanor Higgins' home for the third time in the week. A part of Freddy knew that it was less for the pleasure of their company, and more as a charitable act. Eliza's flower shop had had a bit of a rough start, and while things seemed to be running a bit more smooth as of late, it still seemed as though the pair of them would always be locked in a bit of a financial struggle... not that they couldn't afford to feed themselves. Freddy, who had never questioned where money or support stemmed from in his life, was beginning to grow a bit resentful at the seemingly endless flow of \"charity\" that came to his wife and himself. At first, he had been delighted that his new wife was able to inspire such loyalty from people who were not family. It was touching, that she be so very cared for just on the merit of her charm and grace. Lately, though, it seemed to haunt him as a sign of his inability to care for her himself. The feelings of ineptitude had started for Freddy about six months after he and Eliza had taken over the shop. They had nearly lost the whole thing, due to both their inexperience, and Colonel Pickering had swooped in eleventh hour with a tutor in tow. The outstanding debts had been paid off, and Professor Strallen spent two nights out of the week teaching Eliza and Freddy about sound business choices. Eliza excelled under the man's tutelage, while Freddy plodded along and struggled greatly. He had never been a serious scholar during his years at Eton, and after his father's death, he had been pulled from school altogether, to attend to his grieving mother and younger sister, Clara. Freddy's education, therefore, was entirely negligible. However, he was quite sure that his education was comparably more extensive than his wife's. \"She is a genius, Mr. Eynsford-Hill; what a first rate brain!\" Professor Strallen had complimented one night, as Eliza was fixing tea. Freddy had been very proud at the compliment, although it had been soured considerably by the exasperated looks and sighs the professor had bestowed upon him during the lesson. At a later lesson, Freddy had overheard the professor's report to Colonel Pickering. It had gone along a similiar line as his compliment to Freddy, although, assuming that the conversation was private, Professor Strallen had lamented Freddy's lack of intelligence. \"Such a pity; that young lady ought to be worshipped and cared for, instead she seems fated to be the one to carry that family afloat.\" Freddy colored deeply when he heard Colonel Pickering agree. \"He would have not been my first choice for her, but he loves her so dearly, and that must count for something.\" Freddy had never thought about his lack of skill in caring for Eliza up until that point. The marriage up until that point had been jolly fun, for him. Eliza was a fine girl, and he delighted in making her laugh, giving her little presents, and just being around her. Of course the shop had been turning out to be a disaster, but Freddy looked at it as an experiment of sorts. The pair of them would soldier on together, as husband and wife should! Now, thanks to the money Colonel Pickering had poured into educating the two of them, the shop was starting to flourish. Freddy couldn't help but feel that it all had absolutely nothing to do with him, especially since Eliza locked up all of the books in her escritoire, and refused to let him, or anyone look at them. Eliza had given him an extensive education on the best blooms, and prices for them, and delegated him as a glorified errand and delivery boy, and she had done so with a patronising kiss on the cheek. So life had gone on, with regular dinners at Mrs. Higgins' home, and the seemingly permanent presence of Colonel Pickering, and recently, Professor Higgins. In fact, the man was present at the table that evening. It was rare for the professor to join his mother at dinner, let alone with the Eynsford-Hills' present. Eliza and the professor had struck up a bit of an unspoken truce, although what they had been arguing about, Freddy had no idea. All he knew was when they were in the same room together, they both seemed to be locked in a battle of wills. \"Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, that frock becomes more lovely everytime I see it. What has it been, two years since you acquired it?\" Eliza narrowed her eyes at Professor Higgins' tactless remark, pressing her lips into a thin, disapproving line. It was true that Eliza was remarkably frugal when it came to her clothing. Her evening wear had been mended on several occasions, with the hemlines adjusted for the current styles. However, it rankled her pride that some people had a sharp enough eye (and tongue) to notice such things and remark upon them in public. \"Good heavens, Henry! I will not invite you to dine if you are going to be so consistently rude to my guests,\" Mrs. Higgins scolded. Henry grumbled his apologies, half-heartedly. The truth of the matter was, he did not know what he had been planning when he tried to appeal to Eliza those years ago, before learning she had run off and eloped, but her marriage to Freddy was a constant source of irritation. If he had been honest with himself, Henry would've confessed that his heart had been just a little broken at the news. After several months of isolating himself from Eliza, he thought he would be ready to face her cordially; alas, it never quite worked out that way. The boy was constantly finding excuses to exchange glances and caresses with Eliza, and she, for her part, never put him off of it. That the boy dare touch Henry's masterpiece inflamed him; that Eliza allowed and seemed to enjoy the attention caused that flame to burst into a veritable inferno, although he hid it well, and masked it with the usual acidic rhetoric he bestowed upon everyone. She was happy, and he was miserable. \"I think you look very lovely, my dear. I am glad that you are so clever with that sort of thing; I do not believe that any other normal sort of chap, with things other than fripperies on his mind, would have been able to even notice that the gown is not fresh from a designer's shop.\" Freddy patted his wife's gloved hand, and smirked. Eliza grinned at the unexpected jibe from her husband, and covered her mouth to disguise her mirth. Henry opened his mouth to attack Freddy with a stinging rejoinder, when a strangled female cry came from the corridor. The party stood up at once, and fled to the door of the dining room to investigate. The butler was kneeling on the floor, cradling an unconscious maid to his chest. The woman had clearly fainted. \"What is the meaning of this, Swithin?\" Eleanor Higgins demanded. \"Terrible news, ma'am.\" The usually reserved man seemed beside himself. \"Out with it, I beg you!\" Swithin sighed. \"We are at war with Germany.\"[Chapter 3] A Better Man Chapter Two Duty Author's Note: I thought I would take this time to answer a few questions that have come up in reviews, kind of like an unofficial FAQ. Alrighty, here goes: Q: Wouldn't this officially be considered a sequel to the sequel of \"Pygmalion\" by George Bernard Shaw, and not to \"My Fair Lady\". A: I suppose you could say that. However, many of the characters in my mind - Freddy in particular- look like the actors that portrayed them in the movie musical. (Jeremy Brett, be still my beating heart!) Also, I feel that the Higgins of \"Pygmalion\" would not run back to his mother's to appeal to Eliza one last time, as I have him do in this fic. This is just my humble opinion of course. I pulled Clara out of the \"Pygmalion\" storage just because I felt Eliza needed a female of her own age to interract with, and she is fun to write for. Q: How can you justify this being an Eliza/Henry piece when she is in a consumated relationship with Freddy? A: I suppose you will have to read and find out! It won't be easy, that is for sure. I suppose those were the only two questions that really needed to be addressed, but I would like to address Never You Mind's concern in her review. Do not worry, my dear. I have the wonderfully insightful Jacqueline Viana to cyber-smack me across the skull if I make Higgins too lovey-dovey. *wink* Anyway, thank you all so very much or reading and reviewing! Disclaimer: I do not own these characters, and I've neglected to put up a disclaimer in previous chapters. Please don't sue, I am making no money off of this! War . Eliza took Freddy's hand in her own and squeezed. Cold fear washed over as she was suddenly very aware of how young her husband was. Freddy looked down at his wife, whose eyes had been on him from the moment Swithin made the grave announcement. He wanted very badly to smile reassuringly at her, to prove that he could manage a stiff upper lip if it meant allaying her fears - however, Freddy was too paralyzed with fear to manage anything more returning a gentle squeeze, no more than a slight, tremulous pressure. No one in the corridor spoke for a very long time. Eliza and Freddy had just been children when the war in South Africa had occured; Freddy's father had been too old to serve, and Eliza's father was just young enough, but not at all interested in the military - therefore the two had been spared the keen pain of losing a close relative to war. The concept was foreign to them, and the conflict existed in fading memories of witnessing parades from their vantage points on top of their respective paterfamilias' broad shoulders. Henry and his mother, of course knew of families who had lost their sons to the previous war, but the Higgins family was a pitifully small tree, and therefore no one in Henry's close sphere had been touched by the ravages of South Africa. Colonel Pickering had experienced the disease and the death first hand. He himself had survived the many typhoid outbreaks, but only just. He had watched brothers-in-arms die on the battlefield, and waste away to nothing in hospital cots. He had set fire to crops, and had been party to other activities that made life for the enemy unbearable. A Mauser bullet through the shoulder, coupled with a near-fatal bout of typhoid had sent him home with a few tenuous threads of his humanity still intact. He had felt the stirrings of conflict for some time now, but Swithin's announcement still had hit him with such violence that it took his breath away. He looked to the young couple standing next to him, saw Eliza's anxiety, and studied Freddy very carefully. The boy was obviously terrified, but Pickering knew the look in his eyes; it was the steady gaze of one who was just realising their duty, and suddenly Pickering felt very badly for Eliza. \"Oh dear,\" Eleanor finally managed. It was an underreaction, to be sure, but the silence in the room was growing most unbearable, and she felt something had to be said. The party disbanded shortly after, no one having anything of an appetite anymore, and all returning to their respective homes in a sort of numb, worldless trance. When Eliza and Freddy finally reached their bedroom, Eliza broke down. \"Freddy you mustn't be brave!\" She cried, her voice violently desperate. Freddy was astonished at Eliza's outburst. The thought of bravery had plagued him the entire way home. It was just something men did, when the situation arose, after all. Freddy would've been lying if he admitted that the thought of playing soldier had not appealed to him greatly ever since he was a young boy. His mother had discouraged any mention of it while he was growing up, mortally terrified of losing a son in addition to a husband. Now he was well of age, and there was a war. Freddy was more than a little ignorant about politics, but he knew that this had been a possibility for some time now - that something had been in the air, waiting to descend upon his sheltered world like a tempest, and he was very keen. However, the more hysterical Eliza became, the more the feeling lessened and devolved into husbandly concern for his wife's nerves. She was now reduced to choking sobs, and torrential tears, her face pressed against his chest, and her arms about him, embracing him with surprisingly vice-like strength born of sheer, almost child-like, terror. He had never seen her like this in all of his days. \"Darling - oh, my love!\" He crooned, petting her hair. Eliza suddenly pulled away from his embrace, and cupped his face between her delicate, cool hands. Her eyes were wild. \"You. Must. Not. Leave. Do you understand me?\" Her voice had changed from a hyperventilating, vaguely cockney mess, to a cold-as-steel, steady tones in the span of mere moments. Freddy did not comprehend, but still very much wanted to reassure his wife at the same time. He nodded. \"Good.\" Eliza kissed him hard on the mouth, and Freddy noted a faint tremor in her lips. He would not - could not leave her, if this was the way such a decision would affect her. His devotion to his country was strong, and natural, but his wife superceded any and all prior loyalties, vaguely treasonous as it sounded. Spring 1915 Life for Freddy went on much as it had before. He continued assisting Eliza with the shop, although business was once again starting to dwindle. After the Zeppelins appeared, people were less likely to crowd the streets in pursuit of commerce as they once had. Sadly, it seemed that funeral wreaths were their one dependable source of income. Age and constitution had forced Colonel Pickering to remain in England, but he kept himself busy between helping run a munitions factory and various work at the hospitals. Freddy had taken a position at the factory to supplement the income that Eliza's shop was losing, although he sensed that Pickering had hired him on as a kindness, and not in faith of his work ethic. Freddy's mother still refused contact, even with the war going on. It seemed that she refused to care whether Freddy served or he didn't. Clara Eynsford-Hill, an aspiring bohemian, still kept in contact, and become a confidante of sorts to Eliza. Her company was shallow, but earnest, and Eliza delighted in it in her own way, not ever having a real female friend before in her life. Freddy dearly loved his sister, and as they were of such a similiar disposition, he never showcased resentment at her suddenly constant presence. The war had cut short her decidedly modern travels, but she was more than happy to regale Eliza with tales of them, from the safety of the Eynsford-Hill's pitifully small parlour. \"Dearest, I think that Freddy is very down in the mouth,\" Clara declared to Eliza over tea. Freddy was working late at the factory, and therefore was not privy to the meeting. Eliza sighed, and set down her cup. \"I am afraid he wants to fight. So many of his friends are already enlisted, and several of them...\" Eliza's voice trailed off. The news of Gallipoli had deeply affected Freddy, and the dear, jolly boy that had so unashamedly fallen in love with her was beginning to slip through her fingers. Eliza knew that Freddy would die, rather than show an ounce of resentment towards herself, but she felt it in the tenseness that overcame her husband everytime she touched him lately. \"You ought to let him sooner or later, you know.\" Clara, no matter how modern she claimed she was, was nevertheless shocked at how much control Eliza exhibited over Freddy's existence. To forbid him from enlisting - the very idea! Eliza said nothing, but had grown very pale. It was true, she knew she ought not to stand in the way of Freddy's ever-intensifying patriotism, but still she clung. If he died, her conscience would smite her. She had married him without loving him, which was unfair enough. Eliza felt deep down that if Freddy was sent to the front, God would certainly have him killed to punish Eliza for her crime. True, she felt something very akin to love for Freddy, but instinctually, without much prior experience, she knew it was not of a very romantic sort. She was... immensely fond of him, and enjoyed nearly every aspect of their marriage, but something essential was missing. Later that night, Freddy was walking home from the factory. Fewer and fewer men were working alongside of him, and he was acutely aware of the fact that he was now in the minority. Posters taunted him as he strolled along. 'IF ENGLAND FAILS, YOU FAIL' they screamed at him, in letters that may as well have been sixteen hands high. 'WHO'S ABSENT? IS IT YOU ?' With every glaringly disapproving message, Freddy felt the strength of Eliza's hold slip more and more. 'WOMEN OF BRITAIN SAY - GO!' Freddy smiled bitterly at that one. Not his woman of Britain. Although, someday, she may very well be ashamed that Freddy did not enlist. The thought of her shame was humiliating to Freddy. Once the fear for his life would begin to ebb, it was inevitable that she would find him weak, and ineffectual. What if they had children? What would he say to them when they asked him about his role in the War? It was not a pleasant thought. Freddy stopped along the way to have a drink at the pub. It was a matter of strengthening his resolve; to do what had to be done. Two pints would have to be enough to steel himself against Eliza. Any more and his arguments would come out slurred, and she would undoubtedly be upset that he would come home so very late for dinner. Two were sufficient. His face fell when he saw that his sister was joining them for dinner. Ah, well; it still had to be done, and Clara might appeal to his mother with the tale, if she were there to witness. If his mother would reconcile with him, Eliza's future welfare would be secured, should he die. His mother had recently married again, and her straits were not so very dire anymore, despite the war. \"Eliza, Clara, I have an announcement,\" Freddy began, as the trio finished their simple dinner. He had their attention, although it occured to Freddy that it seemed they were prepared, and resigned. Something had happened while he was away, and Eliza miraculously did not argue. Clara kissed his cheek and called him a 'brave, dear thing', but Eliza stayed silent, and eventually excused herself for the night.[Chapter 4] A Better Man Chapter Three 'Til We Meet Again Author's note: Suprise and Happy Sunday, I've a double update for you all! 10 May 1915 Dear Mrs. Pryce, I hope this letter finds you well. I would like to start by offering my felicitations on your recent marriage. I have heard that your new position and household suits you very well, and this makes me very glad. I do hope that you will forgive me if I do not continue this letter in such a cordial and inconsequential fashion, for I have a grave matter to inform you of. Freddy is going off to fight. He was very firm on his position about a week ago, but the sinking of the Luisitania has completely strengthened his resolve. In exactly a weeks' time, he shall be going off to training, and then to the front. Since you have made no attempt to correspond with us, even with the outbreak of war, I will assume you have hardened yourself against your own son, and that you are convinced his possible death will not affect you; however, I beesech you to put this aside, and come to see him off at the train station. Freddy speaks of you often, and always with sadness. I do believe that your appearance would lift his spirits, and if he went off with a light heart, I think I could bear this a bit better. Freddy needs his mother. Sincerely, Eliza Eynsford-Hill Eliza rubbed her tired eyes, and pulled her shawl tighter against her frame. There was a slight chill in the spring air, and she had been unable to sleep. She had had a mind to write a letter to Freddy's mother for some time, but each previous attempt had turned out wrong. Hostility that she did not want to be apparent had oozed maliciously from nearly every word in other letters; however, as the date of Freddy's departure drew near, Eliza felt that old anger start to ebb, and be replaced with a real desire for her husband to see his mother one last time. Mrs. Pryce, formerly Eynsford-Hill had been the centre of Freddy's universe for so long that even now, two years after their seperation, he seemed sometimes lost without her constant guidance. Eliza found herself being constantly consulted on matters as small as which pair of socks he ought to wear for which occasion, or being inquired about the weather in a manner that suggested she controlled the outlook - this had the potential to be both endearing and irritating at the same time. Eliza looked over her shoulder, to the barely wide-enough-for-two bed where her husband slumbered. The lit candle that Eliza had employed in order to aid her writing had not disturbed him a bit. It was strange that his sleep went so consistently uninterrupted, while hers came late, and stayed lightly. He was the one going off to fight, after all, not her. She crossed the room and crawled into bed, wrapping her arms about Freddy, who responded to the gesture by snorting softly, and turning about in her arms so he faced her, his forehead nearly brushing her own. His eyes fluttered open and he smiled drowsily at the vision before him. \"You ought to sleep you know,\" he chided, kissing her on the forehead. \"I cannot; you sleep enough for the both of us, my darling.\" Eliza smiled bravely, a gesture that chased away the haunted look about her thin pale face, and dark-rimmed, red tinged eyes. \"You are such a brave little love.\" \"Would that I could fight in your place.\" Freddy kissed her quite suddenly, and fiercely after that remark. \"Never say such a thing ever again,\" he admonished after they parted, panting and breathless. His voice was authorative, and gravely serious. He never used such a tone with Eliza before in her life. They were silent for a short while, before Freddy began, \"I've arranged for you to lodge with Mrs. Higgins while I am away. I've spoken with prospective tenants, and I've found a couple that will reside here, and that will give you a little extra income.\" Eliza sat up suddenly, and looked down at her husband with astonishment plain on her face. \"You've done all of this without consulting me?\" \"I will not have you living alone while I cannot protect you. London is not safe anymore.\" \"Mrs. Higgins is hardly a protector; not that I would need one.\" \"No, she is not; but her residence is rather larger than ours, and her son has closed up his house on Wimpole street to stay with her as well.\" Eliza laughed in a quick, nearly manic, burst. \"Professor Higgins is to stand sentry over something that isn't books?\" \"Colonel Pickering will of course be there.\" \"Oh, very cozy.\" Freddy sighed and covered his face with his hands. In theory, he believed that his attempt to put his foot down with Eliza would work, but facing her stubborn temper was proving to be quite trying \"I do not know why you are being so hostile about this, darling.\" Eliza's resolved softened at the sight of Freddy's distress. She was being very unreasonable - what would happen if she were to deny the last request he ever made of her. It could very well be that last request. When Freddy sat up and pulled her into his arms, she realised that the thought had brought tears to her eyes. Soon she was crying in earnest, and Freddy was rocking her like a baby, stroking her hair and whispering reassuring nothings into her ear. Sleep soon overtook her, having finally exhausted the grief that she had kept locked tight since Freddy announced his enlistement. One Week Later Henry Higgins, for whatever reason, found himself shivering at King's Cross, waiting for Eliza to say her fond farewells to her husband. Pickering, Henry's mother, and Freddy's flibbertigibbet of a sister, Clara were also in attendance. If Henry could arrange all the things he least wanted to waste his afternoon doing, he supposed that this would very well top the list, with catching a Gilbert and Sullivan opera being a close second. \"Eliza needs a show of support. Do you have any idea how vulnerable she will be when the day comes?\" Henry's mother had argued with him bitterly over his wish to not attend, and she painted - in broad strokes - a mental portrait of Eliza, prostrate with grief. The image did not bring the vindictive delight that it once had over Henry, for some reason. Instead of the hysterical, grief-stricken female of Eleanor's prophecy, Henry was treated to a stoic, pale, and silent Eliza. She was a curious sight, rigid and impassive as a soldier, despite her small, dainty frame, and other feminine trappings. The torrential rain, and the chill of the morning did not seem to affect her, unlike her sister-in-law who clung tightly to Eliza from beneath the umbrella, wailing piteously into her shoulder. Curiously, Eliza would occasionally glance backwards, beyond Henry, his mother, and Pickering, as though searching for something or someone; when the mysterious search came up empty, she would furrow her brow and look back to Freddy, and come up with a bit of conversation that seemed more stalling than substantial. The boarding call was given, and Pickering summoned the party to give Freddy his send off. Henry took the boys hand, and wished him some rather perfunctory well-wishes, Eleanor kissed both his cheeks, and Pickering gave him his most earnest wishes for the boy's health and well-being. After Freddy had managed to pry his sister away from him, transferring her to Eleanor's motherly arms, the party backed away, to allow husband and wife their own good-byes. Henry, feeling shamefully voyeuristic, did not look away as the others did. Eliza spent a few moments, just looking up at Freddy, and stroking his cheek with a gloved hand. The pair were silently, drinking in each other's features for possibly the last time. Henry felt a pang, not of jealousy for once, but of one akin to sorrow. He was not made of marble after all, and anyone would be touched by the sight of the young couple, bravely saying farewell. The sorrow was fleeting however, as Freddy bent down to kiss Eliza most passionately for public display, and Henry was suddenly terribly uncomfortable, but still unable to look away, somehow. \"Henry - for shame!\" Hissed his mother. Henry realised that she had caught him observing, and that hands were balled up into fists so tightly, that his nails were digging into the soft flesh of his palms. Thoroughly chastened, he looked away. His last image of the intimate scene was of Eliza, glancing wildly over her shoulder once more, her eyes now brimming with tears she was fighting hard not to shed. The whistle sounded loudly, and the engine fired up. Whatever she had been looking for, it had not come in time. Eliza walked over to the small group, after the train began to depart. Henry noted that she still was not crying, and looked rather put out. She glared at Clara, who choked on a sob at the sight. \"Eliza-\" \"You tell your mother...\" Eliza trailed off, squeezed her eyes shut, and bit her lip, seemingly in an effort not to scream. She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and revealed more focused, and less wild eyes to the party. \"Forgive me.\" Pickering walked up to her and offered her his arm, which she took. He patted the small hand that grasped at the crook of his shoulder. \"Steady on, my dear.\" She nodded, and they went ahead of the party, towards the car that awaited to take Eliza to her new residence.[Chapter 5] A Better Man Chapter Four Hello Again \"I've been bringin' trays up to that young thing for the last three days, and it's the strangest thing; she will not come out of her room, but I've heard nary a wail from her since she arrived!\" Henry overheard two maids gossiping in the study as he made his way to breakfast, nothing on his mind but reading the paper and drinking coffee. It was astonishingly easy to not think of Eliza when she kept to her room so often; out of sight, out of mind, as they say. \"Positively inhuman, I say. When my William went off to fight, my mother had to force spirits on me, just to calm me down!\" \"I fainted dead away at the train station when Arthur left.\" \"Shameful; you would think ice water ran through her veins, instead of blood!\" Henry paused, and thought about making his presence known to the silly pair. There were many adjectives he could use to describe Eliza; dispassionate was not among them. In fact, their catty gossip made Henry feel insulted for Eliza, and empathy was something he thought he could never have for the girl, or anyone for that matter. Still, this was not his house, and the servants were not his to kerb. However... Henry cleared his throat loudly, catching the attention of the two young maids, who blushed furiously at being discovered. He granted the both of them the most disapproving and imperious stare that he could muster - it was a look that he usually reserved for the girl in question - before turning on his heel and stalking away in a manner that he admitted was a bit melodramatic. So what if Eliza wasn't keeping the house awake with her wails of injustice? One needn't tear at ones' hair and clothing, and throw themselves on a figurative funeral pyre to prove that their grief was genuine. The mere fact that Eliza would not come down to face the rest of the world proved that she was hurting. Pickering had even hired on a few girls to help run the flower shop while Eliza was indisposed, though where the man always seemed to find money to throw at her was beyond Henry. \"Mother, you ought to have Mrs. Lewis speak to those silly maids she has insisted on hiring. I'm afraid I caught them saying some very malicious things about Eliza.\" Eleanor set down her section of the paper, and raised her eyebrows at her son - Colonel Pickering reaction was nearly identical from his side of the table. \"Henry - you said malicious things about Mrs. Enysford-Hill not a fortnight ago, I wouldn't dare think you would care about such a thing.\" \"It isn't right; Eliza's not well, and they are talking as though she doesn't care a jot whether that boy lives or dies. Ridiculous women.\" Eleanor smiled at her son thinly veiled outrage. \"You are right, Henry - I will have Mrs. Lewis speak with them directly.\" She glanced up at the ceiling. \"I do wish Eliza would come down, though. It may do her good to sit with all of us, and take her mind off of things.\" \"I mean no disrespect, Mrs. Higgins, but Freddy may not come back from this alive - I daresay that may be a hard thing to take one's mind off of,\" Colonel Pickering commented. The papers contained nothing but doom and gloom, and before Eleanor's remark, he had pushed his respective section of the paper aside, giving up on it altogether. \"It will not hurt to try, though, Colonel. It breaks my heart to see her so dispirited, and I feel so utterly helpless as to what I can do for her.\" Pickering nodded. \"So do I; but we must give her some time to be alone.\" \"Good morning.\" Three heads turned in unison to see Eliza standing near the entrance of the room. She appeared fresh, and well-coiffed, if not a little pale. Colonel Pickering stood up at once to come to her side and gallantly lead her to a seat at the table. \"Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, you look lovely this morning.\" Eliza smiled at Pickering's compliment. \"Please, Colonel, you must call me Eliza.\" She settled into her chair, and accepted a cup of coffee, blushing at the scrutinizing stares she was receiving. \"Is everything alright?\" She inquired. \"Of course, my dear, we are just happy to have you back with us,\" Eleanor replied. \"Thank you.\" Eliza stole a glance at her pocket watch. It had been a gift from Freddy, and was wrought with an elegant floral design to commemorate the opening of her flower shop. Eliza gasped at the time. \"I am afraid I must leave; I have to get back to my shop. It's shameful the way I've neglected it!\" She stood up, as did the rest of the party. \"Eliza, we've taken care of all of that; please sit down and let us have the pleasure of your company a little while longer,\" Eleanor pleaded. Eliza gave her a puzzled look, but obeyed. \"Taken care of? Am I not to mind my own place of business?\" Colonel Pickering cleared his throat nervously, and her eyes were instantly upon him, searching for answers. \"You see, Eliza, the Hun have become rather bold as of late, and we thought it best for your safety if we had others look after things for you - people who do not live so very far from the shop, I mean.\" Henry gauged Eliza's reaction. He had come to know every nuance of her expression, and he was certain that she would protest at the blatant act of mollycoddling. Indeed, her jaw tensed, her nostrils flared, and her eyes narrowed, all for a brief moment; astonishingly, that moment passed, and she said nothing, only nodded. \"Freddy requested this?\" \"I am afraid so, Eliza,\" Pickering confirmed. \"Very well.\" Henry nearly smiled at Eliza's barely concealed indignation. He found he could read her like a book, and The Book of Eliza was turning into a quietly simmering tempest. How he admired her spirit. He wondered how long Eliza would be able to keep up this reluctant acceptance of her freedom being compromised thusly. The temptation to pick her brain was far too great. \"I say, Eliza - have you been keeping up on your reading?\" Eliza cocked her head to one side and looked to Henry with a confused half-smile. \"I confess I have not.\" \"Well, if you would care to join me in the study after we are done with our coffee, I have several new books that may interest you.\" \"Oh?\" Henry frowned at Eliza's disbelieving expression. \"Have I got something on my face?\" \"Not at all, Professor.\" Henry said nothing in reply, but finished his coffee, and stood up. \"I will be in the library.\" Eleanor chuckled, lovingly. \"I think it is wonderful that you and my son seem to be setting aside your differences,\" she explained, once Henry was out of earshot. \"I thought he would never forgive you for marrying young Frederick.\" \"I cannot imagine why he was so put-out by the match,\" Eliza retorted. \"Oh, you cannot?\" Eliza furrowed her brow. \"I suppose Freddy was not who Henry would have chosen for his creation, given that he called me a 'consort battleship' at one point.\" Eleanor shook her head. \"Henry is a mystery to us all, my dear.\" Pickering nodded in agreement. Eliza hesitantly joined Henry in the library, some time later. She left the door open for proprieties' sake, and crossed the room to a heavily upholstered wing-chair. \"I cannot say that I'm not a little bit shocked at your request, Professor.\" Henry waved the statement off. \"Don't let's quarrel anymore, Eliza, now that we're under one roof again.\" Eliza nodded. \"I should like us to be as friends again, Professor. It is wise to be friendly with one's jailers.\" There you go, my girl! Henry thought, a bit triumphantly. He felt validated that he had guessed at her frustration, and proud that she found it as stifling as he imagined it must be. Henry very much liked his Eliza with fire. \"Jailers? My goodness, Eliza, it's not as bad as all that!\" He was baiting her, wanting to see more of her passion, because it was alot better than hearing about her wasting away silently behind closed doors. \"Oh? How easy for a man to say; you may come and go as you please,\" Eliza hissed, mindful of the open door, and curious servants. \"Come, Eliza, we are only concerned for your well-being.\" Eliza rolled her eyes and snorted. \"Has it ever occured to any of you that I lived alone from the age of thirteen up until you so graciously picked me off of the streets?\" \"Yes, and that was before you had people be genuinely concerned as to whether you lived or died; now that people do, you are honor-bound to respect their wishes to not have you die in the gutter.\" \"Honor-bound to be a charity case?\" Eliza stood up, and walked over to the shelves, where she mindlessly scanned the selections before her, without actually paying attention to the titles. Henry stood beside her, picked out Rudyard Kipling's 'Kim', and handed it to her. She accepted the book, and flounced rather petulantly back into the chair, before opening it, and making a show of reading. \"Make a real effort to read the novel, don't just page through it angrily.\" Eliza rewarded his command with an icy glare. \"You are not a charity case, Eliza; Pickering and mother regard you as family, and treat you as such out of loyalty, not pity.\" \"I wouldn't even dream of obeying their ridiculous edicts, if it weren't for Freddy.\" There was an awkward pause at the mention of Freddy's name. \"He was right to make sure you are taken care of while he is away.\" Eliza studied him. \"Surely you would not set up such an elaborate prison for your wife?\" Henry gave a start, and sat down at the chair directly across from Eliza. \"What a silly hypothetical.\" \"Would you?\" Eliza pressed on. Henry met Eliza's very direct gaze, and smiled sheepishly. \"I suppose if I were stupid enough to fall in love, I would want to take every measure possible to make sure she were to be safe. I daresay it would be a hard thing, being out on the front lines with no idea how she fared... agonizing, even.\" His voice was as soft as it had been when he had imparted the importance of conquering the english language to Eliza all those years ago. Back then, Eliza had been quite struck dumb by the tenderness in his tone, and had briefly allowed herself to imagine that very voice, making love to her. The thought had cost her a full night of sleep, before she arose the next morning and decried the entire notion to be ridiculous, especially as he had immediately reverted to his acerbic, slightly high-pitched tones the very next day. \"Well, it's a good thing you are too old to serve, and too self-involved to fall in love,\" Eliza jabbed. Henry gasped in mock indignation, and soon the pair found themselves sharing a very rare laugh together. That is how Pickering and Eleanor found them, as they happened upon the library. The sight warmed both the older pair's hearts, as they were beginning to despair at Eliza ever laughing again, let alone with Henry.[Chapter 6] A Better Man Chapter Five Duty Again Autumn 1915 Eliza sat across from Mrs. Higgins in the parlour, which had been packed to full capacity with various chairs, and women sitting in them. All of the women, Eliza included, were knitting. She found this to be a bit of a bore, and also very difficult, as she had never been formally coached in the intricacies of feminine hobbies. She very much doubted that Professor Higgins had even considered a course in sock and muffler making when he had been her tutor. Another dropped stitch nearly made her throw the work across the room in a huff, but such a display would have surely shocked most of the ladies in the room into an early grave. Well, not so very early, Eliza had to be the youngest person in the room by at least four decades. Most of the women her own age were either working in the munitions factories, or training to be nurses; both professions her jailers deemed to dangerous for Eliza, especially when Pickering arrived home with stories of women dying of TNT exposure in the former. Professor Higgins was often at the factory with Pickering, and Eliza often mused if it had more to do with the house being overrun by women, and less to do with die-hard patriotism, and a need to do what one must for one's country. Strangely, Eliza felt his absense keenly. They had been getting on well, for the most part, and his razor-tongued banter was preferable to being subjected to hours and hours of banal gossip, complaints about how modern young people were becoming, or even worse; speculation on the battle in Loos, where Freddy had been stationed. Eliza's spirits soared when she spied Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering walked past the open parlour door, and loudly cleared her throat in an effort to attract their attention. \"I thought I heard the click-clack of patriotism - good afternoon, ladies!\" Pickering greeted in his usual, jovial way. Henry nodded at the gathering, and caught Eliza's wide-eyed, desperate stare. Save me! Her look cried. He smiled, and turned to his mother. \"I say, Mother - Pickering and I would like to borrow Eliza for a while. It's a beautiful day out, and I believe a stroll is in order.\" \"Oh, Henry - can't you see she is quite occupied and having a fine time with us?\" Eliza shook her head almost imperceptibly, pressing her lips into a thin line. \"Her needlework is a disaster, Mother, I wouldn't give those socks to a Hun. She will be of much better use to Pick and I this afternoon - be reasonable.\" He nearly chuckled at Eliza's fleetingly insulted look at his dig at her needlework. It really was atrocious, and he doubted that she was even really trying anymore. Eleanor scrutinised Eliza's work, seeing it for the first time. She tutted in disapproval. \"Yes, I see what you mean; very well, Eliza you may go with my son and Colonel Pickering, if that is what you want to do. If you like, I will go over the fundamentals of knitting with you another time.\" \"Ha! Well, that's not bloody likely, is it?\" A collective gasp filled the room, and Eliza exchanged an mischevious smirk with Henry. She did not know why she said it; perhaps just to show that she still could - just because she had to sit in their cage for Freddy's sake did not mean she had to sing sweetly. With that, Eliza was escorted out into the autumn air, with Professor Higgins on one side of her, and Colonel Pickering on the other. It was a scenario that was very comfortable to Eliza, and for a moment, she forgot about the troubles that constantly plagued her every waking moment, and was transported back to a simpler time in her life. The feeling lasted mere moments, before the conversation turned to the inevitable. \"They say Kipling's son is missing,\" Professor Higgins commented, as the trio passed a newstand. Eliza sighed. She had devoured the man's work after being introduced to it over the past summer. She admired him, and like everyone suffering the numerous losses on each front, felt a pang for the agony he must be going through. Kipling's son was only a boy, and according to Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering, a boy with eyesight far too terrible for service. \"The man ought not to have pulled strings for such a foolish endeavour,\" Pickering replied, referring to Kipling's sway contributing to his son being accepted for military service. Eliza found the comment to be uncharacteristically ungenerous, coming from Colonel Pickering, and gently told him as much. Pickering merely patted her hand, and apologised for his frankness. Eliza was eternally grateful that her husband remained faithful with his correspondence, and was apparently safe. His letters were becoming more and more brief, though, a fact that disturbed her greatly. It seemed to her that Freddy absolutely refused to let any unpleasantness seep into his letters, but was finding it increasingly more difficult to find anything that was not unpleasant to report. She tried to ignore the unsaid words, and focus on the ones that appeared on the page like 'uninjured' and 'safe'. Her mind carressed these welcome, lovely words, and stored them away in her heart, bringing them up to her mind when the news of others not as fortunate were constantly discussed. \"I wish they would grant Freddy leave,\" Eliza said, suddenly. She thought she felt the muscles in Professor Higgins' arm tense briefly at her wish, but ignored it. \"Perhaps very soon, my dear - you miss him terribly, I am sure.\" Eliza nodded mechanically at Colonel Pickering. The truth was, while she fretted and worried about Freddy's well-being constantly, she did not yearn for him in the sense that a wife does for a husband during an extended seperation. It was the strangest thing, for she knew she would be thrilled if he were to come home, and yet she found herself able to cope ever so easily without his devotion, and love. \"So, what do you think Mother will allow you to do now that she's discovered you are an utter domestic disaster?\" Henry teased, desperate to take the subject away from Eliza's aching need for her husband. Eliza smiled, and pondered. \"Oh, I suppose I will be collecting silk gowns and stockings to send to the front, as I am sure you old maids would be too scandalised to do it for her - provided I am allowed to venture out of doors with any regularity.\" \"I am my mother's son, Eliza; I doubt she will let you give up on your knitting endeavours all that easily.\" Eliza let out a dramatic sigh. \"It is all terribly dull. I would much rather be binding up wounds, and being really useful, like Clara.\" Clara Eynsford-Hill was currently working in various hospitals as a VAD nurse, and loving every 'thrilling' minute of it. She regaled Eliza with hours of details of her duties, positively glowing with a newfound sense of purpose. Eliza envied her greatly. In a way, she was beginning to understand how Freddy felt when she had initially refused to allow him to serve his country. \"I, for one, cannot see any harm in it,\" Pickering admitted. Eliza and Professor Higgins gave their friend an astonished look. \"Provided, of course, that your husband approves.\" Eliza's face fell into a disappointed expression, before she narrowed her eyes defiantly. \"I do not think Freddy really wants me to ignore the needs of my countrymen, and all the women my age are doing the very same thing.\" \"Surely not all of them,\" retorted Professor Higgins. Eliza glared at him. \"A great deal of them are - yes- and some of a much higher station than me!\" The two men both knew that Eliza had a point. Some VAD girls were even members of the aristocracy, although what use they could possibly be was beyond Pickering and Henry. For all Eliza's fine speech, and increasingly well-rounded education, she still had years of hardening experience and street smarts. She appeared delicate and everything an English Rose should be, but in reality she had literally spent night sleeping on the street, and had been involved in various physical altercations throughout her life, having held her own very admirably in some of them. Pickering was on the verge of relenting, but something stopped Henry from validating her outright - a nagging fear of losing her. Rather than concede to her point, Pickering awkwardly transitioned the conversation to weather. Rather chilly, and all that. Eliza felt her tower of resentment at the situation begin to teeter a bit precariously towards outright hostility that day, but held it in. She was a guest in Mrs. Higgins' home, after all, and it behooved her to obey the rules set out before her. Still, the thought of disappearing into the night and donning a white cap was deliciously irresistable. It did not help that Clara - emboldened by her own flight from her mothers' home - encouraged her to do that very thing everytime she happened to visit. \"I cannot believe that you left your mother.\" Eliza had commented breathlessly, on Clara's visit immediately after the incident. \"Oh, can't you? Especially after that dreadful business with Freddy! I do not think that I will speak to that nasty woman ever again, as long as I live!\" Clara had exclaimed, wringing her own white cap between her hands. \"I'm rooming with a few girls that work at the hospitals with me, and it is delightfully liberating.\" \"Freddy would not like it.\" \"Oh, he can be such an old woman about that sort of thing! He ought to let you be useful, just as you relented about him serving.\" \"He is just being sweetly concerned.\" \"And isn't it such a bother? You poor, sheltered darling!\" A few more visits went on in a similiar fashion, before Eliza was positively galvanised into action. She snuck out to 27 St. John's Lane, under the pretense of collecting silk for the front, and trained clandestinely. The day she returned to the Higgins' household in full uniform, Eleanor had nearly fainted from shock. Pickering took the news silently, unwilling to cause any sort of unpleasantness, and Henry gave her the understanding look of co-conspirator. It was he, who had finally relented, and had aided Eliza in her deception, escorting her to and from her training area. I would have never thought that the person who had freed me from the bonds of ignorance, would trap me with words given to a man he despised , Eliza had pointed out, during a particularly heated discussion over her lack of involvement in the cause. She knew that although Henry tried to like Freddy - the boy was fighting for the country and all that - he simply could not bring himself to it, and that while her words may have been a bit blunt, they were very true. Henry would not - could not- confess to her, or himself, the real reason he had gone along with the sheltering and coddling of Eliza. So it went, Eliza worked alongside her sister-in-law, and her invitation to Eleanor's home had not been rescinded because of it. It was nearing Christmas when Eliza discovered that Freddy was coming home on leave.[Chapter 7] A Better Man Chapter Seven Scars Author's Note: Okay folks, this chapter is most definitely not for the kiddies. The ending of it probably merits an M rating, but I will call it a hard T. This chapter contains a not-so-flattering portrayal of severe PTSD, descriptions of wounds, and an act of violence against a female. If this sort of thing is not something you want to read about in a My Fair Lady fanfiction, you ought to turn away now. I would also just like to add that my beta made a Grey's Anatomy reference to me while proof-reading this, and I had to admit that I was one of those rare, weird girls that have never watching an episode before (what, what?). Anyway, I hope you enjoy, and that you don't hate me too much once it is all over. 21 December 1915 Dear Mrs. Pryce, Your son has been granted leave, and I would be more than happy to have you attending his Welcoming Home party on Christmas Eve. I realize that with your new status, you will probably be quite busy with other parties; however, your son is not granted leave every day, and he will not be staying long. I am sure an appearance from you would send him back into battle with a renewed sense of purpose. I am willing to ignore your previous snub if you would only make an appearance. We do not even have to engage in conversation. Sincerely, Eliza Eynsford-Hill Once in a while, Henry found himself making believe he and Eliza were still together at his home on Wimpole street, three years prior. After all, they were both under the same roof, taking their meals at the same time, and even exchanging pleasantries. He and Eliza would take turns reading the paper, and she did not complain of the smell coming from the pipe he smoked more often than was necessary. Sometimes, they would exchange glances that contained entire conversations, a feat most commonly found in people who spent copious amounts of time in each other's company. They knew how the other took their tea, and each other's opinion on all manner of things down to how well Eleanor's new hearth rug looked in contrast to the rest of the parlour. It was all too easy to get lost in the illusion of their day-to-day life, all too easy to forget that she had a husband that was bound to come home and end it all. When Freddy returned, Eliza would sit next to him and laugh at his jokes, tolerate his pipe smoking - if he had taken up the habit - and share his paper and his thoughts. It was as if Henry only had her on loan, like a library book. Soon, if the war ended, Eliza would go back to being Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill, and her frosty acquaintance with her old phonetics professor would resume. He was old, and a fool. The boy was a fool as well, but a young and damned good-looking one. More importantly, he was Eliza's husband, and entitled to demand Eliza's every attention. Unwilling to let his thoughts go any further down that path, Henry turned his attention to the activity in the dining room. Eliza and his mother were hanging decorations for both Christmas, and Freddy's return. Both ladies had been dressing a bit more simply as of late, especially Eliza who had little time to bother with elegance and glamour in between dressing wounds, and soothing mental anguish. However, both ladies looked very well, indeed, despite all of that - merriment, and purpose brought an elegance and grace to their bearing that their plainer garb could not. \"Professor!\" Eliza cried from her perch atop a ladder, she grinned at him, and he found himself quite charmed by the sprig of holly that clung to an errant curl, unnoticed by her or his mother. \"You look positively frightful; what a ragamuffin! Good afternoon, Mother.\" He crossed over to them, and assisted Eliza down from the ladder. Her footing faltered near the third to last rung, and she fell forward, straight into his arms. He nearly fell backwards from the shock of it, and ended up holding her tightly for several moments more than was probably necessary. They parted awkwardly, with Eliza soothing her rumpled locks, and refusing to make eye contact. \"Henry, won't you assist us in decorating? I don't like Eliza climbing on top of ladders as though she was some sort of wild thing, when she could very well fall and break her neck. Freddy would never forgive me if I let that happen!\" \"Oh, I suppose; but what happens if I were to fall and break my neck?\" \"I would be very sad, I daresay, but it's not as though you were very invested in carrying on the Higgins name.\" Eleanor's words stung Henry, but it was unintentional, as their banter often had a barbed, but loving edge to it. Henry proceeded to climb up the ladder, and Eliza politely handed him a length of garland, and the tools for fastening it to the edges of the shelves. He had barely begun the process before Eliza cleared her throat loudly. He looked down at her, and she was shaking her head. \"I'm afraid it is no good - have you even done something like this before, Professor?\" \"Pardon?\" \"It is going to be crooked already - a bit more to the right, if you please?\" She was grinning maliciously as she said this. He felt a stab of irritation at her pleasure, knowing full well how delighted she was at the opportunity to lord over him, but he obeyed her all the same. \"I do not think it looks right - what say you, Mrs. Higgins?\" Eliza asked, after Henry had managed to cover nearly the whole room's circumference. Mrs. Higgins said nothing. It was clear that Eliza was teasing her son. \"Come now, Professor, this needs to look perfect for Christmas. Where is your spirit?\" Eliza inquired, plucking the sprig of holly from her hair, and offering it up to him in a show of generosity. With a melodramatic huff, he pulled down the various yards of fabric and fir in one yank, and threw it down on the floor. \"That was hardly called for, Henry!\" Eleanor chided. She gasped when Eliza grabbed a handful of loose tinsel, and attempted to toss it up at Henry, like one would a snowball. A look appeared upon her son that she had not seen since he had been a small boy, and with a cry, he jumped down from the ladder, and gave chase. \"Really - you two!\" Eleanor found herself ignored in the midst of their merriment, and decided to flee the scene before the sight of anymore upset decorations put her in a state. \"Just take care not to break anything valuable!\" She scolded, sure that neither had heard her. By the end of it, both Henry and Eliza was gasping for air, and positively glittering from the various pieces of tinsel on their person. Eliza could not speak for laughing, her shoulders shaking with merriment, and shedding aluminum paper like a bird does its' feathers. \"You silly thing, now it looks like Father Christmas exploded in here.\" Yes, sometimes it was all too easy for Henry to forget. Eliza decided to retrieve Freddy from the train station alone, with the rest of the household - including Clara- waiting to spring up and surprise the young man in the dining room. The feast was as grand as it could be, and the decorations quite charming. A good-natured boy like Freddy would not be able to help but be touched. Eliza sat nervously on a bench near the platform where Freddy's train was due to arrive. She had vehemently brushed off Colonel Pickering's offer to accompany her that day, even when he warned her that she may not be prepared for the Freddy she was about to greet. Rubbish. The train pulled up as scheduled, and Eliza stood up, craning her neck to spy her husband in his car. After a bit, people began to exit the train, and pair off to their respective families. After what felt like an agonising wait, Freddy appeared from afar. Eliza smiled. He looked so dashing in his khaki. Impulsively, she ran to him, and threw herself into his waiting arms. \"Darling,\" he rasped in an alarmingly soft and damaged tone. Eliza pulled away, and scrutinised his appearance. He was clean-shaven, and his uniform freshly pressed, as he had appeared at a distance, but Eliza began to notice things. \"Your face - does it hurt?\" Eliza asked, running a gentle hand over the angry, raised skin of his cheekbones, and nose. It had not been terribly noticeable until one got up close. Freddy responded by taking her exploring hand into his own, and bringing it to his lips, kissing each finger fervently. Tears ran down his face. \"Nothing hurts anymore, my darling.\" Eliza felt her eyes burning with tears when she noted that his lovely, sensitive hands were also marred by the strange rash, and quite a bit worse than his face... and his voice - was he completely unable to speak above a whisper? \"Freddy-\" \"Just take me home, Eliza. Please.\" Eliza led Freddy to the car, feeling for all the world like the oxygen had been sucked out of existence. Neither of them spoke on the way home, and Eliza wondered if he would ever lose the tension in his bearing, or the skittish look in his eyes. When they arrived, Mr. Swithin greeted Freddy uncharacteristically heartily, and Freddy could only nod, bewildered. As they walked down the corridor, towards the dining room, Eliza was struck with the thought that the party may have been a dreadful mistake. Her fears were confirmed when they walked into the darkened room, and Freddy caught her hand in a nearly bone-crushing grip. When the lights went up, and the thunderous cry of 'Suprise!' was uttered, Freddy backed away so suddenly that he nearly tripped over Eliza's feet, yanking her arm with some degree of force. The entire party stood stunned at his reaction, and for a very long time, no one dared utter a sound. Freddy seemed to compose himself, and miraculously, he managed a smile. \"Thank you, all,\" was his barely audible reply, which appeared to break the spell. The room broke out into nervous strains of 'For He's a Jolly Good Fellow', as Eliza led her husband to the head of the table, his seat of honor. She hoped against hope that she would not fall to pieces in front of everyone, and tried to leave his side to take her own seat at the table. Freddy took her hand once more and shook his head. His expression cried Don't leave me!, and Eliza -while one hand was still encased in his own- pulled a chair as close to him as possible, and sat down. Henry watched all of his from a distance, trying desperately to connect this strange young man with the ridiculous little fool he had known previously. He found himself feeling very sorry indeed, despite everything. This was a boy who had crawled through hellfire on his hands and knees, and somehow managed to come out alive. He looked to Pickering, who was having a very hard time even sparing the boy a glance, his expression strained and heavy with concern. It seemed that Eliza would not be permitted to leave her husbands' side at all, from the way the boy clung wordlessly to her. Henry, for the life of him, could not begrudge Freddy that right, not now that he was seeing him face-to-face. No, this spectre of a human-being ought not be denied anything. What pained Henry the most was Eliza's expression. She had been merry, and lively before she had left to house to retrieve her husband, and now she was barely holding on to her self-control. Bitter disappointment, fear, and sorrow were worn plain on her face, even though her voice remained gracious, and light. Henry remained in the shadows for most of the party, observing the pair. They appeared to be victims of a shipwreck, cleaving helplessly to one another amongst the devastation. Mercifully, Eliza excused the both of them from the party early, claiming that Freddy and she were both too exhausted to continue entertaining. Henry watched the two make their retreat, relieved that the reason for the tense atmosphere was leaving, and then somehow angry at the thought of the two of them sharing a bed that night. Freddy and Eliza made love that night, although Eliza would later ponder the events, and decide that 'making love' was not an apt description of what actually occured. Freddy was detached, and nearly violent in his overtures, not conducting himself at all in the sweet leisurely way that was his signature. Eliza emerged from it, lips bruised from kisses, neck and chest spotted with red love bites, and considerably more sore than she had ever been in her life. Freddy had exhausted himself in his frenzy, and fell asleep promptly after, pinning her down with his weight, rendering her quite unable to move. Later in the night, Freddy rolled away from Eliza, to his own side of the bed, allowing her to breath freely. She was quite unable to find rest, mind racing at the speed of lightening, as usual. Freddy began to twitch and whimper somewhere around three in the morning. Eliza had nearly managed to fall asleep when it began. She was unable to ignore the cries, as they became more pitiful, and desperate. \"Freddy?\" She began to wrap her arms about him, in order to pet and calm him, but as soon as her hands touched his shoulders, he cried as loudly as his damaged voice would permit, and in a flash, was straddling Eliza, his hands tightly wound about her throat. A million thoughts flew through Eliza's head at once as she struggled beneath his vice-like grip. She kicked uselessly, and gasped out strangled cries, but Freddy appeared merciless to her cries. Spots began to dance before her vision, and Freddy's twisted, angry features began to blur. She managed to lift her arms, and push her hands against his face, vainly attempting to push him away. The touch of her hands against his face must have been able to bring him to his senses, for he pulled his own hands from her neck as though scalded. Oxygen hit Eliza's lungs with a vengeance, and she coughed and gasped so hard that her ribs began to ache from the exertion. \"Darling... Oh, god, what have I done?\" Eliza struggled to find her voice, to reassure Freddy that all was well, even though it clearly wasn't. \"Fr-Freddy-\" \"The dream... it wasn't you there, it was-\" Freddy began to sob, shamefully, unable to look at his wife. \"Freddy, please-\" He jumped out of bed, to his feet, quite suddenly. \"I cannot stay here!\" In a frenzy he began to gather his things. Eliza, still weak from being strangled to near-unconsciousness could only shake her head and plead softly, while trying to quell the violent tremors that tore through her being. \"Freddy you do not have to leave.\" He was deaf to her. Deaf, blind, and walking out of her life.[Chapter 8] A Better Man Chapter Seven Running Eliza's heart pounded savagely, and she could feel the blood thrumming through her veins as she lay in the bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling. Every breath she took felt like a knife to her constricted throat, and her trembling had yet to abate. Freddy, she had to find Freddy. He could not have gotten far, she rationalized, and if she showed him that all she wanted to do was understand, maybe he would stop running. Eliza willed herself to stand, catching hold of the bedpost when her knees gave out. With momumental effort, she was able to keep her balance, and dress hurriedly. There was no time to lose, so she simply threw a dressing-gown over her night-dress, stepped into her slippers, and headed into the corridor. \"Eliza?\" Colonel Pickering stood in front of her door, concern darkening his kindly features. He had been dozing off in his own room, when he heard the quick, frantic footsteps in the corridor. When he set out quietly to investigate, Pickering caught Freddy fleeing like the hounds of Hell were at his heels. Something wild and lost in the boy's eyes had caused Pickering to suddenly become very afraid, and he had abandoned all thoughts of propriety in order to check up on Eliza. \"Please, Colonel - I need to find Freddy!\" She winced in agony at the effort it took to form words. She could not raise her voice above a whisper without it hurting. Eliza noticed Pickering's expression go from concern to barely contained anger when he heard her speak, his eyes narrowing on her throat. She raised her eyes to the looking-glass on the wall beyond Pickering's shoulder, and gasped at the sight that she beheld. Freddy had most definitely left his mark, with no question as to what he had done. \"I will take a horse-whip to him.\" Eliza gasped at the uncharacteristic venom in her old friend's tone, and could not bring herself to look at the deadly gleam in his usually merry blue eyes. \"It is not what you think, Colonel.\" \"Go to bed, Eliza, I will find the blackguard.\" Eliza shook her head. \"No - you don't understand! Now, please, let me go before it's too late.\" Tears formed in her eyes, and she was desperately, and shamefully close to shoving the man out of her path. She closed her eyes, and gave a defeated, shuddering sigh before succumbing to those tears, and sobbing quietly. \"Go to bed,\" Pickering repeated as firmly as a man confronted with a young woman's crying could sound, which wasn't very. \"H-he was dreaming, he said. I-it wasn't me he saw... oh, please - you must let me go to him. I have to tell him that I don't hate him!\" Pickering's anger evaporated almost instantly. \"He was asleep when this happened?\" Eliza nodded. \"I t-tried to wake him from a n-nightmare, and he-\" She could not explain it again, it was too painful. \"I will find him.\" Her eyes met his finally, wide and apprehensive. \"You must not hurt him.\" Pickering placed his hands on Eliza's shoulders, in a gentle and reassuring gesture. \"I will bring him home to you, Eliza, I promise. No harm will come to your husband tonight - but I need you to return to your room, and let me do this alone.\" With that, he released her, and turned his eyes to her bedroom door with a look that was unmistakably a command. Eliza, still apprehensive, but trusting of her friend, obeyed. Morning came with Eliza rising from bed without actually having slept in it. She walked to the looking-glass, and numbly noted that the fair, delicate skin of her neck had begun to bruise. She thanked providence for high necklines, and went about her morning routine. No one need know about the events of the night before - in fact, she was very sure that she could rely on Colonel Pickering's discretion in the matter. She shuddered to think of how Professor Higgins would react, and poor Mrs. Higgins would undoubtedly go into shock if she knew that Eliza had nearly been killed in bed by her husband. It was Christmas morning. Eliza had nearly forgotten about the holiday since last night. She walked into the dining room to find Professor Higgins and his mother waiting patiently for their guests. Eliza colored deeply - she would have to make excuses for the absence of her husband... not to mention that Pickering was also missing. \"I am afraid that Freddy will be unable to attend breakfast with us this morning,\" she announced, trying hard to keep the grave tone out of her voice. \"How odd - do you know that the Colonel left a note saying the same thing in regards to himself? Seems he was called away on some very urgent business at one of the hospitals.\" Eleanor shook her head sadly. \"I am afraid we make for a very sorry Christmas breakfast indeed.\" Eliza took a seat, making sure she was as far from Professor Higgins as possible. Some of the bruising reached just below her jawline, barely visible to the critical eye. She would not take her chances. Henry noticed something off about Eliza. Her eyes were heavy with sleep, and dark circles had appeared beneath them; her bearing was stiff, nearly rhuematic, and her complexion stood in stark contrast to her dark, owlish eyes. He also noticed that when she was being addressed, Eliza would only turn her head a fraction, and the corners of her eyes would crinkle in a barely supressed wince. A cold realization washed over Henry when he added the fact that her husband was not present. \"Where is he?\" Eleanor chided her son for his icy and impertinent tone, but Henry waved her off, and repeated the inquiry. \"I already told you -\" \"I have a feeling that there is much you are not telling me, Eliza. Where. Is. He?\" Eliza stood up, her features stark with desperation. \"I cannot comprehend why you would want to know!\" Henry fairly leapt to his feet, and strode over to Eliza, intent on drinking in her every feature, in order to seek out the evidence he needed. Her hands automatically flew to her neck, covering it protectively, but not before Henry noticed the ghost of a fingerprint just below her left ear - it stood angry, purple, and in mocking parody of a loving touch. \"Henry, what on earth -\" \"Hush, Mother - Eliza, tell me.\" He was rewarded with a slow shake of her head. \"No. I cannot make you understand.\" The sound of the front door opening caused everyone in the room to divert their attention. Without warning, Henry dashed from the dining room, bent on greeting whoever came through the door. Eliza stood dumbstruck for a moment before realizing his intent; she ran after him. She arrived in time to see the Colonel step between her husband and Professor Higgins, holding his hands up in a halting gesture. \"Higgins, I will not have you harm the boy, whatever you believe has transpired.\" \"'What I believe'? Pickering, I saw with my own eyes!\" Henry stepped forward, as did Pickering, who placed his hands on his friend's shoulders, firmly. \"I will explain everything in the study, and then you may judge.\" With surprising strength, Pickering was able to steer Henry away from Eliza and Freddy, although he was not able to prevent the professor from locking eyes with the younger man in an icy glare that he held until distance broke it. Eliza was alone with Freddy at last. Her husband stood there, staring at her with his smoke-colored eyes, watery with unshed tears, and a helpless expression on his face. Eliza opened her arms, and he came forward, falling to his knees, and pressing his face against her abdomen, crying in earnest. The feel of his arms about her were not constricting as they had been when he first arrived, but gentle and cautious, as though she were made of fine glass. She stroked his dark hair, and murmured endearments, heedless of the few servants that were undoubtedly spellbound by the display. \"I love you, Freddy... please do not run from me like that again.\" At the moment, Eliza meant those three important words. The possibility of him going back to war and dying with that incident being the last memory of him had shown her that. Back in the study, Henry was being made to sit down, when what he really wanted to do was tear a certain young whelp, limb from limb. The whole situation disturbed and angered him, especially with the niggling reminder that he had once threatened to do the very same thing to Eliza. It was different, though. He never would have layed a finger on that girl, especially now that their friendship was so very important to him... why the devil was Pickering so ready to defend the boy? \"Higgins, the boy was not in his right mind when he hurt Eliza.\" \"Drunk, I suppose?\" Pickering shook his head, and took a seat. \"Have you ever had a particularly stressful lecture or project to worry about? The Embassy Ball, for instance - you spent months worrying yourself over that, I know you did.\" Henry nodded, hesistantly. \"Did you ever dream about it? Dream that everything had gone wrong to the point where you woke up in the midst of thrashing about from anxiety, marvelling at how real the whole scenario had been?\" Another nod. \"What if what you saw on a day-to-day basis was death, filth, and your duty was to partake in that in the name of King and country?\" The rest of Christmas day was painstakingly tense. Henry, while accepting Pickering's explanation, still could not bring himself to be so forgiving of the boy, and refused to look at, or speak to him. Eleanor had been gently informed of the situation in order for her to arrange another room to be made up for Freddy. No one was willing to risk another incident like the night before. The gift exchange was carried out perfunctorily. Had the occasion been more merry, Henry would have been very grateful for the new fountain pen from Eliza, and she may have embarassed him with the warmth of her gratitude over the rare edition of 'The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'. Instead, they thanked each other without any real enthusiasm. Freddy managed to kiss Eliza on the cheek when he received his new shaving kit, pulling away immediately when he thought he caught the professor's disapproving glare. Eliza thought that Freddy's gift of handkerchiefs were very sweet, and smiled weakly at the boy. Freddy left the Higgins' household on the second of January, 1916. Eliza saw him to the station, accompanied by Colonel Pickering. The young couple parted with a great deal more tears than the last time, Eliza now burdened with the realization of her love, and Freddy struck with guilt, and the feeling that he did not deserve her renewed regard.[Chapter 9] A Better Man Chapter Eight Tidings Author's note: Well, as you can see, I've had ALOT of time on my hands. \"Hill!\" \"Yes, ma'am?\" \"Go find your sister-in-law and inform her of the fact that bedpans do not clean themselves.\" Eliza emerged from the water closet, weak with fatigue and the bout of nausea that had just overtaken her. She was immediately spotted by Clara, who waved her down with a frantic look upon her face. \"There you are! The matron just singed my ears, she was so keen to find you... Oh, my dear, are you alright?\" Clara linked arms with her sister-in-law, and they headed towards the infirmary Eliza nodded, fanning herself off with her hand. \"I'm fine, Clara, and I overheard what she said; I will get to it.\" \"Darling, you are absolutely green!\" Clara pulled Eliza to an empty bed, urged the girl to sit down, taking a seat beside her when she did. \"If the matron were to see-\" \"Oh, hang that old battle-ax!\" A chuckle from the neighboring bed brought the girls' attention to a heavily bandaged young man, eyes twinkling with mirth from Clara's unladylike exclamation. She turned her nose up at him, sniffed imperiously, and pulled the curtain in order to shield his view. \"I think you had better go home for the day, Eliza.\" \"It will pass, just as it always does.\" Clara eyed her sister-in-law suspiciously. \"How long has this been going on?\" Eliza opened her mouth to speak, but the curtain was pulled aside, and the matron stared down at the pair, a heavy eyebrow raised, and nostrils flaring ever so slightly. \"Girls, what is the meaning of this?\" Both women stood up immediately, ramrod straight in the presence of their superior. It was Eliza who spoke up first. \"It is my fault, ma'am. I had a bad turn, and needed to collect myself.\" \"I made her rest, ma'am,\" Clara added. The matron focused her critical eyes on Eliza for a very long moment. Suddenly, the older woman's features softened. \"Hill, I want you to go see Dr. Hardwicke immediately.\" \"But, ma'am-\" \"I am not in the mood for objections. Your sister-in-law can take over your duties for the rest of the afternoon.\" With that, the matron took her leave. Clara glowered at Eliza for a moment, but then smiled beatifically, and kissed her sister-in-law's cheek. \"You heard Madame General, off you go.\" Much later, Eliza walked into the bitter February air, unable to help herself from grinning. Oh, the doctor's news was quite a shock, without a doubt - not to mention that fact that she had not even considered being in such a state until Freddy was safe at home, and the flower shop had resumed making a profit, but still... Freddy would be so pleased. It was possible that the news would even boost his morale considerably. The frost in the air threatened to sink it's teeth into the very tip of her nose, but Eliza did not feel a thing. It astonished Eliza, that she had not noticed the changes in her body up until now. Of course, her life had gotten quite hectic with the hospital - so much so that she was rarely at home. That would all change immediately. Doctor Hardwicke had made sure that she was to be discharged from her duties at the hospital, claiming that the strain and the sights would be far too much for a women in her condition. Eliza had initially balked, until he gravely informed her of the difficulty that lay ahead. The first time was always the most difficult, he had told her, and the fact that her frame was naturally very small would multiply the danger. However, he assured her that one as young and healthy as herself would most likely recover in no time. Eliza climbed the icy steps in front of Mrs. Higgins home, imagining everyone's surprise at the news. Ordinarily Colonel Pickering or Professor Higgins arrived at the hospital to escort her home, but they were not expecting to make the journey for hours, and were still at the munitions factory. Eliza found Mrs. Higgins in the parlour, reading a battered old romance. Eliza smirked at the sight. Eleanor often tried to hide her habit of reading those types of books from her son, knowing that he would deride the whole genre with a sneer. \"Eliza, you are home early!\" Eleanor declared, setting her book down and standing up to embrace the young woman. She took a step back, and smiled. \"My dear, you are positively bursting with good news - is it about Freddy?\" Eliza waited until they were both seated to reply with, \"Yes, in a manner of speaking.\" Eleanor gave the young woman a look of polite impatience. \"I am with child.\" Eleanor sat back, mouth agape, and eyes wide. \"My dear-\" \"Oh, I know the timing is not right, and-\" \"But this is wonderful news.\" Eliza nodded, grinning. \"Yes, I think so.\" \"Well, now you really shall have to improve your needlework.\" The pair chatted excitedly until Colonel Pickering and Professor Higgins arrived. Henry observed the beaming expressions of the pair, and was quite astounded. Both had been rather down as of late, with the shortages, Eliza's long hours, and the events of Christmas hanging over everyone like a pall. Where had this renewed show of merriment come from? Eliza immediately took note of the questions in both men's eyes, and repeated her news. Colonel Pickering gave a jubilant exclamation, and immediately brought up Harrow and Cambridge, declaring his intent to finance the child's education. \"Are you quite well, my dear? Is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable?\" Pickering fussed like an old hen, or an old, sweet man with no idea how one ought to treat a woman in a delicate situation. Quite overcome by Colonel Pickering, and Mrs. Higgins' attention, Eliza had quite forgotten about Professor Higgins. Henry could only stare dumbly at Eliza after her news. Her words I am with child echoed like a mantra in his mind, and he dimly realized that his hands were shaking ever so slightly. I am with child, I am with child, with child, child. Good lord, she was going to have a baby. Freddy's baby. The news went straight to his gut, and then travelled upwards, twisting at his heart, and then catching in his throat, rendering him incapable of speech and making the simple act of breathing an impossibility. Henry's education in biology had been brief, but he still knew quite well when that child had been conceived - it had been that awful night when the boy had - well, everyone had been struggling to put that incident behind them, but here was a constant reminder. A baby born out of an ugly situation, where it would undoubtedly be put into the arms of a broken, and lost man, barely out of boyhood himself. Eliza had lain with that man. Of course, Henry knew that such things happened in a marriage, but the proof that it had occured within Eliza's marriage... It was intolerable. Henry did not want to sit and listen to Eliza moon and dream over her future with Freddy Eynsford-Hill and their spawn, not when his heart was hammering with such violence that he was sure it would break his chest. So he left the room, pursued by images of a small, beautiful child with chocolate brown curls and smoky-grey eyes. Images of a life quite devoid of Eliza. She was going to be a mother. He had lost her irrevocably. Eliza wrote to Freddy that night, kissing the missive before sending it off. We are to be parents , was all it said. When Freddy received the message, he held it to his heart, and nearly allowed the tears to flow as he lie in bed. One of his fellow officers, a married young man named Brocklehurst, took note of his highly emotional state, and pulled the letter from his hands. \"Well done, Hill!\" The boy exclaimed, clapping Freddy on the shoulder. Brocklehurst let out a shrill whistle, gaining the attention of the rest of the outfit, some of whom had been dozing off. \"Hill is going to be a father!\" That night, Freddy's superiors turned a blind eye to the merriment that ensued. News from home was rarely happy for anyone, and the announcement was cause for celebration. After all, this was going to be his first child - a milestone in any young man's life. There was no reason to ignore tradition just because there was a war on. Freddy woke the next day with a pounding head, bleary eyes, a vague recollection of the night's revels, and a remarkably light heart.[Chapter 10] A Better Man Chapter Nine Morass Being pregnant in the summer was torture, plain and simple. Eliza lay on her bed, with a cold cloth pressed against her forehead, willing the afternoon to disappear into the horizon and bring on a cool night. Trays had been brought up to her room for the past few days, as the heat made her far too ill to venture very far, or allow her to be fully dressed. Her thoughts were very often her only companions during those lonely days. Eleanor would come and sit with her for a while, but the woman had many obligations, and Eliza did not like to take up much of her time. The professor and Colonel Pickering were naturally not allowed in her room, especially in her condition and state of undress - not that Professor Higgins would be much company anyway. Eliza had begun to think that he really and truly hated her. After the announcement of her pregnancy, he had changed. There were no more literary discussions in the library, as found seemingly endless excuses not to be at home. He was now so frosty and acerbic that Eliza frequently found herself in tears when he actually did address her. Of course, it seemed her emotions were higher and higher every single day - for example, just the other day she had ventured a look out of her bedroom window, and the sight of a fallen bird on the sill had sent her into a fit of hysterics - still, she was not imagining his coldness. He would not look at her. Eliza could not remember the last time she had been able to make direct eye contact with Professor Higgins, although she sometimes thought she could feel his gaze upon her in moments when she supposed he thought her unawares. What had she done? Was it the fact that she had forgiven Freddy for the incident at Christmas? She would remember the look on Henry's face when he spied her injuries until her dying day. It was if they had shared an invisible, and tenuous connection that made her pain his pain and vice versa. This was no longer the case. The invisible cord had been snapped in two, and now they were practically strangers living under the same roof. Miraculously, Eliza felt well enough by the early evening to dress herself and head downstairs. It seemed that the heat was on its way to breaking, as the early night air was cool, and breezy. The house was quiet, and empty - Eliza surmised that everyone had either retired for the evening, or had gone out of doors. She was wrong. Eliza found Professor Higgins in the library, so engrossed in his reading that he did not even notice her arrival. She cleared her throat, giving him a start that nearly made him drop his book. He raised his eyes to the intruder, only to immediately look away when he recognized who it was. \"Why do you do that?\" Eliza inquired softly. \"What on earth do you speak of, you ridiculous creature?\" His eyes were firmly glued to the page. Eliza approached him, hell-bent on getting the answers she required. \"All of this. Why can you not even look at me anymore? Why the sudden derision?\" She came up behind his chair, and placed her hands on the back of it, looking down at him. Henry stood up suddenly, as though realizing that he was sitting on top of a burning stove, and crossed the room to get away from Eliza, keeping his back turned. \"I am behaving as I always have,\" he lied. \"No, you are not!\" Henry snapped his book shut suddenly, and slammed it down on a nearby desk. Eliza jumped at the noise. \"Perhaps I grow weary of the shameless way you are taking advantage of my mother.\" Eliza's jaw dropped, the confession stabbing at her insides like a knife. She often agonized over the fact that she lived under charity, years of street hardened pride had made her that way. However, even Professor Higgins had gone out of his way to erase those feelings of being a burden in the past. Now it seemed that he had been lying to save her pride, and for whatever reason, he no longer felt it necessary to keep up the deception. \"I shall leave in the morning.\" Henry turned her then, a mocking expression on his face. \"And where the devil do you think you will go?\" \"After this, I really do not see why you would care.\" He straightened his spine, and looked down his nose at her. \"I would just like to be able to give Mother and Pickering news of your whereabouts, as they are the ones invested in your well-being.\" Eliza felt the knife twist a bit more. It was one thing for him to not want her to burden his mother, it was another thing entirely for him to confess indifference towards her. \"I suppose you can tell them that I will be at Clara's then.\" \"Clara Eynsford-Hill, that cotton-headed modern living in a garret Soho with three other girls?\" He gave a cruel laugh. \"Where on earth would they put you, the broom closet? What of that - that creature you are carrying; where will they keep that?\" Eliza felt her blood go cold. \"Wot's the matter wiv ya? Wot kinda man says the things ya do? This ain't a 'thing' or a 'creature' - this is my child!\" Henry took note of how quickly her hurt expression turned to rage, the color rising high in her cheeks; her breath coming out in heavy, labored pants, and her reverting to cockney. He knew he had crossed the line, and vaguely recalled his mother discussing how Eliza was not to be under any sort of strain at all, as it could prove dangerous for herself and the child. He was immediately sorry and a little afraid. \"Eliza, please calm yourself.\" \"Oh, ho! Ya thought ya could treat me like this and not expect-\" \"I was not thinking at all, Eliza-\" \"Ya never think! For all yer fine learnin', ya truly are ignorant!\" She was shouting now, heedless of the fact that the rest of the house was probably starting to settle into sleep. \"Remember what the doctor-\" Eliza's sudden burst of laughter cut him off. \"Why on earth do you remember what the Doctor said? I'm only burden to everyone around me, aren't I - why should you bother with something as trivial as my health?\" Henry surmised that either her anger was beginning to ebb, or that she had actually listened to herself speak. \"What on earth is going on?\" The pair turned in time to witness Eleanor walk into the room. She had not yet begun to prepare for bed, and had been able to rush downstairs the moment the shouting had reached her ears. \"Your son and I were just discussing my leaving you, Mrs. Higgins.\" Eleanor gasped, and rewarded her son with a glare, before going to Eliza's side and leading her to a chair. \"Nonsense - absolute nonsense! Child, you are not going anywhere as long as I have breath in my body.\" \"No one can stop me leaving if I wish, I am my own person!\" Eliza cried as she sat down. \"Freddy made it very clear that we were to keep you safe, and I will lock you in the attic before I allow you to force me to go back on a promise I made to your husband!\" Eleanor retorted, fiercely. She turned her attention to her son. \"What on earth posessed you to bring her to such a state, Henry? Badly done!\" Henry stood dumbfounded and chastised. \"I did nothing-\" \"Shush! Do not lie to me, Henry Higgins; you were always terrible at it.\" She turned back to Eliza, who was beginning to breath more calmly. \"There now, Eliza; no one wants you to leave.\" \"Your son certainly does.\" \"Dearest, he is an idiot-\" \"Pardon?\" Came Henry's wounded inquiry. \"-and you ought not to listen to a word he says.\" Eleanor helped Eliza to her feet. \"Come, let's not discuss this a moment longer. You need rest.\" \"I am still not convinced that staying here is a good idea any longer.\" Eliza remarked as they began to head out of the library. \"Not another word, my dear.\" Eleanor turned to her son. \"Henry, put out the lights when you are through here, and do not show your face tomorrow unless you are sure you can do so without giving offense to everyone you encounter.\" The next week went along very much like the previous, only Henry had gone from trading nasty barbs with Eliza to not speaking to her at all. She was now truly a nonentity to him, or at least that was how she felt. Eleanor took it upon herself to show Eliza the nursery that still remained intact, even though Henry was decades past childhood. Sheets protected the furniture, and it had not been properly dusted in some time. \"I wanted to save it for Henry's children, you see; so I never quite got around to remodeling it into a different sort of room.\" Eliza took a turn about the room, smiling at the pastel scenes on the wall, marvelling at the fact that Professor Higgins had once been a child at play. \"Oh, Mrs. Higgins - this is lovely, but I am afraid I won't have much use of it once Freddy returns.\" Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. News from the western front had been slow, and discouraging. However, she did not want Eliza to lose hope. \"Of course not, dear; I was just hoping it would do temporarily.\" Eliza ambled over to the older woman and kissed her on the cheek. \"Thank you so much. I do not deserve such kindness.\" \"Don't be ridiculous, of course you do.\" Eleanor smiled sadly. \"I think of you very much as my own, you know.\" Before Eliza could reply Swithin cleared his throat from the entrance. \"This letter has arrived for Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.\" \"Oh?\" Eliza approached the butler, and took the buff colored envelope from his hands. She did not take note of his grave expression, but she immediately took stock of the OHMS stamped on the front of it. She exchanged a worried glance with Eleanor, who had noticed the official stamp on the envelope and had gone very pale. The letter nearly fell from her suddenly nerveless fingers, but Eliza recovered it before it fluttered to the ground. Her entire being focused on the missive in her hands, and her surroundings seemed to disappear. For a while she just stared at the envelope, working up the courage to peruse its contents, knowing full well what it would say, but wanting to have just a few more moments of it not being true. She opened it. It is a terrible thing, having one's deepest fears come to reality. Eliza had vividly imagined what it would feel like to be right about this once instance, and had brought herself to tears in the past from conjuring it up so vividly. Her imaginings had been pale imitations of the real thing. This was fatally authentic, and hit her with such a force that all emotion and thought flew from her body, leaving her a shell. She dropped the letter and left the room, heading blindly for her bedroom. Once she arrived at her destination, she sat at her escritoire, pulled out her stationary, and composed a very brief letter, having to steady her right hand by grasping it with her left to halt the violent trembling that caused the date to come out in a barely legible zig-zag. 20 July 1916 Dear Mrs. Pryce, Your son is dead. Sincerely, Eliza Eynsford-Hill[Chapter 11] A Better Man Chapter Ten The Cold, Cold Ground Author's Note: Dedicated to Sash, who is awesome. :) Colonel Pickering studied the stoic little figure in black, and decided he would sell his own soul if it would bring back the lively little spirit that had once inhabited that lonely, silent shell. Mrs. Higgins had shown Pickering and her son the letter on that terrible day - Eliza had retreated to her room. Even Higgins - whom Pickering suspected was on terrible terms with the young girl once more - had appeared struck by the news. Eliza came downstairs in a daze, and headed to the foyer, a letter clutched in her hand. \"Dearest, wherever are you going?\" Eliza gave a start and turned to the concerned trio, looking very much as though she was just noticing their presence, even though she had wordlessly walked past them only moments ago. There was something terribly lifeless about her eyes, unburdened by tears, and betraying nary a single thought. Colonel Pickering had always enjoyed Eliza's eyes, and the ever-changing expression about them - even if he did have trouble remembering their exact color, he never had the same difficulty discerning the feeling behind them. \"I have to deliver this letter, and I haven't any black gowns.\" It sounded as though she were commenting on the weather, so casual was her delivery. \"My son will deliver the letter for you, Eliza, and we will just alter one of my own mourning gowns; come now, I will have some tea brought to the parlour.\" Colonel Pickering had expected Eliza to fight Mrs. Higgins' deft handling of the situation, but she did not. The girl allowed the letter to be taken from her custody, and then be lead away. Higgins had not been able to tear his eyes away from her the entire time. That had been a few days ago. Now they were all sitting in a sparsely populated church, for Freddy's memorial. The boy had been buried on the battlefield in Somme, and with the conflict still raging, retrieving him was an impossibility. Clara Eynsford-Hill sat at the front pew with Eliza, trying desperately to not shatter in a million pieces. Ordinarily the girl was quite free with her emotions, but now she seemed wary of Eliza's condition. Pickering supposed that the girl could scream and tear at her hair, and Eliza would not acknowledge that it was happening. His dear girl had been thoroughly numbed by her grief. If only she could be rocked and soothed like a small child with a scrapped knee - were it only that simple. Colonel Pickering turned to his friend, who was heedless to everything save for her , silently watching, almost as though he were waiting for something.\"What on earth are you thinking, Higgins?\" He inquired. \"It does not bear repeating.\" The younger man sighed. \"Why does she not break down? She is a female, and no one would think less of her if she did.\" \"She is in shock, Henry. Eliza is barely twenty-four years old, and now she is a widow with a child on the way. I know it is a hard scenario to imagine yourself in, but please try.\" Mrs. Higgins intervened. \"That poor, frightened boy,\" Pickering muttered, thinking back on the last conversation he had with Freddy. Due to the extremely early hour that the boy had fled, and the lack of flurries in the air, Pickering had been able to identify a set of footprints just outside the Higgins' residence, and decided to follow them. The boy could not had gotten far, and with the chill in the air, he probably had eventually stopped to warm himself. Interestingly enough, Pickering found the boy in Largelady Park, staring wide-eyed at his old place of residence. The Eynsford-Hill home had been closed up on the occasion of his mother's advantageous match, and she no longer resided there. \"Mr. Hill?\" Pickering approached the boy cautiously. At hearing his name, Freddy had turned to the old man, saw who it was, and sighed. \"Have you come to thrash me?\" He had asked, in a defeated tone that said he would not argue if that were the case. \"Nothing of the sort, I assure you; I've come to talk to you.\" \"It's far too chilly out here.\" Freddy had then strode up to his old home, and deftly broke in the front door. \"Make haste before someone sees.\" Colonel Pickering shook off his wide-eyed astonishment, and followed the boy into the house. \"I'll be dashed.\" \"You get acquainted with all manner of sundry in the volunteer army,\" Freddy had explained as they entered the parlour. It appeared to be a room full of ghosts, with the darkness combined with the sheets thrown over the furniture. Freddy pulled the sheets off of two chairs, and offered the bewildered old man a seat. \"Eliza is not angry with you, my boy.\" Pickering announced, as Freddy settled into his respective chair. \"I am angry with myself; I will not be bothering her again.\" \"My boy, you are not the only person to have this happen.\" Freddy looked to the older man, with a curious expression. \"The nightmares? You've had them?\" \"We've all had them, Freddy. All of us.\" Freddy shook his head, a look of relief on his features. \"It's so terrible out there, Colonel. I am glad that you have been spared this. I thought I was going to be fine until-\" The boy looked down at his ruined hands. \"It was ours, you know? The wind was wrong... it shouldn't have come back like it did. God, those muffled cries-\" He hid his face in his hands, and Pickering knew the boy was reliving every agonizing second. \"You are here, Freddy. You are safe and sound in your mother's home, talking to a concerned old friend. It can't touch you here.\" \"Can't it? Look what I've done to my wife! My god - I could have killed her!\" He dropped his hands to his lap and looked down at them. \"I worked so hard to keep the death out of our letters, tried so hard to protect her - I brought the war to our home!\" \"There are measures to take to ensure it does not happen again, Freddy. You do not have to live in fear of another occurence. Be reasonable, man - Eliza needs you. Would you truly abandon her?\" \"I cannot even fathom looking into her eyes again. All I can see is how they looked as I-\" Freddy could not finish. \"Then I will stay here with you until you can bring yourself to do so, but you must go back to her. This whole ordeal is killing her.\" The two ended up talking for hours, with Freddy finally agreeing that he would go back and face Eliza. Pickering had been aghast at the tales Freddy told, and the old man was no stranger to the battlefields. This was new territory though - the flooded trenches, the twisted metal, the new toxins that floated in the air. Never in Pickering's wildest imaginings could he conjure up such images - and the waste, the unnecessary waste of an entire generation of boys. If they came back at all, they would come back wrong, like Freddy. A late-comer to the service entered Colonel Pickering's peripheral vision, and he turned to see who it could possibly be. Alarmed, he nudged Higgins, who turned and practically snarled at the sight. Dressed to the very nines in terms of mourning-wear, with an ancient-yet-dapper man at her side, was Mrs. Pryce, formerly Eynsford-Hill. The pair trudged up the center aisle, with a straight and condescending sort of bearing, before picking their seat at the front, right next to Clara and Eliza. Clara's jaw dropped, and something resembling a spark of outrage passed over Eliza's features before she schooled them back into their blank state. Clara urged Eliza to scoot over so that a divide was presented between Mother and Daughter, the daughter in question presenting her mother with the most blatant I-Am-Snubbing-You face that she could muster. Mrs. Pryce was not paying attention to her daughter, however. Her gaze was obviously fixed on Eliza's midsection, and Pickering vaguely realized that this was the first time Mrs. Pryce was seeing her daughter-in-law in her delicate condition. Eliza had begun to grow considerably. \"What is that old crone staring at?\" Henry muttered a little too loudly to be discreet. His mother hushed him as severely as she could, and Eliza turned to him. Strangely, his heartbeat picked up when her eyes met his, and then nearly came to a standstill when she miraculously smiled. It was barely noticeable, practically a mere twitch in one corner of her mouth, but there it was. After the ceremony, Clara helped Eliza to her feet, and attempted to steer her toward the side aisle, in order to avoid Mrs. Pryce and her husband. \"Clara, please.\" Eliza's voice was barely above a whisper, and slightly raspy from underuse. Clara gave Eliza a questioning look, but said nothing as she turned to the older woman and approached her calmly. Mrs. Pryce straightened her spine, and pressed her lips into a thin line. The mourners in the chapel were all privy to the details of Freddy's seperation with his mother, knew that Eliza was the cause of the rift. All eyes were on the scene unfolding, and all waited with bated breath. \"Mrs. Pryce - how wonderful to see you. I am so sorry that I missed you when Freddy went to war, and again when he came home last Christmas. I recall informing you on both-\" \"How dare you speak to me in such a tone, or even at all? You stole my son away from me, and then you sent him to his death when he could not measure up to what you expected. He wrote to me - countless times- speaking of his disgrace at being a mere errand boy while you ran that store - shamless!\" This was news to Eliza. Freddy had never so much as hinted at the fact that he kept correspondence with his mother. The revelation stung greatly, a jolt to her numbed being. \"He never told me.\" \"Of course he did not, why on earth would he? I was his sole confessor during that time, and I begged him not to enlist, to come home. Mr. Pryce could have neatly made your sham of a marriage disappear. He stopped writing after I made that suggestion.\" \"I believe it - that was a cruel suggestion.\" \"You marrying him was cruel, you stupid girl! You who brought him so low in society - you destroyed him! It would have been a mercy on your part to let him go, and now he is dead, and you have his child.\" Mrs. Pryce looked over at Henry, who fairly trembled with barely restrained rage, and smiled maliciously. \"Of course, one tends to hear gossip every now and again-\" \"Mother, get out!\" Clara bellowed, heedless of the spectacle. \"Clara, this is a house of God-\" \"Oh, do not be absurd, Mother and tell me you care about such things, when you are making those sorts of accusations.\" Eliza felt a dizzy spell begin to overtake her, and sat down quite suddenly, causing the bickering mother and daughter to cease their argument, and take note. Clara was immediately at Eliza's side, fanning her face in an attempt to allow her some air. It was almost unbearably stuffy in the church. Clara looked up at her mother, her expression even darker than it had been before. \"Mother, I do not think we will be seeing each other, henceforth. I cannot order you to leave a house of God, as you say, but if you have any pity in your heart you will leave right now. I am afraid if I have to continue looking at your face I will scream. Please.\" Mrs. Pryce inhaled sharply, and it looked as though she had more to say. She began to open her mouth, before a sharp voice spoke up from a few rows back. \"If you do not leave this instant, I will drag you out by your hair, and if that dusty bag of bones you are wed to does not like it, he is welcome to call me out!\" Eliza turned wide-eyed to Professor Higgins, wondering for a moment if she had imagined what he had said. She had not. The whole congregation erupted in whispers as Mrs. Pryce fled the church, sputtering angrily, her husband lagging behind with a slightly dazed look about him. Soon, Eliza was surrounded by well-wishers, some she had never met in her life. Her father and his new wife had attended, and she politely turned down a five pound note that Alfred had contritely tried to gift her. Her eyes were trained past the gathering crowd, to the solitary figure that stood waiting at the entrance to the church, impatiently running a hand through his hair. She wondered why he waited for her, when any number of people would have been happy to escort her home. Not that she had a home.[Chapter 12] A Better Man Chapter Eleven Without Author's note: Thank you for the overwhelming response to the last chapter! You ladies (and possibly some gentlemen?) are the greatest! Henry never seriously considered the threat to his immortal soul until he successfully wished away Freddy Eynsford-Hill. It was true that he never outright pondered the pleasure of seeing the boy dead, a garden variety total abandonment of Eliza had been about as grim as the fantasy had gotten - but Henry had still wished the boy gone, and now he was dead. Eliza's dealing of the situation offered no pleasure either. It had been so easy to conjure up smug delight when he fantasized over her utter devastation; it was another thing entirely to be faced with the reality of it. The sad, stunned silence that had become a part of Eliza's entire being did not entice Henry to boast and gloat over her misfortune, nor did he even contemplate slamming the door in her face - not that he could, this was his mother's home, after all. It was devastatingly disappointing, and not to mention shaming, having one's darkest and most private of wishes come to fruition. Such thoughts haunted Henry as he returned to his mother's home after Freddy's memorial. Eliza kept a few paces behind him, on the arm of Pickering, and Henry escorted his mother. They had decided to forgo the customary reception, as food supplies were growing scarce, and not many families held large dinners any longer. The sight of Eliza fanning her face with her hand caused Henry to feel a stab of pity. The summer heat had taken its toll on Eliza before news of Freddy's death, he imagined it now could only be worse with her being restricted to mourning garb for the forseeable future. Damned barbaric customs. \"Excuse me, I think I need to go lie down,\" she explained, a bit breathlessly. Henry's mother assisted Eliza on the laborious journey upstairs. Her painfully slow steps concerned Henry, a feeling now permanently associated with the girl. It filled him with irritation, the fact that he could not look at her without wondering if she were well. What's to become of me? That question repeated like a prayer in Eliza's mind, as she lay in a bed that was not hers, in a house that also did not belong to her. She had nearly forgotten what it was like to be on her own, and the thought was beginning to frighten her. Except she would not be alone, would she? Eliza let a hand fall to her stomach, feeling the heated skin seperated by the fine lawn material of her nightgown. A quiver of movement beneath her hand confirmed that she would never be alone again. Our child. Eliza allowed hot tears to spill down her cheeks, although she did not sob or cry out, and her blank expression did not alter. She needed Freddy beside her, to share in the moment when their son or daughter entered the world. It would never be so. Eliza thought about what Mrs. Pryce had said, and began to agree with the older woman. She had not trusted Freddy with anything critical involving the flower shop, and she had given him a degrading task. It was no wonder that he felt so emasculated that he volunteered for the army, even refusing to accept Colonel Pickering's offer to ensure he was placed in a safe situation. It was true that he would have been drafted in February, when the act of conscription passed, but perhaps he could have protested, on the grounds of Eliza being with child. Perhaps... She could not believe that he had been in contact with his mother the whole time, and had not said anything. It was a betrayal, to be sure, but Eliza could not get angry over it, not ever. How she wished he were standing before her, so she could berate and resent him without feeling an overpowering sense of guilt at doing so. \"Damn you, Freddy Eynsford-Hill,\" she cursed under her breath. The ensuing shame hit her like a freight train, especially when Freddy's sweet, earnest face appeared in her mind's eye. She would never, ever see that face again unless it was in dreams. September 1916 \"You need to cease looking at Eliza with an expression that clearly states that you think she is as big as a house.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"That is what she told me this morning during tea. She finds it very insulting, you know.\" Henry gaped at his mother. He had just walked through the door after a day at the factory with Colonel Pickering, and instead of a warm greeting, she opened by scolding him out of the blue over something Eliza had imagined. \"Does it occur to you that I rarely see Eliza anymore? The girl is confined to her room more often than not.\" \"I do not know, Henry; she told me that she came to the library for a book the other day, when she was still feeling well, and you gave a start as though just realizing how awful she looked.\" \"Were those her exact words?\" \"They were.\" \"Insufferable girl! I suppose she forgot to mention that she knocked over a vase when she walked into the library - it did not break, Mother - and that is why I looked startled?\" \"She did not.\" \"Probably because she knocked it over with her oversized stomach, and was embarassed.\" \"Henry!\" Her son had the gall to shoot her a thoroughly innocent look. \"You must admit that she has gotten rather large.\" Eleanor threw her hands in the air, and walked away, disgusted at her son's lack of tact. Henry looked to Pickering, completely baffled. \"These confounded women, Pick! I daresay we are the only sane people left in the household.\" \"Oh, Higgins - you must be sensible. Women become very sensitive about such things, and you have got to approach the situation with more care than you have.\" \"I always take care in what I say to Eliza.\" Colonel Pickering seemed to be at war with himself for a moment. A part of him did not want to insult his friend by taking it upon himself to make contradiction, but another part of him remembered Higgins' not-so-sotto-voce exclamation of 'Ye gods!' the first time he noticed that Eliza was beginning to show. He often wondered at how one person could persist in being so spectacularly unselfaware. \"If you say so, old man,\" Pickering replied before heading to the study, intent on pouring himself a stiff drink. It became clear that night that Eliza was not well enough to join the trio for dinner, so Eleanor had a light tray brought up to her. The affair was silent, punctuated by the occasional work anecdote from Colonel Pickering. Everyone was painfully aware of how close Eliza's due date was, and the fact hung over them in a heavy, anxious black cloud. The dynamic of their little makeshift family would inevitably be turned on its head with the arrival of Eliza's child, and the uncertainty of what they change would mean made them all very uneasy. Eleanor and Pickering were determined that the child should have as normal of a life as they could provide. It did not matter that the child's grandparents both maternal and paternal were bound to be nonentities in his or her life, Pickering and Eleanor would simply have to become Grandfather and Grandmother, respectively. Henry, whether he wanted to or not, would be titled with obscure Uncle. Of course, society would definitely have their opinions on the arrangement. Whispers had risen to a fever pitch, ever since Mrs. Pryce had made her accusations at Freddy's memorial. It was entirely possible to the general population, that Professor Higgins - a confirmed bachelor - had fathered a lovechild with Eliza Doolittle, mysterious upstart. A few modern types declared it romantic, the idea of an embittered, stodgy academic falling madly in love with his pupil - and who could blame him? Eliza, questionable origins aside, was a stunningly fetching young thing. One as pretty as herself was bound to get lonely with her young husband away. Yes, it was entirely possible, and a secretly accepted fact. After all, anyone who had ever met Freddy Eynsford-Hill while he was growing up knew him to be a painfully shy, awkward, albeit handsome boy. Perhaps their marriage had not been consumated at all! Several classmates of Freddy even testified that they thought the boy practically fey - in the most derogatory sense - even if he did show a bit of manhood by enlisting well before the act of conscription. Mrs. Pryce had done all the damage she could possibly do. Eliza's reputation was in shambles almost before she could finish building it. Henry was about to comment on dinner, when one of the few maids Eleanor still posessed, ran into the dining room, unannounced. The young girl was white as a sheet. \"Beggin' yer pardon, ma'am, but Mrs. Eynsford-'ill is sayin' that the baby is on its way, and I've just called the doctor!\" The child's dialect betrayed a hasty promotion from scullery maid to regular housemaid, after the war effort had turned most of Eleanor's staff into soldiers or nurses. Henry felt his teeth being set on edge at awful cockney twang. Good lord, the baby! Almost immediately, Henry forgot his complaint about dropped 'H's. \"Oh, my! Thank you, Sarah. Please tell Mrs. Eynsford-Hill that I will be upstairs directly.\" The chit curtsied, and left the trio to soak in the news. \"I want you gentlemen to go and do what you do best -smoke and drink brandy in the study- I will see to Eliza.\" Eleanor started for the door, but paused. \"Could one of you please see that Clara is informed of the news? She would never forgive me if I left her in the dark.\" The two men were left alone, dumb-founded, and a more than a little frightened for their young friend. Hours passed, and Clara had arrived shortly after Pickering phoned her, stumbling awkwardly over the announcement that Eliza was giving birth. There were just some things that a confirmed bachelor did not care to discuss. As Eleanor predicted, the brandy flowed, albeit more in a medicinal manner than a celebratory one. It seemed that everytime one of Eliza's agonized cries rent through the air, a new drink had to be poured. \"Good god, Pickering, why on earth do they put themselves through such torture?\" Henry asked from across the smoke-filled room. He felt rather like Sherlock Holmes, in that Eliza's ordeal was turning into a three pipe problem - possibly more before the night let out. Henry nearly choked on a cloud of smoke he was inhaling when he heard the unmistakable sound of Freddy's name being invoked via a nearly unearthly wail. Even dead, the mention of the boy managed to cause an odd twisting in Henry's heart. \"Higgins, if women did not gallantly put themselves through 'such torture' you and I would not exist.\" \"Poor Eliza,\" Henry replied, fully meaning it. It was nearly four in the morning, when Dr. Hardwicke entered the study. \"Mrs. Higgins asked that I inform you gentlemen her wish that you would retire for the night. The child will not be arriving any time soon.\" Henry's heart nearly stopped at the news. \"Eliza-\" \"- Is doing well. Mrs. Eynsford-Hill is healthy, she is just -\" Dr. Hardwicke blushed, he was not accustomed to explaining delicate things to people who were not anxious husbands. \"-her physiology dictates that this will be a long process.\" Thoroughly mortified, the doctor fled the study, and headed back to Eliza's bedroom. \"Well, I shan't be sleeping after news like that, what say you, Higgins?\" \"There's plenty more brandy.\" The sun was high in the sky, and Henry and Pickering were passed out in a drunken stupor in their respective chairs when the unmistakable cry of a robust newborn filled the household. Henry jerked to consciousness immediately, feeling as though he had been thoroughly thrashed with cricket bats for hours. He cracked his neck, and turned to his slumbering friend. \"Pickering, wake up!\" The older man awoke after a bit, his fuzzy look of confusion turning into one of sober concern when he heard the cry. Eleanor appeared at the entrance, as they were straightening their rumpled clothing and hair, and stretching. \"Eliza has a son.\"[Chapter 13] A Better Man Chapter Twelve Jack Eliza vaguely recalled a fuzzy image of a small newborn, red faced and dark haired, before she lost consciousness. The pain had been great, and the room was sweltering, despite the cold cloth that Clara had dabbed over her face during the ordeal. She hovered peacefully in repose, heedless of the panic her fainting was causing. \"Open a window, quickly!\" Dr. Hardwicke commanded. Clara jumped into action, throwing open the largest window in the room, nearest to Eliza's bed. Eleanor took over with the cloth, dipping it in fresh water, and placing it on Eliza's forehead, pleading with the girl to get her to wake up. The room breathed a sigh of relief when her eyes fluttered open. \"Freddy?\" As soon as she said it, Eliza realized the futility of the request. Her eyes dulled, and she looked away from Eleanor's concerned gaze. \"You have a son, Eliza. He's healthy, and perfect.\" Eleanor smiled sadly at the girl, hoping that the news would bring a light to her eyes. Eliza weakly attempted to push the cloth from her forehead, seemingly deaf to the announcement. Dr. Hardwicke, having finished cleaning off the boy, carried him to his mother. Eliza reluctantly lifted her eyes to the doctor, and allowed him to set the swaddled babe in her arms. She looked down and a head full of dark hair with the promise of a slight curl, his eyes screwed shut, making it impossible to discern the shape, and a round, red face. The babe had her mouth, and her nose, and that was all she could tell for the time being. \"His name is Frederick John,\" she recited dully. It had never occured to her to pick out a name, and as he was a boy, it only seemed fitting to name him after his father. She touched the child's tiny fists with her forefinger, and stared in wonder as he grasped at the slender digit, his grip a tiny pulse that promised greater strength in the future. Little Frederick opened his eyes, and Eliza felt a curious tug at her heart when she realized that they were the exact shape of his father's; keen, intelligent eyes that would most likely turn smoke-colored in a matter of months. \"I will go downstairs and make an announcement to Henry and Colonel Pickering.\" Eleanor kissed Eliza cool, damp forehead. \"He's such a handsome little thing, Eliza. Be proud.\" Dr. Hardwicke excused himself to wash up, and Eliza was left in the room with Clara. A sob in near her bedside caused Eliza to give a start. She looked up at her sister-in-law, who was fairly trembling with emotion at the sight of Little Frederick. \"Would you like to hold him?\" Eliza inquired. The weeping girl nodded through her tears, and carefully took her nephew into her arms. \"Hello, little man,\" Clara cooed, once she regained control of her voice. \"My beautiful, handsome, wonderful boy.\" \"I see you've wasted no time puffing him up and spoiling him,\" Eliza teased in a voice no stronger than the mewl of a kitten. \"Why shouldn't I? He's the only nephew I will ever have.\" Clara's own words reduced her to tears once again, and she handed the child back to Eliza while she attempted to compose herself. Eliza watched her sister-in-law, sinking in to her usual detachment. She wished that she could emerge from her cold and empty cell, and scream at the injustice that the universe had thrown at her. She wanted more than anything to cry, and carry on until her voice grew hoarse; to rail at God and beg for her life back, but something overpowering and stifling held her in check. The pain of childbirth had forced an inevitable outburst, true, but that had been an expression of physical pain, which seemed paltry compared to the agony she suffered internally. Clara left the room when the doctor returned to examine Eliza. He could not discern any physical ailment, other than the need for her to rest and recover. He did not believe it prudent to inform her that she would be able to have many more children in the future, seeing as she was so very recently widowed. He felt pity for the girl, but knew that she was one of many in these times - not that he would be so tactless as to tell her so. Human beings, for some reason, liked to think that their grief was unique, and that they were the only ones who could feel it keenly. Dr. Hardwicke to not have to heart nor the courage to disabuse them of such a notion. It was later in the afternoon before Clara brought Little Freddy downstairs to be introduced to the other men of the house. Eliza would be excused from present company until she recovered. Pickering seemed absolutely enthralled by the newborn, comfortable fitting into the role of doting old grandfather. \"Now, here's a fine little chap! Intelligent too, no doubt - and feel that grip! - good lord, this one is going to be the finest rower in London when he grows up!\" Eleanor nodded in agreement, as Clara beamed proudly. \"I declare I've not seen a more handsome baby-\" She caught her son's hurt looks. -\"Since my Henry,\" she added, hastily. Henry did not have much (any) experience with newborns. It was true that some of his fellow academics gave in to the temptation of a proper family, and some of them were now fathers, but Henry had always found excuses not to pay call after children had entered their lives. He imagined that he would not care much for children. They were always underfoot when he found himself on the town, dirty little ruffians. This was Eliza's boy, however. Henry supposed his mother and Pickering were right. Once you looked past the squashed tomato appearance of the babe's face, he was quite pleasant to look at. The amount of dark hair on his little head was most impressive, and when he opened his tiny eyes to stare at Henry, the older man was struck by the wisdom that lie therein. However, the effect was quite spoiled by the tiny bubble of spit that arose from the child's cherubic mouth. \"Yes, I suppose he is a handsome devil, but that is no surprise; both his parents - his mother in particular- are attractive sort of people.\" He felt as though he should have worked the word 'were' into that sentence somehow, for mentioning Freddy in the present tense caused a bit of awkward silence in the room, broken only by a thin cry from Little Freddy. \"My poor little angel; I will take him back to Eliza - undoubtedly he's hungry.\" Clara left with the child. \"Eliza is well, then?\" Henry inquired of his mother, who had been giving her son a curious sort of look ever since he gave credit to Eliza for bearing a handsome child, admitting that he found the woman to be attractive. \"She is quite healthy, yes. The labor was long, but it did not do any sort of -... she is quite healthy.\" Eleanor had begun to go into detail, but realized to whom she was speaking to, and thought better of it. \"Is she happy? Women get so silly over babies, and I thought for sure this would cheer her up a bit.\" Eleanor frowned. \"I cannot read the girl for the life of me; she is so quiet, and unemotional. I do not think she's had a proper cry over Freddy, and she has not so much as smiled at the babe.\" Henry recalled the night of the Embassy Ball, when Eliza had unleashed her fury at him, and knew she was capable of emotion. She was passionate, loud, and strong; far removed from this quiet, dead-leaf echo that haunted his mother's home. There had to be a way to reach that person, because Henry did not know how much longer his heart could take this pretty, empty shell that had been put in her place. He did not have to wait very long for the axe to fall. It was about mid-October; Little Freddy had just turned a month old, and was turning into a thriving, fat little thing. Eliza was doing her expected duty towards the child; feeding him, clothing him, rocking him to sleep, but she was performing her tasks without the heart and the tenderness that everyone expected of her. It did not seem to matter to the boy; what he lacked in affection from his mother, he received ten-fold from Eleanor, Pickering, and his aunt Clara - who was now a permanent fixture in the household. Eliza was sitting at the breakfast table across from Henry, and they were both engaged in reading the newspaper. Henry thought she looked rather tired that morning. Little Freddy was going through a bit of a cold, and as a result had not been keeping very regular hours. \"The coffee is a bit strong this morning,\" Henry remarked with a grimace. \"I requested it. I needed something-\" Eliza gave a great yawn. \"-to keep me going. The baby was fussing all night, and I simply could not get a moment's peace.\" Eliza never referred to Little Freddy by his name, even though she was the one who had given it to him. He was always The Baby or The Boy; never Freddy. The household had picked up on the unspoken taboo, and followed suit. It seemed strange, though, that the child not have a proper name. \"I am sure Mother would not mind if his aunt stayed in one of the guest rooms tonight and saw to his welfare.\" Eliza shook her head. \"No, that would not do at all - I am his mother.\" Henry thought it unwise to make a retort, so he did not. They resumed reading in companionable silence - that is until the most curious noise filled the room. Henry's ears were assailed by what very much sounded like a female sobbing. He looked up from his paper and across the table to Eliza. It was a female sobbing. It was her. \"Eliza?\" She was seemingly deaf to anything but her powerful, pent-up grief. Eliza gasped, trembled, and nearly choked from the brute force of it, covering her face with her hands, her body slightly bent over in the chair. Henry sprang from his seat, and rushed to her side, fearing some sort of invisible injury had befallen her. \"Eliza, are you hurt?\" Colonel Pickering and Eleanor Higgins entered the room, bewildered looks upon their faces. Immediately they came to Eliza's aid, pressing her with concerned questions. The girl continued to weep, ignoring them all entirely. Suddenly - in the midst of it all - Eliza abruptly stood up, and fled the room. \"What on earth happened? Henry - did you say something to her?\" \"Not at all, Mother; we were both reading silently, when this tempest broke.\" Eliza's discarded newspaper caught Henry's eye, and he picked it up, hoping that perhaps it held a clue. \"Ah.\" Henry was at a definite loss for words. He handed the page to his mother and Pickering, to allow them to be the judge. Tears appeared in Eleanor's eyes as she read, and Pickering nodded, fully understanding, and quite touched by the piece. It was no wonder it had an effect on Eliza: \"Have you news of my boy Jack?\" Not this tide. \"When d'you think that he'll come back?\" Not with this wind blowing, and this tide. \"Has any one else had word of him?\" Not this tide. For what is sunk will hardly swim, Not with this wind blowing, and this tide. \"Oh, dear, what comfort can I find?\" None this tide, Nor any tide, Except he did not shame his kind — Not even with that wind blowing, and that tide. Then hold your head up all the more, This tide, And every tide; Because he was the son you bore, And gave to that wind blowing and that tide! Eliza stumbled into her bedroom, and her eyes fell upon her son, sleeping peacefully in his bassinet, a touch of color in his slightly fevered cheeks, and his little mouth slack. It was the most beautiful sight she had ever seen in her life. She gently took him into her arms, careful to not awaken him, and pressed a tender kiss on the top of his curly dark head. Eliza was able to surpress her sobs, but the tears continued to flow, dropping here and there on her son's blanket. \"Forgive me, sweetheart,\" she whispered. Eliza tried to form the name 'Freddy' on her lips, but her throat still tightened with the effort. \"Jack,\" she whispered instead. There it was; merely a pet version of his middle name, but it would serve. End Notes: Credit for the poem \"My Boy Jack\", and the plot bunny in general, goes to Rudyard Kipling. First published simultaneously in The Times , The Daily Telegraph, and The New York Times nineteenth of October 1916, many believe it to be written about his son, John Kipling who perished in The Battle of Loos, but there have been some claims to the contrary.[Chapter 14] A Better Man Chapter Thirteen Daylight Spring 1917 Eleanor nearly cried the day the flowers were ripped from her garden, but she understood why, and had consented to it when asked. The food shortages were becoming unbearable, with the farmers fleeing their plows to fight in the war, and the blockades. Eliza had approached her with an idea one morning during breakfast; the flower shop was failing dismally, and Eliza felt that people would much rather have something to eat rather then smell or look at. Eleanor's gardening space was expansive, and Eliza had been reading about cultivating vegetable gardens. Wouldn't it be a marvelous venture - she had suggested - to use the space they had for growing and selling vegetables at a very reasonable - nearly charitable - price? Eleanor agreed that it would, and had kissed the young girl on the cheek and commended her for being so very clever - even though her heart was breaking just a little bit. So there she found herself, sitting at a small table in the gardens, dandling seven month old Jack on one knee, as Eliza and Burt the gardener diligently pulled out the prized flowers, and replaced them with seeds that would produce snap beans, tomatoes, and anything else that could turn a good profit and fill an empty belly. \"Eliza - really, dearest, you need not work yourself so hard!\" Eleanor chided. Eliza looked up from her work, hair a frazzle, and a smudge of dirt marring her fair skin. \"Now, ma'am, I ain't 'fraid to get me 'ands a little dirty.\" Jack squealed with delight at the unfamiliar way his mother spoke, and she rewarded her son with a wink. Eleanor felt relief at the child's joy; his first tooth was coming through and his temperament at the unwelcome intrusion was making life difficult for everyone. Henry walked into the garden, upon hearing Eliza speaking in her native tongue. He felt as though he had stepped into the past, when he saw her bent over in the dirt, looking every inch the impoverished flower girl he had discovered that one fateful night. The thought was not an unpleasant one, for those memories came from a much simpler time - a time he would willingly turn the clocks back for. \"Mother - you really must not let in any sort of riffraff from the street into your home - Oh, hello Jack; come here, my boy - if you let one in, more will follow,\" Henry teased, taking the child from Eleanor, and sitting down. His fondness for the child never failed to astonish Eleanor, or anyone else for that matter. Perhaps it was the fact that Jack had immediately become attached to Henry, without any sort of urging from outside influence. The child just naturally gravitated towards the man, and - miracle of miracles - Henry did not discourage it. \"Professor, my son is not a cat!\" Eliza scolded with a half smile - Henry was dangling his pocketwatch in front of the boy's pale, captivated eyes, and Jack was attempting to grasp at it with his small, chubby hands. \"Oh, very well then - here you are, boy.\" Henry allowed Jack to take the time-piece, in which he promptly shoved into his drooling mouth, and then removed with an unguarded look of infantile disgust before dropping it entirely. Henry did not seem appalled in the least bit at the child's rough treatment of the expensive trinket, as his eyes were trained on Eliza, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Eleanor. \"It must be so wonderful to be such a natural beauty that a little bit of dirt and grime does absolutely nothing to distract from it - don't you agree, Henry?\" Eleanor could not decide who was blushing the deepest at her remark: Eliza, who was still having trouble accepting such compliments, or Henry, who probably was not aware that someone had noticed his staring. \"She looks the same to me as she ever has,\" Henry remarked, after clearing his throat. Jack began to fuss. Eliza rose to her feet, and wiped her dirty hands upon her skirt, her cheeks still blazing from Eleanor's little exchange with Henry. She took her son out of Henry's custody, and pressed a kiss against his chubby cheek. \"Whatever is the matter, Jack?\" She threw an apologetic look at Burt. \"I am afraid I have to put my son down for his nap, Burt - can you manage without me for a while?\" The gruff old man waved his hand at her, dismissively. \"I managed just fine fer three decades before ya decided to lend a 'and, Mrs. 'ill - go and get out o' the sun before ya freckle yer fine complexion.\" Henry thought that it was a bit too late for that. A smattering of freckles played across the bridge of her nose as they spoke. Unfashionable to most, but devilishly charming to Henry. As though hearing his thoughts, Eliza raised her hand to self-consciously cover her nose, before entering the house. Henry found himself smiling fondly at the sight, before checking himself. There would be quite enough of that for one day. 13 June 1917 \"Come now, Eliza - can't someone else take your little charity basket for you?\" Eliza narrowed her eyes at Henry. \"Burt is escorting me, and it is not a charity basket, it is a sample basket in order to show people the quality of my wares, and tell them where they can be purchased.\" \"It is a charity basket, Eliza. No one is going to travel from Whitechapel to Brompton for a green grocer.\" \"They will if the price is right.\" \"Is that so? Well, enjoy being torn limb from limb by starving ruffians.\" Eliza pressed her lips into a thin line, and deepened the intensity of her glare, before turning dramatically on her heel and storming from the house, with Henry chuckling at her. It was true, she was heading towards the east end with wares that were to be given freely to its denizens, and she doubted any of them would be in a position to travel to the posher neighborhood her flower shop was located at. She did not care a jot, though. Memories of leaner times still plagued her, and while she did not have much, she still had considerably more then the people of her former caste. Professor Higgins' scorn at her gesture stung a great deal - what was wrong with having a kind heart towards the less fortunate? He would never understand what it was like to shiver, and starve to the point of digging through the dustbin, as she had done as a child when her father's meager income was being thrown away in the pub. Henry Higgins could take his fine airs and graces and shove them up his arse. Eliza had better things to do then to look down her nose at the less fortunate. The less fortunate seemed a bit proud on that day. Eliza faced incredulous looks, and outright rejection from some when she entered the Whitechapel district. \"Yer pride gonna feed them four, then?\" Eliza asked, when a worn-out, pinched face mother of indeterminate age tried to tell the 'fine lady' off. Astonished at the familiar dialect coming from such a nicely turned out specimen, the woman bit down on her pride and accepted one of the baskets. \"Eliza?\" The woman in question turned to see a rather pretty - albeit rather dirty - young woman wave her down. Eliza walked over to her, hesitantly. \"It's Emma Smith, ya silly girl!\" Ah, yes - Eliza remembered now. She had been a bit of a confidante, back in the old days. The years of living rough had not done much to dim the brilliant hue of her bright blue eyes, although lines on her face were beginning at the corners of her pert mouth. \"Emma, what ya doin' all this way? Don't ya still live-\" \"I live 'ere now, 'Liza. Been down on me luck, and 'ad to move elsewhere.\" The two women strolled together, catching up, and making a curious sort of pair. Burt completed the oddity, grizzled and slightly bent, arms overflowing with baskets. It was only when they heard the aeroplanes overhead, did the girls stop their chatter in order to gaze up at the sky to see the crafts, great and white flying above. \"It's our boys!\" Emma cried, shouting joyfully at the spectacle. Eliza felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end, which always signified trouble. \"Emma, I think we had better get to shelter.\" \"Why ya talkin' like that, 'Liza? It's just our-\" Emma was cut off by the screams in the street as the bombs began to fall in broad daylight. Henry had only been teasing Eliza, earlier that day, but the look she gave him as she stormed away stayed with him for some reason. He had been told on several occasions that he tended to tease too hard, especially where Eliza was concerned. They had been getting on so very well, too. The look continued to plague him as he sat in the nursery with Jack, urging the boy to improve his crawling. The child fell to his stomach after a failed attempt, and had raised his head to give Henry a look that eerily echoed his mother's. \"Tosh, Jack - It's not as if I pushed you down.\" The boy began to scream, and Henry picked him up in a panic, dead-set on searching for Pickering, Eleanor, or even that hanger-on Clara. They were all better equipped to deal with Jack's tantrums. \"Mother!\" He cried, hurrying down the stairs. A violent tremor tore through the house, and nearly caused Henry to lose his footing, and drop the boy. \"Henry!\" His mother came into view, face ashen. \"We must get to the cellar, quickly!\" Cold panic gripped at Henry. \"Where is Eliza?\" \"Hurry, Henry - the boy!\" The small, squirming, panicking life in Henry's arms spurred him to action. He followed his mother, while Jack screamed into his ear. Now he feared the sight of Eliza's outraged face would be permanently etched into his memory - something he would see every single time he closed his eyes at night. It could have very well been the last moment he shared with her, and he had mocked her in it. Stupid, stupid beast. They were cooped in that cellar for what felt like ages. The entire time, Henry kept his eyes on the door, willing Eliza to come walking through them as though nothing had happened. Henry was certain he would shake her if that happened. How dare she make him worry so? Who the devil did she think she was? She did not come. Finally, the little makeshift family emerged from their hiding place, and headed into the streets to survey the damage. It appeared that their neighborhood was untouched, and the tremors they felt had come from a distance. Henry spotted a rather filthy looking boy of about eight running through the streets, and intercepted him. \"Where have you come from, boy?\" He barked. The child began to weep, and Henry dimly heard his mother scolding him for being so insensitive. \"T-the east sir - It's real bad over there, it is. Me mum 'as a position in one of the 'ouses over 'ere. I got out of the school but me sister, sir...\" The child spotted Eleanor and recognized a maternal spirit in her; with a sob he threw himself into her arms. \"Please, 'elp me find me mum! They won't let me in all dirty-like...\" \"Hush, child, I will take you to her.\" Henry watched as his mother walked off with the boy. He turned to Pickering, who bore a stricken expression as he held on to Jack. \"A school, Pickering?\" \"God damn them.\" \"Eliza was giving out baskets on the east end.\" Henry was beginning to know how Eliza felt, those long and terrible months after Freddy had died. Something inside of him was not quite registering the fact that she could be gone, and yet another terrible part of him was insisting that she was. The war inside of him made his heart feel as though it would hammer clear through his chest, and yet stop entirely. He looked to her son, cranky, and no doubt confused at the long absence of a mother who was usually loathe to part from his side. What the devil would be done about him if his mother was lost? Henry found himself meticulously going over every memory he had of the girl. Most of them were not pleasant, and he was not proud of those moments. He had bullied, and yelled, and pushed, and... They had danced together. Oh yes, there had been that dance at the ball, with hundreds of people watching her, and whispering about her, and she had been so ethereal and elegant, but that was not the dance he recalled. No, this dance had occured in the wee hours of the morning, and had been a jovial celebration of her monumental triumph. There had been no princes, dignitaries, or socialites hovering around them - it had been only the two of them... well, and Pickering, but the man had been too lost in the celebration to take note of their own private moment. The way she had looked at him... He had not taken note of it then, but there had been something more to her dreamy gaze then just mere exhaustion. He so wanted to be able to question her about it now. She still did not come. This could not be the end, surely. He refused to believe that his last words to her had been \"Enjoy being torn limb from limb by starving ruffians\". Impossible. It could not end with that. He may as well have told her that he wished she'd be blown to bits by- Oh, god, there were tears burning at his eyes. He quickly blinked them down into submission, and sighed, eyes towards the east. She was running down the sidewalk, crying for her son, with that damned ancient gardener trailing behind her. \"Jack!\" She ran to Pickering, blind to everyone but the one person who was the still point in her turning world. Her boy. Jack was in her arms in an instant, getting kisses rained all over his face, and hair. Neither Pickering nor Henry dared interfere on their reunion, even though the younger man wanted nothing more than to pull her into an embrace, and then lock her in her room, never to venture out alone again. The violence of that emotion startled him. Author's note: The school referred to by the young boy is, of course, The Upper North Street School in Poplar. On the thirteenth of June 1917, a bomb was dropped on the school killing eighteen. Sixteen of those deaths were children between the ages four to six.[Chapter 15] A Better Man Chapter Fourteen The Space Between Author's Note: Sorry for the delay, my dears! I had a wedding to attend to, and the preparations for it took up some time. Enjoy this chapter, and its tiny hint of lemon zest. He wanted to tell her about the way he felt immediately after she came running down the sidewalk, but he decided to wait and allow her an emotional reunion with her young son. Much later, he intended on working up the courage to broach the subject; alas, his mother, Pickering, and Clara - who had arrived shortly after the raid was over- insisted on hearing Eliza's account of the destruction, and he delayed once more. Apparently many thanks were owed to Burt the gardener, who posessed an uncanny memory for every nook and cranny in London, and had rushed Eliza and a young lady she had been conversing with to safety. Eliza was visibly shaken by the experience, particularly when she shared the news of the Upper North Street School. News of its destruction had spread like wildfire after the raid, and Eliza ran the entire way home after hearing of it, desperate to get to Jack, and to revel in holding him when there were many mothers that would not get to do the same ever again. Henry knew the timing was not right. Several days after - after the memorial for the lost schoolchildren - he contemplated pulling her aside and finally telling her. What better time - after all - when a reminder that life was precious was so needed in their lives? The sight of her mourning garb galled him into silence. He could not in good conscious talk of feelings to a woman who was under order by society to think of nothing but her lost husband. She had become a wave in the great sea of black that had overtaken London, and even though the rituals were nowhere near as rigid as they had been before the war, Eliza was still obligated to fall in line, lest her reputation fall any further into disrepair. Out of consideration, Henry decided that he would drop the subject from his mind entirely. After all, people's minds always tended to get thrown into chaos when a real threat was imminent. All those thoughts of longing to be able to tell her lest he never see her again was pure foolishness borne of panic. Life would go on as it always had, without any further threat to his sacred bachelorhood. It was better this way. 11 November 1918 Eliza awoke, and - as she had been doing since spring of that year - gave a prayer of thanks that she woke in good health - many people her age were not experiencing that luxury. Her sister-in-law was off in the countryside in a convalesance home, recovering from a nearly fatal bout of The Spanish Flu, and Eliza felt her absence keenly. Clara had very much been a comfort to Eliza for nearly five years - she was never dreary or defeated, and refused to let Eliza be either. The poor girl had continued to be a nurse at the start of the first outbreak, and had insisted on staying on, even as the death toll started to rise. Eliza was beginning to believe that Clara was simply made of sterner stuff - that was until she had returned home completely run down, and not in the way that long hours at work runs one down. She immediately sent her house mates away, and phoned Eliza to tell her that she would not be visiting for some time, and urged her not to come to the flat to see her back to health. Fear for Jack was the only thing that made Eliza obey this request. Amazingly, Mrs. Pryce had caught wind that her only surviving child was gravely ill, and had made haste to her side. It had been established that the old generally had nothing to fear of this mysterious plague that preyed primarily on the young and strong. It had been a long time since Eliza had even considered that the old woman posessed a beating heart, and upon learning that she did indeed, and that it still bled for her children - well, Eliza could have been knocked over with a feather. It did not change the fact that Eliza did not care to ever speak with the woman again, and she doubted that Clara would have allowed herself to be nursed back to health by her mother, had she been possessing of enough wits to refuse. The important thing was that Clara would live, and that Jack would still have someone from his father's side of the family to remind him of where he came from. Jack - at two years and nearly two months old - was the very image of his departed father, with delicate traces of Eliza in the dramatic sweep of his thick, dark eyebrows, the generous shape of his lips, and the slight in his black hair. His eyes had done what everyone suspected they would do, and had turned a piercing grey color, fringed with dark, curling lashes. He was very much a beautiful boy, and Eliza hoped that someday he would inherit some of his father's sweetness to match his striking good looks. That day could not come soon enough, Eliza thought to herself, as she struggled to dress her imperious, wriggling toddler. Unfortunately, his disposition matched Professor Higgins's to the letter, which was no surprise. The child idolized Higgins, and had become the man's shadow the moment he learned how to walk. \"Hold still, Jack!\" Eliza scolded softly as she attempted to pull a jumper over his head. \"No!\" Her son cried, before freeing himself from her grasp and running into the corridor. Eliza gave chase, and breathed a sigh of relief when she stepped into the corridor in time to witness Professor Higgins making a deft retrieval of Jack before the boy could reach the stairs. \"Here now - what's all this commotion, and why are you only in your nappies, young man?\" Jack ceased his squirming immediately when he realized who had caught him. \"Mean Mummy!\" He complained to his confidante. Eliza rolled her eyes as Professor Higgins brought her son back to the child's room. \"Is that so; what tortures has she wrought upon you, then?\" \"No jumper!\" Jack pointed a chubby forefinger at the discarded clothing on the floor. \"I think it's a perfectly good jumper, young Jack. I was just thinking of having your mother knit me up one in that very pattern.\" Eliza snorted in a very unladylike manner, but tried to keep herself in check as the professor attempted to reason with her child. Jack appeared to be contemplating Henry's words, although Eliza was sure he had only comprehended 'Good' and 'Jumper'. The toddler widened his eyes, and attempted to stick a thumb into his mouth, but Henry blocked the manuever. \"You do not want to have teeth like your Grandfather Alfred,\" he warned. \"I get dressed, Mummy.\" Jack's announcement was made in a royal sort of tone, as though an entire populace had been awaiting his decision. Eliza smiled at the professor as she took her son from him. She mouthed a 'thank you', and could have sworn the professor had blushed slightly before he turned and left them alone in the room. A noticeable change had come over Professor Higgins in the past few years, Eliza thought. She imagined he was just trying very hard to cope with being stuck in a house with a small child and herself, and being his usual acerbic self had grown tiresome after a while. She supposed that he did not have to pretend to be so attached to her son in order to make life easier, but it was touching to see Jack with a father-figure, even if it would not last. The flat above the flower shop had been vacant for some time, and Eliza planned on re-establishing herself there, once the war was over. It would be insupportable for her to remain under the patronage of Professor Higgins' mother, and unforgivable. Eliza imagined that the professor would be more than happy to have her gone from his life, for him to be able to return to his solitude and his words. Still, the kindness he had bestowed on her son, and the new - gentle? - attitude he had shown her was endearing. It had to be a front, though, and Eliza could not bear the thought of him feeling that he could not be true to himself - even if his true self was a touch unpleasant and cruel at times. It would be better this way. Eliza headed downstairs, with a fully dressed Jack. She would broach the subject of taking up the old flat at some point during the morning, when the opportunity presented itself. The opportunity failed to show at breakfast. Jack was relentlessly talkative, and more than a little disruptive. However, her resolve to branch out on her own was only strengthened by the fact that she was the one of the only people at the table trying to curb Jack's behavior. Mrs. Higgins was ever the indulgent surrogate grandmother and rather encouraging, and Pickering was blissfully ignorant, and reading his newspaper, occasionally making such statements like 'What spirit!' and 'Well, I'll be dashed!'. Professor Higgins successfully managed to give the boy a few stern looks that seemed to work, until Jack took to mimicking him. Soon after, Pickering and Higgins set off for the munitions factory for the day. Eliza decided to try again at the edge of the morning, after she had set Jack down for a nap. Eleanor was sitting in the study, going over accounts. \"Eliza, whatever is the matter, my girl? You look positively forlorn!\" It was true. Eliza knew that Eleanor would be upset when she heard the news, the older woman was so attached to Jack. He was the grandson that her own son would probably never give her. Eliza opened her mouth to speak, but the sound of jubilant cries in the street had filled the room, alarming the two women. \"What on earth?\" Pickering and Henry suddenly burst into the study. Eliza could not recall ever seeing the pair look so jubilant, not since her breakthrough all those years ago, when she had finally spoken correctly. Pickering boldly strode up to Eleanor, helped to astonished woman to her feet, and then pulled her into an embrace, swinging her full circle. \"The armistice has been signed!\" He cried. Professor Higgins looked like he was about to attempt a similiar manuever with Eliza, but stopped short, as though remembering himself. The pair smiled at each other, Eliza's heart hammering in her chest with joy at the news. The war was over. Impulsively, she embraced Professor Higgins, who initially tensed at the unexpected contact. Eliza started to pull away when she thought that the gesture had been unwelcome, her cheeks burning with shame at her forwardness. Astonishingly, he tightened the embrace for a long moment before releasing her. They stood slightly apart, studying each other with the most curious expressions on their faces. Eliza was bewildered at the thoughts racing through her brain, and the warmth that had overcome her entire being. Professor Higgins looked apprehensive, and on the verge of saying something about it. Jack had woken from his nap, brought to consciousness by the commotion in the streets. He cried desperately for his mother, his gran (Eleanor), Pickering, his Aunt Clara or anyone who would listen to his pleas for attention. Eliza turned away from Henry, and exited the room, thanking providence that her son was a light sleeper, and a convenient escape from a moment she did not quite comprehend. The family all decided to venture out of doors, and join the celebration that seemed to escalate with every minute that passed. Jack's eyes lit up at the sight of the marches in the street, at the fireworks, and the noise - his weariness soon started to fade in the face of such jubilation, and disappeared entirely when his Uncle Henry allowed him to sit upon the older man's shoulder. The boy giggled, and clapped, delighting some of the surrounding crowd. Eliza felt a tinge of sadness at the sight. It would have been nice to have Freddy there with them, to celebrate, and to be commended for his service. Surprisingly, the sadness did not linger as it once had. While she did still mourn his loss for the fact that he was her son's father, and far too young to die, it had been a long time since she had yearned for him in that aching way that one yearns for a lost love. Curious, and a bit shameful when she dwelled on the fact. A raven-haired young woman of about twenty-five pushed through the crowd, and Eliza watched as the woman spotted Professor Higgins. A mischevious smirk played across the girl's pretty features, and she walked over to where he stood, pointedly ignoring Eliza. \"'Ere's an 'andsome old thing!\" The girl exclaimed, before standing on her tiptoes, and kissing him full on the mouth for a very long moment. Eliza frowned, and suddenly she felt quite put out at the woman's impertinence. \"Bugger off, dearie, 'e don't want none of you!\" She found herself shouting at the girl. The dark-haired girl gave Eliza a cheeky grin. \"Sorry, love - I guess I got carried away - e's all yours!\" With a flirty wave, she was off to find the next unsuspecting gentlemen. \"Oh, pray don't look so pleased with yourself, Professor - look! - She seems to be getting all that she can out of today.\" Eliza pointed at the woman, who was now in a passionate embrace with a younger, slightly more dashing man. \"Pleased with myself? I beg to differ, Eliza - the woman attacked me!\" Henry protested, secretly pleased with her burst of temper. A part of him hoped that it was jealousy he was witnessing - until he realized that Jack was sitting on his shoulders, and Eliza was more than likely incensed at the scandalous display her son had been forced to witness. Disappointing, but then again, it did not quite explain why she would use such shocking language in front of the boy. Nothing more was said about the incident, and the festivities continued. Eliza refused flute after flute of freely proferred champagne, sticking to her resolve to never touch a drop of alcohol. The others were not so disciplined, and Eliza soon found herself taking Jack back into the house, intent on shielding his young eyes from the revelry, followed by Eleanor who was content with one drink, and then Pickering and Professor Higgins, who were only returning to retrieve a box of very fine cigars in which they planned on sharing. They both acted decades younger than they actually were, laughing and carrying their offerings of smoke and drink outside like university boys on holiday. Eliza shook her head, hoping that they would not feel too terrible in the morning. 12 November 1918 Henry had never felt worse in his life. It had been many a year since he had indulged so heavily, imbibing even more than he had when Eliza had given birth to Jack. He awoke on the leather sofa in the study, his legs dangling over the sides, and a decanter clutched to his chest. Pickering was snoring away in an armchair. Head pounding, eyes bleary, and the world spinning rapidly, Henry pulled himself up, and stumbled out of the study, intent on making it to his own bed - that way he could sleep off this hangover in peace, without the thought of Eliza or his mother towering over him with disapproving looks and shrill remonstrations. Eliza - there was a poser of a problem. How would they proceed now? He had enjoyed their brief embrace on the previous day, feeling that old familiar longing come over him once more. He thought he had successfully repressed those feelings that had come at him like a train, that long ago day when he thought he had lost her in the most permanent way possible - feelings that he had long dismissed as weakness, sneering at the poor bastards that had fallen prey to them in the past. Best not to think about that now, Henry decided. Not now, when he wanted nothing more than to duck his head into the toilet, and then sleep for days. His head barely hit the pillow before he was off to a deep and disturbed sleep. Eliza had followed him. This time she was the pretty, shabbily dressed girl in the crowd, grinning with seductive intent as she pressed her body against his, and teased his lips with her own. \" Here is a handsome old thing ,\" she whispered, deepening the kiss, urging him to open his mouth, and moaning softly as he- Henry woke up with a start, sweat pouring down his brow, and quite unable to breath. He was not allowed to linger long on the dream he had just had before a sneezing fit overcame him. The fit was long, and so violent that it shook him to the core. When it was over, he looked down at his hand, and then gasped, touching the area beneath his nose with his forefinger, and then looking down again. Blood. Henry blindly reached for the rope near his bed, ringing for someone, anyone to come to his aid. He pressed the back of his hand against his forehead, and his fears were confirmed. Influenza.[Chapter 16] A Better Man Chapter Fifteen Come Back and Haunt Me Author's Note: Sorry in advance for the briefness of this chapter! Henry stared at the woman sitting on the sofa in his Wimpole street study. She shivered in her crimson evening cloak, her gloved hands resting in her lap, bawled up into little fists. She would not look at him - her eyes were cast to the floor, glittering with anger. He approached her, drawn in by the elegant curve of her exposed neck, and her dark glossy ringlets, piled high on her head. An errant curl had tumbled free from its' elegant confine, and he reached out a hand - intent on placing the offending lock back into its' proper place. She turned her head so suddenly with a glare so fierce that he snatched his hand away, almost fearing that she would bite it, so vicious were her eyes. \"Can you see me now, 'Enry 'Iggins?\" \"I have always been able to see you perfectly well, Eliza.\" The magnificent creature rose to her full height, diamonds sparkling at her ears and throat, her white gown speckled with stars. \"What do you see?\" She inquired, her voice soft as a velvet glove. \"I am at a loss for words.\" She gave him one of her ironic little half-smiles, gazing up at him from beneath her thick eyelashes with an almost coquettish expression. \"Professor Higgins at a loss for words?\" \"Only when it matters.\" Tears appeared at the corners of her luminous eyes. \"Then I am sad for you.\" With a sigh, she turned and walked out of the room. \"Wait!\" She did not heed his plea, so he gave chase, finding her impossible to catch even though he was running and she was keeping an easy pace. She was going to exit his home, and wander into the fog. Already it crept through the cracks in the front door, curling and billowing about, and when Eliza opened the door, it consumed her entirely, leaving nothing behind. Henry could do nothing but stand in the entryway, paralyzed with fear of the harshness outside, calling out her name until his voice grew so hoarse that he had to cease. Eleanor Higgins pressed a cold cloth against her son's burning forehead, and whispered soothing words in order to quiet his delirious cries. \"Henry - hush, my love. Mother is here.\" Her son thrashed about weakly, still whispering for Eliza in a helpless tone that caused his mother's heart to shatter. \"Eliza is not here, Henry - I had to send her away.\" Henry furrowed his brow, and opened his eyes just a fraction. \"Why?\" \"You are ill, love - I did not want her to get ill as well... or her son.\" He gasped, and then was overcome with a violent coughing fit. Eleanor acted quickly to get him turned on his side, so that he could expell the sickness without choking himself. \"I... have a son?\" He asked, once the fit had passed and his was resting on his back once more. Eleanor did not know how much more she could take. \"No, darling - Eliza's son is Freddy's boy.\" \"Marry Freddy...\" Even in his weakened state, his disgust was apparent. \"Heartless...\" \"Oh, my sweet boy.\" \"Bring her back?\" Eleanor felt the tears threaten to spill as she was faced with the proof that her son was in love with Eliza, and had been for some time. \"I cannot. This flu is particularly nasty to young people, Henry - do you want Eliza to die?\" Henry whimpered, and Eleanor realized that she ought not have been so blunt. \"She will return when you are well. I sent her to Wimpole Street in order to meet with Mrs. Pearce and help with hiring on new staff at your home.\" Henry smiled, and closed his eyes. \"That is good.\" Eleanor nodded, and wiped the tears from her eyes. She fervently prayed that her son would be able to return to his home in good health, and maybe... Well, it was not her place to reveal to Eliza what had transpired here, obviously. Hopefully, Henry would have the good sense to propose to the girl. Eleanor bite her bottom lip, apprehensively. If Henry pulled through, there was a good chance he would not remember a single thing - even if these were his private, innermost thoughts. Still... she could not reveal anything. She could prod things along, however... If only he would live. His fever was spiking dramatically, and it had become far too dangerous to move him to hospital. The family doctor had yet to show, being busy with other housecalls due to this new wave of illness. Eleanor still remembered Eliza's stricken face when she had been informed of Henry falling ill. \"He's just had too much too drink, Mrs. Higgins!\" The girl had tried to reason, unable to accept that her mentor was most likely at Death's door. Eliza had initially refused to leave the house, wanting to stay and utilize her nursing experience. Eleanor had refused her help emphatically. They could not risk Jack becoming an orphan, it would be too tragic. Henry, despite his delirious demands for Eliza's presence, would not want her there had he the mental faculties to process the risk - therefore, Eliza, Jack and Colonel Pickering were sent away to open up the house on Wimpole street. Eleanor had hoped the task would distract Eliza; however, the girl had been calling relentlessly, inquiring after Henry's condition, sounding as though she would shatter everytime Eleanor gave her a grave report. Surely Henry's regard was reciprocated - it was not a completely unrealistic thought. Eliza had been a widow for over two years, and had been a part of Henry's world for longer than that. The timing was right - Eleanor determined - and the match was a fine one. She could not think of a couple that knew each better than her Henry and Eliza, and - what was more - she could not think of a single woman who would tolerate her son the way Eliza did. \"You must live for Eliza's sake, dearest.\" \"Professor?\" A feminine voice caressed his ears, and he turned in time to see her standing before him in wedding finery. They standing in the front of a church, every inch of the interior covered with a thick layer of dust, and empty except for the two of them. \"Are you marrying Freddy?\" She smiled. \"I already did... do you not remember?\" \"Then what are we doing here, pray?\" \"That is precisely what I am doing for you.\" \"In a wedding gown?\" Eliza gave a short laugh. \"This is how you wanted me to appear.\" \"Ridiculous. I am a con-\" \"'Confirmed old bachelor', yes, I know.\" \"So, why would I want you to appear thusly?\" Eliza responded by pressing her lips against his own, in a brief, chaste caress. It was like being touched by a butterfly. \"That is something I cannot answer for you, Professor.\" She turned away from him, intent on leaving once more. \"Please do not do that again!\" He cried. She turned back, astonished. \"Kiss you?\" \"No- leave.\" \"You know where to find me, Professor. I will be waiting.\" She was gone, once more. Two days after Henry had fallen ill, Eliza eyed the telephone - distractedly - as Mrs. Pearce fussed over Jack while sitting on the sofa in Henry's study. The older woman had managed to be a nurse in a field hospital during the war, but was only too happy to return to Wimpole street, where she had been employed since Professor Higgins had branched out on his own as a young man. The sight of a small child in the professor's decidedly bachelor abode was astonishing, and quite welcoming. Truth be told, it was a sight Mrs. Pearce confessed to never dreaming to see. \"It is only temporary, Mrs. Pearce. I will stay long enough to help Professor Higgins re-establish his household, and then I will return to the flat above my shop.\" \"Oh, do not be silly, I am sure the professor would love to have you stay on. He can scarcely find North without your guidance.\" The last bit was added in a low, secretive voice. Eliza smiled weakly, and then looked to the telephone once more. The older woman clucked sympathetically. \"Professor Higgins posesses a fine constitution. I am sure he will be back to his old self in no time at all.\" \"I wish I could be there to help.\" \"Well, I do not! Good heavens, girl - that sickness could fell you in an instant, and then where would we all be?\" \"I imagine you are right.\" \"And I won't have anymore nonsense about you living in that shabby little flat, either.\" Eliza glared. \"I daresay I will live where I like.\" Mrs. Pearce stood up, with Jack still in her arms. \"I daresay you will, girl.\" \"Jack seems to find no shortage of doting admirers,\" Eliza remarked, changing the subject. Mrs. Pearce beamed at the remark, and kissed the boy in question on the cheek. \"He is as fine a boy as one could ever wish for, Eliza. You must be quite proud.\" \"Terribly, even if he can be a perfect beast - he seems to be putting on his Sunday manners for you, though.\" \"I simply know how to deal with difficult youngsters. I was the oldest child in a family of eight, and then only girl.\" Eliza's eyes widened. \"Perhaps I should hire you on as Jack's nanny and let him find a new housekeeper.\" \"The professor would never forgive such a thing, if you did!\" Mrs. Pearce replied, laughing at the absurdity of it. The phone rang. Eliza sprang from the sofa and had the receiver to her ear within moments. There was a long terrible silence, in which Eliza just listened to the person at the other end. Finally, she hung up, and looked to Mrs. Pearce, tears shining in her eyes. \"His fever broke.\"[Chapter 17] A Better Man Chapter Sixteen Possession The last thing Henry remembered before waking up had been dragging himself to bed, hung over - so it was very shocking when his eyes came in to focus, only to behold the tired and stricken face of his mother. \"Really, Mother - you needn't faun over me, I just had too many spirits.\" His skin fairly crawled with discomfort when she began to weep. Henry had never done well with hysterical women - either he could not come up with a single word of comfort, or his attempts failed disasterously. \"You have been unconscious for nearly three days, Henry - I thought you were going to die!\" \"Die?\" He suddenly recalled the blood and his fevered brow. \"Was I very ill?\" He suddenly wanted very much to sit up and take his mother into his arms to comfort her, but the effort seemed as though it would be supremely monumental - he barely had strength enough to move a hand to cover hers and squeeze. Eleanor nodded. \"We were preparing for the won't remember, but I had Eliza, Colonel Pickering, and Jack sent away to Wimpole Street - Eliza is re-establishing your household.' \"She is not...\" Henry's voice trailed off; it was hard to even think about Eliza being ill, let alone put it into words. The idea that this merciless strain of influenza only seemed to kill off the young and healthy had kept Henry in constant fear for his young friend's life. \"'Eliza is very well - as are Colonel Pickering and Jack.\" Henry sighed in relief. \"That is a mercy.\" He looked around the room, and then at his mother. \"Well, I think I have lazed about long enough; I should like to go home.\" Eleanor frowned. \"You will have to 'laze about' a bit longer, my dear boy. You are far too weak to be moved just yet.\" \"Come now, Mother, I very much would like to see-\" \"-Eliza?\" Eleanor suggested, more than a bit mischeviously. \"My house. I need to ensure that the girl isn't making a complete botch out of hiring servants.\" Eleanor let a brief look of disappointment pass over her features for a moment. \"You needn't, Henry; Eliza has Mrs. Pearce to help her with the particulars.\" \"Oh- has she? Well, that's a comfort, I suppose. Mrs. Pearce is damned fine housekeeper.\" Eleanor suppressed the urge to throw breakable objects at her recovering son, and smiled, nodding in agreement. \"Tell Eliza that she may pick any room she likes for Jack. I daresay she can even fashion a nursery if she pleases - the house is certainly large enough,\" Henry added, magnanimously, and then frowned when his mother gasped. \"What on earth is the matter with that?\" \"Henry - Eliza couldn't possibly live with you.\" Her son's face suddenly took on a look that had signified a tempest ever since he was a small child. Eleanor steeled herself, and prepared for battle against his furrowed brow, and the firm set in his jaw. \"Why not?\" \"My dear, it simply is not done!\" \"She lived with me before and no one said 'boo' about it.' Eleanor sighed impatiently. \"She was your pupil then, Henry. Eliza needs to have some sort of proper reason to live in your house in order for people not to talk... which they already do.\" \"Hang those gossips - the world has changed, Mother.\" \"Not really, my boy. People are clamoring for a return to a normal sort of existence, and that includes looking down their noses at a situation that strikes them as unsavory.\" Henry merely shrugged, and settled back against his pillows. \"It just so happens that I do have a proper reason for Eliza to stay.\" Eleanor's eyes widened, and she was unable to supress a curious little smile. \"Oh?\" \"Well, I shan't reveal it now. The matter requires a good amount of thought, and I'm devilishly sleepy.\" Eleanor stood up, now grinning from ear to ear. \"Oh, Henry!\" \"Mother, please.\" Henry gave a tremendous yawn and closed his eyes, ending discussion on the subject. Eliza scribbled away at the ledgers, finding herself to be oddly comfortable at Henry's desk, in his chair. Jack was toddling about, tailed by Mrs. Pearce and her granddaughter, Rosemary - a comely girl of sixteen whom Eliza had taken on as Jack's nanny-in-training and a part-time personal assistant. \"Professor Higgins will simply have to do with a smaller staff until more people are well again,\" Eliza announced, frowning at the small pile of letters to her right. Not many answers to her inquiry, and even fewer that qualified. Getting Mrs. Pearce back had been a godsend, and at least she had managed to find a suitable butler and cook. \"I daresay we can manage; so long as Professor Higgins is fed and can keep track of his appointments, he will be content.\" \"Do you suppose I ought to inquire about a secretary?\" Mrs. Pearce scooped Jack into her arms, and handed him off to Rosemary, who carried him out of the room intent on settling him down for a nap. \"My dear, isn't that what you are?\" Eliza chuckled. \"I am afraid I can't juggle the flower shop and fetching Professor Higgin's slippers. You do not mind my taking Rosemary on as an assistant, do you, Mrs. Pearce?\" \"Heavens no! That silly little thing will have to learn how to earn her keep somewhere. Do not be too soft on her - Eliza - or she'll walk all over you.' \"Oh, somehow I doubt that. She's a sweet sort of girl, and is in more danger of my son walking all over her.\" \"He is a bit of a handful.\" \"Professor Higgins' influence, I am afraid,\" Eliza replied with an exasperated sigh. \"Oh?\" Mrs. Pearce's curious look told Eliza that the idea of Professor Higgins paying attention to a child enough to mold one's personality was shocking. \"Yes, Jack is practically his little shadow it seems, and the Professor is amazingly tolerant.\" Eliza chuckled softly and added, 'He must be mellowing out in his old age.\" The two women's shared laughter was interrupted by a cough coming from the entrance to the study. They turned in unison, and Eliza colored deeply when she beheld Professor Higgins. He was a little worn about the face, but still appeared in remarkable health, one eyebrow raised quizzically. \"Old, am I?\" His tone was light, but Eliza detected a bit of hurt in his voice, and from the way he proudly tilted his chin. \"Professor, you look very...\" Eliza trailed off, at a loss for words when the realization that he was alive and well finally hit her. \"Decrepit? Ancient?\" \"Well - you look very well.\" Henry felt himself grow warm at the sight of her breathtaking smile. He cleared his throat, and decided to get at the task at hand. \"Oh - well, thank you, Eliza. Mrs. Pearce - would you mind terribly if I asked you to go away for a moment? I have a matter to discuss with Eliza.\" The older woman's face went from puzzlement to giddy comprehension in seconds, and she left the room hurriedly, and with a distinct blush. \"Confounded women - why are they all acting so bizarre today? No matter.\" Henry pulled a chair up next to Eliza and sat down, their knees close enough to nearly touch. Eliza unconsciously tilted hers slightly to one side, as though to give a bit more distance between the two of them. \"Eliza, I should like for you and Jack to move in to Wimpole street.\" Eliza blinked, and opened her mouth to begin a reply, found herself unable to find proper words and promptly closed it once more. \"You are at loss for words.\" \"Obviously.\" \"Why?\" Eliza gave him her most patient-yet-bewildered smile, and shook her head. \"How would that be proper?\" Henry studied his fingernails for a moment; after finding them to be slightly stained with ink, and a bit unkempt in general, he meet Eliza's inquisitive gaze. \"How? Well, the most logical way possible, Eliza.\" Eliza's heart began to pound, and for a moment she forgot how to breath. She tried not to look too coy as she bit her lower lip, and her hands trembled in her lap. It occured to her that it was the most logical way; after all, such a thing would be accepted without question. She had mourned Freddy, and society had since eased up on the acceptable length of said mourning for the women of England... perhaps even the world. She was unable to suppress a shuddering sigh, nor push back the tears that threatened to fall. She wanted this - him - with a violence that tore through her entire being... perhaps she had for some time. How blind she had been to realize that he may have wanted it too! \"Henry...\" The name wavered unsteadily on her lips before she breathed it out into the world like a song. \"Pardon?\" The slightly panicked tone in his voice brought Eliza crashing back to earth. \"Is it... it it not proper that I use your given name in such a circumstance?\" \"Why in heaven's name would you do that? I am sure you have heard Mrs. Pearce call me 'Sir'. I would never ask you to be that formal- of course - 'Professor Higgins' has always been more than appropriate.\" \"Oh.\" Eliza had never felt more humiliated in her life, and found herself inwardly praying that the world and all of its inhabitants would disappear in a wisp of smoke, leaving her to be alone with her shame. \"You could stay on as a secretary of sorts, Eliza. You know how dreadful I am at keeping track of appointments, and all other manner of things. It is actually a bit humbling - admitting to all that- but surely it tells you how desperately I need to have you about.\" Years of fetching slippers, organizing mountains of paperwork, putting up with tempers, and soothing said tempers with tea made just-so stretched out before her, and she finally came to the realization that if she were to find a life of fulfillment tempered with mutual admiration, she was woefully misguided if she thought she would be able to find it here. \"I cannot.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I am afraid I cannot stay on at Wimpole Street, Professor Higgins.\" Henry sat back in his seat so suddenly that it almost appeared an act of violence. \"What do you mean 'you cannot'?\" \"Pray don't be thick - Professor - you know exactly what it means. Thank you, ever so much for the offer to become your servant -\" \"Secretary!\" \"- but I've a business of my own that needs my attention once more, and that business has a perfectly suitable flat above it -\" \"-The idea of my godson in that wretched little hole in the wall -\" \" - and Jack and I will be moving our things to that residence within the fortnight.\" \"Oh, will you now?\" Eliza jumped from her seat, and stood straight as a ramrod, vehement pride seething from every pore. \"Absolutely I will. I do not like your tone, Professor Higgins - it strongly insinuates that you feel well within your right to stop me, and you should not.\" Henry stood then, towering over Eliza, and standing ever-so-close. His eyes were dark. \"I suppose I cannot - Eliza - but what I can do is make my displeasure at the idea known; I think you are a prideful, stubborn fool - something that I think will not help you, or your child at all. Clinging on to this conceited sort of independence will not put Jack in a good school, or even keep him fed -\" He got no further before the resounding crack of her palm against his cheek filled the room. They both stared at each other when it was over; Henry's eyes blank as he placed a hand on his stinging cheek, and Eliza's eyes wild with anger, her nostrils flaring slighlty and her lips pressed together in a painfully thin line. Her ragged breathing filled the air, as did his oddly even inhaling and exhaling. Wordlessly, Eliza breezed out of his study, and he vaguely heard her voice in the next room over, shakily requesting that her son be retrieved from his nap. A few minutes later, the gentle 'click' of the door closing heralded Eliza fleeing from Henry's life once more. This time he could not bring himself to turn on the phonograph.[Chapter 18] A Better Man Chapter Seventeen Growning Up September 1921 Jack Eynsford-Hill blew out the candles of his birthday cake, feeling a rush of pride when the grown-ups cheered him on from the parlour of his Gran's house. He magnanimously allowed his mother, his Gran, his Aunt Clara, Rosemary, and Mrs. Pearce to bestow kisses on his cheek, and felt quite grown up when Grandfather Pickering and Uncle Henry gave him a congratulatory clap on the back. Jack knew quite a few things for certain at his vast age of five years; His mother was the most beautiful woman on earth, although his Aunt Clara wore the prettier clothes, had the most interesting hair, and was certainly the nicest. His mother sometimes got cross, and Aunt Clara never did. In fact, his mother had gotten very cross when she came upstairs from the shop one night to find Aunt Clara, Aunt Clara's beau, and Jack painting a landscape on the southern most wall in his mother's drawing room. Another thing that Jack knew for certain, was that his Uncle Henry and his mother did not get on. It caused immense sadness in him, because they were both his most favorite people in the entire world. Uncle Henry was so smart, and was always trying to explain great complicated things to Jack which he could not comprehend, but thought it made his uncle look very grand indeed. He also allowed Mrs. Pearce to give Jack sweets whenever the boy requested it. His mother did not seem to think Uncle Henry was so grand. When Jack would come home with reports of his afternoon with his uncle, his mother would roll her eyes, particularly when Jack relayed a chestnut of wisdom that Uncle Henry had bestowed upon him. When Jack would use language and just generally emulate his uncle's behavior, his mother would berate him soundly. She told him that Uncle Henry was a fool, and to not take the old goat so seriously. Jack did not like it when his mother called Uncle Henry names, or when she would act coolly to him when they were all together in the same room. Uncle Henry never seemed to answer back to her - though - and Jack often wondered at the sad expression he often saw on his uncle's face when his mother was present. She did not seem to notice his sadness, and Jack was not sure if she would care. It was most distressing. The generous pile of presents pulled Jack from his train of thought, and for the next ten minutes all he knew was bright wrapping paper, and childhood delight. Henry found himself watching Eliza, as she beamed at her son with unguarded delight shining in her face. It was rare that he got to witness such a treat, and it was certainly never directed at himself. The gulf that had opened between them that fateful day after his recovery stretched for what seemed to be thousands of miles. He had been too mortified to pursue her in order to apologize. His mother had shown up at his doorstep mere hours later, unable to suppress her fury at Henry. \"What have you done?\" \"Mother...\" Henry trailed off, galled into silence by the the irrate woman as she sat down on the sofa in his drawing room, seething with anger. \"You've made a botch of things with Eliza, as usual, and I demand to know what happened!\" Henry walked across the room so that he towered over where his mother sat, glowering down at her. \"What has that baggage told you?\" \"She told me nothing, Henry! She returned to my house fighting tears, and immediately packed her bags, and arranged for the rest of her things to be sent to her flat. Now, I was under the impression that you were going to propose marriage to Eliza-\" \"What?\" \"Do not say 'What?' - Henry - say 'Pardon'.\" \"I will say what I jolly well like, I am a grown man after all!\" \"Evidently not when it comes to her; Henry, does everyone know that you are in love with her but you?\" Henry was speechless. His heart lurched painfully in his chest, filled with a fear he had not experienced for decades, the last time being when he had been sent home from school for fighting when he was ten years old; a fear specific to when one knows one is caught. \"I asked her to by my secretary. It did not go well.\" \"'Secretary'? That was your plan to keep her?\" Henry did not answer. There had been moments when he had entertained the thought of solving the problem of Eliza with marriage. He thought on that the time before, when he thought her dead, and wanting nothing more than to express his wild joy when she wasn't by pulling her into his arms and kissing her, or by demanding to hear his given name on his lips. He had long given up on the hope that such a thing would happen... Good god, she had called him 'Henry'. The realization that he had had all before him, and that he had been completely blind to it staggered him. Surprisingly, Eliza did not cut herself off from the Higgins' household, and had begun to visit Eleanor mere weeks after her flight. Henry was allowed to be present for those visits, although it took him a long time to actually bring himself to show up. The acute pain of missing both Jack and Eliza drove him to finally lose his resolve to avoid them. A chilly Eliza was better than no Eliza at all, and Jack's regard never seemed to waver. They had gone on in this fashion for nearly three years, and the loss seemed to never lessen for Henry. If he had been a sentimental sort, he would have confessed to be 'dying of love' for her - alas, he was not as such, and could only profess to 'miss her greatly'. He was devilishly happy that she had not yet joined the short hair club, as Clara had done. Most people found Clara's sleek black bob to be chic, but Henry only imagined that her exposed neck must grow very cold in the winter. He recalled overhearing Clara inquire as to why Eliza would not cut her hair, and the woman had replied that she was getting far too old to be a 'bright young thing'. He certainly hoped not. It was hard to imagine hard-working, painfully prim Eliza with that set; drinking until dawn and drunkenly roaming the streets on youthful treasure hunts. She had not thrown herself into the new world as Clara had - instead she focused on her small enterprise, and her son. Henry commended her for refraining from such silliness... privately, and never directly to her, of course. Eliza caught him staring, and his face flushed with shame as he directed his gaze to the floor. If he were to let down his guard and humble himself before her, she would surely laugh in his face. He knew he had killed any regard she held for him, and the mere fact that there had been something on her part, and that he had overlooked it entirely, caused him no end of pain. He suddenly wished that he could excuse himself from the party and return home, where he would bury himself in his work and forget about the little guttersnipe that got away. Eliza had felt his gaze, and turned to meet it, curious if she had some sort of flaw that was offending him. For a moment, she observed his unguarded gaze. He seemed to be off in another time and place. Surely he was too young for senility! Finally, he noticed her noticing him, and she wondered at his red cheeks, and humiliated look. \"Thank you very much for the book, Uncle Henry!\" Jack's voice chimed in, holding up a copy of Alexander Meville Bell's Sounds and Their Relations . Eliza wrinkled her nose at the book, thinking it far too advanced for a child still in infant school. Still, Jack was thrilled with any offering from the professor, and Eliza found herself grateful for his presence in her son's life, despite everything that had gone wrong between the two of them. \"You are very welcome, Young Jack.\" \"What a dry sort of gift, Higgins! Don't you know little boys want train sets, not phonetics books?\" Pickering inquired, waving a hand at still-packaged model train set he had purchased for the boy. \"I like trains and learning, Granddad,\" Jack replied gravely. Eliza smiled fondly, pleased that her son had matured into a thoughtful young man, mindful of the feelings of others. There were times when he was so much like his father, that Eliza would have to excuse herself from his presence in order to weep silently, and alone. \"You show very good sense, my boy,\"Pickering complimented. The party died down shortly after dinner, and Eliza took a sleepy Jack back to the flat. On the way there, she wondered that no other children from school had come to the party. It seemed strange. \"It is a shame none of your friends were able to attend, darling.\" Jack did not answer as they walked hand-in-hand, and the implication weighed in heavily. Eliza feared that the old rumours had followed her son into the schoolyard, and he was being ostracized for it. While her flower shop was figuratively blossoming, she could sense the judgement in each and every one of her patrons of the middle class persuasion. \"I am so sorry, my love. Perhaps next year -\" \"I did not give out the invitations - I chucked them in the dustbin,\" Jack confessed. \"Whatever for?\" \"I don't want any of them at my party. They said horrid things about you, Mum.\" \"Even Piers Stone?\" \"He's a dullard.\" No more was said on the subject of Jack's show of loyalty.[Chapter 19] A Better Man Chapter Eighteen: Buy a Flower? \"Darling, those buttonholes are lovely - but I think they are just a little too large, don't you?\" Eliza inquired of Jack, silently thanking providence for being blessed with such an industrious child. \"They are for large men, Mummy.\" Eliza's eyebrows shot up nearly to her hairline, as she choked out an astonished, \"Oh?\". Jack nodded, and then sighed impatiently when she offered no other reply. \"They won't feel so fat if the buttonholes are a little bigger.\" Eliza bit her lip to keep from laughing out loud. Jack was being quite serious, and she did not want to bruise his sensitive feelings. \"How wonderful, my love! Just make sure to make a few smaller ones for the not-so-large men.\" \"Yes, Mummy.\" \"Mrs. Hill?\" Eliza turned her attention away from Jack's workspace to one of her regular customers. He was a slim and tall young man of about twenty-five - rare nowadays - with a shock of white-blond hair, fair skin, and brilliant green eyes. He walked with a slight limp, wearing gloves at all times. Eliza supposed that it was in effort to cover chemical burns, as his complexion was slightly marred by tell-tale pock-marks. \"How do you do, Mr. Elton?\" She greeted warmly. He frequented the shop quite often- moreso than most, actually - and her heart went out to him, for she was sure he was in ardent pursuit of a ladylove. She had quite forgotten what it was like to be courted, but it was quite nice to live vicariously through the various swains who cluelessly wandered into her shop, asking for advice on the best bouquets, or corsages. It seemed most of her customers were male, come to think of it. Odd, considering how the woman vastly outnumbered them. \"Oh, f-fine, M-mrs. H-hill,\" Mr. Elton stammered. Eliza's smiled sadly. It could not be easy, wooing someone when words were so painful to formulate. \"How may I help you, today?\" \"I, nuh-need a c-corsage - or-orchids... \" He struggled over a mighty plosive before managing to specify that the bloom should be pink. \"Of course, Mr. Elton - one moment, please.\" Eliza went to the workspace, working diligently on the request. The hairs on the back of her neck prickled and stood on end; she threw a glance over her shoulder to discover Mr. Elton, staring intently at her as she worked. She suddenly felt extremely self-conscious. She finished, hurriedly, and took the corsage to the front of the store, where Mr. Elton stood. \"Here you are, Mr. Elton.\" The transaction was made, but the young man continued to stand in front of the counter. \"Mr. Elton?\" It happened so fast that Eliza scarcely had time to react. The young man leaned forward, and with a sharp stab of pain on the left side of her chest, Eliza realized that the boy had pinned to corsage to her blouse. She yelped in pain, which made Mr. Elton jump back, startled and red-faced. \"What on earth?\" Eliza cried, unsticking the corsage from her person and dropping it onto the counter as though it were some sort of pest or vermin. \"F-f-forgive...\" Mr. Elton trailed off, unable to continue. He fled the store, shamefaced, nearly bowling over Clara in the process as she entered. \"There's an odd duck,\" Clara remarked, nearly unruffled by the incident. She grinned at Eliza, and waved at Jack, who had been too intent on his project to notice the whole thing. \"Was that one of your suitors, Eliza?\" Eliza's jaw dropped. \"My suitors?\" \"Oh, yes. You know - one of those boys that only buy flowers from here in order to be near you?\" Now Eliza was blushing. \"That is so untrue, Clara!\" Clara shrugged as she bent over to kiss the top of Jack's dark head. \"I know more people than you, darling, and the men of my acquaintance are always so curious about my 'damned lovely widow of a sister-in-law'. I tell them that you are quite content to have nothing to do with them, whatsover, but they still insist on queuing up.\" \"Who said I wanted nothing to do with them?\" Eliza inquired, feeling a stab of annoyance. \"Oh, no one, darling. I am just trying to give that handsome, older professor a sporting chance. I can tell them that you've thrown off your weeds for good, if you like.\" \"Handsome, older professor?\" Clara nodded. \"That repressed old goat is absolutely dying of love for you, didn't you know?\" The cheeky flapper plucked a red rose from one of the displays, and tucked it behind her ear. \"Doesn't your Auntie look pretty, Jack?\" The young boy nodded with a shy smile. \"Clara, do not change the subject; everyone knows that Professor Higgins only puts up with me because he is fond of Jack.\" \"Uncle Henry likes you, Mummy - he is always looking at you,\" Jack chimed in. Eliza frowned at her son and her sister-in-law; clearly, they were both touched in the head. She remembered that horrible day when she thought he may have felt something... but she had been dead wrong. She would never let her mind wander in that direction ever again. \"That is just wishful thinking on your part, Jack.\" \"What, Mummy?\" \"You would like to be able to be around Uncle Henry all of the time, so you imagine he wants to marry me.\" Jack's eyes lit up. \"Could he? I would like to live in Uncle Henry's house very much - he has a library.\" \"Oh, yes, Eliza - a little library is always very nice!\" Clara added, smirking at her sister-in-law's obvious irritation. \"I am very sorry -Jack - but I do not think that matrimony is very appealing to Uncle Henry. Clara - I've got my hands full raising one little boy, I do not need another.\" Jack frowned, obviously not comprehending his mother's last statement. Clara only rolled her eyes, and waved a dismissive hand at Eliza. \"You know what is best for you - dear sister - I am sure.\" The ringing of a tiny bell heralded that another customer had arrived. Eliza's jaw nearly dropped to the floor when her eyes beheld Professor Higgins. He had never stepped foot in her shop since... ever. \"Speak of the devil!\" Clara announced. Jack immediately ran to the older man, bearing a buttonhole (small) as a gift. Professor Higgins took the proffered present, and ruffled the boy's hair. \"I thought I felt my ears ringing - hullo, Miss Hill, always a pleasure to see your shining face before noon - now what on earth would you all be talking about?\" \"Mummy said you would not like- \" \"What brings you here, Professor Higgins?\" Eliza interrupted her son. There was a time and a place for childlike honesty, this was not one of those times. \"Well, none of the servants can be arsed - pardon me, Jack - there is no one at Mother's house who is readily available drop of these arrangment specifications for her birthday party tomorrow.\" Professor Higgins thrust out his right hand, in which a piece of paper was clutched. Eliza took it, read the instructions, and smiled. \"Oh, this is fairly simple - yes, I believe I can just arrive to the party early, and have them brought myself.\" \"Well, that is good.\" Henry took a quick glance around the shop. It was not much more than four very sturdy walls, but the flora and fauna made it bright and cheery. \"You've done very well for yourself, Eliza,\" he found himself saying. Eliza felt pleased, despite herself. \"Thank you, Professor Higgins.\" He looked to Jack, who was back at the worktable. \"Boy, what are you doing out of school, and where is that little ninny that shadows you?\" \"It's a half day, Uncle Henry - and Rosie is ill.\" \"I don't suppose you would like to go to the Zoo?\" Jack's eyes glowed with promise, and he turned to Eliza. \"Mummy, may I?\" \"Of course, darling. Thank you so very much for helping out an old woman with her flowers.\" Jack giggled. \"Mummy, you are not old!\" He ran over to Professor Higgins's side, and took the man's hand. The two were about to head off, when another man entered the store. This one was older than Mr. Elton, maybe slightly younger than Professor Higgins, if the wings of white in his dark hair were any indicator. He was definitely more debonair, and took great pains to always be perfectly turned out every time he appeared in Eliza's shop. His dark eyes glittered with purpose, and a tight smile graced his full lips when he spotted Eliza. \"Mrs. Hill, how well you look,\" he greeted in a deep, smooth voice. Professor Higgins visibly scowled, as did Jack. \"And what of your stepsister?\" Clara inquired. The visitor was Mr. Linton Pryce, eldest son of Clara's mother's now deceased second husband. He was independent (and old) enough to have been detached from the scandal that Eliza had supposedly incurred by marrying his stepmother's only son. Clara intrigued him - as far as stepsister's went - so the two of them maintained correspondence, and he had helped her out of a few financial scraps over the years. He had also tried to encourage Clara to patch things up with her mother - who had mellowed considerably, in his opinion - but to no avail. She refused to reconcile unless Mrs. Pryce also mended her relationship with Eliza. \"You always look smashing, Clara - however- Mrs. Hill always managed to do so without the slightest adornment.\" Eliza blushed, and was suddenly conscious of the dark look on Professor Higgins's face. \"Mr. Pryce, what can I do for you today?\" \"Nothing of the floral nature, I assure you. I was rather hoping you would accompany me to the opera tomorrow evening.\" Eliza was stunned into silence, and remained so until the loud 'bang!' of the front door brought her back. Henry and Jack were gone; Mr. Pryce and Clara were waiting patiently for a response. \"T-that is very kind - Mr. Pryce - but I am afraid that I am engaged elsewhere; a birthday dinner for a very dear friend.\" \"You could not throw them over this once?\" Eliza bristled. \"Certainly not.\" \"Another time then?\" \"Perhaps, Mr. Pryce.\" Shortly after her refusal, he left the shop. \"Someone is quite popular,\" Clara announced in a sing-song voice. \"Hush.\" \"What will you be wearing to Mrs. Higgins's birthday? You know it has to be quite stunning, in order to show that jealous professor what he is missing.\" \"I am afraid I am short on 'stunning', but have more 'serviceable' clothes than I can manage.\" Clara clapped her hands together. \"Brilliant! Close up the shop a little early, and we will go to SoHo!\" \"SoHo?\" Disgust was plain on Eliza's face. \"Oh, you prude! You must know that the best, and cheapest dresses are in SoHo.\" Eliza relented, but with a twinge of regret. Even in her flowergirl days, she had tried to stay away from the sin-soaked streets of that neighborhood, just as her Sunday School teacher had told her to. Clara really was the dizzy limit. Eulalie Pryce sat on a park bench, and watched as her deceased husband's grandchildren played. They were a horrible lot - whinging, screeching creatures with the manners of field hands. Not like her own children had been... well, Clara had always been a bit of a strange creature, but Freddy... She missed her sweet, thoughtful boy. Eulalie reckoned that volunteering to spend more time with the grandchildren would ease the persistent sting in her heart, but it caused her to do nothing but compare. With one child dead, and the other not on speaking terms, Eulalie was terribly lonely. \"Uncle Henry, did you see the size of that Black Bear?\" The sweet, chirping sound of a child in the distance caused Eulalie's ears to perk, and she turned towards the noise. Her heart nearly stopped in her chest when her vision was filled with the sight of the sensitive features of her deceased Freddy. There were a few marked differences, but once she beheld the boy's eyes, she did not notice those. She immediately recognized the boy's chaperone as Professor Henry Higgins, son of her former best friend. That meant... Without thinking, she rose to her feet, and walked towards the pair. The professor noticed her, and stepped in front of the boy in a protective stance. \"How do you do, Professor Higgins?\" Eulalie inquired of the cautious man. \"Mrs. Pryce.\" \"Who is it, Uncle Henry? I can't see!\" The boy stepped out from behind the professor, and scrutinized the old woman before him. \"My name is Frederick John Eynsford-Hill, ma'am - what is yours?\" The child gave a little bow, and Eulalie burst into tears, much her observers' mutual mortification. \"Come along, Jack.\" The pair left Eulalie to weep alone.[Chapter 20] A Better Man Chapter Twenty A Party \"Absolutely not; I won't be seen in public in that .\" Eyebrows shot up at Eliza's horrified comment, most notably the eclectic little designer whose shop Clara had taken the prudish woman too. All four foot and eleven inches of Elsie Hannon trembled with indignation. She may not have had a shop in a more chic district, but her patrons rarely reacted to her creations with such disgust. \"Elsie, darling - Eliza simply means that the hem is far too high for her.\" Clara explained, adding, \"She's nearly thirty,\" in a conspiratorial whisper that earned a sharp look from Eliza. \"Hems are getting higher, Clara - It is simply the way things are!\" Elsie explained, still irritated. The gown was quite lovely, even Eliza could not argue with that. The underslip was made of a soft, silk-like fabric, and gold in hue, falling to about mid-calf. Over the slip was a see-through gown of black lace, embroidered in a floral pattern, with hints of metallic gold within the petals of the flowers. The neckline of the gown was boatnecked, which lent modesty to the plunging neckline of the underslip, and the sleeves were capped, leaving the arms bare, but for the black silk opera-length gloves that Elsie offered with the gown. The hem of the gown was uneven, the front falling just slightly below the hem of the slip, and the back nearly skimming the ankles. It was not the hem that caused concern for Eliza - no, she was almost sold on the creation until she chanced a look at the back. It was open straight down to the point where one's waist was at its' narrowest, right before the natural flare of ones' hips, where it was belted. The underslip had been modified to suit the cut of the gown, and the only thing Eliza could discern that held the top in place - besides the tiny, insubstantial sleeves- was a thin chain of gold running from one shoulder the the other. \"What ever would I wear underneath it?\" Eliza inquired. Clara and Elsie's smothered giggled, and blushing faces provided the answer. \"Come now, Eliza - you cannot deny that it is a stunning dress.\" \"I cannot.\" \"And you have such a stunning figure - really, you could pull it off so nicely,\" Clara cajoled. \"So could the man she is trying to impress,\" Elsie added suggestively, causing Eliza's breath to catch in her throat, and her face to flare up in the most impressive blush. \"Elsie, hush! You must not embarass her so - she is not used to that sort of talk!\" This was untrue, Eliza had been subjected to 'that sort of talk' for most of her life, leading up to her transformation at the hands of Professor Higgins. However, she had never spoken thusly, even when she lacked the polish and graces that one thought of when the word 'lady' was spoken. \"I did not mean to insult your work, Miss Hannon - the gown really is stunning... absolutely gorgeous. Could you forgive an old prude?\" \"Only if you purchase it, and do it justice.\" \"May I at least try it on first?\" Much later, Eliza was dressing in a guest room at Mrs. Higgins's home. Clara informed her that she would be getting ready at her own home, but promised to bring a guest with her to the party. Eliza supposed that it was a new beau by the mischevious way the younger girl's eyes sparkled. She sighed at the thought,and was more than a little jealous that Clara had time for such things. Jack was being cared for by Rosemary that evening, and for the first time in a long while, Eliza allowed herself to be pampered and prepped by one of Mrs. Higgins's able maids, who happened to be adept at hair. Eliza's hair was piled artfully in a psyche knot, modernized slightly by having the front of the hair not styled out in a pompadour, but sleek and tight, with a few chic waves. A gold lame bandeau played nicely against the natural highlights in Eliza's hair, unadorned by the superfluous feathers and rhinestones that seemed signature amongst the fashionable elite nowadays. Eliza admired herself in a full-length mirror, suprised to see the glamourous creature she had once had a nodding acquantaince with mere lifetimes ago. Being a mother and a budding entrepreneur left little room for glitz and glamour. Her clothing was never poor quality anymore, only a simple and more serviceable cut. Now, she felt as though she was ready for a night of smoke-filled rooms, and dancing, and - She never realized how very shapely her legs were. Eliza impulsively did a conceited little twirl, and then struck a dramatic pose with one leg extended slightly, so that she could admire her nude stockings, and clever black satin heels. They were not terribly high, but the toes were dramatically pointed, and there were flirty black and gold rosettes on one side, where the straps met the buckles. The maid giggled at her vain little show, and Eliza found herself giggling as well. \"What silliness,\" Eliza sighed, pulling on her gloves. Her neck, earlobes, and right wrist were adorned with mock, gold painted pearls, provided by Clara. She hoped Professor Higgins would not laugh at her, or think her silly for dressing up like a silly, young thing. Henry Higgins felt stifled in his evening coat. It was a silly birthday, after all - why did he have to torture himself so? He supposed he ought to humour his mother, she did love her fancy dress parties, especially now that the war was over and one could have them again. Still, he would have much rather come to the party in his trustworthy tweed. Eliza was taking a devilish long time to get ready, he thought with some annoyance. Pickering had already had two pre-dinner drinks, and was talking animatedly with some of the female guests. How one be a confirmed bachelor, and still a shameless old flirt, Henry could not figure out for the life of him. The whole thing was almost - His reverie was broken by the sight of Eliza entering the parlour, almost hesistant in her arrival, as though she had something to be ashamed of. He was suddenly aware of the fact that his drink was sloshing about in its' tumbler, due to a slight tremor in his hand. A heat rose to his cheeks, and he was positively fixated on her, all other inhabitants blurring into the background, so insignificant to him were they. She was remarkable, and not a day over nineteen in his eyes... no, that was not true. Motherhood and responsibility had lent an elegant wisdom to her form. He could not have taught and cajoled that air into her, she had done so all by herself. Suddenly, the other guests came into focus - the male ones, that is. Henry became painfully aware that he was not the only person stunned by her appearance, but he was the only one without the courage to approach her. She was soon flanked by gentlemen, like bees around the sweetest flower. He noticed his mother intervene on this possible breach of etiquette, and began introducing Eliza to them, one-by-one. All of them so's of her friends, and most of them middle-aged, with a few young ones in the mix. She greeted them all with her usual polite warmth, and suddenly her back was to Henry, and he found himself positively inflamed. There it was. Shocking in its' nakedness, and all smooth ivory. What could she possibly be wearing beneath it? Henry nearly dropped his drink entirely when the answer came to him. He suddenly wanted nothing more than to sit down, anything to spare himself the humiliation of discovery. Not that anyone would be looking there of course, how absurd! Still, he spotted the nearest armchair and sat down upon it. His pulse quickened to a dizzying pace when she approached him. \"How do you do, Professor H iggins?\" She greeted, her tone a mockery of the way it had sounded at Ascot, even gasping out the 'H' in 'Higgins'. She was giving him an odd half-smile, expectantly waiting for him to stand and greet her. \"Eliza,\" he managed, but did not stand up. He fervently prayed she would accept this as one of his personality quirks and move on - she did, but not without allowing her face to flicker with disappointment. His stomach lurched with dread - he did not want her angry with him, not when... \"Hullo everyone!\" Came a sing-song voice from the entrance of the parlour. All eyes flew to Clara, who arrived on the arm of none other than Linton Pryce. Clara was a vision in mauve chiffon, contrasting dramatically with her fair skin, and black hair. She wore a matching headband across her forehead, with white feathers gracing one side. She spotted Eliza immediately, and dragged Linton across the room to greet her, holding out a white gloved hand to grasp one of Eliza's, nearly pulled the two face-to-face, with herself in the middle, petite and nearly unobtrusive. Henry glowered when Clara's eyes met his, rewarding his sour countenance with a sly grin. \"Mrs. Hill, you take my breath away.\" Linton greeted boldly, and Henry wanted more than anything to strike the man's head against the mantle repeatedly. \"Thank you, Mr. Pryce - How do you do?\" \"Fantastic, now that I am seeing you.\" Henry stood up, finally able to control his 'problem'. \"Excuse me, Mrs. Hill, Miss Hill, and... I am sorry, I cannot remember your name for the life of me.\" \"Linton Pryce.\" Henry fairly grunted in response, and stormed off to his mother's side of the room. He overheard Eliza inquire about Mr. Pryce's engagement with the opera, and rolled his eyes when the man gave his excuse in the form of another vomit-inducing compliment. Henry found himself unable to tear his eyes away from their conversation, and was pleased to see that Eliza did not seem altogether comfortable in Mr. Pryce's presence. The dinner bell interrupted all conversation, and Henry was suddenly compelled to cross the room once more and approach Eliza. \"May I?\" He offered his arm, and heard Eliza's astonished gasp, even though she tried to suppress it. He watched her visible battle between the prospect of turning him down or playing nice for his mother's sake. He could read every expression that played across her fine features, and was pleased when he saw the 'playing nice' option win out before she even linked her arm in his. \"Are you cold, Professor Higgins?\" Eliza asked, as they walked towards the dining room. Quite the opposite. \"What a notion! Why on earth would I be?\" \"You are trembling, it seems.\" Henry inwardly cursed his traitorous body. Everything down to her scent was enticing him that evening, it would seem. His peripheral vision caught the sight of a male guest giving Eliza's bare back an appreciative gaze, and Henry shot the man a look that was dripping with venom and reproach. \"I could ask you the same question. Were you given a discount from your seamstress for her neglect in finishing your gown?\" He was rewarded with a very unladylike elbow to the ribs. \"Be quiet, or I shall walk with Mr. Pryce.\" \"You say that as though it were a threat.\" \"Is he not?\" They arrived at the table, and nothing more was said as Henry gallantly pulled a chair out for her. Once she was settled, he found himself unable to resist leaning over so that his mouth nearly brushed her earlobe. \"You are playing a very dangerous game, Eliza - Mr. Pryce is a well known ladies' man, and you would do well to avoid him.\" His intimate tone caused a Eliza to shiver slightly, despite the fact that he was giving her a warning, and not an endearment. Dinner went off without a hitch. The company was friendly, and engaging. Henry even managed to converse without causing insult, although he wanted to very much when he found himself talking to Linton Pryce. He hated the way the man always seemed to catch Eliza's attention with some sort of stupid anecdote, even though he noted that most of her responses seemed to be more of the polite variety. \"My mother-in-law told me that she happened upon your Professor Higgins in the park with little Jack.\" Eliza's eyes widened, and she looked to Henry for confirmation. He had not told her of the encounter, believing that such news would upset her. Henry nodded at Eliza's silent query. \"How astonishing,\" was Eliza's reply. \"She said she was very struck by how like -... that is, she was very touched by your young boy. I believe she would like to extend an olive branch in the future.\" Eliza's smile was tight, and forced. \"I daresay that would surprise me greatly.\" Henry spoke up. \"Dreadfully sorry about not bringing it up, Eliza - I didn't think the encounter was of any consequence, nor that it beared repeating.\" \"You did not have a conversation with her?\" Eliza inquired, her tone an edgy one. \"No, I did not. Jack and I had a very busy schedule that day, and I did not want to deviate from it.\" Her expression softened, and Henry was relieved to note that she did not bear any anger towards him for the omission. That was a mercy. After dinner, the men all retreated to the study for cigars and brandy. \"That young widow is quite fetching, what was her name? Mrs. Hill?\" \"Yes, she is my mother-in-law's daughter-in-law. I have been trying to court her for ages... damned pretty thing.\" Henry felt his anger rise at Linton Pryce's admission. However, it was nothing in comparison to what was said next. \"What say you, Higgins? I heard a rumour that you've sampled a bit of her. I am sure that frock brought back some fond memories.\" A man - younger than Eliza, enough to the point where he had been too young to serve in the Great War, and far into his cups to boot -. was the one who made the bold statement. \"I could just imagine what I would see if I unlatched that clever little chain on the back of the thing and -\" Henry had not engaged in fisticuffs since his schoolyard days, but he did not hesitate to bring his fist against the boy's face, slamming it against his fine nose. Years of reserve, and longing came bubbling forth in a hot rage, roaring like a freight train in his ears, causing his vision to go red. He was suddenly held back by a strong grip on each arm. \"Steady, old man!\" Pickering urged. Suprisingly, the other man holding him back was Linton Pryce. \"Get him out of my mother's house!\" Henry raged. Two men of the boy's acquaintance rushed forward, and assisted their wounded friend to his feet, ushering him from Henry's presence. The room was deadly quiet until Eleanor Higgins came rushing in, followed by several curious ladies, one of which was Eliza. \"What on earth is going on in my home?\" Eleanor demanded. \"Why is William Perry being dragged from here with a bloodied nose like this is some sort of cheap pub?\" Henry found himself unable to make eye contact with his mother, and the confused look upon Eliza's face caused him to flush with shame, and suddenly he was quite sober. \"I-...\" He could not finish his sentence. Wordlessly he fled, followed closely by Colonel Pickering, who was similiarly tight-lipped about the incident. The rest of the men could only cough nervously, and avoid eye contact with the ladies. \"I never!\" Eleanor huffed, slamming the door shut on the study, and effectively ending her birthday party.[Chapter 21] A Better Man Chapter Twenty-One Walking After You Eliza arrived home a few hours after Jack's bedtime. She had rather hoped that the night would have lasted longer, but the strange row at Mrs. Higgins's birthday party had brought the festivities to a screeching halt. None of the men were willing to discuss what had happened, although Clara promised to get something out of Linton eventually. Eliza believed it - Clara was a persistent busybody when she wanted to be in the know. Eliza also suspected that Mrs. Higgins would be conducting an investigation of her own, once she got a hold of Professor Higgins. He had looked so strange when Eliza saw him! Such an expression of unrestrained wildness, as absurd as it sounded - this was not a banging-his-head-against-a-tree-Heathcliff she was dealing with, after all. What the devil had sparked it all? Her reverie was broken by the sight of Jack, slumbering sweetly in his little bed. The fire had begun to ebb in the fireplace, so Eliza crossed the room to put on another small log, and stoke it. The flat was growing more and more drafty as the days shortened, and Eliza was reminded that she ought to find better lodgings, now that things were beginning to stabilize financially. Jack needed a bigger room, and Eliza longed for a nice study, or perhaps a small library. \"Mummy?\" Her son's groggy voice pulled her to his bedside, smoothing his rumpled locks with a gloved hand. \"I am here, darling.\" Jack rubbed his eyes, and then rewarded her with a sleep-soaked smile. \"You look like a queen.\" \"Thank you, my little prince. Were you on your best behavior for Rosie?\" Jack nodded. \"Oh, yes; I let her beat me at chess. She's very bad at it, you know.\" Eliza covered her mouth to supress a grin. \"Perhaps you didn't let her win - perhaps she bested you.\" Jack furrowed his brow, as though thinking hard over how absurd his mother's statement was. He shrugged it off and asked, \"Was Uncle Henry at the party?\" Eliza nodded, tucking Jack in once more. \"Yes he was.\" \"I bet he thought you were beautiful.\" She kissed his forehead. \"Uncle Henry doesn't notice things like that, darling.\" \"Silly Mummy,\" Jack murmured before closing his eyes. Eliza left Jack to his dreams, and entered her bedroom. Piece by piece, she dismantled her illusions of glamour, scattering bobby pins and jewelry about in a tray on her bedside table. The gown that had so entranced every male at the party was put away, and a plain cotton nightgown was put on in its' place. Eliza meticulously brushed her hair, erasing the elaborate style it held earlier, and plaited it into a single, thick braid. She smiled at her reflection, relieved to see her reliable, serviceable self in the looking-glass. It had been wonderful to be the center of attention - that she could not deny - but there had been an underlying air of danger, as though she had sparked a series of events that could not be reversed. With a sigh she crawled under the covers and pulled them against herself tightly. She glanced over her shoulder, at the other side of her bed, and for the first time in ages she noticed how very empty it was. She closed her eyes to escape the feeling, and ended up seeing him . Henry wondered if anyone had truly ever died from humiliation. Surely, if not, he could prove the exception. He had walked all the way back to Wimpole Street, and promptly locked himself up in his study, intent on drinking away any memory of his actions. Throwing around his fists like he was some sort of back-alley pugilist, and at his age! Disgusting. His glass of port went down bitterly, as his mind added that he had fought for a 'woman' of all things. \"Higgins, old chap - open the door!\" \"Go to bed, Pickering - I'm in no mood to explain myself tonight!\" Henry bellowed back. \"Come now, it's not as bad as all that - I daresay that whelp had it coming to him, don't you?\" \"Go. Away.\" There was a pause. \"Well, that's fine then. I will see you in the morning, Higgins.\" If Henry was not mistaken, there was a hurt tone in Pickering's reply. Oh, well - it's not like it was the first time Henry had even been cross. It was likely it would not be the last time, either. She made him feel like an old fool. Who did she think she was, waltzing into his mother's like that, dressed the way she was? He had not felt such a violent, heady desire for someone since he had been a very young man, when those sorts of feelings were new and uncharted. That foolish boy had only drunkenly confessed what Henry himself was thinking at that moment. Still, it had been jarring to hear one's innermost thoughts echoed in an inebriated slur from someone over two decades younger. It pained him to know that he could have had her - should have had her - years ago. They would have arrived at that party together, arm-in-arm, and the rest of those swains would have had to keep their leering at a discreet distance. After all, she was the wife of their hostess's son! He would have been proud, rather than threatened. He was a colossal idiot. Oh, god - Linton Pryce was actively pursuing her hand. Linton Pryce was handsome, rich, and would willingly repair the rift between Eliza and Jack's grandmother if need be, thus giving the boy a legitimate family. Blast. Henry poured himself another drink, and then another. He went on in this fashion until sleep overtook him. Apparently, even in a drunken stupor, he could not escape her , for she was waiting for him. \"Hello Professor,\" Eliza greeted. She was standing by the sofa he was laying on, staring down at him with a curious smile. She was wearing that damned indecent frock. \"What are you doing here? Aren't you off to marry that Linton fellow?\" \"My, but your brain works fast, Professor. I hardly know Mr. Pryce; why on earth would I marry him?\" \"You hardly knew Freddy.\" \"This is true. You are right, Professor - I should marry that rich, handsome man.\" She turned her back to him, and started walking away. Henry sat up, and grabbed at her left hand, finding it cold, and smooth - like marble. With a tug, she was pulled backwards, forced to sit at his side. He kept a firm grasp on her hand. \"Like hell.\" \"Professor...\" \"I will not sit by and watch another man marry you.\" \"Then do not 'sit by and watch'. Come to me, Professor - tell me all, or you will lose us both.\" \"You ask much of this old bachelor, Eliza.\" \"Do I really?\" She kissed his cheek, the icy shock of her lips enough to give him a start. He awoke, head pounding, and thoroughly frustrated. Fantasy would not suffice any longer. The question now was: How? How could he possibly compete with Linton Pryce? Granted, he knew absolutely everything there was to know about Eliza, a fact that was first brought to his attention when she had lived with him and his mother. On the downside, she could say the same thing about him, and a deviation from the behavior expected of him would more than likely cause concern, rather than palpatations. Oh, why the devil did men have to act so silly to get a wife? If only women could oblige him by being more like a... Best not to dwell there. He contemplated a life where she married Linton Pryce, and left London for parts unknown, undoubtedly to travel with the man and possibly Jack's grandmother. Perhaps she would return once in a while to visit with her old friends, and Jack would vaguely remember a time when 'Uncle Henry' was the center of his little world. Uncle Henry: The Man Whom Mummy Tolerated. Look how old he's grown, how bitter and isolated; what a funny old thing! This was insupportable. Henry dragged himself from the sofa, and stretched out cramped muscles. His right hand hurt like the very devil, and upon inspection he realized that it was broken. \"Damn.\" Fisticuffs at his age, indeed. Mrs. Pearce would simply have to bind it. After returning to his room to sleep off the rest of his hangover, and allowing Mrs. Pearce to force coffee down his throat and care for his wound, he decided it was time to start the monumental task of keeping Eliza. He donned his best tweed, squared his shoulders, and started for the front door. He would not propose today, oh no - this was a delicate matter that required a delicate, subtle hand. What was that ridiculous proverb? \"'Softly, softly, catchee monkey'.\" Henry gave a start, and turned to see Pickering standing behind him. \"What on earth, Pick - Are you a mind reader?\" \"Higgins, you were muttering to yourself - quite loudly, I might add.\" \"Then you are a nosy parker.\" \"Perhaps - frankly, I couldn't be happier that you've finally come to your senses about Eliza.\" Henry scoffed. \"Romantic old fool.\" \"Aren't we all? Mind you don't make a botch of things again.\" Pickering frowned. \"If you hurt her again, you will have to answer to me.\" Henry nodded. \"Quite right. Well, off I go on this foolish business, I suppose.\" They shook hands in a brotherly - albeit left-handed - sort of fashion, and Henry headed out the door. He was relieved to find Eliza was once again the approachable lovely sort, and not the dark eyed vamp from the night before. Her hair was softly coiffed, allowing for a few curls to spring out from the bun and frame her face lovingly as she worked, oblivious to the man watching her from outside the front window of her shop. He took a moment to admire the sweet cornflower blue of her cotton frock, with its' lace peter pan collar, and violet floral print. She wore a matching violet cardigan, with the sleeves rolled up to reveal her slender forearms and wrists, as her long elegant fingers twisted and formed the corsage she was working on. She was not even an echo of the type of woman he despised; silly, vain, and devoted to making him miserable - well, she did make him miserable at times, but now was not one of those times. With a deep breath, he stepped into her shop, his heart nearly stopping when she smiled at him. They stood awkwardly apart - she behind the counter, and he in a state of nervous paralysis three feet in front of her. \"Professor Higgins, I thought you had fled to Argentina after last night.\" He colored quickly at the remark, and vaguely contemplated fleeing the mission at once. \"Come, I was just teasing. What did happen, by the way? None of the men are talking, and Clara has not been able to get a single word from her brother-in-law.\" \"Why don't you ask him? I've heard rumours that you've been seeing quite a lot of him.\" Oh. He did not mean for it to come out so petty-sounding. \"Oh, really? If rumours were instantly true, than you and I would have been living together in sin for years by now.\" Eliza planted her hands on her hips, and smirked, obviously pleased to have caused him further discomfort. Both of them were too engrossed in the conversation to be cognizant of the fact that the front door to the shop had been opened, and that they were not alone. \"I was not aware that such a rumour still existed.\" \"Then you have not seen Jack come home from school early with a bloodied lip and a warning from his headmaster to not quarrel in the schoolyard.\" The revelation took Henry's breath away. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Jack was suspended about a month ago for trying to thrash a boy. It took me a few days, but I managed to glean to reason for the fight. The boy called me a whore - I am astonished well-bred boys know such words - and then went on to say that Jack was your bastard, and that you were a coward for not fighting in the war.\" Eliza's voice was slightly hoarse with emotion by the end of the tale, and Henry detected that her eyes were suspiciously sparkling. \"Little ruffians.\" \"Indeed. Why have you come here?\" Before Henry could answer, Eliza noticed his bandaged hand. \"You're hurt!\" She exclaimed, rushing from behind the counter and to his side before a very visible realization came over her, and she gasped aloud. \"You? Professor, why?\" Once again, his reply was interrupted. \"Eliza, I would like to speak with you about my grandson.\" Mrs. Pryce had come to call.[Chapter 22] A Better Man Chapter Twenty-two A Bit of Her Own Back Author's Note: A thousand apologies about the delay in this chapter. I really, really am very sorry for keeping you all waiting. An explanation: I have been working on a short film that has been devouring alot of my spare time, and recently I ended my nearly six year relationship. Needless to say I've been a bit of a trainwreck. :/ I love you guys! Henry turned to the demanding voice, and an immediate scowl appeared on his face. As he had done in the park with Jack, his second instinct was to shuffle slightly to the left, so that Eliza was blocked from Mrs. Pryce's view. His stance was purely protective, and he tried very hard to make himself look quite tall to the tiny, plump woman. The two of them took a moment to exchange icy looks, while Eliza cleared her throat several times in an attempt to get Henry's attention. \"Professor.\" Henry turned his head a fraction, catching Eliza's impatient look from over his shoulder. With a sigh, he stepped to one side, allowing the women to see each other, face-to-face. He made no attempt to leave the store. \"I daresay this is a private conversation,\" the old woman snapped at Henry. \"I daresay that this shop is open to the public, and I will not have my search for buttonholes be derailed by female drama.\" Henry then turned from the ladies, and began to put on a show of browsing the shop. \"Professor, it is alright; I will be alright,\" Eliza pleaded. Their eyes met, and she gave him her most reassuring smile. \"The buttonholes will be here when you return.\" Buttonholes, indeed. \"Very well, Eliza.\" Henry made sure to fix Mrs. Pryce with the most withering look he could muster, and held it as he exited the shop. Once out the door he took the position of sentry, a bit to the left and out of sight, but close enough to be able to hear any sort of disturbance. Eliza calmly studied her longtime foe. Widowhood and great wealth had made the woman fatter than ever, and she was dressed to the nines in the clothing of the highest quality. Fashionable for the old victorian matrons, who were not quite ready for shorter hems. \"Mrs. Pryce, I am all astonishment - I did not know that you regarded Jack as your grandson.\" Eliza kept her tone steady and measured, never raising her voice. \"We have had some difficulty in the past, Eliza - I freely admit that - but you must allow me to be a presence in the child's life.\" \"Why?\" Casual. Genuinely curious, without seeming overtly so. The query seemed to flummox Mrs. Pryce, evidenced by the way her large pale cheeks were marred with red splotches. \"Freddy was my son!\" Mrs. Pryce cried, unable to keep the conversation civil. Her shoulders were squared, and her fists bawled up tightly, ready for a fight. Eliza thought she looked quite silly, and was unable to prevent the derisive snort that came from her. \"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Pryce, but didn't you disown Freddy? If I were to allow you into Jack's life and he did something to displease you, what then? Would you shun him as well?\" Eliza sighed. \"I am sorry, but he is just a little boy, and I will not subject him to that sort of confusion-\" \"Confusion? Oh my dear girl, I could not confuse him anymore than you already have!\" The observation managed to breach Eliza's defenses, and it was her turn to blush. \"I?\" Mrs. Pryce smirked, and stood a little taller, having found her mark. \"This silly little family you've constructed for him with the Higgins's. You are lying to that child, making him believe that Eleanor is his grandmother... and allowing your lover to have such a hand in raising him- \" \"Stop right there!\" Eliza was all fury, straight as a ramrod, though she trembled from head to toe. \"You have finally hit upon the reason I shall never allow a relationship between my son and yourself. Your cruel slander has done nothing but harm for Jack ever since the moment is escaped from your poisonous lips. He has no friends, and was nearly expelled for defending me against one of your vile rumours! Why on earth would I allow you to build a rapport with him after that?\" \"He is my flesh and blood!\" Eliza shook her head. \"I have seen the way you treat your flesh and blood, how you twist and weaken them, and I want none of it. You made Freddy so dependent on you that he even persisted in writing to you after the estrangement-\" \"No, he did not.\" Eliza inhaled sharply, and blinked several times. \"What?\" Mrs. Pryce's eyes went to the floor, seemingly shamed by something. \"That was a lie. Freddy was dead, and I wanted to hurt you so very much. He never wrote to me after I disowned him, not a line.\" The opponents stood silently after that admission. Eliza realized that in confessing the falsehood, Mrs. Pryce was offering herself up as humbly as she could for the sake of seeing Jack. Eliza was very nearly moved by it. \"You saw him in the park, and you thought of Freddy.\" \"I did. They look so much alike... those eyes.\" \"It does not change the fact that you have severely damaged my reputation and his with your lies. I am not Professor Higgin's lover. I never have been.\" \"Will you allow me to see him? My son-in-law has spoken to me about his interest in you; surely you must see that the best course of action would be to allow me my way in this, especially if you will someday become engaged to him.\" Eliza laughed. \"Linton Pryce? He is a very nice man, I am sure, but I shan't be getting married any time soon... least of all to him.\" \"And why not? He is rich, he is handsome, and he is fond of you.\" Eliza frowned, and planted her hands on her hips. \"Matchmaking for me will not help your case.\" \"And denying your son a solid father figure will not help yours!\" Eliza felt the sting of that retort keenly, although she tried to school her features as to not betray her inner turmoil. It was true that she had been a long time on her own... but still, she would not stand aside and let a harpy like Mrs. Pryce try and hand out life lessons to her. She was not the vulnerable, pregnant young girl she had been all those years ago, numbed with grief and void of fight. \"My life is my own, and Jack is my son. It is true that you bore his father, but you gave up the right to know my son a long time ago. There was a time where you would have done anything to protect Freddy from what you felt was harmful to him, and I am doing the same for his son. You will not ever approach him, and rest assured that if we see you coming our way on the street, we will go to the trouble of crossing to the other side.\" Eliza let out a shuddering sigh, trembling with pent-up emotion. Mrs. Pryce stood stricken and pale, quietly taking her punishment. \"Now, if you have no business here that includes putting money in my till, I would like very much for you to leave.\" Eliza turned her back, and waited for the slamming over the door. Several moments later, the door opened once more and Professor Higgins entered. \"You weren't very far away, were you?\" Eliza inquired, turning slowly to face him. He looked a bit sheepish. \"I did not hear a word, I swear.\" \"Liar.\" \"You were magnificent.\" Eliza blushed and averted her eyes under his praise, rare thing that it was. \"Does that Linton Pryce repel you so?\" \"He is not what I envision for myself.\" Professor Higgins smirked. \"You do not envision yourself to be extravagantly rich and comfortable?\" \"I do not see myself living forever with someone I do not love.\" She noticed his sharp intake of breath, and the nervous way he wrung his hands together. \"Always the romantic, Eliza.\" Eliza smiled. \"Always.\" Professor Higgins replied with something so very jumbled in incoherent that Eliza missed it altogether. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Would you care to come to this silly ballet with me tonight? Mother cannot attend and it falls on me to find a replacement.\" Eliza felt as though she could have been knocked over with a feather. First her erstwhile mother-in-law demanding a relationship with her son, and now Professor Higgins was asking her on an outing![Chapter 23] A Better Man Chapter Twenty Two The Ballet Author's note: Sorry about the delay... again. I've been going through a move. Unfortunately, there might be another delay as I have to rely on using my roommate's computer to write and they need it primarily for school. However, I should have my very own laptop by January! ... I will try to update before then, though. PS: Have fun spotting the slightly altered quote from \"Gigi\"! :) \"What are you going to wear?\" Clara inquired from behind her fashion periodical. She was sprawled on her stomach on Eliza's bed, kicking up her stockinged legs in a childish gesture. Eliza was seated at her vanity table in a robe, brushing through her long dark hair. She pointed across the room to a chair where the gown from Eleanor's birthday party waited. \"That.\" \"Oh.\" Eliza set down her brush, and turned to the girl, who was still browsing obliviously. \"Oh?\" Clara looked up and gave Eliza a contrite smile before setting down the periodical and pulling herself into a sitting position, smoothing over her skirt. \"Well, darling, he's seen you in that, hasn't he?\" Eliza nodded, frowning. \"Yes, he has, what of it?\" Clara shrugged, picking off an invisible piece of lint from her skirt. \"Oh, the old thing is lovely, of course-\" \"'Old Thing'? Clara, I've only just purchased it!\" \"Yes you did. It's a very lovely, daring gown and the professor was quite enchanted by it I am sure. However, he's used to seeing you in it, isn't he?\" \"I daresay he's seen me in a great deal of gowns several times, I don't exactly have a grand wardrobe.\" Clara got up from the bed and approached Eliza, taking up the brush and running it through Eliza's hair with a gentle expertise. \"Oh, I know darling. Perhaps it does not matter.\" \"Why wouldn't it matter?\" Clara shrugged, and sighed. \"Oh, he's such a stodgy old fellow. I am sure he wouldn't even pay attention to such things, buried in Academia the way he is.\" Eliza turned her head in a violent gesture that caused the brush to catch and tear at her hair, bringing tears to the corners of her angry eyes. \"Stodgy? You can leave right now if you are going to slander him!\" A grin lit across Clara's features as she stepped back from Eliza's rage. \"Can I not? It was all quite fashionable for you to do so not so very long ago- what has changed?\" \"I lo-...\" Eliza stopped herself, and covered her mouth in horror at the words that nearly tumbled out. Clara threw down the brush with a cry of joy, and pointed an accusatory finger at Eliza. Her expression screamed 'I Have You Now!'. \"Aha! There it is!\" Eliza picked up the brush from the floor and turned back to the looking-glass, attacking her hair with vehemence, a very put-out expression on her face. \"I can't imagine what you mean.\" Clara burst out into giggle, and wrapped her arms about Eliza from behind, resting her head on the angry woman's shoulder. \"Oh, how quick you are to anger! Don't be ashamed, Eliza... I knew it all along.\" \"Knew what?\" \"Why - that you loved Professor Higgins of course!\" \"Don't hug me so tight, Clara, I can't breath.\" Clara pulled away, still grinning. \"You silly goose! What fun you are to tease! I am sure Professor Higgins absolutely adores baiting you.\" \"He revels in it.\" Once Eliza calmed down a bit more, Clara finished placing her hair into a charming chignon, decorated with a crimson silk band. \"Now, stay here for a moment, and do not put that dress on. I will be return shortly,\" Clara instructed, before leaving Eliza alone to her thoughts. So she loved Professor Higgins. \"How shocking,\" Eliza murmured, dabbing a bit of perfume behind her earlobes. Clara returned twenty minutes later, bearing a garment bag, and a jewelry box. The jewels were small diamond studs, and a diamond choker reminiscent of the one she had worn at the embassy ball, albeit less elaborate. Eliza raised an eyebrow at the finery, sending Clara an inquiring look. \"Oh, it was just a trifle from some dull prince I was chummy with.\" \"Was he a great prince?\" \"No, a little one. Great princes do not give very large stones.\" \"Why not?\" \"In my opinion it's because they don't feel they have to.\" Eliza blushed. Clara lived a much more colorful life than Eliza could ever conceive of. The gown was lovely, and of a simpler cut than the one Eliza was planning on wearing. It was crimson silk, like the band in her hair. The neckline plunged into a daring 'V', as did the back. The sleeves were non-existent, instead the gown tied at each shoulder, and was accented with matching rhinestone roses. The gown was fitted slightly from below the bodice to the hips, where the skirt flared out and fell to just below the knee. Clara provided matching mary jane heels, with the same rhinestone roses at the buckles. Eliza marvelled at her friend's resourcefulness. \"You are made for fashion, Eliza. It's a shame you won't let me bob your hair...\" Eliza smiled at Clara. \"It would be more convenient, to be sure, but I just can't bring myself to part with it.\" \"Mummy! Uncle Henry is here and he looks like a real toff!\" Jack's boisterous announcement filled the air. Clara gave Eliza an astonished glance. \"Dad paid one of his rare visits the other day, and Jack's vocabulary hasn't recovered since.\" \"Ah... well, shall we go greet your stodgy old professor?\" Eliza blushed. \"Yes.\" Henry gently scolded Jack for the boy's use of slang, and ruffled his hair. The sound of Eliza's bedroom door opening pulled his attention in her direction and he was stunned with what he saw. True, the dress at his mother's party had been of a much more daring cut, but this... he had never seen her in crimson. Such a shade never failed to engage the mind of every unsuspecting male that came across it. The way the silk whispered and danced across her curves, and the realization that once again she could hardly be wearing anything substantial beneath the gown... \"Uncle Henry, your face has gone all red!\" \"Only because your mother keeps this flat like a furnace... h-hello, Eliza.\" \"Hello, Professor Higgins.\" His name on her lips affected him like the most exquisitely composed symphony. Damn! He was becoming foolish in his old age. He was vaguely aware that Jack was trying to shove a cloak in his hands. Snapping himself out of his reverie, Henry took it from the boy and held it open for Eliza. She was his for the night. His. Eliza smiled before approaching him and allowing him to place the cloak about her shoulders, and Henry wondered if one could suffer a heart attack from such a sight. Impulsively, he leaned forward and whispered in a voice he knew only she could hear, \"You look lovely.\" She blushed to the very tips of her ears, a sight Henry found damned irresistable. After saying their goodbyes' to Jack and Clara, Henry offered his arm to Eliza, and led her out into the night. The taxi ride to the theatre was made in companionable silence. Henry thought he felt Eliza make a few tenative glances in his direction, and he tried desperately to catch her eye. She resisted, shy as a butterfly. He looked down at their gloved hands, so close that a pen would scarcely have room to set between the two. The slightest twitch of his pinky would bring him close enough to caress her own. His hands trembled from the effort to resist doing just that. God in heaven, she smelled divine! Quit becoming everything you hate, you goat! The taxi came to a halt in front of the theatre, and the pair was ushered out into the chilly air. Eliza held Henry's arm a little tighter, as though to steal his warmth. He was not at all invested in the ballet. Not only did he find the art a bit dull, despised 'Giselle', he was also distracted by the pleasure of watching Eliza's reaction to it. He realized that he and Pickering had never taken her to the theatre, and that she had not had the money, nor the opportunity when married to Freddy. He was witnessing a first, and it was endlessly entertaining. Eliza refused to hide her enthusiasm at the show before her. Everything she found thrilling was punctuated with a romantic sigh, or a gasp. Henry found himself shooting glares at the nearby entreaties for her to contain herself. Let them hiss at her for silence at their own peril. Henry nearly jumped out of his chair when Eliza's hand shot out to grasp his. Her face was ashen and tearful, and he was tempted to ask what ailed her, until he noticed that their was a death scene being portrayed on the stage. She really was a tender thing. Regrettably, the ballet ended, and Henry was faced with the unhappy task of returning her to her flat. \"Why don't we walk, Professor?\" Eliza asked, as they waited for a taxi. \"Walk? It's damned cold out, woman.\" Eliza smiled, and tilted her head to one side. \"Ah suppose it would be cold to a toff like you, sir,\" she teased in her old way. \"Filthy little guttersnipe,\" he replied with a laugh. \"Ah washed me face and 'and 'fore I come, I did.\" At that, the mood became tense. Henry was struck with the memory of all the nights he spent listening to that very phrase on the phonograph. He coughed, and averted his eyes, unwilling to let her see the hurt within them. \"It's damned cold, Eliza.\" \"Professor?\" She had sensed it. Of course she did. Clever girl. \"Here comes a taxi, now.\" He felt her hand on his shoulder, and his first instinct was to shrug her off. He resisted, and instead hesitantly turned to face her. \"Did I say something wrong?\" Her eyes were large and pleading. His resolve to wait for the 'right' moment was beginning to fail. \"We've missed the taxi.\" \"Hang the taxi, Professor! What is the matter?\" A couple passing by gasped upon overhearing Eliza's abuse of the english tongue. \"Oh for heavens sake, move along!\" Henry shouted at them, causing them to flee. He turned back to Eliza. \"I should have thought it obvious by now.\" \"Pardon me?\" \"'The Matter' is you, you stupid girl!\" Eliza gasped angrily, and turned from him in order to make a retreat. Henry grabbed her hand and pulled her to him. Their noses nearly collided from the force of his pull. \"Don't run from me, Eliza. Not anymore.\" \"I won't be insulted by you after I've shown concern for your well-being!\" \"Hang your concern, I don't want it.\" He spat back, releasing her. Eliza took a few steps back raised an eyebrow. \"Oh, and what is it you want?\" Henry looked around to ensure the street was deserted, or at the very least, there were no interested parties watching. He stepped foward so that they were in close proximity once more. \"You.\"[Chapter 24] A Better Man Epilogue Author's Note: Sorry guys! School, distractions, drama, and writer's block are solely to blame. :( Henry Higgins was once again in a church, and of his own free will. It happened very infrequently in his not-so-short life. Eliza was sitting next to him in the front pew, smiling serenely. Henry often wondered how the ravages of time seemed to never touch his little guttersnipe, when getting out of bed and walking down the stairs were now a chore for him. There were lines around her eyes and mouth, it was true, but they were fine, barely perceptible, and did nothing to diminish the beauty of those features. Her rich dark hair only held a few strands of silver. The very idea that she had agreed to marry him was staggering. He was not young when they walked down the altar, and he was remarkably less so now, as they witnessed the marriage of her-... their son Jack. \"She is a silly creature,\" Henry whispered to Eliza as Miranda Dobbins, soon to be Hill, walked down the aisle to her betrothed. The girl had features as delicate as a china doll; cornflower blue eyes framed by long, thick lashes, a little snip of a slightly upturned nose with a smattering of freckles on the bridge, and a cupid's bow of a mouth. Her strawberry-blonde hair was piled in curls on top of her pretty head, and she carried a bouquet of pink lilies that matched her suit. The girl's entire ensemble had been designed by Clara, whose sobs could be heard throughout entire church. The affair was small, and informal, as Jack's leave from the army was brief. \"She is a nurse for the military, you can hardly be a silly creature when you are bandaging grotesque wounds,\" Eliza hissed back, pinching his arm. \"You were an exceedingly silly creature, and managed just fine.\" Eliza shot him a glare that removed the smug grin from his face. \"You are still so very easy to bait, my dear.\" He took her hand and squeezed. \"Hush now. The ceremony is starting.\" Henry tried valiantly to pay attention to Jack's nuptials, but his mind was elsewhere. He was thinking about a cold night, and a ballet, and the woman who gaped incredulously at him when he confessed that what he wanted was her. \"Do not make me flower the sentiment with drivel, Eliza. I'm not a romantic man.\" He had informed her as she repeated his declaration. The very thought of him being the romantic sort was enough to pull Eliza out of her astonished stupor. She snorted in a very unladylike manner, and agreed with him whole-heartedly. \"And I want you,\" She had confessed. Were he a demonstrative man, he would have pulled her into his arms right then and there, but he had not. He decided instead to be the inquisitive man. \"How long?\" \"My whole life, it would seem.\" Still unable to express what he wanted so desperately to do, Henry instead took her hands into his own, and brought them to his lips to kiss them. It was not her mouth, but he would never allow himself to passionately kiss someone in public, no matter how much he wanted. Eliza was not that disciplined. Her mouth was on his for a brief, thrilling moment, causing his grip to tighten on her gloved hands. She looked contrite as she pulled away. \"Oh, God. I shouldn't have done that... Professor, I am so very sor-\" He lost the war with his emotions, and cut her off by reciprocating her innocent kiss. He hands flew to her face, cupping it gently as he deepened the kiss, pulling away only when she moaned slightly into his mouth. \"Well now that's done, Henry Higgins. You'll have to marry me. There are witnesses to your shameless debauchery\", she whispered, turning her gaze over his shoulder. He craned his neck to see a pair of ruffians, ages six and eight, staring in Henry and Eliza's direction. He turned back to her. \"I suppose I will do just that, if you are open to the idea.\" Turns out she had been very open to the idea. They had stood at the very altar that Jack and his beloved stood at, only a lifetime ago. Their own wedding was just as sparsely attended, although with Miranda's circle of girlfriends, this ceremony was a bit more giddy than Henry and Eliza's reserved affair. Jack had still been a child. Henry choked back the emotion that had plagued him ever since the boy had enlisted. Not a boy anymore... a man. Henry and Eliza's union did not produce any children, but Henry didn't care. His Jack had been son enough. Ten boys of his own blood couldn't have made Henry as proud as he was of the child he had helped raise since infancy. He prayed Jack would return from the war to have a long fulfilling life with the silly girl he had chosen. He prayed the boy would have decades more time on the earth than his poor father, Freddy. Now his attention was on the ceremony. Miranda was glowing with girlish delight, undoubtedly pleased with her choice of husband, and Jack was blushing. There had been nothing but praise for the girl in the letters he sent home. She had nursed a bullet wound that he retrieved. Nothing to cause alarm, and certainly not the sort of wound that would debilitate and ultimately send him home. Eliza absolutely adored her, of course. Henry supposed that there was a part of him that liked the girl as well. Her delicate appearance did not mirror her inner-strength, clearly. Just as Eliza's steel spine was masked by lace, silk, and an achingly sweet figure. Why did she stay with someone as old as he? Henry was nearing blindness, as was constantly plagued by a rhuematism that exacerbated his ill temper. Yet, she stayed, and he was grateful for that. He lifted a hand to tuck a stray stand of hair behind her ear, and she smiled at him. Why had he wasted so many years not being with her? Foolish. Now it seemed that their days were numbered. \"Don't give me that sour look, Henry Higgins.\" Eliza chided. He managed to smile back at her. He had gotten his lifetime with the squashed cabbage leaf of Covent Garden, and for that gift, he would put away his regrets forever. \"Who is being sour, you silly girl?\" He asked. End.

Please be kind. Let me know what you think. Thanks much in advance! A New War Chapter 1 \"I'll let you shoot first as long as you get out of this terrible mood you're in,\" FDR said. Tuck eyed his partner warily, but said nothing. \"Seriously, man; I don't like seeing you like this. It's…weird,\" FDR continued. \"Well, I'm sorry. My marriage just failed…again. I had to miss my son's karate match today and we're stuck in DC in the middle of winter,\" Tuck grumbled. \"There was a reason I moved to California from Britain.\" \"Yeah, your parents moved here…\" FDR mumbled. The two CIA agents had been in the country's capital for about 18 hours. It hadn't stopped snowing and everyone in the damn city seemed miserable. Tuck adjusted the collar of his navy blue pea coat to keep the snow off of the back of his neck and sighed. \"I'm sorry, mate. I know you're missing Lauren, too,\" Tuck said in his English accented voice. FDR nodded and kicked the snow off the top of his boot as they walked. \"She wasn't exactly pleased when I told her two seconds after she told me she was pregnant that I was flying across country for an unknown length of time,\" FDR said. \"I can imagine,\" Tuck conceded. \"I am really pleased for the both of you, mate.\" \"I know you are. Just because you're sullen and grouchy all the time doesn't mean you aren't still my best friend,\" FDR said. \"So you'll be naming the child after me?\" Tuck asked, finally cracking a smile. \"What if it's a girl?\" FDR smiled. \"I mean, it works for me, but…\" \"Shut up,\" he said as he landed a swift elbow to FDR's ribs. \"I really wanted it to work out with Katie,\" Tuck said. \"I just…\" \"You wanted it to work for Joe. Not you or Katie. And that's admirable, dude, for sure. But you need to be happy, too.\" \"Relationship advice from you?\" \"Who's the happily married man in this conversation?\" Tuck knew that FDR was right. He and Lauren had gotten married just over six months ago and FDR had shared the good news about their impending child on the flight out to Washington DC. The two men turned down an alley and met with an informant on their case. The man they spoke with had a thick accent, Slavic in nature, Tuck decided, although it was hard for him to distinguish from behind a thick balaclava. The information, however, was exactly what both Tuck and FDR thought they were going to get. It was not good news in the slightest. The items that were being fenced, some of the most precious and rare gems in existence, had already gone to the black market. And these people weren't the kind of people that felt it necessary to record the whereabouts of the fenced items. \"Collins isn't going to be pleased,\" Tuck said as they started their walk back to their hotel across town. \"Collins isn't the only one. Lauren is going to be pissed,\" FDR said. \"I told her this would be an easy one.\" \"Like she actually believed you? You always say that,\" Tuck laughed. \"I can't help that I'm incredibly believable,\" FDR replied. \"But I think I have a solution for your problem.\" \"What problem?\" Tuck asked. \"I think you just need to get laid.\" Tuck threw a dirty look in FDR's direction, but did not answer him. \"Seriously; when was the last time you've had sex?\" FDR asked. Their hotel was now in sight and Tuck just wanted to get inside and get warm. He didn't want to answer anymore of his questions. \"It's none of your business,\" Tuck replied in a clipped tone. \"I have two responses for that,\" he held up one finger. \"One: you're my best friend and therefore your business is my business and two,\" he held up a second finger. \"Two: that response means it's been far too long.\" FDR laughed, but Tuck looked like he was going to punch him. \"I'm extremely happy for both you and Lauren,\" he said as they strolled up to the doors of their hotel. \"I just haven't been attracted to anyone since…\" FDR was first at the doors and pulled it open as Tuck noticed first a man running towards them and then a woman chasing after him. Without hesitation Tuck took the steps down quickly and tackled the man to the ground, knocking the wind out of both him and the guy in the process. Tuck, breathing hard, looked up as the woman who he now realized was wearing high heels and only a thin coat, was carrying a Glock and had handcuffs in her hands, too. \"Thanks, mate,\" she said in a softly accented voice. Tuck smiled up at her. \"No problem,\" he replied. She had long, dark hair and a slim body. The high heels were actually knee high boots with extremely thin heels. It was a miracle she hadn't done serious injury to herself running in them. \"Do you need…?\" he said as he motioned towards the man on the ground. \"I'm fine,\" she said putting her right knee into the man's back. He made a loud groaning sound and Tuck saw a smile form on her perfectly shaped lips. \"Are you sure?\" he asked. He didn't want to walk away from her; he was drawn to her for some reason. She nodded. \"Come on, Tuck. She said she's got it,\" FDR called. He narrowed his eyes and focused on the woman's face. He thought he recognized her, but said nothing further. Tuck watched as the woman got her handcuffs around the man's beefy wrists. He struggled against her, but she didn't let up and eventually the man gave up his fight and lay limply on the ground. The woman hauled the restrained man to his feet without much effort. \"Thank you,\" the woman said again in her accented voice. \"Are you a cop?\" Tuck asked. \"Bond enforcement agent,\" she replied. \"A bounty hunter,\" Tuck smiled. \"Pretty professional skills for a bounty hunter.\" The handcuffed man spat in Tuck's direction, but he sidestepped the insult and it fell to the left of his feet. \"A woman has to know how to protect herself,\" she replied, throwing a hood over the man's head. \"Sorry about that,\" she said, apologizing for the man in her custody. \"No problem,\" Tuck replied. \"You're sure you're all right?\" She nodded. \"I've handled bigger ones than this before,\" she smiled, obviously flirting with him. She and Tuck locked eyes for a few more seconds before she turned her attention back to the man in her custody. \"Come on, shove on,\" she said to the man to get him to start walking. \"Don't make me use the taser.\" She started back down the street, speaking Russian to the man. Tuck strained his ears to hear what she was saying. He could make out that she was asking, no, demanding , that he tell her where something was. As he was concentrating, he didn't notice FDR walk down the steps towards him. He jumped a mile when he clasped him on the back. \"Holy shit,\" Tuck replied, looking at his best friend for an explanation. FDR shrugged. \"You were staring at her.\" Tuck shook his head and headed up the stairs to the hotel once more. \"She was asking that man where something was. It sounded important.\" \"Let it go, Tuck,\" FDR said. \"Let's get a drink.\" Tuck nodded at his friend and then followed him into the hotel's bar. \"What was all that about?\" FDR said once he had a beer in front of him. Tuck took a long drink of his own and studied the fingerprints that he'd left on the chilled glass. \"What?\" \"Earth to Tuck,\" FDR said. Tuck looked up and into his friend's face. \"What is wrong with you?\" \"I just wonder who she was,\" Tuck said by means of an explanation. \"Why didn't you ask Ms. Bounty Hunter for a business card when you helped tackle her perp?\" FDR asked laughing. \"I mean, you probably could go get yourself arrested and jump bail.\" \"That's really funny, mate,\" Tuck replied without a single touch of amusement in his voice. Working for the CIA, both Tuck and FDR had met their fair share of beautiful women. A long while ago, he'd met Katie. She was funny, cute and smart. But before he could say that he'd fallen entirely in love with her, they found out she was pregnant. Tuck had married Katie out of obligation more than anything. And he'd been blessed with Joe who was the best son that could have ever existed. Tuck and Katie learned to love one another, if for the sake of their son, but it didn't matter. It wasn't enough. Tuck was constantly gone, constantly lying to both Katie and Joe. They divorced and they split custody of their son. Then, in an act of desperation and pure luck, he'd met Lauren Scott. But, so had FDR. What had ensued after that was comical now, but had been incredibly frustrating at the time. Tuck couldn't begrudge his best friend the love he'd found with Lauren, though. Even though he wished it was himself, he and Lauren made a great couple. And now they were expecting a child. This woman, despite only having spoken to her for a short while, intrigued him. Even though Tuck had assisted her in the take down, she'd been able to handcuff the guy and haul him to his feet by herself. He'd tried to memorize her face and body as best as he could; he was going to find her. FDR finished his beer. \"I'm going to call Collins,\" he said, standing up. \"See you upstairs.\" Tuck nodded and FDR walked out of the bar, smirking to himself. … … The man, handcuffed behind his back with the hood over his head, sat in a chair in a white room. He was all alone. Until he heard the door scrape open and a pair of heels click across the floor. The steps stopped right in front of him and the hood was ripped from him. The man hung his head down, not meeting her eyes. \"Bounty hunter, my ass,\" the man said in a low tone. It was the first thing he'd said since she'd cuffed him. She pushed up the sleeves of her jacket and inspected her fingernails. \"You chipped one of my nails,\" she said, no accent this time. \"And you're right; I'm not a bounty hunter.\" \"You look damn good in those boots,\" he replied. \"Mr. Roberts…that's what you're going by now, right? It's Alexander Vladimir, really, though, right?\" He said nothing. \"Listen, it's late, I have a flight to catch back home. You got tackled by a stranger and handcuffed by a girl, it's been a rough night,\" she said. \"I'm Agent Amanda Simons and I work for the CIA.\" She leaned against the other table and stretched her legs out in front of her. She was dressed in dark skinny jeans and a black zip up athletic jacket. She was still wearing the knee high boots from earlier. She had blue eyes and dark curly hair. The man looked her over approvingly, but still said nothing. Amanda put her stiletto heel down into the shoeless prisoner's foot and he howled in pain. It sliced into the meat of his foot instantaneously and blood began to pool on the top before dribbling around his whole right foot. \"I need you to tell me where that last batch was headed,\" Amanda said, bending down to meet his eyes. \"I want a lawyer,\" he growled. \"I'm not a cop,\" she smiled back. \"No one knows you're here, sir. We're going to treat you as nicely as possible while you're here, but you're going to be here for a while if you don't give me what information you have.\" The man shook his head. \"I don't know anything.\" \"Bullshit.\" \"Believe me when I say this, I'm the nicest person you're going to deal with here, and I put my heel through your foot,\" she said. \"Remember that?\" she pointed to his now-bloody right foot. She walked around him and put her hands on his shoulders and massaged them for a second. He let out an involuntary groan of pleasure; his shoulders were definitely sore from being handcuffed. Her hands moved up his neck and one dug into the hair at the back of his head. His enjoyment was lost as he growled in pain once more. As she opened her mouth to say something, her cell phone began to ring. She pulled her phone out of her back pocket with her free hand and looked at the display. \"I have to take this,\" she explained, not releasing her grip on the man's hair. \"Hi, honey,\" she said sweetly. \"What's going on?\" She listened intently as the person on the other end of the phone chattered away. \"I'll definitely be home in the morning. I'll be getting home while you're still asleep and then I'll be taking you to school,\" Amanda explained. \"I promise. Can I talk to Cameron?\" she asked. \"I love you, too.\" She waited a second while the phone was passed along on the other end. \"Hey, Cam,\" she said. \"Everything okay?\" she waited for a response. \"Yes, you can borrow those earrings. Yes, I'll be home to help with your hair in the morning. It's just a boring old business trip, you know, just meetings and taking notes.\" Amanda was silent again for a minute. \"Love you, Cam. Give Sophie a kiss for me. And give Thomthom a treat for me. See you in the morning.\" Amanda disconnected the call and slid the phone back in her pocket. \"How touching,\" the man said after thirty seconds of silence. Amanda wrenched the man's head back and looked down at him. \"Shut up. I clearly have a place to be and I made a promise. I don't break my promises. Especially to those girls.\" A handful of hair, one more stiletto wound and some curse words later, Amanda had her answers. She stepped out of the room while two more agents rushed in to take care of the wounded prisoner. \"I got what we needed,\" she said to a tall man standing in the corner. His arms were crossed over his chest and he had an impassive look on his face. \"You aren't going to congratulate me?\" she asked, smirking. \"You need to go clean the blood off of your heels.\" \"I'll have time on the flight back to California, Ed,\" she said. \"Did you miss me?\" The man smiled for the first time since she'd stepped out of the interrogation room. \"Department hasn't been the same since you transferred.\" \"That's nice to hear,\" she said. \"I start at the new office on Monday. I gotta go, now, though. Flight to catch.\" She waved goodbye to her former boss and was gone. She had three days until she was officially back to work. It had been a hard transition, but she'd had fun spending time with the girls. Hailing a cab, she made her way to the airport, with only her purse. It had been a last minute flight that she wasn't going to be able to do for much longer. She hated flying anyway. She just wanted to get to her new home. She finally closed her eyes once she was on the plane. She didn't realize how exhausted she was until she'd relaxed into the plush seat. In a few hours, she'd be back to pretending she was a mild-mannered (and nerdy) secretary at a law firm. That's what her cover was for this trip. As she started to doze off, her mind wandered to the man who helped tackle her. He'd been incredibly good-looking and charming. His accent surprised her, but probably not as much as hers surprised him. She fell into a deep sleep thinking of the man in the blue pea coat. Amanda knew she'd never see him again, especially as she was flying back to California, but he'd at least be in her dreams.[Chapter 2] A New War Chapter 2 Amanda had snuck into her own house at four am, careful not to wake anyone up. She'd had just enough time to collapse, fully clothed, on her bed for a solid two hour nap. She had changed out of her skinny jeans and boots on the plane in favor of yoga pants and flip-flops; there was no reason she shouldn't be comfortable. Promptly at 6:15 am, her bedroom door creaked open and she was pounced on by a small child. \"You're home!\" the small girl shouted at her. It didn't matter that she was asleep previously. She wanted Amanda awake. Amanda's eyes were open in an instant and she pulled the small girl into a tight hug. \"I promised I would be, didn't I?\" Amanda said, smiling and then yawning. \"Did you miss me?\" The girl nodded and shoved the bear she was holding into Amanda's arms so she could hug him, too. \"Did Bernie miss me, too?\" Amanda laughed. \"He always misses you,\" she replied. \"I'm sure you took excellent care of him, though. That's why I gave him to you to look after; you're very responsible when it comes to taking care of teddy bears,\" Amanda nodded. \"Especially ones named Bernie.\" The girl squeezed the bear tightly to herself once more. \"So, what do you want for breakfast?\" Amanda asked as she stretched. \"Waffles!\" \"'Kay, Soph,\" Amanda said through another yawn. \"Waffles, it is. Are your sisters up?\" she asked as she moved off of the bed. She hated to move from the comfy cocoon she had created for herself, but things had to be done. The day had to start even though she wasn't quite ready for it. \"I don't know,\" Sophie replied. \"I'll go check!\" she raced out of the room without another word. Amanda heard one bedroom door bang open into the wall behind it. \"This isn't going to go well,\" Amanda said out loud to her now-empty room. By 7:45, she had all of her girls fed, dressed and packed in the car on the way to school. Cameron, the oldest at 15 years old, was in the passenger seat next to Amanda. She would be dropped off first at the high school. Alexandra, the middle girl was 12, sat behind Cam, and she would be dropped next door at the junior high. Sophie was in her booster seat next to Alex and was 5. She would be dropped at her kindergarten class at her school across town. All three girls were blond and blue-eyed; and all of them insisted on wearing their hair long. It fell completely straight, everyday, without any work. It made Amanda slightly jealous that her brown hair had a natural curl to it and required 45 minutes with a straightening iron to get it as straight as theirs. \"So, where did you have to go?\" Cameron asked in between rapidly sending out text messages to her friends. \"You're going to see them in a few minutes, why are you texting them?\" Amanda asked as a response. \"Uh, duh; it's to find out what they're all wearing,\" Cameron replied. Amanda rolled her eyes behind her mirror-like sunglasses. It hadn't been that long since she'd been a teenager, but she definitely didn't remember texting her friends to find out what they were wearing every morning; it didn't seem important. That and she didn't have a cell phone until she was almost 18 years old. \"And you didn't answer my question,\" Cameron added. She was too smart for her young age. \"I had to help out at a meeting for Mr. Benedict. Since I'm his secretary, he wanted me to go and take the meeting notes personally,\" Amanda explained. \"And since I like taking notes, I figured I could go.\" She'd been lying since she moved out there; she hadn't been working, except for some research work from home, since she'd moved to California. Mr. Benedict probably did exist, but not in Amanda's world. Cameron sighed. \"You're such a nerd,\" Cam laughed. \"Did you at least go somewhere fun, like Vegas or Miami? Because if you left us with that weird lady for somewhere lame…\" she trailed off. \"She dresses worse than you do.\" Amanda looked mock-offended at the 'nerd' comment, but then smiled when Cameron mentioned the person who'd babysat for Amanda last night. Since the CIA was in such a pinch to get the guy back in DC, they'd sent an agent to watch the girls. The woman they'd sent was named Cynthia. She had black hair done up in a tight bun and she was wearing an ill-fitting suit and wide-rimmed glasses. The story they'd told the girls was that Cynthia was someone from the same law firm; that Amanda's boss had arranged for her to help Amanda out because it was that vital that she went. It wasn't the best of lies she'd ever come up with, but it had to work since they were cutting it so close. Amanda sent her home as soon as she'd opened the front door. \"It was in DC,\" Amanda explained. They pulled up in front of the high school and Cam's hand was on the door handle. Amanda re-locked the door and turned to her. \"Are you coming home right after school?\" Amanda asked. Cameron unlocked the car door manually and was halfway out of the car as she answered her. \"No, I have cheer practice tonight, then there's a game at 7 that I have to be at. Then we're having a sleepover at Steph's, remember?\" Amanda thought for a minute and then it all clicked. \"I just told you yesterday,\" Cam added in an annoyed tone. \"You already forgot?\" Amanda remembered. It was in the first few minutes of her chase with the man last night that was now in CIA custody. \"Right, right,\" she said. \"Have a great day! Call me if you need anything.\" \"I'll be fine,\" she said before slamming the car door closed behind her. \"Good talk,\" Amanda mumbled. \"All right, next stop: the junior high!\" Once Amanda had the three girls dropped off at their respective schools, she drove herself home. She wasn't scheduled in at the new CIA office in Los Angeles until Monday, but she figured she'd make an appearance and meet her new boss in person. She'd moved to California only weeks ago, buying a house without actually seeing it. But this one was big enough for her, the three girls, and the cat and was in her price range. And it had the added benefit of being in a relatively safe neighborhood and had a high fence that ran around the yard. Amanda's goal was to make the girls comfortable. Truthfully, it had been an easier transition than Amanda had anticipated, but that was a very good thing. The girls had only lost their mother, her sister, two months ago. Charlotte was a strong woman and had been diagnosed with cancer four years ago. She went into remission and had been until a year ago when it came back with a vengeance. After such a long battle, Charlotte passed away. Amanda's brother-in-law, Greg, was in Special Forces and had managed to delay his tour of duty until after the funeral, but was now going to be gone for 18 to 24 months and would only have limited contact with his family. Who did he trust with his girls: their only aunt. Amanda couldn't tell him no. And so she didn't. Amanda spent her life's savings on a very expensive house in LA so the girls didn't have to change schools, but so they also didn't have to live everyday in the house where their mom passed away. At only 28 years old, it was a little strange for her to go to parent teacher conferences for a high school student, but since she was trained as a spy for the CIA it didn't really bother her to go in and play the part. She got a lot of weird looks from, well, everyone, but that didn't bother her either. What bothered her was lying to her nieces. But it was for their own protection that they didn't know about her real job. And so they thought she was a nerdy secretary at a law firm. Little did they know she was tackling guys twice her size and then putting the heel of her boot through their feet until they gave her the information she was looking for. It had been really hard losing her older sister, but she tried to put on a brave face for the girls. So far, there had only been a few minor spats between Amanda and the girls…well, Cameron. The other two little girls looked up to their aunt and her new role as pseudo-mother. Cameron was just angry at life. But who could blame her? Amanda stopped home and put on something more business-like and made her way to her new building. … Tuck and FDR were informed shortly after arriving back at their hotel that they needed to be on a plane home to California as well. They took a red-eye back into LAX and grabbed a couple hours of shut eye before arriving back at their CIA headquarters. They hadn't heard anything from Collins yet that morning. FDR was playing solitaire on his computer while Tuck typed away rapidly on his own. They had both arrived back from their respective homes in suits: Tuck in a dark one with a light blue dress shirt, FDR had worn a light grey suit with a black dress shirt. Tuck's sleeves were already rolled up to his elbows as he rapidly did research. \"I've checked the database of bond enforcement agents and I've been through thousands of names. I can't find her,\" Tuck complained. \"I guess it's possible that she isn't registered, but she was carrying a gun, so I…\" \"Why do you care?\" FDR said interrupting his friend. \"What do you mean why do I care?\" Tuck asked. \"What made you look Lauren up?\" \"She called me on my bullshit after talking to me for thirty seconds,\" FDR replied simply. \"I just don't think…\" \"Gentlemen!\" Collins yelled over the railing upstairs. Both of the men looked up at their boss. \"My office, right now,\" she said. Both FDR and Tuck got up and made their way to their boss' office. They continued to chat about the situation until they reached the threshold of the doorway and realized that there was someone else in Collins' office with her. \"Tuck, FDR, I'd like you to meet the newest member of our team, Agent Amanda Simons.\" Amanda stood and turned around to face the men. \"This is the agent that brought in one of the heavy hitters last night,\" Collins said. \"But I think you already know that,\" she half-smiled. \"You,\" Tuck managed to say. \"Amanda!\" FDR said. \"Frank,\" she smiled warmly. \"Thanks for pretending to not know me last night,\" Amanda said sincerely as FDR pulled her in for a hug. She didn't have an accent this time; she was clearly faking the voice last night. Tuck looked back and forth at the two of them after they'd ended their hug. FDR merely grinned back at his best friend as Tuck made angry faces at him when Amanda wasn't looking. His best friend had known who this woman was the whole time! \"You just moved out here?\" FDR asked, ignoring Tuck's faces. \"Well, I didn't just move out here,\" Amanda said. \"I've been out here a few weeks sorting out my life and a couple other lives.\" \"I'm Agent Tuck Hansen,\" Tuck said, extending his hand. Amanda shook his hand and smiled at him while looking him in the eyes. He was even sexier in the daylight. And from the way he was looking her over; he thought she was pretty damn good looking, too. \"Amanda will be a permanent member of our team. I trust the both of you will make her feel welcome,\" Collins said to them. \"Was it good to get back into the field after a while off?\" Amanda nodded. \"It was…good. I couldn't have done it without Agent Hansen. I probably would have had to chase him for blocks. But with the way life is right now, I'm definitely content to just sit back and handle the paperwork for a while.\" FDR and Tuck both looked at her confusedly. \"You two can show Amanda to her new desk, it's currently being placed near your desks,\" Collins said. \"She'll be an integral part of our team; I trust you will treat her that way.\" Tuck smiled at the blush that had creeped across her cheeks. Amanda was now staring at her shoes; clearly she wasn't aware she was going to get this kind of recognition. \"We'll have your phone and laptop dock ready for Monday. Foster and Hansen can show you around.\" \"That sounds fine,\" Amanda said. \"Thank you, ma'am.\" The three agents exited the office and proceeded to make uncomfortable small talk during the tour of the CIA office. \"How do you all know each other?\" Tuck asked after they had wound up at their work stations. \"It was that mission in Turkey,\" FDR said, grinning ear to ear and Tuck took that to mean that they'd been intimate. \"Yeah, you were trying to pick me up,\" Amanda smiled and laughed. Tuck stared, he couldn't help it. She was pretty just standing there, but the smile made her beautiful. He mentally shook himself; he had to concentrate. \"You're one of the few women in the world that has said no to me,\" FDR said. \"How does that feel?\" Tuck breathed a sigh of relief and both Amanda and FDR turned to look at him. \"Oh, man, you've got to come meet my wife. You can have dinner with us!\" FDR said. \"I'd have someone to talk to other than Trish and Bob,\" he said flatly. \"I, uh,\" she started. She looked down to her watch on her wrist. \"I actually have to go pick up the girls from school. Maybe some other time?\" she asked. \"Sure, of course,\" FDR replied. \"I'll see you both Monday. It was nice to meet you, Tuck,\" she said. \"And thanks again for helping last night. I was able to get a little bit of information out of him before I flew back here.\" \"He's being flown here for trial,\" Tuck said, reading a message on his phone. \"If he mentions anything about the hole in his foot, I had nothing to do with it,\" Amanda laughed. \"See you later.\" Amanda smiled at the both of them again and headed out of the building. Tuck stared at his best friend after watching Amanda disappear for the second time in less than 24 hours. \"What?\" FDR asked as he sat in his desk chair. \"You know her and you didn't tell me!?\" Tuck asked. FDR smiled. \"You let me obsess over her all day and you know her?\" \"I couldn't blow her cover last night, like she said. And how was I supposed to know she was going to show up here today?\" he asked. \"Whatever,\" Tuck replied. But now he knew who she was. And he was bound and determined to figure her out. A/N: okay, please review![Chapter 3] A New War Chapter 3 Amanda's weekend was not nearly as relaxing s she needed it to be. She spent all day Saturday interviewing women for a nanny job. She trusted Cameron, but having a nanny around for Alex and Sophie would make her feel so much better. The Agency, she learned, had a bunch of people already background-checked that they kept specifically for their employees. After five iffy interviews, the sixth woman finally impressed her. The woman was in her early sixties and was a former CIA agent. Her name was Jeanne MacDonald and she reminded Amanda of her own mother. \"So, how long have you been retired?\" Amanda asked. The two were enjoying some lemonade in the backyard. \"About ten years. My babies started having babies of their own and I realized I was just too old to keep working. That and my knees got to squeaky to be sneaky,\" she laughed. Amanda was immediately at ease with this woman. And Amanda had done her own check on this woman, too. \"So, how many children do you have?\" Jeanne asked. \"Well, I have three girls. The oldest is fifteen, then twelve and the last one is five. And it's kind of a different story…\" \"Lay it on me, dear,\" Jeanne said in response. \"I'm guardian to them; they're my nieces. My sister died of cancer a couple months ago,\" Amanda explained. \"My brother-in-law had to leave to go on his tour of duty. We don't know where he is or when he'll be home. But it's going to be at least eighteen months.\" The woman's sympathetic gaze deepened. \"Shoot. I was ready to take the job if offered before you told me that story. Now I really feel like I have to help you out,\" she said. \"That's kind of you,\" Amanda replied. \"It's been hard, but so far the girls have been really good. And I'm going to try to keep it a desk job for as long as possible, but…\" \"I know. With the unknown nature of the job, you just want to make sure they're taken care of,\" Jeanne said, nodding sympathetically. \"You moved your whole life out here to take care of your nieces? That's extremely admirable,\" Jeanne said. \"They needed me.\" As if on cue, Sophie, Alex and Cameron came out to the backyard. It was the first interview they'd made an appearance during. \"These are the girls!\" Jeanne gushed. Jeanne stood and the girls looked her over. She was shorter than their aunt and stockier. She was probably beautiful when she was younger and had aged into a handsome older woman. She wasn't dressed like an old lady, either. She wore jeans and fancy running shoes. Her bright green top suited her complexion as well as her personality. She smiled brightly at all three girls. \"I'm Jeanne,\" she introduced herself to them. Amanda moved to the girls. \"This is Cameron, Alex and this little one hiding behind me is Sophie,\" Amanda said. Jeanne bent down and looked at the littlest girl. \"How old are you?\" Sophie giggled and held up her whole hand, but did not speak. \"Five? You're practically all grown up already!\" Jeanne smiled. Sophie took a tentative step from behind her aunt's leg. \"Who are you?\" she asked bluntly. Amanda looked shocked at the girl's forwardness, but Jeanne simply laughed. \"Well, Soph,\" Amanda said. \"I'm hoping Jeanne will help take care of you girls.\" Cameron immediately looked up from her text conversation. \"Excuse me? I don't need a baby-sitter,\" she said with a lot of attitude. \"Cameron, we talked about this. She's not a baby-sitter; she's…\" \"A nanny,\" Jeanne piped up. \"And I'll be around for your sisters more than anything,\" she said softly. \"Do you like to color?\" Sophie asked. \"I love to color,\" Jeanne smiled. Sophie's eyes lit up. One down. \"Alexandra, you haven't said anything,\" Amanda said. Alex looked to her older sister who then actively ignored her. \"Alex?\" Amanda said again. \"Can't you just stay with us?\" Alex asked in a quiet voice. \"Oh, honey. I'm not going anywhere. I just want to make sure there's always someone to pick you up from school and fix you dinner in case I work late,\" Amanda explained. \"Oh,\" Alex said. \"I promise,\" Amanda said. \"And do I ever break my promises?\" Alex finally cracked a smile. \"No,\" she answered. \"Why don't you guys go decide on pizza toppings? Cam, would you order it?\" Amanda asked. Cameron nodded and the three girls walked back into the house. \"They're all so beautiful,\" Jeanne replied. \"My sister was gorgeous,\" Amanda answered. \"You're no slouch yourself,\" Jeanne replied. \"Well, thank you. So, you still want to help us out?\" Amanda asked. \"Of course!\" Jeanne replied. \"You need me to start Monday?\" Amanda nodded. \"Is that okay?\" \"Definitely,\" Jeanne answered. Amanda and Jeanne worked out the details of the arrangement and then Jeanne left. … … … Monday morning came far too quickly in Amanda's opinion. She'd spent the weekend making sure the house's cameras were working properly. She trusted Jeanne, but the surveillance cameras the entrances and in the backyard made her feel better. She had the feed connected right to her phone and there was a TV she showed the girls to use to check the front door. Amanda was uncharacteristically nervous as she walked into the entrance of the CIA building. She flashed her badge and was admitted by a friendly security guard. Maybe the warmer weather made people happier and friendlier? Other agents were milling around the breakfast station, but Amanda headed straight to her desk. She shouldn't be nervous; she'd been doing this for years. But something about that Tuck guy that put an anxious feeling in the pit of her stomach. She barely knew him though. Why should he make her nervous? Because he was incredibly good-looking, that's why. She turned the corner to where the desks were set up and found the man in question was already seated at his own desk. FDR was not. \"Good morning,\" he said, rising from his seat in a gentlemanly fashion. \"Good morning,\" she replied. She felt a warm head flush through her cheeks. Was she blushing? Amanda quickly looked down to her shoes. Her shoes wouldn't make her blush. \"How was your weekend?\" he asked politely as he returned to his seat. \"Getting the hang of California?\" Amanda nodded. \"Yes. It helps that I've visited my sister out here before,\" she said softly. Tuck had, embarrassingly enough, done his research. She had relocated to California to help care for her nieces. Those were the girls she'd been referring to. He'd learned her whole life story. Born and raised in Michigan and graduated from Michigan State University. She joined the CIA when she graduated and had been there ever since. \"Do anything fun?\" \"If you consider interviewing and hiring a nanny for my nieces as fun…\" Amanda smiled politely. She pulled a couple framed photographs from her briefcase and put them out. \"How many nieces do you have?\" Tuck asked. Amanda hadn't sat down yet, so she carried the one photo over. \"Three,\" she smiled. The photo was of their dad and the three girls. \"They're beautiful,\" Tuck replied. Amanda became more at ease as she spoke of them to Tuck. She noticed the framed photo on Tuck's desk. \"Who's this guy?\" she asked. \"Uh, that's my son, Joe and my wife, um, ex-wife , Katie,\" he said. \"Good-looking family,\" she smiled at Tuck. The words had poured from her mouth before she could stop them. What was wrong with her? Amanda clutched her photograph and quickly crossed back to her desk. \"So why were you the unlucky one left in charge of hiring the nanny?\" Amanda sucked in a breath. It was almost too early to tell this story to a stranger. \"I'll spare you the details, but my sister passed away and my brother-in-law is gone on business for the next god knows how long,\" she said. \"So, it's either quit my job or find a nanny. I lucked out because the agency keeps a few in the rolodex. But some of these ladies are a little unhinged.\" \"I wouldn't doubt it,\" Tuck laughed. \"They'd have to be if they want to be a nanny after working for the CIA.\" Amanda nodded. \"Were you close with your sister?\" \"When we were younger, of course, but she moved to California when I was like twelve to get married to Greg. That was my brother-in-law in the picture with the girls.\" Tuck had noticed that she kept the smile firmly planted on her face, but her eyes were shiny with unshed tears. However, she recovered quickly and moved to begin turning her computer on. True to her word, Collins had Amanda's desk set up and ready for her. It wasn't like her old desk, where she had a corner to herself, but she would make due. Amanda continued to set up her desk as Tuck settled back into his work. FDR came in a few minutes later. \"Hey! You're here!\" FDR smiled. \"That I am,\" Amanda replied. He settled into his own desk. \"So you caught Alexander Vladimir. We were sent in to meet with an informant about him,\" FDR explained. \"And some of the pieces that are being moved by the organization he works for. I just wonder why they didn't tell us they had you on the case, too.\" \"I think they were just hoping someone would get him,\" Amanda said. \"Hopefully the two of you will have better luck getting info out of him. He wasn't very forthcoming when I chatted with him. I tried asking nicely, but you know how that goes.\" \"Report says he had some small, sharp object impaled upon his foot,\" Tuck read. \"Bled quite profusely, I understand.\" \"I might have accidentally stepped on his foot that night,\" she grinned. \"Which was unfortunate because I was wearing my stilettos.\" Tuck smiled at her. \"I hate it when that happens,\" he laughed. \"But I'll just tell you both right now, I'm perfectly fine letting you guys take the lead on this one. I don't want to step on any one's toes, well, anyone else's toes,\" Amanda told them. \"How could you want to sit here?!\" FDR asked. \"It's so boring!\" \"Well, I have a bad habit of getting myself into some close calls with the bad guys we go after,\" Amanda replied. \"And right now, I'm the only person that my nieces have. I can't get myself maimed or killed right now.\" \"So don't get yourself maimed or killed,\" FDR argued. \"You don't have to get injured.\" \"It seems like you're all getting along,\" Collins said, strolling in between their desks. \"I think so,\" Amanda said. \"Well, Vladimir has arrived and is in an interrogation room if you'd like to continue your conversation, Simons,\" Collins told her. \"I was thinking that maybe FDR and Tuck could take a crack at him. And he kind of hates me now,\" Amanda smiled. \"I am always pleased to find out when my agents aren't best friends with the people we have in custody,\" Collins replied. \"Agent Hansen can go in with you. FDR, I want you to do a bit more research on the Las Vegas outfit that they have going.\" FDR nodded. Collins was clearly in a bad mood, so he wasn't going to argue. And he decided to wait until later to ask if he could leave early. Amanda stood from her desk as Collins walked away. She smoothed her skirt down, but she didn't put her suit jacket back on. Tuck also stood and began rolling up his shirt sleeves as they walked. \"I'm not going to lie, I can't wait to see you in there with him,\" Tuck said. He put his hand on the small of her back to guide her through the doorway into the block of holding cells. Amanda almost jumped out of her skin before immediately relaxing when she realized how natural it felt. They arrived outside of the cell that Alexander Vladimir was being held in. There were guards and agents all around, ready to let both Tuck and Amanda inside. \"Are you ready?\" Tuck asked and Amanda was temporarily distracted by his accent. \"Yes, let's do it,\" Amanda replied before blushing again. Tuck smiled at her and Amanda hurried over to the door. She was let into the white tiled room and she was followed quickly by Tuck. The door slammed closed behind them. \"Good morning, Mr. Vladimir,\" Amanda said in Russian. The man, who was bound to the chair that he was seat in, said nothing. \"Is that really how you treat a woman?\" Tuck asked in Russian as well. \"You could say good morning.\" The man's head never moved; his eyes were fixated on his injured foot that was now bearing a bandage. \"Good morning,\" he grumbled in English. \"That is much better,\" Tuck replied in English. \"You're wasting your time, agents,\" Vladimir said. \"You can do what you want to me, but I will never talk.\" \"Well, I hope we can persuade you otherwise,\" Amanda said. \"I know you remember what happened when you didn't want to talk to me before.\" The man slowly slid his uninjured foot back a couple inches. \"You do remember,\" Amanda said as she smiled. \"I do also hope that you'll believe that my friend here is much stronger than I am.\" Amanda saw Tuck unconsciously flex his muscles. \"So, we want to know everything you know about your friends,\" Tuck said, getting in the man's face. \"I need a couple things from you before I'll even consider talking,\" Alexander said. \"And what are those things, Mr. Vladimir?\" Tuck asked. \"I want to be placed in the Witness Protection Program if I talk to you,\" he started. \"I would also like to be paid for my pain and suffering since it was caused by you.\" \"As far as anyone knows, you were brought in with that injury,\" Amanda said from the other side of the room. She was leaning on the table ledge as Tuck spoke with the man. \"And we'll talk Witness Protection when you're a little more forthcoming with information. Because we won't help you if you feed us bull shit,\" Tuck informed him. \"I want one more thing.\" \"What's that?\" Amanda asked disinterestedly from her perch. \"I want…I want her on her knees in front of me,\" he said. \"Sucking on my…\" It wasn't the first time a man in custody said things like that to her. But with Tuck in her way, she couldn't get him to punch him. However, she didn't need to. Tuck had knocked the man so hard with a left hook to the jaw that the chair tipped backwards and the man's feet were straight in the air. \"I hope saying that was worth it, mate,\" Tuck said as he loomed over the man's face. \"Consider that your warning to never say anything like that to this woman ever again.\" The man was still on his back. \"Now apologize to her.\" \"Tuck, that isn't…\" \"I'm only sorry that I don't have her alone. Because the things I would do to…\" Tuck kicked the man in the ribs and kept him from finishing his statement. \"Let's leave him to think on it a bit,\" Amanda said putting a hand on Tuck's arm. He turned and looked her in the eyes. The spark of something was there. Tuck nodded and the two of them walked back out of the door once it was opened for them. \"I'm really sorry that he…\" Tuck started. Amanda put a hand up. \"I'm not worried about it. I've heard much worse.\" \"That is extremely unfortunate,\" Tuck replied. \"I do hope you'll let me buy you lunch to make up for it.\" \"You already defended my honor back there,\" she smiled. \"But lunch would be good.\" Amanda turned to an agent who was monitoring the cell. \"You might want to have medical check him over. He might have a broken jaw.\" \"He should have a lot more than that,\" Tuck replied. \"But…\" \"But, its okay,\" Amanda finished. \"So, lunch?\" \"If you insist,\" Amanda said. \"That I do,\" he smiled at her. \"Well, I just need to get my purse,\" Amanda said. \"I'll meet you at the front doors, then,\" Tuck smiled. Amanda walked back to her desk. FDR was staring disinterestedly at his computer screen. \"How'd it go?\" FDR asked. \"Better than it could have,\" she replied. She bent over her desk and FDR, out of habit, checked her out. She stood up and he quickly looked away. \"I should probably get some ice for Tuck, though.\" \"He punched him, didn't he?\" FDR smiled. Amanda nodded. \"Got him good.\" \"That's Tuck for ya,\" FDR replied. \"We're going to get some lunch, would you like to join us?\" Amanda asked. At the same time she asked her question, FDR's phone buzzed with a text. It was from Tuck. If she asks you to come with us to lunch, politely decline . FDR smiled and put his phone down. \"I actually have a lot of work to finish for Collins,\" he lied. \"You two have fun.\" \"Are you sure?\" Amanda asked. \"Yes, I'm sure. But you Lauren really wants to meet you. Laurent's my wife, by the way,\" FDR said. \"She wants to meet the only woman who turned me down.\" \"Would it make you feel better if I told you that the only reason I turned you down was because I had a boyfriend at the time?\" she smiled. \"It makes me feel a little better. A couple of the other guys thought you were a lesbian,\" he replied. Amanda laughed. \"Well, there was that one time…\" she trailed off. FDR's thick eyebrows shot up to his hairline. \"Just kidding,\" Amanda smiled and started to walk away. \"Or am I?\" she called back. FDR leaned back in his chair and picked up his phone to type a response to Tuck. Don't screw this one up. … A/N: I just want to thank the folks that are reading this. I know it's a small ficdom, but I'm super pleased that I've had so many hits! I appreciate it! Also, big shout out to James90 who has been my sole reviewer so far. Thanks a million. And I promise that there will be more action coming up. I just needed a bit of time to set up the story![Chapter 4] Disclaimer: If there was a rating between T and M, that would be what this chapter is rated. (in my opinion, anyway…) A New War Chapter Four \"Line it up,\" Tuck whispered. \"Okay, take the shot.\" Amanda swung the golf club at the ball and it flew across the mini golf green towards a large clown's mouth. Amanda came around and watched the ball completely miss the hole. \"Good try, though,\" Tuck smiled. Amanda swung her club again and this time the ball went right into the plastic cup in the ground. Currently, Tuck and Amanda were undercover. In broad daylight. Playing mini golf. The two of them were out on a \"date\" following Vladimir's business partner and his extremely young girlfriend out on their own actual date. So far, Danton Yencich hadn't taken his eyes away from the redhead he was with. He hadn't even taken a phone call. So far, it was just a regular, albeit boring, date. Yencich wasn't the head of the operation, but was probably, as Tuck Amanda estimated, third in command. He was about 35 years old with wispy blond hair that was thinning in the front. He wasn't very tall, but he was pretty solid. He was also really tan, which looked really odd on this particular man. He was the next clue they needed. Yencich would be able to lead them to a man that only went by Leonid. Tuck and Amanda were in their own little world when the sound of a shrill giggle wafted towards them. Yencich had picked the girl up and thrown her over his shoulder to take her to their next hole. Amanda did what she could to ignore her shudder of distaste. \"If she makes that sound one more time, I'm going to have to shoot her,\" Amanda said through gritted teeth as she and Tuck walked to their own next hole. \"Now, now, darling,\" Tuck smiled. \"That is not very nice.\" \"Her laugh sounds like nails on a chalkboard,\" Amanda replied. Aside from the fact that they were following a jewel smuggler and possible hired assassin around, she was enjoying her time with Tuck. It had been a couple weeks already and Collins was sending them out to work recon. Since today they were out doing \"couple\" things, it was hard for her to not pretend they weren't an actual couple. FDR was not excited that he was left out of the fieldwork, but he managed to get Collins to compromise and let him work in the van. Truthfully, he didn't mind it. FDR was enjoying his time listening to the audio of his best friend flirting with Amanda and vice versa. He was wondering when they were just going to realize how good they were together and finally do something about it. By all accounts, Amanda was already part of the family. Lauren had met them all for lunch a couple weeks back and the two had become fast friends. The ladies were happily swapping FDR stories, some that even Tuck hadn't heard, within the hour. Now Amanda had plans for girls' nights with Lauren and Trish every week or so. FDR turned his full attention back to the audio feed from the mic Tuck was wearing. Apparently Amanda had managed to splash her golf ball into the water hazard ad Tuck's laugh filled FDR's ears. \"So, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that golf's not your sport?\" Tuck laughed. Amanda slapped Tuck lightly in the upper arm in a playful way. \"My real skill lies in checkers,\" Amanda laughed. \"Don't challenge me.\" \"Noted,\" Tuck replied. \"Are you going to go get your ball?\" he asked. \"Oh, you can go get it for me, honey,\" Amanda smiled. Tuck shook his head. \"I don't think so,\" Tuck laughed. \"I'm pretty sure the person who loses the thing has to go in after it.\" \"Is that an official rule? Could you find that written down somewhere?\" Amanda asked as she looked at him in the eye. Tuck smirked but didn't say anything. Amanda sighed audibly. \"All right, all right.\" She bent down to slip her shoes off and Tuck couldn't help but appreciate her rear end. \"What makes this water blue?\" Amanda asked. \"It isn't poisonous, is it?\" she asked seriously. \"I think it's something to keep algae from growing in it,\" Tuck replied. He held his arm out as Amanda carefully stepped into the blue pond. \"This is truly disgusting,\" she said as she made a sour face. Her foot sunk into the bottom of the muck up to her ankle. \"Oh, gross,\" she laughed. She couldn't help but laugh despite how much she hated what was happening. \"I can't tell if you're really disgusted or if you…\" \"Oh, I promise that I'm really grossed out. It's squishy, Tuck!\" she replied. \"Ewww!\" She reached for the golf ball and came back to the edge of the pond. Yencich and his girlfriend came up to the hole. \"Play through, mate. My wife's gone for a swim,\" Tuck laughed. \"You sure?\" he asked, downplaying his accent. \"Because we can…\" \"No, no,\" Amanda said as Tuck helped her back up. \"Go ahead. I have a feeling this is going to take me a while. I wouldn't want to hold you both up.\" \"Are those your shoes?\" the redhead asked dumbly. Her voice was high-pitched and almost as grating as her laugh. Amanda fixed the smile on her face. \"Yes; great aren't they?\" \"They're adorable! Where'd you get them?\" \"On our honeymoon in Paris. I saw them and he just insisted that I have them,\" Amanda told her. \"They're amazing.\" \"I think they're amazing for a totally different reason,\" Tuck said. \"One day, I came back to the room, they were the only thing she had on.\" Amanda appeared to sputter for a moment before continuing. She put her hand on Tuck's chest and a tingle of excitement ran through him. \"You promised me that you weren't going to tell anyone that story,\" Amanda smiled. \"I just like that story too much not to,\" Tuck smiled. \"However, the mental image is better.\" FDR was cracking up on his end of the conversation and Yencich was now surveying the woman in the fancy high heels and shorts playing mini golf. He appeared to approve of her long legs. \"How long have you been married?\" the redheaded woman asked. Tuck looked to Amanda to answer; they were too professional to try to answer at the same time. \"Four years, but our anniversary is next month,\" Amanda replied. \"He's great, right?\" \"You are so great together! And your accent is hot,\" she said to Tuck. \"Are you two married?\" Amanda asked trying to change the subject. \"Oh, no. Not yet, at least,\" the redhead replied. \"I've been hoping though,\" she finished. Yencich looked uncomfortable next to her. \"Honey, we should finish up here if we're going to make our reservations at LaCirque.\" \"Bothwick,\" FDR said into his phone. \"Get Tuck and Amanda reservations at LaCirque.\" \"I'm not dressed for LaCirque,\" Amanda whispered into Tuck's mic as she hugged him. \"It doesn't matter, MandyAnn,\" FDR replied in her ear. \"You're going.\" \"What an odd coincidence; we have reservations at LaCirque, as well,\" Tuck smiled. FDR almost fell out of his chair in the van. \"What are you doing?\" he yelled into their ear pieces. Tuck still had his arms around Amanda, but he spoke to FDR. \"Calm down, mate,\" Tuck said. \"This woman won't let him change the reservations.\" \"How can you be so sure?\" Amanda asked. Tuck looked down into her eyes. \"Because I am.\" Amanda still wasn't sure, but Tuck seemed so confident, so she couldn't help but believe him. … … … An hour later, Tuck and Amanda were being seated at LaCirque and both of them were focused on the areas behind one another. They were surveying the crowd, trying to find Yencich and his annoying girlfriend. So far, Amanda didn't see either one of them. \"They'll be here,\" Tuck said as if reading her mind. \"I'm just going to enjoy dinner at a terribly expensive restaurant on the agency's dime,\" Amanda laughed. \"I want a steak,\" FDR said into their ears. \"Medium well.\" The waiter came up to the table and Tuck smiled at him. \"Can I start the both of you off with a drink?\" he asked. \"I'll have water and the lady will have a white wine,\" Tuck said. \"No, no,\" Amanda said. \"I'll just have water, too.\" \"Honey, you should have some wine,\" Tuck told her. \"I insist.\" Amanda didn't say anything, she simply looked at Tuck. \"White wine, for the lady.\" \"All right, I'll be right back,\" the waiter said before walking away from the table. \"Did you hear me? I want a steak. And maybe a baked potato,\" FDR said into their earpieces. They both continued to ignore him. \"I still don't see them. That bright red hair on that woman is pretty hard to miss,\" Amanda said. The waiter came back with their respective drinks and took their orders. Amanda was seated to face the entrance of the restaurant and took her position seriously. While she wanted to focus on Tuck's eyes, she needed to see when the couple walked into the building. After ten minutes, Amanda had taken a bite of her salad and stopped with her fork in the air. A shrill laugh had cut through the sounds of the people in the room and it could only belong to one person. \"We've got Yencich and the girl, eleven o'clock,\" Amanda told Tuck and FDR. Amanda watched as the couple was seated in the back corner in the restaurant in a semi-private area. Amanda could see them, but not well. And they certainly couldn't hear anything. \"I think that this wasn't one of our better ideas,\" Amanda said. Tuck smiled. \"At least we'll have a good meal out of this,\" he said. \"And good company.\" \"Good one,\" FDR said into their ears. Amanda laughed and blushed, while Tuck turned his own shade of red. Tuck turned off his mic a second later. Now they would be able to enjoy their dinner. The waiter had just brought them the cart of desserts when Amanda's cell phone rang and Tuck's eyes went wide and focused on something past Amanda's head. She was too focused on her phone to notice Tuck's reaction. \"I have to take this,\" Amanda said. She knew the polite thing would be to leave the table, but she didn't. She was going to try and make it as quick as possible. \"Hey, Cam,\" Amanda said into her phone quietly. She waited for the girl to respond. \"What's it rated?\" she asked. She waited for an answer. \"Who are you going with and how are you getting there?\" Amanda waited again. Amanda watched Tuck rise in his seat and she furrowed her brows in response. She watched him greet someone in her peripheral vision. \"His name is Nate?\" Amanda said into the phone. \"No boys. The answer is no,\" she said into her phone. \"Honey, you haven't seen the worst. We'll talk more when I get home.\" Amanda put her phone down and looked at Tuck, who was still standing and chatting with a man and a woman. Amanda stood and got ready to introduce herself. However, before she could speak, Tuck pulled her to his side and planted a kiss to her temple. \"Amanda, this is my ex-wife, Katie,\" Tuck said, eyeing their mark from across the restaurant. They were too far away to be able to hear what was said at their table, so Tuck knew he could speak freely. Amanda recovered quickly from the shock of his display of affection and extended her hand to the petite brunette who was partially wrapped around a guy who was probably Amanda's height. \"And this is her… boyfriend …Travis,\" Tuck explained in a partially strained voice. Katie looked at them expectantly so she could be introduced to the woman who was attached to her ex-husband. \"I'm Amanda,\" Amanda replied, not letting Tuck say anything. \"I'm his girlfriend. It's nice to finally meet you.\" \"It's nice to meet you, too,\" Katie said flatly. Travis might not have been very tall, but what he lacked in height, he made up for in attractiveness. The man was extremely good looking. He had a full head of dark, wavy hair and a tan that suited him. His eyes were a chocolately brown color. Both he and Katie were dressed up, and were much more suited for the restaurant than Amanda and Tuck were. Amanda kept looking at Travis, though. She was certain she knew him from somewhere. Travis extended his hand towards Amanda and she shook his hand as well. He had a terrible handshake. His palms were sweaty and his wrist was pretty limp; it was like holding onto a dead fish. When they finished their greeting, Amanda subtly wiped her hand on her red cotton shorts. When she looked up, that's when she realized that Katie was doing to her what she'd been doing to Travis. Katie's eyes were surveying the body language between her and Tuck and then her head shifted towards Amanda's bare legs and the tall high heels she was wearing. Her eyes were narrowed and she was obviously jealous of Amanda. Tuck's grip tightened on Amanda's waist and she leaned into him more. Clearly, Tuck hadn't known that Katie had a boyfriend. \"Where's Joe tonight?\" Tuck asked. Katie frowned. \"Not that you care, but he's with my mother.\" \"Of course I care,\" Tuck replied. Katie was still frowning. \"Oh, I hadn't noticed.\" \"Katie, tonight's not the night,\" Travis said as he smiled at Tuck and Amanda. \"It was nice to meet you, but we'll let you get back to your meal.\" Tuck said nothing, simply stared down his ex-wife. \"It was nice to meet you both, too,\" Amanda said. Travis ushered Katie away and Amanda sat down in her own chair and waited for Tuck to do the same. They sat in silence for a few minutes. \"Did you find that as awkward as I did?\" Amanda asked finally. Tuck cracked a smile a minute later. \"I'm sorry,\" Tuck said. \"That was…\" Amanda smiled in response. \"It's not a big deal. I take it you didn't know she was seeing someone?\" she asked. Tuck shook his head. \"Would you like some of my wine?\" she asked, pushing her glass towards him. \"And not to keep talking about it, but I feel like I know that guy.\" Tuck raised his eyebrow at her. \"From where?\" \"I don't know,\" Amanda said. \"I can't place him. But he looks so familiar.\" Across the restaurant, from the direction that Katie and Travis had been seated, came a shriek. \"Of course I'm saying yes!\" a voice, that Tuck instantly recognized as Katie's, yelled. The restaurant was applauding before Tuck even processed what had just happened. Amanda saw the look on his face and knew it was time to leave. \"Let's get out of here,\" she told him. Their recon on Yencich was a bust, they might as well go. She saw the look of concern on his face and told herself that it wasn't smart to be jealous of this other woman. Katie would always be the mother of his son and Tuck was hurt because Katie had failed to mention any of this to him. \"Yeah, let's go,\" he mumbled. He threw several hundred dollar bills on the dining table from his wallet and then took Amanda by the arm. His hand moved to the small of her back again to direct her out of the restaurant and for a minute it all felt incredibly real to her. The sun had completely set by the time they'd left the restaurant and the air had become about ten degrees cooler than it had been. The night air hit Amanda's bare legs and instantly she was covered in goose bumps. She silently chided herself for not thinking ahead and wearing something a little more covered up. She didn't want to shiver in front of him, but she couldn't help it. \"C'mon, we'll get in the car and I'll take you home,\" Tuck said, noticing the bumps on her body. She waved him off. \"Let's go get a drink.\" \"I should call FDR,\" Tuck said. \"Let him know he can go home.\" \"Just text him,\" Amanda said softly as she put her hand on his arm. \"All right,\" Tuck said. … Three hours later, Tuck was walking Amanda up the path to her front door. Both had a lot to drink and there was danger of Amanda breaking an ankle in her sky-high heels. \"Shh,\" Amanda said, putting her finger over his lips to quiet him. They were both laughing like children and they couldn't seem to stop. \"We'll wake up the girls.\" They had talked about everything during their time at the bar. His relationship with Katie and her last boyfriend mishap. They'd even gotten on the topic of raising children. There had been some harmless flirting and touching at the bar, but once they'd gotten into the backseat of their ride for the night, that's when it all really started. They were sitting right next to each other and Tuck was tracing lines on the inside of her thigh, right above her kneecap and Amanda had unbuttoned Tuck's shirt just enough to make out the tattoo on his upper chest. She used her own fingers to trace the letters. Amanda was remembering all of that when fumbled with her keys and dropped them on the doorstep. She laughed again and bent down to grab them. When she'd straightened up, Tuck was looking right into her eyes. He braced his hands on either side of her head on the door frame. Amanda's hand went to the back of his neck and instantaneously they were kissing. Tuck was pressed against her and she was sandwiched between him and the door. The agency car that had brought them home laughed and shook his head before driving the SUV away. In her inebriated state, Amanda forgot about the security camera that would be watching them and she had somehow managed to turn on the mic that Tuck was still wearing. \"Your ride just left,\" she breathed hard. His left hand slid down her side and stopped at her hip. \"Let's go inside,\" he said into her ear. He had somehow managed to get the door unlocked and it opened into the expanse of the house. It was a terrible idea to bring Tuck into the house with the girls, and Jeanne, asleep in their rooms. And had Amanda been in her right mind, she would have realized that. Instead, she was acting like a rebellious teenager and quietly shut and locked the door behind Tuck before turning off the porch lights. Soundlessly, she led him through the house and to her bedroom, locking that door behind them as well. To Be Continued… … A/N: so what did you think? Let me know![Chapter 5] A New War Chapter 5 A soft knocking on the door woke Tuck from his pleasant slumber. Before he opened his eyes, he felt a hand on his chest and a warm body pressed against his. The knocking didn't stop and he finally opened his eyes. He was shirtless and shoe-less, but still dressed otherwise. The body lying next to him was Amanda. Her blouse was un-tucked and unbuttoned, revealing her lacy bra, and her high heel shoes were kicked off somewhere, but she was still otherwise dressed, too. The knocking grew more impatient, but Amanda didn't stir. They had a lot to drink last night. Tuck looked at her sleeping and almost didn't want to wake her up. But a voice was calling on the other side of the door now. \"Mandy!\" a small voice called. \"Hey,\" Tuck whispered in her ear. \"You're wanted outside of this room.\" Amanda's blue eyes flashed open instantly at the sound of Tuck's voice in her ear combined with his warm breath on her neck. The hand she had on his chest drew back immediately and there was now a foot of bed between them. \"What?\" she asked as she held her head in her hands. Amanda had promised herself that she wasn't going to drink enough to get a hangover ever again, and somehow, she'd broken her rule. Her eyes washed over Tuck, who was still only half dressed and lying on the bed not far from her. She was fairly certain, after inspecting their clothing situation that they had only slept together. Tuck's body was as amazing as she thought it would be and she had a vague recollection of helping him take his shirt off. She suspected that her shirt was open because of Tuck's handiwork. \"Mandy!\" the voice on the other side of the door yelled again. \"Are you dead?\" she called. \"No, Soph,\" Amanda called. \"I'm not dead.\" \"Is that guy still here?\" Sophie asked. Amanda's eyes went wide in disbelief over what her niece had just said. \"Uh…\" \"You'd better come to the kitchen. Cammy is watching the TV with you on it,\" Sophie said. \"Holy shit,\" Amanda whispered hoarsely. \"The security camera.\" \"What security camera?\" Tuck asked. Amanda ducked her head and stared at her lap. \"The one at the front door.\" Suddenly the memories of their make-out session at the front door only a few hours ago flooded back into both of their minds. \"I'll be right out!\" Amanda called. \"Do you have a plan?\" Tuck asked as he stood from the bed. He needed to find his shirt; it couldn't have gotten too far. \"Well, I'm not going to ask you to go out the window, if that's what you're asking,\" she smirked as she buttoned her blouse back up. \"Everything aside, Amanda, I had a good time last night,\" Tuck said. \"You were drunk; you don't remember anything,\" Amanda pointed out. She walked to her closet and pulled out a pair of grey yoga pants. She started to unbutton her shorts and got incredibly self-conscious standing in front of Tuck. He simply smiled at her before turning and facing the opposite wall. \"How do you know I don't remember anything?\" he asked. \"You were pretty hammered yourself, ma'am.\" Amanda groaned in disgust. \"Don't call me ma'am . And I know you don't remember anything because I don't remember much.\" Tuck ran a hand through his hair and then noticed something on the floor. The mic he'd clipped to himself had come undone from his shirt. He picked it up and inspected it. It had switched itself on, but it probably did that when it fell off. He clicked it off and stuck it in his pocket. \"Is it okay if I use your bathroom?\" he asked. \"Of course,\" she replied. \"Its right there,\" she pointed to the en suite bathroom. He started to walk towards the bathroom, but he stopped right in front of her. He put his hands on her hips and looked straight into her eyes. \"I really did have a lovely time last night,\" Tuck said. \"Really. And not just the stuff at the end of the night. The getting to know you part,\" he explained. He kissed her chastely on the lips before walking into the bathroom and closing the door behind himself. Amanda's toes curled despite the innocent kiss. It was clear: she'd fallen hard for Tuck. But what was she going to do now? \"I'm going to go talk to the girls,\" Amanda called through the door. She didn't wait for a response; she hurried out of the bedroom. Amanda made the short trip down to the kitchen and there were four expectant faces waiting for her and the security TV was paused on the frame when Tuck and Amanda were making out. \"Who is he?\" Alex asked. \"How long have you known him?\" Sophie asked. \"And when you get married, can I be in the wedding?\" \"Did you sleep with him last night?\" Cam asked disapprovingly. \"He's a work colleague and a friend, Alex. And, if and when I get married, which isn't happening anytime soon, of course, you can be in the wedding,\" Amanda answered. \"I'm going to have a purples dress. Is that okay?\" Sophie asked. Amanda nodded and smiled at her youngest niece. There just wasn't a filter there yet and it was still precious on a small child. \"You didn't answer my question,\" Cam pointed out. She was too smart and too observant for her age. \"No, I didn't. Because you don't need an answer.\" \"You not answering is actually an answer,\" Cam replied. \"Young lady…\" \"What?\" she spat back. \"You can have a guy in your room all night, but I can't even go to the movies, in public, with a boy?\" Tuck had unfortunately chosen that particular moment to walk into the room. \"Um, hi,\" he said sheepishly as all eyes turned to him. He flashed all the girls his brilliant smile and Cam's angry face changed; her jaw dropped slightly. \"Good for you, honey,\" Jeanne smirked. \"I'm Jeanne. I'm the girls' nanny. And I should be getting home.\" Jeanne didn't wait for him to introduce himself, she headed for the door. \"Thank you for staying over, Jeanne. I really appreciate it,\" Amanda said. Jeanne smiled. \"Anytime, dear. You know that.\" \"Oh, by the way: this is Tuck,\" Amanda said to introduce them. Jeanne shook his extended hand and smiled at him. \"Don't let these girls scare ya. She's worth it.\" Amanda looked horrified for a minute while Jeanne spoke to Tuck. Jeanne let herself out and Tuck turned his attention back to the pajama-clad bunch of girls. The oldest was trying to smooth down her hair and the youngest regarded him like he was an alien. Clearly Amanda hadn't brought anyone home before. Tuck kind of liked that bit. Tuck turned to the youngest girl and crouched down. \"You must be Sophie.\" Sophie nodded enthusiastically. She was thrilled that someone already knew who she was. \"Are you going to ask Mandy to marry you?\" she asked. Amanda looked horrified again and Tuck chuckled. \"Not today, I don't think, but I'll make sure I check with you before I do. Is that okay?\" Sophie nodded again. \"Sound good.\" \"I'm Tuck,\" he said, as he held out his hand to her. \"Tuck's a funny name,\" Sophie said as she shook his hand. \"My real name is John, but everyone calls me Tuck,\" he replied. \"Oh,\" Sophie said, wide-eyed. He then stood to full height to look at Alex. \"You would be Alexandra,\" he said. Amanda looked at her two older nieces and was fairly certain they both swooned at his accent. Shy as ever, though, Alex only nodded at him in response. \"That makes you, Cameron,\" he said, turning to the oldest. \"Don't be too angry with your aunt; it was a last minute situation. And she was kind enough to offer me a place to stay when I needed it. We thought it was best if I stayed somewhere where I wouldn't scare any of you ladies,\" he explained. Cameron simply nodded this time, too. Her whole argument with her aunt was over. She was transfixed on Tuck. \"If you girls go get dressed, I'll take everyone out to breakfast,\" Amanda told them. \"Pete's Pancakes?\" Sophie asked. \"Uh, duh?\" Amanda said, smiling. All three girls took off for their rooms. \"Thank you,\" Amanda said as they leaned on the kitchen counter. \"Gotta love kids,\" Tuck replied. \"Sophie has zero filter,\" Amanda said. \"And she'll ask any question that pops into her little head. Her dad is kind of like that. And Cameron, well, she's just like her mother. She even has my sister's disapproving stare down pat.\" There was a little of an awkward silence between the two of them. Amanda hurried up and spoke. \"So, if you want to, you can come to breakfast with us. But I wouldn't blame you if you didn't want to,\" Amanda said. \"But you are invited.\" \"You are not selling this well,\" Tuck replied. \"But I'm still game.\" \"Good decision. Pete's Pancakes has the best buttermilk pancakes in the entire world. Have you ever been there?\" Tuck shook his head. \"Nope, but I love pancakes. The entire world , you say?\" \"I've done extensive research in the field of pancakes, Mr. Hansen,\" Amanda laughed. \"And you're in for a treat.\" … At the restaurant, the five of them sat down for their meals. \"So, how did you meet Aunt Mandy?\" Cameron asked. Amanda shot her a dirty look, but Cameron was unaffected by her aunt's stare. Tuck finished chewing his pancakes and swallowed before wiping his mouth with a napkin. \"I met your aunt through my work,\" Tuck explained. \"Tuck is a travel agent,\" Amanda chimed in. \"He's using the law firm for contracts; you know, work stuff.\" \"A travel agent?\" Cameron asked in a sarcastic tone. \"Yes,\" Tuck replied. \"That sounds almost as bad as Mandy's job,\" Cameron announced. \"Cameron!\" Amanda scolded her. \"It's one thing to mock me, but to talk to Tuck like that, a stranger to you, it's just plain rude…\" \"Its fine, Amanda,\" Tuck said. \"She's just expressing her opinion.\" \"Thank you,\" Cameron replied in a satisfied voice. Someone finally took her side in an argument. Amanda rolled her eyes in response, but was choosing her battles a little more wisely. \"Is there anything interesting about being a travel agent?\" Cameron asked. \"Ah, well, I do actually travel,\" Tuck replied. \"I'm confused, so maybe you can clear this up,\" Cameron began and Amanda braced herself for the coming statement. \"You've never said anything about having friends, and you never said anything about having a boyfriend. So, what is he to you?\" \"What?\" Amanda asked before staring open-mouthed at her niece. All three girls stared at her expectantly, waiting for an answer. \"I'm hoping she'll agree to date me, but I'm not so sure she'll say yes,\" Tuck said. \"Hopefully you'll all agree to help me convince her otherwise.\" The humor was lost on the girls, but Amanda smirked down into her plate of pancakes. After breakfast, Amanda dropped Tuck back off at his apartment. He decided not to make it awkward and he climbed out of the mini-van without saying much. He smiled in her direction and she gave a half-wave before pulling the car away. … … The rest of the weekend passed and it was too busy for Tuck and Amanda to keep in contact. Monday morning, Tuck rolled in to the CIA field office bright and early and made his way to his desk. FDR was already waiting for him. \"You're in early, mate,\" Tuck said, smiling as he removed his suit jacket. FDR smiled slyly. \"Well, Bothwick called me after he came in. He was reviewing some of the audio files from the recon that you and Amanda were working on.\" \"Oh?\" Tuck replied. \"Something in the background? Why didn't he call me?\" \"Is there something you want to tell me? Maybe about what you all did after the restaurant?\" FDR prodded. Tuck smoothed his tie out and sat down in his desk chair. \"We went to the bar for a drink. You know that, but we turned off the mic.\" \"How about after the bar?\" Tuck shook his head then realization suddenly flooded over him. \"Listen, Franklin…\" Tuck began. FDR was laughing too hard and held his hands up. \"No, no, good for you, man,\" he said. \"Seriously, Amanda is a very beautiful woman and she's good for you. And it sounds like it was a good time.\" \"It didn't go as far as you thought it did,\" Tuck said. \"How many people have heard the audio? I want to keep this as quiet as possible.\" \"That isn't how you felt Saturday night,\" FDR replied. Tuck gave him a look, but didn't say anything. \"I made sure Bothwick and I were the only ones who would hear it,\" FDR said, smiling. \"Did you have a good time?\" Tuck wasn't going to dignify the question with an answer, but he nodded. \"But nothing happened. We fell asleep…I think,\" Tuck said, smiling. \"You're sure you and Bothwick were the only ones to hear the audio?\" FDR nodded. \"Tuck, as soon as Agent Simons arrives I want to see you both in my office,\" Collins called unexpectedly from the railing above them. Tuck's smile immediately faded. \"Uh-oh,\" FDR said. \"You got called to the principal's office.\" \"Thanks, mate,\" Tuck replied. How was he going to tell Amanda about this? … Please review. Thanks![Chapter 6] A New War Six Amanda and Tuck were equal shades of red when they were finally released from Collins' office. Her eyes were on the floor as she exited and she rushed away as quickly as she could from the entire situation. Tuck had been about to say something to her, an apology, but she was gone and out of sight. Tuck walked silently back to his desk and he looked at FDR helplessly. \"Where is Amanda?\" FDR asked. \"Well, I had hoped she had come back here,\" Tuck answered as he sat down in his chair. \"Should I ask how the meeting went?\" his best friend smirked. \"Well, it could have gone a lot worse,\" Tuck told him. \"That's all I get?\" \"Collins doesn't want this to affect our work, like another event affected you and I previously,\" Tuck explained. \"Oh,\" FDR replied. \"I would feel better if I knew where Amanda had gone. I didn't think it was so bad. Just a tad embarrassing,\" Tuck said. \"Sounds like you had a good time,\" FDR said. \"How much did you have to drink? Whiskey again?\" \"Worse. Tequila.\" \"You got a girl to drink tequila with you on the first date?\" FDR asked. \"Shit, she drank me under the table. That woman can hold her liquor,\" Tuck smiled. \"And she felt bad for me.\" \"Sounds like a perfect combination: lots of alcohol and pity,\" FDR laughed. \"Why was she feeling sorry for you?\" \"How could you have already forgotten?\" Tuck asked. \"Oh, yeah. Katie and that guy ,\" FDR said in a conspiratorial tone. \"They got engaged, Franklin,\" Tuck said seriously. \"I didn't even know she was seeing anyone.\" \"So?\" \" So? That's all you have to say?\" Tuck asked. \"It wasn't working between you and her. It is working with Amanda. So, buy them a shit wedding gift, like a salad spinner…\" \"We had one. She got it in the divorce,\" Tuck grumbled. \"Okay, remote control caddy. Something as equally as useless as a salad spinner. Then you can wish them well and flaunt Amanda at the wedding. All eyes will be on my child and wife and your date.\" \"What other nonsense do you feel like spouting?\" Tuck asked. \"I say, tell Amanda that you want her despite whatever specifics Collins mentioned in the meeting. You like her . Don't screw this up. And don't let this Katie thing get in your head more than it already has.\" A moment later, Amanda came strolling through the space between the desks. Tuck took another minute to admire her figure clad in a bright blue knee-length pencil skirt and black cowl neck sweater. It was a welcome change to the drab suits that most wore in the office. His eyesight continued up her body and he realized that she was grinning like the Cheshire cat. \"You look more a lot happier than you did a few minutes ago,\" Tuck said. Amanda raised an eyebrow and smiled. \"I feel happier than I did a few minutes ago.\" Amanda smoothed out her skirt as she sat in her very own desk chair and FDR noticed her bloody knuckles. \"What's wrong with your hand?\" he asked. Amanda looked down at her left hand then back up to the men on either side of her. \"I took care of an issue for the agency,\" Amanda said. A moment later, an agent, one fairly new to the west coast agency was being lead down to corridor in handcuffs. She was dressed in one of the drab suits that Tuck had been thinking of earlier. She had the beginnings of a black eye forming and she had blood on her face and on her white button up. \"Isn't that Nancy Wallace?\" FDR asked, standing from his chair. Tuck also stood and smoothed his tie down the front of him reflexively. \"Yes,\" Amanda said, not standing up. \"What happened?\" Tuck asked. \"She got her ass kicked, man,\" FDR laughed. \"I did it for you, Tuck!\" the woman in cuffs called down the corridor to them. Tuck's brow furrowed in confusion and FDR erupted into laughter as he sat back down. \"Only you, dude. Only you,\" FDR continued to laugh. \"Would you care to explain this to me?\" Tuck turned to Amanda. Amanda was busy filling out an incident report detailing the situation that had just occurred. She said nothing. She still did not look up when Boyles dashed in and stopped in the middle of their grouping of desks. \"What?\" Tuck asked. He was still confused as to what was going on. \"Did you tell them what happened?\" Boyles asked happened. She looked up from her paperwork and fixed him with an evil look. \"Someone needs to tell me,\" Tuck said. \"Come on; out with it.\" \"She sucker-punched Wallace,\" Boyles said. \"Harder than I've ever seen a woman hit something.\" \"Why?\" Tuck asked her. \"What was Wallace saying about me?\" \"She's the reason that the audio from Saturday night was leaked to the entire Agency,\" Amanda said. \"Apparently, Wallace was, is , obsessed with you and she didn't like what happened,\" Amanda explained. \"Oh,\" tuck said. \"Um…\" \"That's ridiculous!\" FDR said. \"She got into a fist fight for you.\" \"From all accounts, it wasn't much of a fight,\" Boyles said. \"It was more like she Hulked-out and smashed.\" Amanda cocked an eyebrow up, but said nothing. \"Manda Smash?\" FDR laughed. \"You know that part in the Avengers movie when the Hulk picks up Loki and tosses him around like a ragdoll?\" Boyles asked. Both Tuck and FDR asked. \"I might have some slight anger management issues,\" Amanda told them. \"Well, as long as you didn't go Bane on her and break her back,\" FDR said. \"Nah, she was still walking. Besides, just because she's a tech-wiz doesn't mean she's Batman,\" Amanda said. \"Not everyone can be Batman,\" Tuck replied, agreeing with her. \"Sometimes it's more fun to be the villain anyway, right?\" she asked. \"I don't think you were much of a villain. You were defending my honor,\" Tuck said. \"I'm sure I'll get some kind of demerit, citation, something, for breaking a co-worker's nose, but all in a day's work, I suppose,\" Amanda said. Bothwick came up to their desks next and stopped next to Amanda. \"Collins wants you in her office, again,\" he smiled. Amanda rolled her eyes. \"Called to the principal's office twice in one morning. Well, it was nice knowing all of you,\" she said. \"Hey, maybe there's a medal involved,\" FDR called after her. … Amanda sat down in the chair opposite Collins for the second time since she'd gotten to work that morning. \"Did you go around hitting your co-workers at the office in DC, too?\" Collins asked without any amusement in her voice. \"Not regularly,\" Amanda replied, equally as emotionless. \"I'm sorry. I lost control for a moment. And she, well, was bat-shit crazy.\" \"I know,\" Collins replied. \"IT just took her computer files apart. She's been virtually stalking Agent Hansen for about four years. I don't usually thank my agents for putting others in hospitals or handcuffs, but you did good this time,\" Collins explained. Amanda's jaw must have fallen open, because Collins continued. \"What, did you think I was going to fire your ass?\" she asked. Amanda nodded. \"To be perfectly honest, yes. Yes, I did.\" \"I probably should, but I'm not going to. At least, not today.\" Amanda breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thank you. Oh my god, thank you,\" she said. \"I'd hug you, but I figure that might get me fired for real.\" Collins finally smiled. \"It might. Okay, now get out of my office. And don't hit anyone else under my employment today. Also, if you suspect anyone else is crazy, can you just talk to me first? Then swing?\" Amanda stood and nodded at her boss. \"Sure thing,\" Amanda said. \"Thank you again,\" she said before hurriedly exiting the woman's office. … Elsewhere… \"That's going to be a long, drawn-out process,\" the man said. \"Are you sure that's what you want to do?\" \"Are you really questioning my plans?\" the other man asked. \"Mr. Leonid, of course not,\" Yencich replied back. \"I'm just concerned…\" \"I don't like the word concerned . It means you don't trust me. And I don't like that fact even more.\" Yencich shook his head and held up his hands. \"Of course I trust you! I owe you my life,\" Yencich replied. \"You know that.\" \"Then you should show your faith in me,\" Leonid said. \"And Travis Stemworth will be marrying Katie. And Katie's ex-husband is a CIA agent. One of the CIA agents that killed Heinrich.\" Yencich nodded. Yes, he knew that. \"We spoke to him and his lady friend this past weekend, sir,\" Yencich told him. \"As did I,\" Leonid said in an annoyed voice. \"We can infiltrate the family and take them out, one by one. The woman is also an agent; after doing a little research, turns out she's the one who brought in Vladimir.\" \"I want to take down the agents that took down my friend,\" Leonid said. \"The organization hasn't been the same since Heinrich died. Hansen and Foster are going to pay for it. And so are all the people close to them,\" he finished. Leonid started to hang pictures on the corkboard next to him. \"These are obviously Hansen and Foster,\" he said, pointing. \"This is the woman, Amanda Simons. Foster's wife,\" he said as he hung up a picture of Lauren Foster. \"She's pregnant with their first child. Simons has custody of her three nieces.\" He hung up a picture of Amanda with the three girls. \"This is Katie and her son with Hansen.\" \"We're taking everyone out? Even the children?\" Yencich asked. \"We'll see,\" Leonid said coldly. \"I need you to find me someone to be my best man. Since I'm pretending to be American, get me an actual American or someone who can act as well as I can,\" he finished. \"I can't do it, sir?\" he asked. \"It would be easier if we didn't have to train someone else.\" He shook his head. \"No, they know you. They're watching you,\" Leonid explained. \"You'll have to remain unseen from now on.\" Leonid removed the gun from his suit jacket and aimed at Yencich. \"No, no; please don't,\" Yencich begged. Leonid squeezed the trigger and the bullet hit Yencich in the leg. He screamed in pain as he collapsed to the floor and clutched his now bleeding-profusely leg. He looked up at his boss and gave him a pleading look. \"I feel better now,\" Leonid said before stalking away, leaving his right-hand man bleeding on the floor. … \"What do you mean, he spent the night with her?\" Lauren asked. She washed the lettuce in the sink and proceeded to put it in the salad spinner that she and FDR had received for their own wedding. \"You use that?\" FDR asked. \"Yes,\" Lauren replied. \"Now what were you saying about Tuck?\" she asked. \"Oh, well, the night that we were supposed to be doing recon? Well, Katie and her boyfriend happened to be at the same restaurant that our mark and his girlfriend were going to. And Katie and her boyfriend got engaged.\" \"No shit!\" Lauren said. She smacked her husband in the upper arm. \"How did you not tell me this?!\" she yelled. \"That guy is so good to her.\" \"You knew she was seeing someone?\" FDR asked, remembering that Tuck had no clue. \"Well, yeah,\" Lauren smiled. \"You didn't?\" \"No. And neither did Tuck.\" \"But what happened with Amanda?\" Lauren asked. Tuck sat down on one of the barstools and watched his wife drain the water from the bottom of the salad spinner. FDR had moved into Lauren's house; it made more sense than having Lauren move into his bachelor pad. While he missed the pool ceiling, climbing into bed with his wife every night was so much better. Who'd have thought? \"Apparently, they got really drunk and then almost had sex,\" FDR told her. Lauren stopped and looked at him. \"Almost?\" \"Well, I guess they passed out,\" FDR said. \"Sounds like something you'd do,\" Lauren remarked. \"I told you; that was a well-aimed tranquilizer dart. I think I've proven, on many occasions, that I don't fall asleep like that,\" he said as he moved from the stool to her side. His hand found the roundness of her baby belly and he rubbed it. \"Countless times,\" Lauren replied. \"So, how did you find out about this? Because having known Tuck for some time, he doesn't strike me as the kind of guy that would divulge something like this that you would hold over his head forever.\" \"By accident. Somehow in their…well, whatever exactly they were doing, they ended up turning the mic back on that Tuck'd been wearing,\" FDR said, taking a bite of a carrot. \"It got leaked to the entire branch by some crazy woman who worked in the IT department. Apparently she's been stalking Tuck for years.\" \"Shit,\" Lauren said. \"So, Tuck and Amanda spent the night together and then had breakfast together with the girls the next morning. And today, Amanda punched that woman who leaked the audio. Like, broke her nose and everything.\" \"Did you do any actual work?\" Lauren asked. \"Define: work,\" FDR replied. \"I did agree to a trip out to Nana's house this weekend.\" \"That sounds great,\" Lauren said. \"The weather is supposed to be great.\" \"And I convinced Amanda to bring the girls and Tuck's going to bring Joe,\" FDR said. \"Get this: it's an engagement party for Katie.\" \"I think you'll like her fiancé,\" Lauren said. \"He's really great.\" \"Well, I trust your opinion,\" FDR said. \"After all, you picked me.\" … Author's Note: thanks to everyone who's been reading and reviewing. This little one right here is getting a better response than I could have hoped! Thanks in advance. Review, please?[Chapter 7] A New War Seven \"I suppose if you don't want to go to the party and have fun and meet some new people, you don't have to. I'll ask if Jeanne can come over tomorrow,\" Amanda said. \"But if she can't you'll have to go with me and Sophie.\" \"Fine. I'm sure Jeanne will say yes,\" Cameron said. \"I hope for your sake that she does,\" Amanda replied back. \"An engagement party for people I don't know sounds sucky,\" Cameron announced. Cam had done nothing but complain since her aunt had mentioned the party. In fact, her mood had soured Alex's and now Sophie was the only one who wanted to go with Amanda. Cam had tried to convince her baby sister otherwise, but Soph liked any reason to put on a party dress. \"I have homework to do,\" Alex said as Amanda turned her attention to her. \"On a Saturday afternoon?\" \"It's a diorama,\" Alex said. \"You can't do it today, when you're off of school?\" \"Nope.\" \"All right. I'll ask Jeanne when she gets here,\" Amanda told them. \"Can I wear my pink dress?\" Sophie asked. \"If you're talking about your princess costume from Halloween, the answer is no, honey.\" Sophie looked disappointed. \"But isn't someone getting married? Don't you get really dressed up for weddings?\" \"Oh, Soph; they aren't getting married tomorrow. It's just an engagement party to celebrate that they will be getting married eventually,\" Cameron told her. \"Oh,\" Sophie said, her face still a mask of confusion. \"Who is actually getting married?\" Alex asked from behind her book. \"Where are you glasses?\" Amanda asked. \"Cam said they make me look like a geek. So I don't want to wear them anymore,\" Alex replied in a tone very similar to her older sister's. \"Oh, fifteen year old Cameron Lee McCoy is now the authority on what is cool and what isn't?\" Amanda asked. \"You're going to ruin your eyes if you don't wear them. I wear glasses sometimes. Am I geeky?\" \"If the pocket protector fits…\" Cameron mumbled under her breath. \"Okay! I've had enough of your bad attitude this week, Cameron. You will not be going out with your friends tonight,\" Amanda said. She was starting to lose her temper and she tried her best to reign it all in. Jeanne opened the door to the house as Cameron sprinted past her and up the stairs. A second later, they all heard a door slam closed. \"Looks like it's going to be a good day,\" Jeanne said. \"Good morning, Jeanne. Sorry about that,\" Amanda said. \"Coffee?\" \"Oh, no thanks. I have a bet going with my husband. He's going to quit smoking if I quit coffee,\" Jeanne explained. \"I think that's very good of him,\" Amanda said. \"We also want to save up for a trip to Bora Bora.\" \"Where's Bora Bora?\" Sophie asked. \"It's an island in the Pacific ocean,\" Jeanne told her. \"The water is clear and you can stay in a house on stilts above the water.\" \"Can I go, too?\" \"No, Soph,\" Amanda said. \"That'll just be a trip for Jeanne and her husband. Bernie, right?\" \"Yup; good guy. Worked for the phone company for a million years or so until he decided he could hear telephones ringing in his sleep. Turns out all the ringing in his ears was just him needing hearing aids, but that's neither here nor there,\" Jeanne laughed. \"So, how's your cute Englishman?\" Amanda laughed. \"Well, he's not mine, but…\" \"He seemed like he was yours last weekend,\" Jeanne replied. Jeanne opened the fridge and pulled out a carton of orange juice. She poured herself a glass and replaced the carton. \"Tuck is a nice guy,\" Amanda said. She felt her face get hot. \"You're blushing,\" Jeanne shouted. \"Look, Sophie, your aunt Mandy has a crush on Tuck.\" \"Mandy and Tuck, sitting in a tree…\" Jeanne started to sing and laugh. \"I'm going to tell him tomorrow!\" Sophie yelled. \"I'm gonna tell him!\" Amanda laughed. \"No, you won't, little girl.\" \"Tomorrow is the engagement party, right?\" Jeanne asked. \"Have you and Cameron told your aunt you don't want to go?\" she asked Alex. Alex moved the book away from her face. \"Um…\" \"Wait, they told you first?\" Amanda asked. \"Yes, they asked if I could come stay with them tomorrow while you were out with Sophie,\" Jeanne said. \"I don't mind if you don't.\" \"I don't want to take Cam with her lousy attitude, but it sounds like an amazing punishment right now.\" \"No!\" Alex shouted. \"Please don't make us go. Who is even getting married?\" \"It's Tuck's ex-wife, Katie,\" Amanda said. \"Tuck's been married before? That's gross. Find someone else,\" Alex said. \"You don't get an opinion on who I date, young lady. Any more attitude like that and you'll be in your room with no TV,\" Amanda told her. Amanda turned to Jeanne to confirm this and she nodded her understanding. \"I expect you to get your chores done today. As always, Jeanne is in charge and I trust you will both be respectful of her.\" Both girls nodded at her. \"I was thinking beach day,\" Jeanne told them. \"After your chores, of course.\" \"I'm going to chat with Cam for a second. If she can act like a polite young woman, she can go with you. Otherwise, I don't think a beach day is a good idea,\" Amanda said. \"Of course.\" Amanda climbed the stairs and walked to Cam's room. Amanda knocked and she received no objection, so she opened the door. \"What?\" Cameron hissed. \"Hey, I don't know what's gotten into you, but you can knock it off anytime, darling. I did this whole rebellious thing when I was younger and trust me, it's exhausting. Okay, I'm not the cool aunt and you don't a pep talk.\" Cameron blinked silently at her. \"So, buck up, Cam. Because you don't have to go tomorrow and Jeanne says she take to the beach today.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Cam said to her aunt. \"Me, too. Now, I have to leave for work. You have a good day. Enjoy your day off from school.\" Amanda walked out of the room and closed the door behind her. … Saturday morning rolled around and Sophie was dressed in her finest. \"Soph, the frilly socks are too much,\" Amanda said. \"It's hot outside.\" \"But they match my dress and my white shoes.\" \"We're going to be outside all day; white shoes are a bad idea. What about your sandals?\" \"Not that I care,\" Cameron started. \"But what are you going to wear?\" \"I was thinking my blue dress,\" Amanda said. Her niece was convinced she had zero style; her niece also didn't know that Amanda kept a whole different closet full of clothing hidden from her. \"That floor-length sundress with the swirls on it?\" Cameron asked. \"Can't you wear something form-fitting or are you Amish now?\" \"Oh, don't spare my feelings,\" Amanda said sarcastically. \"It's a party, right? Wear a party dress,\" Cameron told her. \"Hold on one second.\" She left the room and returned with a dress in her hand. \"I'm not wearing one of your dresses. It won't fit; I'll look ridiculous.\" \"Dad bought it for me. It's too big on me and too long. I was going to have it shortened, but I won't ever fill it out,\" Cameron told her. \"You're a perfectly normal girl. And you will fill out in time. Your mom was a painfully late bloomer,\" Amanda smiled. \"Just try it on,\" Cam told her. Amanda took the hanger and inspected the garment. It was turquoise with a slight sheen. It was fitted through the body and it flaired out at the hip. The dress was on the hanger with clear straps. No wonder she was concerned; it was a strapless dress. \"Your dad bought you this?\" Amanda asked. \"Yes,\" Cameron said. \"I think he was trying to make me feel better about mom. He forgot that he had no idea what I liked to wear.\" \"All right, I'll try it. But I need your word that you won't make fun of me,\" Amanda told her. Amanda stepped inside of her bathroom and emerged just a second later, dressed in the garment offered to her by her niece. \"You're…\" \"I know, it's awful right?\" \"No, Mandy,\" Cam said. \"You look great. Really pretty. Hey, Alex, Sophie, come here!\" A minute later, the other two girls rushed into Amanda's bedroom followed by Jeanne. Jeanne let out a wolf whistle and Amanda rolled her eyes. \"Seriously, don't lie to me.\" \"Dad should have bought that dress for you,\" Cam said. \"It's never going to look that good on me.\" \"I'm sure it looks great on you, Cammy,\" Amanda told her niece. \"The world will never know because the dress is yours now,\" Cam told her. \"Just promise me you'll wear your hair down.\" \"Oh, I don't…\" \"Yes, hair down,\" Jeanne said. \"All eyes are going to be on you, my dear. Tuck isn't going to be able to keep his hands to himself.\" \"Oh, ew!\" Cameron said. \"Gross. Boys are so gross,\" Sophie said. Alex nodded at her littlest sister, but then looked to Cameron. \"Boys aren't gross, but thinking about Mandy and Tuck grosses me out. You're like…old,\" Cameron said. \"I'm like twenty-eight. Which isn't even twice your age,\" Amanda pointed out. \"Despite the fact that Tuck is amazingly hot, it doesn't change the fact that you're my aunt and I don't want to think about you having sex.\" Amanda blushed bright red and so did Alex. Jeanne stifled a giggle unsuccessfully and Sophie looked around at everyone like she just missed the punch line of a joke. \"What's sex?\" she asked. \"We'll tell you when you're older,\" Amanda told her. Sophie pouted then looked at her aunt again. \"Can I wear my dress that's that same color? I want to match you,\" Sophie said. \"You got it,\" Amanda said. \"I'll come help ya,\" Jeanne said. \"Don't you dare put your hair up. And get some heels on those feet.\" \"Alex and I will make sure she's good,\" Cameron said. … \"I don't like him, dad,\" Joe said. Tuck and his son Joe were waiting outside of Nana Foster's house for the rest of their group. The party had begun in the backyard, but FDR and Lauren weren't there yet and neither were Amanda and her niece. Tuck was nervous. Nana was meeting Amanda for the first time. \"Why not? He seems…all right,\" Tuck said. He didn't really like him either, but for a totally different reason. \"He's weird.\" \" Everyone is weird, my son. Your mom, uh, loves him, so we all have to be nice to him because he's going to be part of the family.\" \"Have you met him?\" Joe asked. \"Once.\" \"Did he have an accent then?\" Joe asked. Tuck stopped pacing and looked at his son. \"No. What kind of an accent did you hear from him? Like mine?\" \"No. It was while he was talking on his phone to someone. And sometimes I couldn't understand what he was saying at all. Like…\" \"Like he was speaking another language?\" Tuck asked. \"Yeah. Like another language.\" \"Hm,\" was all Tuck said. He wanted to investigate further, but two vehicles arrived right after one another and parked. \"They're here,\" Tuck said. \"Who is this lady you said was coming?\" Joe asked. \"A work colleague,\" Tuck replied. \"Does she work with you like Uncle Frank does?\" he asked. Tuck remembered that the girls didn't know what Amanda did for a living. \"No, I know her from somewhere else. And don't talk to Amanda's nieces about what your Uncle Frank and I do for a living. That might scare them a little.\" Joe rolled his eyes. \"Come on, its super cool!\" \"No, not today,\" Tuck said. \"All right, fine,\" Joe said quietly. A short distance away, FDR was out of their car and he was helping Lauren out of the passenger side. Joe rushed towards them and Lauren hugged him. Tuck's attention moved to a vision in a blue dress. Her dark hair was blowing in the breeze and it caught the hem of her dress slightly. She pushed it down and then went back to work getting something out of the backseat of her car. Tuck recognized Amanda's youngest niece, Sophie, emerge from the back of the car in a dress in almost precisely the same color. Tuck chuckled to himself and moved towards them. Instead of greeting Amanda first, he bent down and kissed the back of Sophie's hand. \"Why mademoiselle, don't you look lovely today?\" he said. Sophie giggled like mad and semi-hid behind Amanda. \"You could probably read the phone book and make it sound sexy with an accent like that,\" Amanda said. She realized that she didn't filter what she'd said. After the situation the previous Monday, Tuck and Amanda had spent a lot of their time trying not to flirt with one another, but it wasn't working. They had tried to ignore their growing feelings for one another, but the two of them always seemed to be at each other's side. Today, Tuck was looking at her like he was going to devour her. Lauren, FDR and Joe walked up to the Tuck, Amanda and Sophie. \"Hey, Sophie,\" Tuck said. \"This is my son, Joe. He's just a couple years older than you. Joe, this is Sophie, Amanda's niece. And this is Amanda.\" \"It's nice to meet you, Joe,\" Amanda said. Tuck's son reached out his hand and Amanda extended her hand to shake it. \"It's nice to meet you, too,\" Joe said. \"Is it okay to call you Amanda?\" Amanda smiled at the kid's manners. \"You got it,\" Amanda said. \"And Sophie, these are a couple more of my friends, Lauren and FDR.\" \"You can't have letters for a name,\" Sophie said. FDR laughed. \"It's just my nickname. You can call me Frank if you'd like,\" FDR said. \"Nope, I think I'm going to call you FDR, like you said.\" \"That's such a pretty dress, Sophie,\" Lauren said. She smiled down at Sophie and silently hoped that the baby she was carrying in her belly was a girl so she could dress her up just like Sophie. \"Thank you,\" Sophie replied. \"Your hair is really pretty.\" Lauren laughed. \"Hey, Sophie, do you want to go swing? Nana's got a really great swing set.\" Sophie's eyes lit up. \"Can I? Please please please?\" Amanda nodded. \"Of course.\" Sophie and Joe ran off in the direction of the play set and left the four adults alone. \"Your dress is so adorable,\" Lauren said. \"I like that Sophie matched you.\" \"She insisted,\" Amanda said. \"And it's disgusting, but this is my niece's dress. It was too big on her, but I think it's too small on me. Isn't it too young for me?\" \"Nope,\" Both Tuck and FDR answered her. Lauren slapped FDR in the gut, but they all laughed. \"It looks very nice on you,\" Tuck said. \"Thank you,\" Amanda replied. \"Can I talk to you for a second?\" Tuck asked. \"Privately?\" \"Sure,\" Amanda replied. FDR grinned like an idiot and slapped his friend on the back before Lauren dragged him away. \"What's up?\" she asked. \"I'm sure it's nothing, but I thought I'd ask you. When we met Travis the other day at the restaurant, he didn't have an accent, did he?\" Amanda shook her head. \"No. He sounded American to me. What made you ask that?\" \"Well, Joe was telling me that he overheard Travis on the phone and he had an accent and he was speaking in another language,\" Tucks aid. \"He's eight, so it's probably nothing.\" \"I don't know about that. Kids are pretty good about picking stuff up like that. He probably did hear an accent,\" Amanda said. \"Or he doesn't like the guy.\" \"He called him weird.\" Amanda laughed. \"Well, it's about time,\" Nana called from around the side of the house. \"When she starts grilling you, I'd recommend calling on your CIA training,\" Tuck told Amanda. \"It's good they don't supply us with cyanide tablets anymore.\" \"I highly doubt that speaking with this woman is akin to torture that would require suicide,\" Amanda said, laughing. \"I'll let you be the judge of that,\" Tuck replied. \"I'm just kidding. Nana is a wonderful woman.\" Nana Foster walked towards them. She was dressed in a sky blue skirt suit and she had her white hair pulled back in a neat bun. \"You look lovely today, Nana,\" Tuck said, kissing her on the cheek. \"Don't to kiss up, Tuck,\" Nana replied. \"Nothing is going to get you forgiven for not bringing this one around here sooner. You must be Amanda. I've met your precious little girl already,\" Nana said as she pulled Amanda in for a hug. Amanda was slightly taken aback, but allowed the woman to embrace her. \"I am Amanda. But Sophie is actually my niece…\" \"She said daughter . She must think highly of you,\" Nana said. \"You're every bit as beautiful as Tuck over here said.\" \"Oh, he said that?\" Amanda said, smirking slightly at the man who was trying to play it cool. \"Yes, he did. So, you work with him?\" Nana said, dropping her voice to a lower volume. \"You're a secret agent, too?\" \"Yes,\" Amanda whispered. \"But none of my nieces know that. I'm a legal secretary.\" \"I see,\" Nana smiled. \"How many nieces do you have?\" \"Three,\" Amanda said. \"Nana, I am going…\" \"Okay, Tuck, you go. But I'm going to chat with Amanda here for a few more minutes,\" Nana said as she waved him off. \"I'll be fine,\" Amanda told him. Tuck took his dismissal and headed for a drink, leaving Amanda with Nana. \"So, you brought her along?\" Katie said. \"Yes, obviously,\" Tuck replied. \"To my engagement party?\" she asked. \"I didn't realize it was forbidden,\" he said sarcastically after a healthy swig of his drink. \"I just think it's confusing for Joe to have you parading women in and out of his life. And I don't want women like that around my son,\" Katie told him. \"Excuse me?\" Tuck asked. \"Amanda is a wonderful, classy woman and I'd appreciate it if you didn't insinuate things about her. By the way, this is only the second woman I've dated since our divorce. I didn't even know that you were dating someone, and poof! Here you are, getting married. Would you have told me if I wasn't at the same restaurant as you both?\" \"Of course I was going to tell you it was a serious relationship, Tuck. But how could I have known he was going to propose that night? It's only been a month.\" \"Well, isn't that just fantastic ?\" \"What about her? She's already here, meeting people and she's been in your life an hour?\" \"Amanda is an old friend of FDR, for your information.\" \"Oh.\" \"She is a former work contact,\" he said. \"And I don't want to fight with you.\" \"That's good to hear,\" a male voice said from behind Tuck. He turned and was greeted with Travis Stemworth, the fiancé. \"Nice to see you again, mate,\" Tuck said, extending his hand. Travis shook his hand and stared Tuck down as best he could. Tuck wanted very badly to dislike this man, but he couldn't find any real reason. Well, any legitimate reason, anyway. He wanted Katie to be happy, truthfully, and apparently Travis made her happy. \"It's so nice of your grandmother to invite me into her home like this.\" \"Oh, Nana isn't my grandmother. She's FDR's Nana,\" Tuck said. \"But I was told I was part of the family a few years back,\" he smiled. \"And Katie and Joe then. And now…you, I guess.\" \"My family couldn't make it, so it's nice to have some family here,\" Travis smiled. He had a mouth full of pearly white teeth that twinkled in the sunlight. Tuck resisted the urge to roll his eyes. \"Is your mother here?\" Tuck asked. She was the one person in the world that Tuck truly was afraid of. \"Of course,\" Katie replied. \"She's over there.\" All three of them turned to look. Katie's mom, Nancy, spotted them across the yard and smiled, but it turned to a grimace as soon as she locked eyes on Tuck. \"What some advice, mate?\" Tuck said to Travis. \"Sleep with one eye open if you piss that woman off. She'll eviscerate you.\" \"Mom likes Travie,\" Katie cooed. \"She used to like me, too.\" … \"So, did Nana give you the third degree?\" FDR asked as Amanda walked towards him. She had a moderate shell-shocked expression on her face. \"Yes. It might even count as fourth degree. I might use that rapid-fire technique the next time I have to interrogate someone,\" Amanda laughed. \"You could just bring her in; she has it perfected,\" FDR replied. \"Where's Lauren?\" Amanda asked. \"Had to pee…again,\" he smiled. \"She has to pee, like, every half an hour.\" \"You're excited to be a dad, aren't you?\" \"I never would have thought that I would be saying that. But meeting Lauren changed me in a lot of ways,\" FDR said. \"Made me change my mind about a lot of things.\" \"Listen to you, waxing romantic,\" Tuck said, putting a hand on FDR's back. \"I think leaving out that we almost killed one another in the process is a good touch.\" \"I think it's hilarious that the two of you felt the need to fight over a woman,\" Lauren said as she walked towards them. \"But since it was me, it's all right.\" \"Oh, my god, Lauren, you are the cutest pregnant woman,\" Katie gushed as she walked up to the group. Travis was hot on her heels and the six of them stood awkwardly around one another. \"Oh, thank you, Katie,\" Lauren said. She and Katie tried to be friends after she and Tuck had gotten back together, but it was weird, so they weren't that close. Tuck's arm found Amanda's waist and she unconsciously moved closer to him. He couldn't even begin to describe how much he liked the dress she was wearing. It was hard for him to concentrate on anything else. \"So, how many kids do you have?\" Katie asked Amanda. \"Oh, I have three nieces that I take care of. My brother-in-law is overseas,\" Amanda explained. She didn't really want to get into her sister's death with Tuck's ex-wife today, so she hoped Katie would drop it. \"Where are the other two?\" she asked. \"I think I only saw one running around here.\" \"Sophie came with me. The other two are teenagers and are full of attitude,\" Amanda said. \"That's got to be a handful,\" Katie stated the obvious. \"Oh! My sister is here!\" she said before rushing off. \"Sorry about that, please excuse her,\" Travis offered as an apology. \"How do you work and take care of three young girls?\" he asked. He was fishing for information and he hoped this woman was unassuming enough about him to answer honestly. \"I have Jeanne, a nanny for the girls. She runs the house while I'm out,\" Amanda said. \"She's great; a Godsend.\" \"Oh, I see,\" Travis said, filing that information away for later. \"Well, I should go with my fiancé,\" he said. \"It was nice seeing you all again. I'm sure we'll all talk again later.\" His eyes went wide when he knew his accent had slipped out. But none of them had reason to suspect him of anything. He smiled and with a small wave, he hurried to Katie's side. \"I think Joe's right,\" Amanda said as he walked away. \"What do you mean?\" Tuck asked. \"That guy is weird,\" Amanda replied. \"And I did hear a bit of an accent there.\" Over by Katie, Travis had his phone out and he was typing out a message. We hit the house on Monday. 3pm. … To Be Continued…[Chapter 8] A New War Eight Amanda was bleary-eyed as she strolled into the kitchen. Her cat, Thommas, came strolling up behind her and meowed to alert her of his presence. \"Hey, Thomthom,\" Amanda yawned. \"Is it breakfast time already?\" He meowed again at her, expecting his food in his dish at that precise moment. Amanda wasn't awake enough to be moving that fast. Amanda went through the motions of getting the cat his breakfast and he stuck his furry face in the dish immediately. It was five in the morning and she had to be in to work at seven. It was not even fair that anyone's workday started before eight-thirty, particularly her own. And on top of that, it was Monday, too. After making herself a cup of coffee, she headed back up the stairs to go get herself ready for the day. The weekend had gone by too quickly, as it always did. The party on Saturday had been extremely fun, aside from the dirty looks that Katie kept shooting at her all day. Sophie had thoroughly enjoyed playing with the couple of kids that were there, including and especially, Joe. The two had become fast friends, running around and playing all day. Amanda smiled at the memory. And her smile got wider when she remembered her alone time with Tuck. He had offered to show her the grounds and Amanda had ended up pinned to the back barn wall with Tuck holding her there. They were making out like highschoolers until Sophie had shouted out Amanda's name. And now it was Monday morning and she had to go back to reality. Luckily, her reality involved the charming Tuck. An hour later, Amanda was putting the finishing touches on her to-go coffee and Jeanne was letting herself into the house. \"Well, don't you look zazzy this morning?\" Jeanne said as she walked into the kitchen. \"Zazzy?\" Amanda asked. \"How else would you describe a leopard print skirt?\" Jeanne said as she swatted Amanda on the rear end. Amanda had chosen this outfit specifically, even though she didn't want everyone to know it. This grey leopard print was her favorite and she topped it with her favorite avocado-colored sweater. Despite her blue eyes, she thought the green looked nice with both her fair complexion and dark hair. She'd spent most of her youth wishing for any other color hair, but she was now finally enjoying it. \"For Tuck?\" Jeanne asked. \"What? Why would it be for Tuck?\" Amanda asked. Jeanne grinned. \"You know playing dumb looks terrible on you. It's actually kind of ridiculous.\" \"Gee, thanks,\" Amanda said sarcastically. \"Anyway, thank you for coming so early,\" she said, changing the subject. \"It's no problem. I like being up early. And the girls like when I make 'em breakfast before school.\" \"I know. They hate when I make them breakfast.\" \"That's because your idea of the most important meal of the day is cereal,\" Jeanne laughed. \"Okay, so I missed the seminar on feeding children. But I don't feed them hotdogs every day. Which is good, because Cam told me that she is going to be a vegetarian.\" Jeanne looked at her incredulously. \"What?\" \"She thinks meat will make her boobs not grow. Claims she read it on the internet.\" \"The internet is so full of garbage,\" Jeanne smiled. \"You and I have eating meat our whole lives and we filled out fine. I've never gotten any complaints,\" Jeanne smiled and laughed. \"Me either,\" Amanda laughed. \"So, if you need anything, call me. I should be able to pick up my phone.\" \"We'll be fine,\" Jeanne said. \"I know,\" Amanda nodded. Amanda grabbed her purse, her coffee and her keys and left the house. … At the CIA field office, Tuck was at his desk, flipping through the paperwork that had been dropped off for him. He was concerned that in the seemingly endless amount of surveillance they had done on the Russian mob that was operating in LA, no one had gotten an image of Leonid. And they just didn't have any information that they could use to bring in Danton Yencich. But they had noticed that no one had seen Yencich in about a week. \"You look hard at work,\" Amanda said as she stepped toward him. Tuck looked up and his eyes took her whole outfit in. \"Well, I was until now,\" Tuck said as he stood. He looked around, and seeing no one, he planted a kiss on Amanda's lips. \"Good morning, Mr. Hansen,\" she said once they'd broken apart. He loosened the grip that he didn't realize he'd had on her and she walked her things to her own desk. \"What was that for?\" she asked, smiling. \"I missed you.\" A warm feeling spread through her. \"You did?\" \"Yes,\" he said, sitting back down at his desk to return to his paperwork. Once Amanda had booted up her laptop and had her desk situated, she walked back to Tuck. Perched on the edge of his desk, she looked at the black and white photographs he had spread out. \"So, what are you working on?\" she asked. \"We still haven't had a confirmed sighting of Leonid and now no one had seen Yencich in seven days. But, there was another jewelry store burned down to the ground last night.\" \"A front for something?\" Amanda asked. \"More than likely,\" he replied. \"So, we did some backtracking and the store was owned by Yencich's uncle.\" \"How long have you been here?\" Amanda asked. \"This morning? Maybe half an hour. But Boyles called me in last night for a bit. The boys in research were up all night looking into the details for me,\" he said, stretching his arms by putting his hands on the back of his head. \"So, arson?\" she said, turning her attention back to the jewelry store. The image Tuck had was grainy and out of focus, but it looked like neither of the buildings around the store were damaged too badly. That gave Amanda the distinct feeling that the ignition source was done just to destroy the one building. \"That's the unofficial ruling,\" Tuck said. \"Is there an official ruling?\" \"Not yet. Forensics are still on site,\" Tuck replied. \"Did they find any bodies or any jewelry?\" Amanda asked. \"Nothing.\" \"So, they cleaned out the place and then lit it up,\" Amanda reasoned out. \"That is what I would assume as well,\" Tuck said. \"It's just going to be you and I today, by the way. Franklin and Lauren have a doctor's appointment today.\" \"Is everything all right?\" Amanda asked. \"Oh yeah, it's just a check-up. I think they find out the sex of the baby today,\" Tuck replied, smiling. \"Oh,\" Amanda smiled back. \"That's awesome.\" \"Franklin is thrilled,\" Tuck replied. \"He and Lauren ends up with a girl, though,\" Amanda said. Tuck laughed. \"He deserves it.\" \"Okay, so back to work,\" Amanda said as she stood from her perch on Tuck's desk and she straightened her skirt. \"I'd like to go see the jewelry store.\" \"Are you a detective now?\" Tuck smirked. \"I'm a little bit of everything,\" Amanda replied. \"I want to see if the area has surveillance cameras. They might help us figure out who torched the joint. Or at least who the last person to visit Uncle Yencich's store was.\" \"Okay, we can go out in a bit. I'd like to finish going through these photos before we go,\" Tuck said. \"Is that all right with you?\" \"Of course,\" Amanda told him. An hour later, it was already sunny and totally muggy as Tuck and Amanda stepped out of Tuck's SUV and walked towards the site where the jewelry store used to stand. Both Tuck and Amanda had dark, reflective sunglasses on and she had changed into a dark suit to look more official. They both walked purposefully to the officer who was patrolling the crime scene. \"I'm sorry. You can't…\" Both Tuck and Amanda flashed their official CIA badges. \"Sorry, agents. Please go right in,\" the police officer said, holding up the yellow crime scene tape. \"Thank you,\" Tuck replied. He guided Amanda through the area with a hand on her back. Amanda had seen, and caused, more gruesome buildings than this one. But this one wasn't pretty and wouldn't be salvageable. The whole thing was going to have to be razed and they could collect the insurance company. There were not many walls left, but what were there were black and charred and looked like they were going to come down at any minute. Amanda saw a passing firefighter and touched his elbow to grab his attention. \"I'm going to assume this wasn't some run of the mill electrical fire?\" she asked, taking off her sunglasses and looking at him. \"No, ma'am. There was definitely some kind of accelerant used,\" he told her. \"The biggest concentration was in the back of the building, where they probably had a break room or stock room. Whoever did this definitely didn't want what was back there to be found or investigated,\" he said, smiling down at her. Tuck nodded. \"Thank you,\" he said with a jealous note in his voice. He wasn't fond of the way that the fireman was flirting with Amanda. \"We'll come find you if we have any further questions, mate.\" The firefighter grinned at her and then walked away. \"What was that about?\" Amanda asked. \"I was going to ask him a couple more questions.\" \"I didn't like the way he was looking at you,\" Tuck replied, looking everywhere but in her eyes. \"Oh, like you aren't looking at me now?\" Amanda laughed. \"You don't have to be jealous, Tuck.\" \"I'm afraid that bit comes naturally,\" Tuck told her. Amanda rolled her eyes behind her reflective sunglasses. But she knew he had a point; if he was talking to another woman, and flirting, Amanda probably would be jealous, too. \"There really isn't much left,\" Tuck said. \"Have you seen enough?\" \"I think so,\" Amanda replied. \"Good, because I want to get you away from all of these firemen,\" Tuck said. Amanda swatted him in the ribs, but smiled. \"I'm hungry. I think you should take me for some lunch.\" Tuck nodded. \"This could be arranged.\" … \"What exactly did you plan to accomplish my burning my poor uncle's jewelry store to the ground?\" Yencich asked. Leonid was in a foul mood and didn't feel like dealing with his ridiculous employees. Yencich brought his cane down on Leonid's desk and it dented the wood. Things fell over and clattered to the floor. He didn't care; he wanted answers. \"I needed a way to keep the CIA agents busy,\" Leonid said. Yencich growled deep in his throat. \"My uncle had nothing to do with any of the other jewelry stores that you were using. Why would you do that to an old man?\" he asked. \"He's had that store since he moved to America fifty years ago.\" \"And he will be compensated for the part that he's played,\" Leonid said. He stood up from his desk chair and picked up the framed photo of himself and Katie. The glass was cracked, but he smiled admiringly at it. \"You think a little bit of money is going to replace the memories of a business that be built from the ground up?\" Yencich asked. \"Why do you insist on this? This means nothing,\" Leonid said. \"And your uncle seemed perfectly content with his payout. I do believe he and your aunt are planning on moving to Florida,\" he smiled. \"You could have at least told me what your plans were,\" Yencich complained. Leonid stood the frame on his desk and smiled down at it. \"You are not going to know any of my plans unless I feel like telling you. You have your job for now.\" \"Taking children is…\" \"Taking the children is the perfect way of getting what we want. We want those agents to suffer for what they have done,\" Leonid told him. \"Don't over think this, Danton.\" Yencich shook his head. \"But one of the children is the son of your fiancé,\" he told his boss. \"Do you think I care?\" he replied coldly. \"Do you think those agents cared when they blew up Heinrich? No. They did not. We will take their children and then we will kill them when they come after the young ones. Do you understand me? Our plan will commence at 3:30 as we have discussed. Do not fail me.\" There was silence in Leonid's office for a full minute. There was no movement. \"What the hell are you waiting for?!\" Leonid shouted. \"Get out!\" Yencich grabbed his cane and hobbled out of the man's office. It was 2 o'clock already, he needed to get his act together and complete this mission he was given. He didn't want to do this. He didn't to destroy a family. In fact, he didn't care about Heinrich at all, so doing the dirty work to avenge the death of this man meant nothing to him. But since Leonid was a dangerous man, he was going to do what he was told to do. … At five-thirty, Tuck and Amanda were packing up their things. Tuck had gotten a text from FDR at lunch that he and Lauren were having a boy. They had made plans to go out and celebrate in the next couple of days. Tonight, though, Amanda was going to stop at the grocery store and then somehow manage to cook her and the girls something delicious for dinner. Tuck walked Amanda to her car and she grabbed him and kissed him passionately. She caught him by surprise, but he wrapped his arms around her. \"You're sure you can't come home with me?\" Tuck smiled down at her. \"I can make it worth your while.\" Amanda giggled, but shook her head. \"Oh, Tuck, I wish I could. But the girls will want dinner and Jeanne will want to go home.\" Tuck nodded. \"You're right, you're right,\" he said. He leaned his forehead down on hers and looked her into her eyes. \"You drive me crazy.\" \"In a good way, right?\" Amanda asked. \"Of course,\" Tuck laughed. Amanda's cell phone began to ring and she looked down at the display. \"It's Cam, I should probably take this.\" \"Sure, of course,\" Tuck said again. \"I'll talk to you tonight.\" Tuck smiled at her once more and then walked away while Amanda answered her phone. \"Hi Cam,\" Amanda said as she turned the car on. \"Hey! Can you come pick Becca and I up at the mall?\" Cameron asked. Amanda put the phone on speakerphone and set the phone down to start driving. \"Why are you at the mall?\" Amanda asked. \"Are you supposed to be home with Jeanne and your sisters?\" \"Jeanne said I could go to the movies because I got an A on my science test,\" Cameron said. \"You got an A? Congrats, my friend!\" Amanda said. \"Which mall did you go to?\" \"Brookside,\" Cameron replied. \"All right,\" she said. \"I'll be there in ten. Hang out with Becca 'til I get there, all right? Don't go missing.\" \"We can probably handle that,\" Cameron said. \"See you in a bit.\" … Amanda and Cameron drove down the street towards the house. It was now almost seven o'clock and Amanda's stomach was growling. But that very same stomach dropped as she got closer to the house and saw the front door standing open. \"Why is the front door open?\" Cameron asked. \"I don't know,\" Amanda said slowly. Amanda left the keys in the ignition with the car running as she climbed out. Cameron started to move, too, but Amanda stopped her. \"Stay in the car,\" Amanda said roughly. \"Climb over into the driver's seat and lock the doors. If anyone comes towards you, you gun it out of the driveway.\" \"Where are you going?!\" Cameron shouted. Amanda was already climbing out of the car and drawing her gun. \"Stay in the car! Do what I told you, okay?\" Amanda called. Cameron started to cry, but Amanda had to go check out the house. She watched her niece climb into the driver's seat like she was told to and watched her aunt walking slowly towards the house. Amanda had her cell phone in her hand and she dialed Tuck's number. \"Missed me already?\" Tuck greeted her. \"Tuck, my front door is standing open. I'm going in to see if the girls are okay.\" \"No! Do not go in the house. Go somewhere safe,\" Tuck said. \"We'll call the police and we'll get agents out there.\" \"I don't have that kind of time,\" Amanda said. \"I have my gun, I'll be okay. But if you could get over here, that would be great,\" she said, her voice panicked and emotional. \"Amanda! Do not go in that house!\" he shouted at her. But Amanda had already disconnected the phone. Amanda tucked her cell phone down in her shirt since she didn't have any pockets and looked back at Cameron to try to reassure her. It was probably counterproductive, though, because she had a gun in her hand and Amanda was ready to shoot anything that came at her. Cameron was staring at her with wide eyes and Amanda had to look away again before she freaked herself out anymore. Amanda crept into the house slowly and started to systematically checking rooms. There were signs of a struggle and Amanda immediately thought the worst. She turned the corner into the dining room, and Amanda's eyes went wide. Jeanne was tied to one of the dining room chairs with a gag in her mouth to keep her quiet. Jeanne had been crying, Amanda could tell, and she moved to the woman to start untying her after she tucked her gun back into the back waistband of her skirt. \"I am so sorry, Amanda,\" she sobbed into Amanda's shoulder once she was free from the chair. \"He took the girls!\" \"What happened?\" Amanda asked. \"Who took the girls?\" Jeanne shook her head. \"I don't know who he was. But he came to the door when I ran to the bathroom. Sophie answered it, I think. He forced his way in the house and I heard the guy. I came out of the bathroom and he was waiting for me. He put a gun to my head and made me sit in the chair before he tied me up,\" Jeanne explained. She was crying again and Amanda put her arm around the older woman. \"I asked why he wanted the girls and he said that it was retribution.\" \"Come on, let's get you out of here,\" Amanda said, walking her toward the front door. \"Where's Cameron?\" Jeanne asked. \"She's outside in the car,\" Amanda said. \"She's fine.\" Amanda could hear the sirens coming closer and she made sure she had her badge on her so she could explain her gun. Cameron had climbed out of the car and ran to Jeanne and they clutched at one another and Amanda waited for the police officers to arrive. Amanda thought about what Jeanne had said about the girls being kidnapped for retribution. She'd pissed a lot of people off in her career; she didn't even know where to start when it came to figuring out who was working against her. As the police came to her, she had her badge out and was explaining her gun to them. Cameron had come to her side and was listening to her explain her role at the CIA field office. Cam's face was a mixture of disbelief, confusion, and slight anger. The police started to take a preliminary statement from Jeanne and an ambulance arrived to check her out. Tuck arrived a few minutes later as the police were asking Cameron some questions. Amanda was half-listening to the questions that the police were asking her niece; she wasn't going to know anything, but they were being thorough. \"Are you okay?\" Tuck asked her as soon as he'd explained his role with the CIA as well. He'd gone through the rigmarole of presenting his badge and gun for inspection before he was allowed past the crime scene tape. \"Ask me later,\" Amanda replied with her arms crossed over her chest. \"Two of my nieces were kidnapped, I can't see the man's face on the security camera at my front door, and my nanny was bound and gagged in my dining room,\" she explained. He pulled Amanda to him in a hug and she tried her best to remain calm and not cry. FDR arrived shortly after and rushed up to the both of them. \"Hey, this is a zoo,\" he said. Tuck shot him a dirty look. \"What happened?\" \"Two of Amanda's nieces were taken by an unknown man,\" Tuck explained. \"Her nanny is giving a description right now and is getting checked out.\" FDR hugged Amanda. \"We'll hunt the bastard down and we'll get the girls back,\" FDR told her. \"Don't worry. Across the yard, they heard Lauren's voice arguing with a police officer. She was yelling that she should be allowed into the crime scene. FDR went and brought her back to Amanda and Tuck, explaining the situation as they walked. She cried and hugged Amanda hard as soon as she got to her. \"Damn pregnancy hormones,\" she sobbed into Amanda's shoulder. \"Cameron can come stay with FDR and I for as long as you need.\" \"What?\" FDR said. \"Honey…\" \"No, Amanda is going to be busy and you and I can look after Cameron,\" Lauren told her husband. \"They aren't going to be able to stay here. And we at least know that our house is safe. Amanda can stay with Tuck.\" \"No, no, I can't ask anyone for that,\" Amanda said. \"I'll get us a hotel…\" \"Right now, I'm working from home,\" Lauren said. \"I'll take Cam to school and pick her up. You need to focus on getting Sophie and Alex back,\" she told them. \"You shouldn't argue with a pregnant woman,\" FDR said. \"I learned that the hard way,\" he smiled, trying to lighten the mood. \"I think it's a good idea,\" Tuck said. \"Franklin and Lauren can look after Cameron and you can stay at my loft. We'll get the girls back, Amanda.\" … Okay, there was the latest update. Let me know what you think![Chapter 9] A New War NINE \"I don't' understand what it means when you say that you work for the CIA. You're a spy?\" Cameron asked. She was freaking out and pacing, but no one could blame her. \"How do you get that job? Have you killed people? What does the CIA do?\" Amanda and Cameron, along with Lauren, FDR, Tuck and Jeanne were all standing in the sixth floor conference room at the CIA field office. Both Amanda and Cameron had a chance to pack a bag, but the agency wanted to get a description from Jeanne and statements from Amanda and Cam, so the whole group went to the field office. \"You all work here?\" Cam asked. FDR, Tuck, and Amanda nodded. \"I'm retired,\" Jeanne replied. Cameron's head spun. \"What?\" \"Jeanne used to work for the Agency,\" Amanda explained. \"I don't work here,\" Lauren said. \"Have you always known they worked here?\" she asked Lauren. Lauren smiled and shook her head. \"No, that was a bit of a shock,\" she replied. \"But these three are the best of the best.\" \"No way. You're just…you can't possibly be…\" \"Know ten kinds of martial arts? Some that you've never heard of?\" Amanda said. \"Or take down a guy three times your size in heels?\" Tuck said. \"Right,\" Amanda said. \"I almost forgot that.\" \"Speaking of that, we should go have a chat with him, Amanda. Maybe he's forgiven you for the stiletto heel you put through his foot,\" Tuck told her, bragging to Cameron on her behalf. \"He might be a bit more forthcoming with information with you as angry as you are.\" \"Well, you might have to go without me. I don't want to leave Cam…\" \"I want you to go away. Go find my sisters or something. I don't want to talk to you,\" she began to cry. Cameron ran from the room and slammed the conference room door behind her. \"She'll find the bathroom,\" Jeanne said as Amanda started to follow after her. \"Yeah, she won't' get too far away in this building,\" FDR said. \"I just don't even know what to do. I can't ask you to take her in.\" \"You didn't ask. I told you that Cameron can stay with us. You can't stay in a hotel with her. Who would look after her while you're working? Hotels are safe, but not that safe,\" Lauren said. \"You'll be busy getting your other nieces back. FDR doesn't even mind, do you?\" she said. \"Well…\" FDR began. Lauren shot him a dirty look. \"Nope. Don't mind,\" he said. \"And my beautiful wife is right. It will be safer to have Cameron at our place because we can keep an eye on her and you won't bave to worry about her.\" \"But Cameron is a handful normally, she's going to be…\" \"It's all right. I was a blond teenager once…well, sort of,\" she smiled. We'll bond or I'll take her to work and let her destroy some shit.\" \"I could do with smashing something myself,\" Amanda said. \"Why can I do to help?\" Jeanne asked. \"I feel awful about this. It was my job to keep them safe? I feel so useless.\" Amanda put her hand on Jeanne's arm. \"This is not your fault, Jeanne. This is my fault. I am going to get Sophie and Alex back. Without a single doubt in my mind,\" Amanda told her. \"You aren't useless. You gave a great description of the guy. But since you're the only person who can ID the man who took the girls, the Agency is putting you into protective custody.\" \"But…\" \"Your husband is going as well. You'll both be taking a vacation. That trip to the island is coming a bit sooner than you'd planned on,\" Amanda forced a smile. \"I, um…\" Jeanne started. \"It's all set,\" Tuck said checking his phone. He read the display. \"Your ride is here. They'll take you back to your husband. You can pack a bag and the escort will then take you on to the airport. Your husband has already been told the situation and an armed guard is positioned at your home for safety.\" Jeanne began to cry again. She tried to look at Amanda, who was barely holding it together herself, but she couldn't meet Amanda's eyes. \"Lauren and I will walk you out,\" FDR said. \"Now, don't use your phone. A new one will be provided for you,\" he said as the three of them walked out of the conference room. When Amanda and Tuck were alone, he grabbed her arm and pulled her to him so he could hold her. \"You know, you're handling things pretty well, all things considered,\" he tried to comfort her. Amanda pulled back, out of his grasp. \"I'm operating on adrenaline only. Those girls are everything to me and now…what if?\" \"Don't do that. Not yet. It's been just over two hours. We are going to find them and they will be fine,\" Tuck told her. \"You know as well as I do, that these situations almost never turn out well. The more time that passes…\" Amanda trailed off. She was trying not to cry, but she knew her resolve was crumbling. Tuck's phone chimed and he looked at the display. \"What?\" she asked. \"They've got the sketch finished and Jeanne looked at it,\" Tuck told her. \"I know it's a long shot, but I think I want to take the sketch to our friend in holding. Since Jeanne said she recognized the accent as Russian, I guess there is a slight chance…\" Amanda said. \"You're looking at me like I'm crazy.\" \"No, no,\" Tuck shook his head. \"I think that's a great idea.\" \"But Cameron…\" \"Franklin and Lauren will take her home with them.\" There was a tentative knock on the conference room door before it opened. Cameron walked back into the room and looked at Amanda and Tuck with swollen, red eyes. \"You're going to get them back.\" \"Yes, I am,\" Amanda replied. \"What do you need me to do to help?\" Cameron asked, surprising Amanda immensely. \"You can help by keeping a low-profile. Don't tell anyone what's going on. And I know it's going to be hard, but don't worry.\" \"What if someone on our street asks what happened? Or one of my friends?\" \"You can't tell anyone. It could jeopardize your safety and that of your sisters,\" Tuck explained. \"Do you know why someone would come take Sophie and Alex? What did you do?\" Cameron asked. \"I'm not sure who would do it. I…\" \"What do you for the CIA exactly?\" Cameron asked. \"I bring in the bad guys,\" Amanda explained. She really thought the most uncomfortable conversation she had with Cam would have remained the sex talk, but telling her oldest niece that she was a hired assassin was actually the top of the list. \"Do you kill people?\" \"Sometimes,\" Tuck replied before Amanda could. \"Sometimes that's part of the job. But not always.\" \"I think you should kill the man who took my sisters,\" Cam said. \"I know I'm always breaking rules and pushing the limits, but…I just want them back, okay?\" Cam had tears streaming down her face as she walked to her aunt to hug her. Amanda couldn't control the emotion anymore and finally broke down. Tuck did his very best to remain unfazed, but he found the whole thing rather uncomfortable. Luckily, Lauren walked into the room. \"Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I just wanted to see if you were ready to go Cameron?\" she asked. \"FDR and I were thinking of getting a pizza on the way back.\" Cameron stepped away from her aunt and sniffled. She nodded to Lauren. \"Okay, honey. Let's go,\" Lauren said. \"I love you, Cam.\" \"Love you, too,\" she threw over her shoulder as Lauren put her arm around it. \"Bye.\" \"You…\" Lauren said as she pointed at Amanda. \"You keep me updated. And you…\" Lauren pointed to Tuck. \"Make sure she gets a little sleep tonight.\" Tuck nodded, accepting his orders and Lauren left the conference room. \"Shall we go pay Vladimir a visit?\" Tuck asked. \"Yes, I think he's our first lead.\" … \"You told me I had to get the girls. You said nothing about baby-sitting them,\" Yencich complained. \"It was implied,\" Leonid answered him in a matter-of-factly. \"I cannot and will not take care of the children. I am not a nanny…\" \"That is about all you are good for,\" Leonid replied. Yencich boldly threw his boss a dirty look. \"Get your pretty girlfriend to watch them,\" Leonid told him. \"Who do you think is with them right now?\" Yencich asked with a sarcastic note to his voice. \"Those kids won't shut up. The little ones cries all the time and the older one yells.\" \"What about the third one?\" Leonid asked. \"What third one ?\" Yencich replied. \"There are three girls! Three!\" Leonid shouted. \"You moron!\" \"It was just the nanny and the two…\" \"Where is the nanny?\" he asked through clenched teeth. He was clearly angry, but trying to control himself. His face had turned an angry shade of purple and his handsome face was now sporting an unhealthy-looking pulsing vein. \"I tied her up and left her there,\" he answered her matter-of-factly. \"So, she could identify you when she became untied.\" \"I had sunglasses on, so…well, they came off at that one point…\" \"You are the biggest idiot in the whole entire world!\" Leonid shouted. He punched the man square in the jaw and Yencich flew backwards and collapsed on the ground. \"If you weren't related to my wife I would have killed you ages ago, you know that, right?\" He stared down at Yencich on the floor of the office. \"You don't think! You don't plan ahead! You're essentially useless. I want the third niece. These agents are going to suffer!\" Leonid said. \"And while you're at it, I want Hansen's son.\" Yencich looked up at Leonid who was still standing over him. \"How are you going to marry this woman while you're still married to Natasha? And how can you kidnap her child?\" he asked. \"Travis Stemworth isn't married, so he can marry whoever he wants,\" Leonid said. \"Now get your fat ass up off of the floor and go get the third girl and Hansen's kid!\" Leonid kicked Yencich in the gut before stepping up and over him on the floor and out of the office. … Once Tuck had the sketch in his hand, he hesitated to show Amanda. It was going to be unnecessary interrogate Vladimir. \"Just let me see it,\" Amanda said loudly. She got a couple weird looks from the other agents that were around them, but she was too focused on the image in Tuck's hands. \"I don't think that's such a good idea,\" Tuck said. \"Just let me see it,\" she told him as she enunciated each word. He handed over the image in his hands and Amanda stared down at it. \"Holy shit,\" Amanda replied. \"Yencich.\" Amanda dropped the image and went running from the hallway. … To Be Continued…[Chapter 10] Author's Note: Hello Everyone! I'm sorry it's been a while since I've updated…I went on vacation. But I already have the next chapter done, so it won't be so long before the next update. Let me know what you think! A New War Chapter 10 \"You should at least close your eyes for a few minutes. You've been awake for over 30 hours,\" Tuck told her. \"I can watch the front door for movement.\" Amanda was half asleep in the passenger seat of one of the agency's vehicles. It was seven in the morning and the sun was getting bright. She had dark sunglasses on and was doing her best to be nice to Tuck, but her mood was dark. \"No, I'm fine,\" Amanda said. \"I don't want to miss anything.\" It had been hours since there was movement in the house. Amanda and Tuck had made it to the house listed on Yencich's driver's license around 1 am. At the time, lights were on and there were people moving around in the front rooms. It was impossible to know if the people were Sophie and Alex, but Amanda had a hunch that they were in that house. She just needed enough of a reason to bust in and take her girls back. Tuck's phone buzzed and FDR's name was on the display. \"Hey, mate,\" Tuck said tiredly. \"Any change?\" FDR said. Tuck put the call on speakerphone so both of them could talk. \"No,\" Amanda replied in an annoyed tone. \"Can I just to ring the doorbell?\" \"That would be a good idea if you wanted something worse to happen to those kids,\" FDR said. \"Well, this is stupid,\" Amanda said. \"I can't sit here anymore. I have to do something.\" \"Let's get another surveillance car here and then I'll take you back to my place to sleep,\" Tuck said. \"You aren't going to be any good without sleep.\" \"I don't care. I'm going to bash his teeth in with or without sleep,\" Amanda told Tuck and FDR. \"How is Cameron?\" \"She's fine. I dropped her at school. She's got agency detail on her all day and she's wearing a tracking device,\" FDR told her. \"Does that make you feel better Aunt Mandy?\" \"It makes me want to slap you for calling me Aunt Mandy,\" she said. \"But thank you for taking care of Cam.\" \"No sweat,\" FDR said. \"I can practice being a dad.\" \"I hate to tell you this, but you're a long ways away from having a 15 year old, mate,\" Tuck laughed. But Tuck quickly became quiet again as the home's garage door opened and a dark car backed out. The car backed down the drive way and then drove slowly down the road. The windows were tinted a dark color and it was impossible to see inside the vehicle. \"They are either in that car or they are still in that house. You can follow the car and I'm going in the house,\" Amanda told him as she opened the car door. \"No,\" he said as he put a hand on her arm to stop her. \"We'll both go in the house. Let me call in the license plate. That's not the car we had on record for Yencich.\" He realized that FDR was still on the line and he disconnected the call without saying anything. He dialed the number for the agency and described the black Lincoln sedan to the folks that could find it and gave them the license plate number. \"Have someone pull that car over and report immediately if there are girls in the car. Bring him in for questioning no matter what,\" he said before ending the call. Amanda was up and out of the car before he could stop her again. \"What's the plan here, Amanda? Go in, guns drawn, and just search the place? Because you're going to scare the shit out of those girls if they're still in there or something really bad could happen. The house could be wired to explode or…\" \"You've been watching too many spy movies.\" \"Tell me I'm wrong then,\" Tuck challenged her. \"Tell me that it'll all be honky-dory going in there. The girls will be baking cookies and…\" \"Enough, okay!\" Amanda yelled. \"Enough! What's your plan?\" \"Approach from the backyard. Through the hedges…\" Tuck's phone rang and he looked down at the display. FDR. \"What, Franklin?\" he said in an exasperated tone. \"They pulled over Yencich's girlfriend already…April,\" FDR said. \"She was the one driving the Lincoln.\" \"And?\" Tuck said into the car. And she's fine, so far.\" \"They've picked up Alex already,\" Tuck told Amanda. \"Is the girlfriend saying anything about Sophie?\" \"No, but the woman sounded pretty terrified. She…\" Tuck stopped listening because his focus shifted to Amanda who was dashing across the lawn towards the front door. \"Holy shit. I've gotta go, mate,\" Tuck said. \"Amanda is about to do something really stupid.\" He disconnected the call and slammed the door. Tuck dashed after Amanda and was able to catch up to the mad woman as she approached the side door. \"You got a plan there, slick? Or are you just going to go in there and, more than likely, get shot at?\" Tuck asked. \"Why would I get shot at?\" \"Um, because they had to have seen you run through the front yard. And if not you, then me. One of us had to be seen.\" \"I get it, you're mad at me. But now isn't the time,\" Amanda told him. She took the gun out of the holster she was wearing and readied it. Her youngest niece had to be in this house. \"I suggest you stand back.\" Tuck did as she requested before Amanda put her foot into the door. It took two more shots like that with her foot screaming in agony before the door did as she wanted. But it didn't matter; they were now in the house. So much for being a secret agency, Tuck mused as they began to systematically check the house. Breaking down a door with guns drawn really wasn't subtle. He was hoping there were no nosy neighbors that would come calling because of the noise they'd caused. After a search of the entire house, they found nothing and Amanda was all but in tears from both the bad outcome as well as exhaustion. \"Come on,\" Tuck pulled her away as CIA agents dressed as police officers came to secure the crime scene. They would check the whole house and see if Sophie had ever been there. And now Amanda could go see her second oldest niece and see if she could help them get Sophie. … Amanda rushed to Alex as she came upon her in the conference room they'd used just last night. Alex allowed her to pull her into a tight, almost suffocating hug. \"Are you okay? Did they hurt you? Who did this? Do you know where they took Sophie?\" Amanda rapid fired. Alex stared silently at her aunt. Where to start? Alex simply collapsed into tears. Amanda pulled her into another tight embrace. \"I'm so glad you're okay, Alex. I was so scared.\" \"I don't know where he was taking Sophie. April said she was going to take me to get my hair and nails done. But they took Sophie somewhere else in the middle of the night. I tried to stop them, but…\" she cried into her aunt. \"It's okay, honey. Really. You did great. Do you know what his name was?\" Amanda asked. \"April called him Danny. But I think that was a nickname. I don't know what his real name is,\" Alex told them. Amanda pulled the picture of Danton Yencich from her pocket. \"Is this the guy?\" she asked. Alex nodded furiously. \"That's him for sure! And he was making plans to get a boat ready at the marina.\" \"Okay, honey. Good girl,\" Amanda hugged her. She stood up to full height and looked at Tuck, who was in the corner of the room, giving them space. \"So, the marina?\" he asked. \"Do you want to take that nap before we go?\" he continued. She shook her head. \"I was hoping to tell Lauren and FDR that they had one more bundle of joy. And then go out there.\" Tuck smirked. \"There is no use in arguing with you, is there?\" Amanda mustered up the best smile she could. \"Nope. Come on, Alex. You're going to be staying with Lauren while I go get your younger sister.\" Alex walked with her and took her hand. \"Is Cameron okay?\" Amanda nodded. \"She sure is. She's in school but she'll be staying with Lauren and FDR and you.\" \"Do you really work for the CIA?\" Alex asked the both of them. \"We do,\" Tuck replied. \"And your aunt is one of the best.\" \"Good. Because the guy that is doing all this…he's one of the worst,\" Alex said. \"Is there anything else you remember?\" Amanda asked. \"Danny told someone on the phone that he was going to get Hansen's son, I don't know who that is, and Cameron,\" Alex said. \"And I think he called that man Leon or something…\" \"Leonid?\" Amanda asked. \"Maybe,\" Alex said, unsure of herself. \"But I guess the guy on the phone said something Danny didn't like.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"Because he swore loudly and said it would be easy for Leon to grab the boy because they already spent so much time together,\" Alex finished. … To Be Continued…[Chapter 11] A New War Chapter Eleven \"Where is Joe?\" Tuck said into the phone. He was trying to play it cool and calm, but he was certain that he was losing that particular battle. And if he'd been thinking clearly, he would have known the precise location of his son. Katie was on the other end of the phone and she wasn't finding this morning's phone call from her ex-husband the least bit amusing. \"Travis took him to school on his way to work this morning, Tuck,\" Katie told him in an annoyed voice. \"You never care. Why do you care now?\" \"What did you say that Travis does?\" Tuck asked. \"Why are you asking this at eight thirty in the morning?\" Katie asked. \"Because I want to know now,\" Tuck told her. His voice was angry and loud. She had no idea that her son could be in anger. \"He's a jewelry appraiser,\" Katie said. \"He freelances to museums and decides on the value…\" \"I know what an appraiser does, Kate,\" Tuck said. \"Well, fine,\" Katie huffed. \"Listen, he's not who he says he is,\" Tuck said. \"Then who is he?\" Katie challenged. \"He's a really bad guy. Do me a favor. Call the school; find out if he's there. I'll have an escort pick you up and then take you to get him. If Joe isn't there, call me immediately. I know where he'll be,\" Tuck said. \"I hope.\" \"What are you even talking about? Travis is a great guy…\" Amanda wrenched the phone from Tuck because she couldn't take it any longer. \"No, he's not a great guy!\" Amanda yelled at Katie. \"He's already kidnapped my nieces and it's very likely that he's got your son right now. Now, just call the school as Tuck asked,\" Amanda finished. She ended the call and handed the phone back to Tuck. \"She didn't like me before and she really won't like me now,\" Amanda told him. \"It's so very unimportant right now,\" Tuck told her. \"Is it really possible that Leonid has been right under our noses this whole time?\" \"Seems like it,\" Amanda said. \"We should have figured with a name like Travis Stemworth. That sounds like a made up name. And not a very good one.\" They were headed towards the marina, but they were unable to prepare for what was ahead. No one could know what was being planned for them. \"Whatever happens, just get Sophie and Joe out,\" Amanda told him. She wasn't concerned about them getting Cameron; she knew that the agency would be looking after her. Still, she fired off a text message to FDR. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Tuck asked he pulled into a parking spot in the marina lot. \"We're going in together and we're going out with the kids together.\" Tuck's phone began to ring again. His phone never seemed to quit ringing anymore. He picked it up and Katie's panicked screams filled the car. \"Joe isn't at school,\" she freaked. \"Where did he take my son? How bad of a guy is Travis?\" \"Does the name Leonid mean anything to you?\" Amanda asked. \"No, nothing,\" Katie said as she tried to regain her composure. \"Are you sure Travis has him?\" \"Because someone would have had to taken him out of school. I don't think Joe made it to school this morning; I think Leonid took him with him. The school wouldn't have let a stranger take him out,\" Tuck told her. These were all logical conclusions. Amanda nodded in the passenger seat, agreeing with his statement. \"Is there a black SUV outside?\" Tuck asked. \"Yes,\" She said. \"Wave at him,\" he told her. \"If he honks the horn three times, that's your escort.\" \"Are you sure?\" Katie asked. \"I waved.\" Tuck could hear the horn honking in the background. \"Yes, I'm sure,\" he replied. He tried his best not to sound annoyed, but he thought he was failing. Amanda rolled her eyes. \"Please just go get in the car,\" she said. \"What if they try to shoot at me?\" Katie asked. \"Who?\" Amanda asked. \"Who is going to shoot at you?\" \"I don't know!\" Katie panicked. \"You're the ones who sent an escort car for me,\" she whined. \"I'm going to shoot her myself,\" Amanda said. \"Please go get in the goddamn car.\" \"The driver is motioning for me,\" Katie said. \"He's a trained sniper, so he'll have you covered,\" Amanda told them. \"But if you don't mind, I would like to go find your son and my niece and make sure they are all right? How does that suit you?\" \"Okay, okay,\" Katie said. They heard the door slam and they could hear Katie huffing and puffing as she booked it for the agency's SUV. They heard another door open and slam close a second later. \"I'm in,\" Katie whispered into the phone. \"Good,\" Tuck said. \"I'm Agent Bothwick, ma'am,\" both Amanda and Tuck heard the driver say. \"Nice to meet you,\" Kaite said as she tried not to panic further. \"Okay, you're good,\" Amanda said before putting an end to the call. She was going to say something about Tuck's ex-wife but bit her tongue. It was not the time and she knew she'd regret it at a later date. \"Bothwick is a trained sniper?\" Tuck asked. \"Maybe,\" Amanda replied. \"It's seemed to calm her down a bit.\" \"You don't like her?\" Tuck almost smirked. \"She's lovely. Let's go get the kids.\" Both of them exited the car. \"We should go find a list of boats docked here. It would take us hours.\" \"Do you think he just has a boat registered in his name? We couldn't find Leonid and he's just been running around as Travis Stemworth since he set foot in our country? Faking an American accent and…\" \"Shhh…\" Tuck told her and pulled down and behind a wall. \"What the hell are you…\" she started. \"Quiet!\" he whispered hoarsely as he put his hand over her mouth. He pointed with his free hand and then she focused on what he was shushing her about. Yencich, now with his foot in a boot, indicating some kind of injury, was holding Sophie's hand as they walked along the docks. Tuck had to hold Amanda back as she tried to rush for Sophie. The little girl was pointing at some ducks and smiling. Yencich nodded and urged Sophie to follow him onto the very large yacht nearer to the animals. She did follow him and Amanda's heart sank. But Amanda didn't know what she expected the small girl to do. Once Sophie had been led onto the yacht, Yencich signaled over the deck railing and someone came around the corner with a kicking and screaming Joe Hansen. \"That's my boy,\" Tuck smiled despite the situation. \"I apologize for stating the obvious, but we need to get on that boat.\" \"It's all right,\" Amanda said. \"Let's go. Leonid is probably aboard. I would like to personally drag his ass into headquarters. After a couple good shots to the face with my fists. I don't understand why they are using a yacht. Isn't that a little conspicuous?\" \"Or really inconspicuous,\" Tuck said. Both Tuck and Amanda waited with bated breaths to see if anyone else came around the corner in the marina. When no one did, they both knew it was time to move before the boat did. \"Go,\" Tuck told her. They both ran for the lower deck of the yacht that was still tied up at its slot in the marina. No one was watching this area, so they took it as a good sign. \"Can Sophie swim?\" Tuck whispered to Amanda as they crept along side of the desk. Amanda nodded to indicate yes. She wasn't sure what he was thinking, but she now was now assuming that she was going to get wet. But it didn't matter; she was steps away from getting her niece back and bringing down Leonid. \"Danny! I want to feed the ducks!\" \"You can feed the ducks in a little bit, okay, Sophie?\" Danny told her. \"Okay,\" Sophie said. \"When am I going to go see my dad?\" she asked. It dawned on Amanda; that's why Sophie wasn't fighting to get away. They told her they were going to see Greg, Sophie's dad, and she was just young enough to believe the lie. \"I'm going to go in and see what we have that you can feed to the ducks. I'll be right back,\" Danny told her. \"I want to go home!\" they heard Joe shout. \"Take me home! My dad is going to kick your butt!\" he told his captors. \"He's not wrong,\" Tuck whispered. \"I'm sure your dad'll be along soon enough,\" Danton told them. \"Now, you stay here and keep your friend Sophie company and I'll go get some bread or something so you can both feed the ducks.\" Tuck and Amanda heard the cabin door close and then Joe was talking to Sophie quietly. \"No, Sophie. They aren't taking us to see your dad,\" Joe told her. \"Yes they are! Danny told me that he was sent by my daddy, he's in the Marines , to get us. But he said that he could only see one of us at a time, so I get to go first. Then Alex and Cammy,\" Sophie told Joe. \"No, Sophie. No,\" Joe told her. \"We need to get away from these guys. Hold my hand and we'll go see if they have some kind of little boats or something. My dad taught me how to steer a boat,\" Joe said. \"Can you swim, though? We might have to go in the water.\" \"I can swim,\" Sophie said in small voice as she started to understand a little of everything. \"I'll go get the kids. You go get the boat over there ready. We can make our escape that way,\" Amanda said. \"Oh, really?\" Leonid, aka Travis, said from behind them. … To Be Continued… Let me know what you thought! Thanks![Chapter 12] A New War Chapter 12 \"Oh, really?\" Leonid, aka Travis, said from behind them. Slowly tuck and Amanda turned around to look at the source of the voice. \"Stand up, the both of you,\" he ordered them. \"And put your guns down on the deck.\" Both of them removed their guns from themselves and stood, moving slowly because of the gun in his hand that was being aimed in their general direction. \"I didn't want to have to shoot you in front of your children,\" he said, his full Russian accent coming out as he spoke. \"But I'll do what I have to. Get moving!\" He marched the both of them out onto the deck with the kids. \"Dad!\" Joe shouted and tried to dash for Tuck. Danton Yencich caught the boy by his shirt collar to stop him. \"Aunt Mandy!\" Sophie called and waved. \"Stay with Joe,\" Amanda shouted back. Sophie nodded when she saw the gun in Leonid's hand. \"Look how brave your dad and your aunt are, coming after you,\" Leonid said in a sarcastic voice. \"Aunt Mandy! They told me that I was going to see daddy, but I don't believe them anymore,\" Sophie yelled. Amanda could do nothing, but nod at the little girl. Leonid crossed the deck towards the kids and pushed the girl to quiet her and the force of the shove knocked her down and she started to cry. \"She's just a little girl!\" Amanda told him. \"Let her be!\" she said as she tried to move towards the child. \"Don't you dare move,\" Leonid trained the gun at her. \"Honey, it's going to be okay,\" she told Sophie. The small girl was back on her feet, thanks to Joe, and sniffled and nodded at her aunt. Leonid smirked. \"Go ahead, lie to the children. See if that makes you feel any better,\" he told Tuck and Amanda. \"But everything is not going to be okay.\" \"What are you doing?\" Tuck said. \"These are just children. They have nothing to do with any of this.\" Leonid laughed; a short, sarcastic, sadistic, laugh. \"You really have no idea, do you?\" he asked. \"You should have considered all of this when you killed my brother.\" Amanda had no idea what he was talking about, but out of the corner of her eye she saw Tuck's expression harden. He knew. \"You aren't Heinrich's brother,\" Tuck said. \"Because Heinrich was after us for his real brother's death.\" Leonid moved towards them again and swung the gun excited as he spoke. \"So we weren't from the same mother! We grew up together! And you…\" he pointed the gun at Amanda. \"You've got a lot of nerve to lock one of my nephews up in your agency building. It was embarrassing to find out that he'd been taken in by a woman.\" Amanda narrowed her eyes and bit her tongue. Now was not the time to argue women's lib. Because a bullet was going to hurt just the same. Yencich was still standing guard over the children; Joe was looking around, trying to decide something. Amanda wasn't sure what he was doing, but it looked like he was trying to find an escape route…and the only way out was going into the water. And even doing that wasn't a sure escape; a bullet traveled pretty quickly. The yacht engines kicked on loudly, causing the boat to hum and vibrate. The yacht was moving, slowly, out into the deeper water of the marina. \"I have to go to the bathroom,\" Joe shouted. Everyone's heads turned in Joe's direction. \"Ocean is that way, kid,\" Leonid said. \"Ugh, no,\" Joe said. \"I need a bathroom,\" he said. Leonid sighed loudly and angrily and rolled his neck and shoulders. \"Fine! Yencich, take him to the bathroom. And take the girl with you. Don't let either of them out of your sight.\" \"What's he going to do? Flush himself? They're a couple of children and I am a grown man. Of course I can keep my eye on them.\" Yencich muttered. \"Let's go!\" he yelled at both kids. Yencich started to walk the kids out of sight. They were out of sight around the corner when everyone heard him shout. \"Stupid kid!\" Yencich shouted. They heard a thud, like something heavy hitting the wooden deck of the yacht and then a string of broken curses in Russian. Amanda tried to run again, towards the sound, but Leonid aimed his gun at her. \"Yencich!\" Leonid called over his shoulder so he didn't have to take the gun away. A set of splashes was heard next and Amanda's heart broke. \"Yencich!\" Leonid called again when he got no response. \"The kids jumped over the railing into the water. I don't see them,\" Yencich shouted as he came around the corner once more. He was limping. \"What happened?\" Leonid shouted in Russian. \"The boy kicked me in my injured leg,\" he replied. When I bent down to look at my wound, they jumped over the side.\" \"You're such a f*ing idiot!\" Leonid shouted. He turned and aimed the gun at Yencich and fired a single shot. Silently it connected with him and Yencich fell to the deck of the boat in a heap. The life in his former henchman disappeared as he bled out on the deck. \"So stupid,\" Leonid muttered. \"They are children; how could they have gotten very far?\" He temporarily forgot about Tuck and Amanda and he dashed to the railing. In the second he had, Tuck grabbed the guns that were still lying on the deck. Around the corner, Leonid was firing blindly into the water. He was screaming incomprehensively as he frantically searched. Tuck rushed after Leonid while Amanda rushed to the opposite deck and tried to find the kids. Her stomach dropped when she didn't see them. She couldn't see any sign of them and despite the fact that they weren't in that deep of water, their small bodies wouldn't be able to keep swimming long distances. Leonid had turned just in time to see Tuck coming after him and while he had a gun in his hand, Leonid decided to throw a punch. The two men proceeded to get into a fist fight, both pummeling the other as hard as they could. The only difference was that Tuck was hitting Leonid with all the force of an angry father. Crewmembers that were also more of Leonid's henchmen came running to their deck, finally and Amanda was surrounded by five men with guns, all aimed at her. \"Give me your gun,\" one of the men told her. \"Shit,\" Amanda hissed as he took the gun forcefully from her hand. Tuck and Leonid rolled into sight from around the corner. But then there were two of Leonid's men standing over Tuck with their guns fixed on him. They came to a complete stop as they realized what was going on. One of the men helped Leonid to his feet and he wiped at his bloody nose. Tuck was still on the ground, bleeding from the corner of his mouth and his forehead. \"Well, at least some of my men know what to do,\" Leonid said. \"Put the both of them below deck. And do something with this mess,\" he said, toeing Yencich's body. Tuck and Amanda were forced below deck and tied to the chairs in a small bedroom. A tear rolled down Amanda's cheek before she could stop it. She didn't want to cry, especially in front of Tuck, but she couldn't control it any more. \"We're going to get out of here and we're going to get the kids,\" Tuck told her. \"I didn't see them in the water,\" Amanda said. \"I don't know where they could have gone. We're further away from any of the docks than I thought. And while Sophie can swim, I don't think…\" \"Stop,\" Tuck said. \"Joe wouldn't have jumped if he didn't think he could make it,\" he explained. \"My son…\" \"You've raised him well,\" Amanda said. \"He was awfully brave back there.\" \"Which is why I know that they're safe. Very wet, but safe,\" Tuck said. \"I've got a lot of faith in my son. I might not have been the best father, but I know Joe is okay,\" he said. \"So, how are we going to get out of here?\" Amanda asked. To Be Continued… … Let me know what you think…[Chapter 13] Disclaimer: This chapter is rated M. This chapter has some coarse language and some adult situations. Please, don't read this if you're uncomfortable with these things. A New War Chapter 13 \"I can't honestly say that I have never ended up like this,\" Amanda said. \"And I do not like this,\" Amanda finished thorough gritted teeth. Her fingertips were raw and her nails broken as she clawed at the ropes that bound her hands behind her back. Her shoulders were sore and her body was stuck at an awkward and uncomfortable angle as the chair chosen for her was unusual. In spite of the situation, Tuck looked perfectly comfortable and relaxed in his own chair. Tuck almost made a smart comment about her own statement, but decided that it wasn't the same. \"Can you see anything?\" Amanda asked. Tuck had managed to bounce his chair to a window that was only partially under water. Unfortunately, that was the only thing he could make out. \"No, there's only water. Everywhere, water,\" Tuck replied dejectedly. The yacht was moving at a quick pace; faster than Tuck thought it would considering the sheer size of the vessel. They were already clear of the marina and out into the ocean. No one had been down to check on them in at least two hours and now Amanda really had to go to the bathroom. None of her CIA and survival training could help her battle a full bladder combined with a pissed off attitude. Amanda did not know what to say. \"Well, if I'm going to die, at least I'm with someone I enjoy spending time with,\" Tuck told her. Amanda still said nothing. \"I know it's not much of a consolation,\" Tuck told her. \"I'm sorry. This is not your fault,\" Amanda told him. \"I'm just…\" \"Don't worry. I know,\" he replied back. Amanda's sore fingers continued their attempt at untying the knot. \"My fingers have to be bleeding,\" Amanda told Tuck. \"I keep slipping as I try to undo this,\" she finished. \"I can't move my hands enough to even try,\" Tuck said. \"Well, you have semi-use of your legs and feet,\" Amanda pointed out. \"When I get my hands on that asshole Leonid…\" she trailed off. \"I am going to wrap whatever bloody stubs I have around his neck until he is no longer breathing.\" \"Shh,\" Tuck whispered. Both of them stopped at their attempts to free themselves while they listened for approaching footsteps and voices. \"Leonid said the prisoners would not be going with us,\" a man said in Russian. \"How much longer until we reach the other vessel?\" a second man's voice asked, also in Russian. \"About an hour. The exterior of the boat is much less flashy than this one and we won't draw as much attention,\" the first man answered. \"I suppose we should check on the two in there,\" one said. \"I don't know why we haven't killed them already.\" Both Tuck and Amanda recognized the scrape of a deadbolt lock that turned before the door to the room swung open. Two men, who couldn't have been more than 25 years old each, stood in front of them. One was blond and one was a red head. Neither of them really looked like they were a pair of henchmen, but they seemed to be Leonid's goons. \"Thank goodness you're here,\" Amanda said breathlessly in English. \"I have my last request.\" Both of the men laughed at her. \"We are not taking your last request because we have no intention of fulfilling it, bitch,\" the blond one replied. \"Hey! Watch your language!\" Tuck told them. One of the men turned and slapped Tuck across the face, hard, and Tuck's nose began to bleed again. \"I'll tell this… bitch …whatever I want,\" the other man said. \"Are you sure you don't want to hear my last request? No man has ever been able to do it for me…\" she said in a suggestive tone. \"Oh?\" the red head said. Amanda shrugged as well as she could. \"Nope.\" \"What is it?\" the second man said. \"Come here and I'll whisper it to you,\" she told him. He looked to his cohort and they silently debated what they could do. Finally, the young man walked to Amanda and bent down to listen to her. As she spoke, Tuck saw the kid's eyes grow wide. He stepped back and looked at her. \"Do you think he'd be up for it?\" Amanda asked, motioning to the other man. Tuck noticed the totally innocent look on Amanda's face, but the devious smile that was on the young man's face meant something else. What did she say to him? \"Well?\" the second man asked in Russian. The first man walked to the other and dropped his voice low so Tuck could not make out anything. His curiosity was piqued and Amanda's impassive, almost stoic face, gave nothing away. \"Normally, we can't take last requests from prisoners, but…\" smiling an evil smile he continued. \"Well, make an exception.\" \"Perfect,\" Amanda smiled. \"I suppose you'll need to be untied,\" the blond said. Tuck was more confused than ever as the henchman moved behind her to start releasing her from her bonds. \"Where should we take her?\" the other one asked. \"We should just do it right here,\" the first answered. \"What about him?\" \"Seriously, boys? Make him watch,\" she replied. \"Tuck's own eyes went wide when he realized what she had promised them. He began to pull harder at the bonds on his wrists and ankles. He never believed she had any intention of going through with it, but he wanted to be able to help when she needed him. Amanda was loose in another second and she stretched seductively. Her muscles were cramped and she needed them at that precise moment. One of the men ran his finger along her exposed collarbone and she tried as hard as she could to keep from shuddering and possibly vomiting in complete and total disgust. Amanda fixed a non-committal smile on her face and tried to keep their attention on her and not on Tuck, who was furiously trying to free himself still. And she was doing a pretty damn good job of it. She started removing her cardigan and both men were staring at her fixedly. \"Don't you think it's kind of cruel to do this to your boyfriend?\" one of the men said to her as she took off the shirt she had on. He walked to her and closed the gap between them. He started to kiss her neck when Amanda slid her hands around his neck. She put more strength into her hold and he started to fight back. The grip she had on him was enough to cut off some of his oxygen and that surprised him. His hands came up and tried to pry her off of him, but her nails were starting to dig into his skin. The other man had noticed Tuck's attempts to free himself and was now focused on fighting him. Tuck's legs were totally free and he had the chair attached to him to use as a weapon. Tuck spun and used the chair to hit the young man. The wooden legs cracked and splintered into a million pieces as the guy fell backwards. Tuck's hands were still stuck behind his back, but he now had full range of motion with his legs. The man Amanda was fighting was now trying to choke her as well. His hand moved over her mouth and nose. He thought if he could cut off her oxygen, she would be easier to fight, but Amanda bit his finger as hard as she could. \"You bitch!\" he howled in pain as she stomped on his foot. \"Guilty!\" she agreed. He gathered himself and he charged her. The forced knocked the both of them to the ground and a mix of wrestling and punching ensued. Tuck's opponent thought Tuck was going to be easy, too, since he was still partially bound, but Tuck was putting up a strong fight. Tuck kicked out, and despite the usual stigma, his foot connected with the young man's crotch. The other man howled in agony and fell to his knees. Tuck kicked him then with his kneecap; it connected solidly with the kid's skull and made a terrible crack. Tuck watched the kid fall over unconscious and he reflexively moved his knee to make sure it wasn't his kneecap that was broken. It moved find with only moderate pain; he was all right. He needed to help Amanda who was still locked in a dirty fight with the other man. Tuck was able to break the rest of the chair on the doorframe as another man came running into the room. Tuck had the unconscious man's gun in his hand and the very young man put his hands up. \"Get in here,\" Tuck said. \"Get off of her or I'll shoot you in your fucking head,\" he told the other man. He turned to the kid. \"I want your gun.\" The fight instantly stopped and Amanda scrambled off the floor. They closed the door and looked at the henchmen they now had as prisoners. \"How big is the crew?\" Tuck asked. \"How many more of you are there?\" \"I will never tell you,\" the man who had been fighting Amanda said. Tuck walked to the man and pulled on the man's hair. \"You will fucking tell me or I will shoot you in the fucking head,\" Tuck told him. \"Do you understand me?\" He had so much pent up anger that he figured he wouldn't even feel guilty shooting him. \"Do it!\" he dared Tuck. Tuck moved the gun and fired a warning shot into his leg. The man tried to move in pain, but Tuck still had a firm hold on his scalp. \"How many are coming down here now?\" \"There ten of us. Without you two,\" he cried. Tears were streaming down his face and blood gushed from the wound. \"Did that count Yencich?\" Amanda asked. \"Yes, yes,\" he replied. \"She tossed a spare rope in his direction. \"You should use this as a tourniquet,\" Amanda told him. \"We need to get the hell out of here.\" \"The other boat is going to have hundreds of people on it,\" Tuck said. They used each other as cover and removed themselves from the room. Tuck locked the door as Amanda kept watch. They weren't safe yet, but at least they were out of their prison. As they began to walk, Tuck realized he needed to know something. \"What exactly did you tell that kid…?\" … Author's Note: sorry it's been a while. But what did you think? Let me know![Chapter 14] A New War Chapter 14 \"Search the whole boat. It's a tiny ship! Where could they be?\" Leonid shouted. He was furious that his men had let the two CIA agents slip through their fingers. It wasn't rocket science to know how to keep the both of them locked up and stuck in a room and yet they had failed. \"Why the hell did you untie them?\" he shouted. He kicked the man who had bled out all over the floor before putting the rope around his leg to stop it. No one replied. \"Well?\" Leonid continued to ask. \"I want to know how they escaped.\" Still none of them wanted to answer to Leonid. \"What the hell happened? You must have been shot with your own gun, you moron, and you, you were knocked unconscious,\" Leonid observed. \"And you…why were you even down here?\" Leonid asked the third one. \"I…uh…I came down here because I hadn't seen them in a while,\" he replied to Leonid. \"So when I came down here, I found them already untied.\" \"We never untied the man,\" the blond man said to Leonid. \"He attacked me with his chair and kicked me until I was unconscious.\" \"How did the woman get free?\" Leonid asked. \"Well.\" \"Well what?\" he shouted. \"Tell me or I'll shoot you in your other leg!\" \"She had a last request,\" one man told their boss. \"Well, she said she had a last request. So after she told me what it was, we untied her.\" \"You're a moron, and you're a moron, and you, well, you don't deserve to be on this ship,\" Leonid said. He raised his gun and fired a bullet to the third henchman in the room. His eyes went wide and he slumped over on the ground. \"Now, I should do the same thing to you two losers, but I think I'm going to make you both help everyone search for the agents.\" \"Boss, Mr. Leonid, I can't walk,\" the one that had been shot told him. Leonid shrugged disinterestedly. \"I don't care! Move!\" The kid struggled to his feet and he gingerly put weight on it. He howled in pain again and went crashing to the ground again. However, this time he was unconscious. The pain had caused him to pass out. \"Whatever. Never mind. You stay here,\" Leonid said to the last man. He stepped toward the door. \"No! Don't leave me here!\" He yelled. But it was too late. His boss had slammed and locked the door and he was now left with a dead man and one that was going to bleed to death. Leonid didn't care. And it certainly didn't matter that he was his godson. He did not tolerate stupidity. And these three were some of the stupidest. After this fiasco, Leonid wasn't going to be using family ever again. It just was useless to try to include them. No, he was definitely going to use people with experience from now on. His next task was to find the two CIA agents. They had managed to get away from the ridiculous children he'd been employing, but they wouldn't get away from him. He slammed his fist into the wall and the paneling cracked with the force. First the two kids had gotten away, but he assumed they drowned. And now both Hansen and Simons were gone. But not for long; he was going to go through the whole ship to find them. And no one could get away…he had the main deck safely guarded and all of the lifeboats were thrown overboard. No one was getting away from him, especially not these two. These two were going to pay. \"We don't have much time left to hide here,\" Amanda whispered. She and Tuck were crouched down, hiding, while the remaining crewmen searched the ship. Eventually, their hiding spot would be found, simply by process of elimination. What his men lacked in, well, everything, they were going to be epically great at hide and seek. \"Well, we've got a couple of options,\" Tuck replied. \"We can make a break for it and we might get shot at in the process, or…\" \"We could wait and let them find us and then they can shoot us,\" Amanda finished. \"So what poison do you choose?\" \"There is the chance, since we also have guns that we could shoot our way off of the boat.\" Amanda nodded. \"I suppose.\" \"You don't seem convinced,\" Tuck said. \"I mean we could do it.\" \"Well, whatever we're doing, we need to do it now,\" she told him. Amanda motioned with her head to the right. That direction was clear. They could start that way. They would probably never make it in the ocean, but they could try to take over the ship they were on. Tuck moved past her and snuck up on one man first. Tuck swung and made direct contact with the man's skull. He started to fall and Tuck caught him before he made too much noise on the deck. Amanda attempted the same kind of maneuver, but wasn't as lucky. She was now defending herself against two assailants. Tuck started to help her, but more started to surround them. How many people were on this ship really? Both Tuck and Amanda knew that they were exhausted, but their only hope of getting out alive was to continue to fight. If the men thought she was going to be limited because of her skirt, they were sadly mistaken. She kicked one and the slit of her skirt went higher, giving her a better range of motion. The same man came back and landed a punch that knocked her onto her butt. Both men came running at her and she was able to trip one while she started a fight with the second. \"Fight back all you want!\" Leonid's voice told them. \"But here is the next leg of our trip and you will not be joining us. Stephen, are there sharks in this part of the ocean?\" \"I believe sharks are everywhere, sir,\" Stephen, a man to his left, replied. An evil smile spread across Leonid's face. \"Good. Go on and shoot them, then throw the both of them overboard,\" he ordered. \"If you're lucky, they'll get you quickly. But maybe you'll be one of those shark attack victims that lives to talk about all of the horrors.\" Amanda was picked up and set on her feet by the man she had kicked previously while their boat came alongside a very large freighter. Tuck was forced over next to Amanda while the very few remaining crew members held them at gunpoint. \"Why do we keep ending up like this?\" Amanda asked. \"Because I really don't enjoy it. I would want anyone to think I have enjoyed it,\" she babbled. Up until this point, she thought they stood a chance, but now it was looking like the end for Tuck and Amanda. \"Ditto,\" was all Tuck managed before people from the other ship landed next to them on the deck. \"All right!\" one of the men called. \"Hands up! Or I will shoot!\" Amanda started to comply and put her hands up, but Tuck grinned at her and stopped her. He knew that voice and he knew it was the voice of someone on their side. \"Hey, mate,\" Tuck said to FDR as more men surrounded Leonid and his bad guys. \"Did ya miss me?\" FDR asked with a huge grin on his face. \"How did you take over the freighter?\" Amanda asked. \"How did you even find out about it?\" \"Well, I had a little bit of help,\" FDR pointed. Tuck and Amanda squinted in the direction that FDR was pointing. Amanda had no idea who the man was, but Tuck sighed loudly and she thought she saw a smile on the unknown man's face. \"You didn't,\" Tuck said. \"Well, the alternative was that you would be dead now,\" FDR told him. \"He was already working on it from the European side of things anyway. And, well, he's your brother.\" Two CIA agents marched Leonid past Tuck and Amanda. He was shackled behind his back, but that didn't stop the sneer from forming on his face. \"Hold on,\" Tuck said. They stopped moving Leonid along and Tuck looked into the man's eyes. \"You almost won,\" he said before punching the man as hard as he could in the gut. Leonid let out a puff of air as all oxygen left his diaphragm. His face turned green as though he was going to be sick and he tried to fall onto his knees in pain, but the two men on either side of him wouldn't let him move. \"My son had better be okay. Otherwise, our next chat won't be as pleasant as this one.\" The two agents dragged Leonid away and the three of them were almost alone. \"How are the kids?\" Amanda asked. She felt guilty. While she had been in immediate danger herself, thoughts of Sophie and Joe were gone. But now it was hitting her full force and she was trying not to cry. Tuck also had a concerned look on his face while they waited for FDR to answer them. \"Well?\" Tuck asked. \"Those kids…\" FDR started, but Tuck had him by the shirt collar. \"So help me if you don't…\" \"Joe and Soph are terrific swimmers,\" FDR announced. \"I would have never guessed. But I was in one of those dinky little boats with one of those pull-cord motors and…\" \"FDR, I need you to tell me a little bit faster. My nerves can't take it,\" Amanda announced. \"I was maybe half a mile behind you guys and I found them on a dock. Joe had pulled them onto one of those random floating docks. I turned around and got them checked out and then joined your brother to get you guys. You should be so proud of those kids.\" \"They are okay? You're not kidding? Both of them?\" Amanda kept asking. FDR smiled. \"Both Sophie and Joe are totally fine. And by now, they're probably dried out,\" FDR finished. All of the adrenaline that she had was gone, Amanda passed out and Tuck very nearly missed catching her before she hit the deck. … To Be Continued… A/N: okay, there was the newest installment. What did you think? Thank you![Chapter 15] A New War Chapter 15 Amanda heard the voices of the people around her before she opened her eyes. She counted them as they all talked amongst themselves. One, two, three, she counted silently. All of the girls were there. Then there was a man's voice. An accented one. Tuck; she recognized. She decided it was time to let them all know she was awake. How long had she been out anyway? She opened her eyes. \"Hey! Hey!\" Sophie shouted. \"She's awake!\" the youngest yelled. Amanda watched as everyone's eyes turned to look at her. She was swarmed by the girls. \"Hey, hold on,\" Tuck said. \"She's just waking up. Give her some space.\" Amanda shook her head. \"No, no. I'm fine,\" she said as she held her arms out to the girls and all of them hugged her. \"Are you all okay?\" she asked. \"Yeah!\" they call chorused together. \"We're okay.\" \"I am so sorry,\" Amanda said as she began to cry. \"Will you come talk at Career Day?\" Alex asked. \"Like, this is so cool!\" \"I don't…\" \"How long have you been a secret agent?\" Cameron asked. \"Can we get a puppy?\" Sophie asked. \"Aren't you supposed to be traumatized?\" Amanda asked. \"I mean, I am very happy that you aren't, but…\" \"I think we should get a puppy that'll grow into one of those really big dogs. And he can eat bad guys so you don't have to fight them,\" Sophie said. \"We could just let the dog out.\" \"That's a great idea,\" Amanda said. \"We'll see, okay? Where's Joe?\" she asked. \"He is at home with his mother. Katie is not pleased with me,\" Tuck said sheepishly. \"Even though Joe is more than fine,\" he told her before she could ask. \"Joe and I jumped off the boat and we swam all the way to one of those floaty dock things. I pretended that I was Ariel,\" Sophie smiled. \"Can I dye my hair red?\" \"No,\" Amanda said. \"You have beautiful blond hair,\" she said. \"And your dad would kill me if I let you dye your hair.\" \"Dad won't know! I'll dye it back before he comes home,\" Sophie said. \"No,\" Amanda shook her head. \"Are FDR and Lauren here somewhere?\" Amanda asked Tuck. \"FDR is out in the hall.\" \"Hey, ladies,\" Amanda started. \"Can you go out and find FDR in the hallway? I need to talk to Tuck alone for a minute.\" \"Sure! Frankie is sooooo cool!\" Sophie giggled. She clearly knew calling him Frankie would work his nerves. Alex kissed her aunt on the cheek and Cam squeezed her hand before they all left the hospital room. \"I can't believe this all worked out,\" Tuck smiled, as he sat down on the edge of the bed next to her. \"I have my son and the girls…and you. And Leonid is in custody…\" \"I am going to move the girls to Michigan,\" Amanda announced. \"What?\" he said. \"You're joking.\" \"I just think it would be best for everyone, especially the girls. I almost got my nieces killed. And your son. I think I'm going to hang up my badge and find a nice quiet librarian job. At least I won't be risking people's lives.\" \"But…\" \"Tuck, I really like you. Like, really like you and I don't want give up my job, but…\" \"Then don't. Don't quit and don't go. There are more precautions we can't take. We need to give… this …a chance,\" he told her. He was up off the hospital bed now, pacing the room. \"I don't want to sound like a martyr, but I have to take care of these kids. Their mom died. And their dad is somewhere in the Middle East. I can't guarantee that they'll ever see him again. My parents are retiring soon. They can't afford to take on the care of three little kids. I'm all they have and…\" \"But you can stay here. You don't have to move across the country,\" he said. \"Tuck, I have to take them somewhere that I can get them away from everything.\" \"And when did you decide this? While you were passed out? Because you can't make these kind of decisions in a stressful situation, you…\" \"Tuck, I cannot put myself ahead of these kids,\" Amanda said. \"Would you put yours ahead of Joe and his safety? No, you wouldn't. Because he's your son.\" Their voices were raised and they knew they were probably being heard in the hallway. FDR knocked once before popping his head in. \"Lover's quarrel?\" he smirked. \"Go away, Franklin,\" Tuck said. \"Sheesh. What…\" \"I'm going to move the girls to Michigan. I think it would be safer for everyone,\" Amanda explained. \"Well…that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard,\" FDR said instantly. \"I don't recall asking your opinion,\" Amanda told him in an icy tone. \"I don't think that I care,\" FDR told her. \"Do you really think moving them is going to be the best for them? Because I think they're fine.\" \"When did you become an expert on children?\" Amanda asked. \"Both of my parents died when I was young. I was traumatized. I hid in my room for days and then…\" \"FDR…\" \"No, no,\" FDR said. \"Kids don't fake shit. Usually. If Sophie was really so traumatized, she'd be cowering in a corner. Kids have defense mechanisms, but it's usually shutting down or acting out. Not being excited to get a puppy. Which, by the way, you should probably get her a puppy.\" Neither Amanda or Tuck said anything. \"Take it however you want, but remember, I'm usually right. About everything…always,\" FDR told them. He gave each one of them a smile and exited the room once more. \"How did he pass the psych portion of the exams? Because he's crazy,\" Amanda said. \"I wonder that myself sometimes,\" Tuck said. \"Can we just put the plans to move on hold for a bit? I won't try to stop you, but I think we deserve to attempt our own happiness while we take care of the little ones,\" he explained. Before Amanda could answer with more than a smile, the door to her room banged open and a woman came running into the room. \"Oh, my poor baby!\" the woman cooed. She pulled Amanda close and squeezed her tightly. \"Mom…\" Amanda sighed. \"I was so worried.\" \"Mom, how…\" \"Cameron called us last night. We've been flying all day,\" her mom said. She released her from the grip she had on her. \"Why didn't you tell us you,\" she dropped her voice. \"…worked for the CIA?\" she asked. \"How could you lie to all of us?\" \"Greg knows,\" Amanda countered. \"I don't care. I am your mother.\" She seemed to not notice Tuck's presence in the room. He started to move for the door, but the mom finally saw him. \"Who are you?\" she asked. \"Tuck Hansen,\" he said, extending his hand to her. \"Oh, you're the boyfriend, then. Cammie told me all about you. And your accent,\" the mom said with her eyes narrowed at Tuck. \"He's not…\" \"I'm not…\" \"You spent the night with my daughter; that's what Cammie told me.\" \"Well, that happened, mom, but it wasn't what you think…\" Amanda tried to explain. \"By the way, Tuck. This is my mom, Pattie Simons.\" \"Well, it's nice to meet you, Mrs. Simons.\" \"Don't call me that. That is my mother in law,\" she told him. \"Call me Pattie.\" \"Okay,\" Tuck said in an unsure way. \"Could you give us a minute alone, Mr. Hansen?\" she asked. He nodded. \"Of course. I'll go check on the girls,\" he said. \"And FDR.\" Amanda watched him leave and really wished that he wasn't going. The door closed and Amanda braced herself. \"What would you have done if those girls had been killed?\" her mom asked. \"How long have you been down this career path?\" \"Since I was 19,\" Amanda answered. \"I changed my major to criminal justice and…\" \"You have a degree hanging in our living room that says you have a BA in Art History.\" \"Well, the CIA is pretty thorough for background stories…\" \"How did you get involved? Have you killed anyone?\" her mom asked with wide eyes. \"Mom, I would rather not answer that,\" Amanda said as she started to get up off of the bed. \"Do you see my clothes somewhere?\" \"You need to stay and rest. Your face is black and blue,\" her mom said she started to cry. \"Mom, I'm fine. And apparently the girls are better than fine. Do you think it would be okay if we moved in with you and dad for a bit? Until I can sell the place out here and find us something else?\" \"No.\" \"No?\" Amanda said, standing up from her crouched position next to the hospital bed. \"You are not moving those girls. I spoke to them. And they think their aunt is the coolest thing since sliced bread.\" \"I said 'we' right? I'm not just moving the girls to Michigan. I would go, too. And find a new job,\" Amanda said. \"Doesn't matter. You could have gotten them killed, but you didn't. You risked your life to get them home safe. I'm not thrilled that you carry a gun, but I would hate to see the guy you were fighting based on the way you look,\" her mom said. \"So, to sum it up: as angry as I am that you lied to me…for years…and that you almost got yourself and all of my grandchildren killed, you didn't. And you're here to get yelled at for it now.\" They remained silent while they both processed the situation. \"Do I really look that bad?\" Amanda asked. \"You look like hell,\" her mom told her. \"Thanks, mom.\" \"Hey, I'm honest to a fault,\" her mom smiled. \"You must get the lying streak from your father.\" The mood lifted significantly and Amanda crossed the room to hug her mom. \"I'm sorry, mom,\" she said. \"This whole thing went a lot better than I thought I could have,\" Amanda said. \"I was going to tell you last Thanksgiving, but Greg made that pronouncement about going back overseas and…\" \"Weren't you scared?\" her mom asked as Amanda pulled on the leggings that her nieces must have brought her. \"Of course, mom. I don't particularly like getting guns drawn on me or doing hand to hand combat. And I ruined my favorite skirt in the process,\" Amanda explained. \"And all of that was on top of the fact that I almost lost my nieces.\" \"Your dad and I are going take the girls to Disneyland for a week. We talked on the plane that if they were really okay, we'd take them. And I think they really are okay,\" her mom said. \"I should probably call the airline and apologize, too.\" \"For what?\" Amanda asked. \"Well, we were frantic when we needed tickets. We weren't very kind to the ticket agent and then we made one of those flight attendants move us where we wouldn't bother people with our praying.\" \"Oh,\" Amanda said. \"I see.\" \"So, I'll go find the girls and we'll go get their things from…Lauren's house? Who is Lauren?\" \"She is a friend of mine,\" Amanda told her. \"Okay, well, we can get the girls' things and then probably stay in a hotel tonight. Then we can head to Disneyland tomorrow,\" her mom said. \"We'll be gone a week or so. You can get the security in that house set up.\" \"Unfortunately, all the security in the world can't compete with a five year old that wants to open the front door when her nanny is going to the bathroom.\" \"She did what?\" \"It's not her fault. She opened the door. It has never been an issue before, so why would it even have crossed her mind?\" Amanda said. \"But that front door is triple walled steel. If it had remained closed and locked, no one would have gotten in. . My windows are bulletproof glass. And they are all wired with a state of the art security system. But it can't stop someone who was let into the house.\" Amanda finished and started for the door, but Pattie stopped her. \"What?\" Amanda asked. \"I want to know about Tuck,\" her mom said. \"Mom…\" she whined. \"You're 28 years old. Don't do that,\" her mom warned. \"So, have you and he…you know…\" \"Mom!\" Amanda blushed. \"I'm not…\" \"Well, he's cute. No, handsome. No, well, he's sexy. And I think you should, if you already haven't. Because you aren't getting any younger.\" … To Be Continued… … Author's Note: What did you think?[Chapter 16] A New War Sixteen \"I just don't even know why you still want me,\" Jeanne told her. It was the day after Amanda had been released from the hospital. She had to convince the woman to meet her for coffee, but eventually Jeanne had given in . \"I just feel so bad,\" Jeanne said. Amanda smiled. \"Okay, so it wasn't exactly like we'd planned, but how often does life happen according to plan?\" \"I know what you're doing and…\" \"Is it working?\" Amanda asked. \"No,\" she replied firmly. \"My parents have the girls and they are safely in Disneyland. They left this morning. I have a security detail on them. And I can personally guarantee that none of the girls will ever answer the door again,\" Amanda told her. \"And they are okay. All of them were checked out by doctors. And I am going to make sure they see one of those shrinks we employ at the agency. All things considered, it went well, honestly.\" Jeanne still looked unconvinced. \"Seriously. I don't want to downplay it because it was scary as hell, but they are okay. Really, they are,\" Amanda told her. \"Will they forgive me?\" Amanda laughed. \"Of course! Sophie wanted to call you and I thought it wasn't a good idea yet.\" \" She wanted to call me? Jeanne asked. \"Soph wanted to call and tell you that she was sorry that she opened the door without asking first,\" Amanda explained. \"I was originally concerned for her because I thought she was going to keep blaming herself that this all happened, but she's back to herself.\" \"Oh, that sweet thing,\" Jeanne said, tearing up. \"Don't you dare cry on me,\" Amanda laughed. \"I can't handle when people cry at me.\" \"You're in a world of hurt considering you have three girls…\" Jeanne said. Amanda nodded. \"That is for sure,\" she answered. \"So, will you at least consider it? Please? I'll beg. It will be pathetic and terribly sad. You aren't going to like it if I beg…\" Amanda said. \"Okay, okay,\" she said, holding her hands up. \"But before I do come back, I want to sit down and talk to the girls,\" Jeanne said. \"With you. And that fella of yours.\" \"That fella of mine?\" Amanda asked. \"Are you two knocking boots yet?\" Jeanne asked. \"I'll bet that's a good time…\" \"You are starting to sound like my mom. And I don't like it.\" Jeanne grinned at her. \"No, I have not had sex with Tuck yet, okay?\" Amanda said. \"Why not?\" \"I think I was a little busy trying to rescue my nieces and his son. And…it is never going to work out.\" \"Ugh, I don't want to hear this sad crap from you. You don't need me to tell you that you're beautiful and that Tuck would be lucky to have you,\" Jeanne said. \"I don't?\" Amanda asked. \"Smart ass,\" Jeanne told her. \"Well, I'm definitely going to continue doing what I do best,\" Amanda said, smiling. \"You have to come back to us. You help keep me sane.\" \"You know a good way to keep yourself sane is to have a good shag every now and then…\" \"Oh, man,\" Amanda sighed. \"Really? Did you really just tell me that?\" Jeanne smiled. \"Now it's settled. I definitely have to come back, my dear. I have to continue to make sure you're making progress with that man,\" Jeanne said. \"Your love life needs more looking-after than those kids do.\" \"Am I really that hopeless?\" Amanda asked. \"Honey, if your love life was a person, it would need CPR,\" Jeanne replied. \"How did all of this become about me?\" Amanda laughed. \"You were so sad about the girls…\" \"You said they were fine. Frankly, looking at your bruised face, I'm more worried about you.\" \"Oh, I've been checked out; I'm fine. A couple broken ribs and my face, but I'm okay,\" Amanda smiled. She looked at Jeanne's silent reaction to her statement. \"You don't believe me?\" \"I have a sinking feeling that you have always been one of those folks that puts on a brave face even when things aren't okay…\" Jeanne trailed off. Amanda said nothing. \"I think you keep a lot bottled up, don't you? That's why when you actually let emotion out, it's like an explosion,\" Jeanne told her. \"Am I right?\" \"Seriously? How did this become all about me?\" \"This is just friendly advice from me. I care about you and those girls and you playing Ms. Sacrifice isn't helping anyone, you understand me?\" Jeanne said. \"Clear as mud,\" Amanda said. \"I should call Tuck and ask if he's busy for lunch? See if he wants to have sex?\" Jeanne laughed. \"I don't think you'd have to worry about what kind of response you'd get,\" she said. \"I think he'd crash his car getting himself to you.\" \"So, you're going to come back? After all, you're part of this crazy family,\" Amanda said. \"Yes,\" Jeanne sighed. \"I'll come back. When are the girls back?\" she asked. \"Next Tuesday,\" Amanda said. \"Unless they decide to keep the girls a bit longer.\" \"Good, you have plenty of time to finish seducing Tuck…\" … Later that evening, Amanda walked up to the restaurant and pulled open the large glass doors. It was one of those trendy restaurants that was going to be open for a short time before something else better came along. She'd allowed herself to get roped into dinner with Lauren and Trish. She told herself she needed some decompress \"girl time\". Lauren and Trish were already seated, she was informed and when she was led back to their table, she found that it wasn't going to be the girl time she'd hoped. FDR, Bob, Trish's husband, and Tuck were also seated with the two ladies. Tuck immediately rose and pulled out the chair next to him for Amanda to sit in. \"You look like shit,\" Trish exclaimed when she finally saw all of Amanda's injuries. \"You really do.\" \"Ah, thank you,\" Amanda said, staring down at her menu. She thought she'd done a fairly decent job covering up the bruises and scrapes with make-up, but apparently not. \"It wasn't exactly a fun time,\" Tuck muttered. \"Are we drinking? Where's the waiter?\" Amanda asked. \"I'll just go back to the bar. Can I get anyone anything?\" Tuck slid his chair back. \"I'll go with you.\" The two of them started off in the direction of the back of the restaurant towards the bar. Absentmindedly, he put his hand on the small of her back to guide her. \"I was tricked into this, too,\" he told her. Amanda let out a dry laugh. \"What would happen if we just left?\" Amanda asked. Tuck's face snapped in her direction. \"The table is just enough out of the way that they'd never see us leave. I already checked,\" he told her. \"Let's go,\" Amanda said. She pulled on Tuck's arm and they headed at a quick pace right out of the restaurant. \"Order in at your place?\" Amanda said as they headed for her vehicle. \"That is the best idea I might have ever heard,\" Tuck told her. … … By the time they got back to Tuck's apartment, neither of them was thinking about food. Tuck could barely tear his hands away from Amanda to unlock the door. It was like all of the built up emotion was finally coming out. While he finally got the door unlocked and opened, Amanda had unbuttoned his shirt and was now working on his belt buckle. They had a flight of stairs to contend with next and despite the difficulty, Amanda had wiggled free of her dress and Tuck had kicked free of his pants. By the time they were at the top of the stairs, Tuck was staring down at her in awe at her in just a bra and panty set. His hands ghosted along her ribcage where the bruises stood out purple against her slightly tanned skin. Amanda winced slightly, but then put her mouth back on his. … … Amanda woke up and blinked into the sunlight streaking across the room. A bare arm was across her waist and she smiled when she realized whose arm it was. She looked across the room and saw their clothes from last night were draped across the chair in the corner. Tuck must have gotten up at some point in the night and picked everything up. Amanda yawned and decided to go back to sleep. The next time she woke up, it was because someone was pressing light kisses on the side of her neck and slowly moving down her exposed shoulder. Amanda opened one eye and smiled at him. \"Good morning,\" Amanda told him. \"Sleep well?\" she asked. \"Almost too well,\" he replied. \"You?\" \"Almost forgot where I was,\" she told him. \"What time is it?\" she asked as he stretched then winced in pain as she forgot her bruised ribs. \"You're beautiful,\" he told her before capturing her mouth with his own. Amanda laughed. \"You already got me in bed…\" she trailed off. \"Does that mean I can't admire your beauty anymore?\" he asked. \"It means our next move is a shower. Can I use your shower?\" she asked. Tuck smiled. \"Only if I can join you,\" he said. \"Hopefully that wasn't too forward.\" \"I unbuttoned your shirt and unbuckled your belt, totally sober, out on the street in front of your apartment. I don't think…\" Tuck kissed her again to silence her. A second later he'd thrown the covers back on the bed and picked her up over his shoulder. \"Shower time,\" he announced. Amanda giggled the entire time she was carried into the bathroom. … … \"What is this?\" he traced his finger around the outline of a tattoo on her lower back as they stood under the running water. \"A drunken mistake,\" she said, trying to turn out of his grip, but failing. \"Oh, no, no,\" he smiled and laughed. He bent to get a closer look at the shape. \"I really don't you that close to my butt like that…\" Amanda told him. \"Then just tell me the story,\" he said as he stood back to full height. The smile on his face was sincere and it was melting Amanda's heart and resolve. \"It looks like a bat…\" \"It's a botched bat-symbol,\" Amanda told him. \"My friends and I were really, really drunk. And I lost a bet and ended up with a really bad tattoo artist and a tattoo that looks like a three year old drew it,\" Amanda explained. \"Why the bat-symbol?\" he laughed. Amanda laughed, too. \"We played darts and that's the design that I hit. Well, technically I missed the dart board and hit the autographed Adam West picture…I was really drunk. Have I mentioned that?\" she said. \"It kind of looks like a lumpy bunny,\" he said running his hand over it again. Amanda kissed him again as the water came down on the both of them. \"What does this mean…for the both of us now?\" Amanda asked. \"I'd understand if the mystery was gone now…\" \"Do you really think I'm done learning about you?\" he asked. \"I'd like to think we're just getting started. When are the girls back?\" he asked. \"Next week,\" she said, sliding her hands up his chest. \"Well, then…I'm hoping I get some of your time in those days,\" he told her. … … Author's note: thanks for being patient and waiting for an update. I hope this wasn't a letdown. I just figured Tuck deserved a bit of fluff and a break from beating people up all the time. Let me know what you thought![Chapter 17] A New War Chapter 17 \"That is all we need?\" Tuck asked. \"A head of lettuce and heavy cream?\" he said before kissing her cheek gently. They were standing in Tuck's kitchen. There were some pots and pans out as well as various ingredients and spices that she'd found in his cupboards. \"Heavy cream only if you want dessert,\" Amanda told him. \"But some kind of fancy cheese would be good. Well, some cheese that sounds fancy but is already grated and in some kind of re-sealable container,\" she laughed. Tuck nodded his understanding. \"You got it.\" \"Are you sure you wouldn't rather go out?\" Amanda asked. \"I'm not that great at cooking.\" She continued to stir the sauce that was simmering on the stove. Amanda was dressed only in one of Tuck's discarded shirts and was now cooking in his kitchen. \"It smells good. Besides, then you'd get dressed and I have you do that,\" Tuck told her. \"I just hope you didn't mind cooking…\" \"Nope. This is the one thing I don't mind cooking. Especially for you.\" He came up behind her and kissed the side of her neck while his hands wandered over the hem of the shirt. \"I don't think so.\" Amanda turned in his arms to look at him. \"At some point I'm going to have to go home and face reality,\" she said. \"But not today,\" he smiled. It melted her resolve. \"You are a terrible influence on me,\" Amanda smiled. \"Oh, by the way, did you ever hear back from FDR?\" Tuck grinned and laughed. He then produced his cell phone and held the display for Amanda to read. \"Oh, I think he's mad,\" she laughed. \"I don't care.\" \"Me either,\" she told him. Then she swatted his behind with an oven mitt. \"Get going to the store or I'm eating without you.\" He retaliated by sliding his hand down and squeezed her butt. Tuck was rewarded with a squeal of delight. \"Yes, ma'am. I'll be back in twenty,\" he told her. \"You'd better be. If not, I'll send out a search party.\" Tuck kissed her once more and then he left the apartment. Amanda took a quick second to re-roll the sleeves of Tuck's dress shirt before she continued to stir her sauce. Tuck was the first guy she'd ever wanted to cook for. She smiled to herself and opened a package of pasta. A second later, she heard the door open in the other room. \"Hello? Tuck? That was quick!\" she said. There was no response from him, so Amanda set her spoon down and cautiously she stepped into the living room. \"Hello?\" Amanda said. There was a brunette woman standing there. She turned around and studied Amanda. Tuck's ex-wife, Katie. \"Oh, hi,\" Amanda said. \"You surprised me. Did Tuck know you were coming over? He's not here right now…\" she trailed off when she saw her non-emotive face. \"Well, I was hoping to speak with my husband,\" Katie said. \"He and I need to decide on a time for our son's parent-teacher conference.\" \"Well, he was just running to the market. He should be back shortly,\" Amanda said uncomfortably. \"I'm going to grab some pants, okay?\" Amanda dashed up the stairs and pulled on a pair of leggings before jogging back to Katie. Katie was at the breakfast bar, looking at the mess in the kitchen. She still had not smiled. She was judging Amanda; she could feel the silent appraisal of bother her and the food she'd made. \"You probably think that you and Tuck are going to make some kind of spectacular couple, don't you?\" Katie said, breaking the silence. \"I'm sorry, I…\" \"You're wrong. After everything, I've realized that I do love Tuck. I am going to get him back. I have the advantage, too, you know,\" Katie told her. \"I am the mother of his child. You're just a…a booty call.\" Amanda sat on the arm of Tuck's couch and looked at the woman. \"Oh,\" Amanda said. This woman was acting crazy and she'd had enough of crazy for a while. \"Well, then,\" she began. \"I guess I'll talk to Tuck when he gets back, then,\" Amanda told her. \"You will?\" Katie asked, totally surprised. \"I mean, I'm really falling for him, but how can I compete with you?\" Katie recovered from her surprise. \"I'm glad you see it my way,\" Katie said. \"Of course; I'll tell Tuck over dinner.\" \"Shouldn't I be here, too?\" \"Seeing the two of you together will only further break my heart,\" Amanda said. \"I think it's best if I can tell Tuck and leave with dignity.\" Katie was nodding. It was clear that she was missing the sarcasm. \"I'll tell him to call you when I'm leaving. You can come back then, I suppose,\" Amanda said sadly, or what she hoped was sad. The two ladies walked to Tuck's front door. \"You're really going to break up with him? Just like that?\" Katie asked. \"I expected a fight. I expected a woman like you to be a bigger bitch about it.\" Amanda fought to bite her tongue. \"It's clear that you really love Tuck,\" she said. \"And I can't fight true love,\" she almost couldn't say without smiling. Katie put her hand on Amanda's shoulder in some kind of act of comfort. \"Thank you for understanding,\" Katie said before letting herself out. Amanda watched out of the peephole before bolting all three locks. She leaned against the door and sighed. \"Fat chance I'll break up with Tuck for you, you crazy bitch,\" Amanda said out loud. She shook her head and went back to the kitchen. Half an hour later, Tuck let himself back into the apartment. \"Honey, I'm home!\" he smiled while he shouted to her. It felt good to say that. It felt right. Amanda emerged from the kitchen doorway and Tuck watched her expression change from a worried look to a fake smile. And he noticed that she was now wearing pants. \"What's wrong?\" Tuck asked. He temporarily forgot to ask why the door was triple bolted. \"Nothing,\" she lied. \"I'm fine.\" \"Well, that's a lie,\" he said, following her into the kitchen with the few things he'd picked up at the store. \"How about I start with why I took so long at the market and you can tell me why you're upset?\" Amanda said nothing. \"I ran into one of Joe's teachers down at the market. And he said that he couldn't stop talking about his new friend Sophie. He asked me if it was some kind of animal,\" Tuck laughed. \"Okay, your turn.\" \"Listen, Tuck,\" Amanda said. \"Katie was here.\" \"Katie? My ex-wife Katie? In the forty minutes I was at the store?\" he asked. \"The very same.\" \"And what did she want?\" \"You.\" \"Of course. Did she tell you what she needed me for?\" he asked. \"Well, she said you and she needed to decide on a time for a parent-teacher conference.\" \"That's rubbish because that's not for a month…\" he told Amanda. \"And she wants you back. Katie asked me to break up with you because she realized she still loves you. And that she has the advantage because she is your son's mother,\" Amanda explained. \"And what did you tell her?\" he asked as he leaned back on the countertop. Amanda finally smiled as she gripped the waistband of her leggings and started to slowly remove them. She kicked them aside when she stood up and looked at Tuck. \"I lied. And told her what she wanted to hear,\" she said, moving toward Tuck. He smiled against her lips as they met. Her hands wandered to his belt buckle and started the removal process. \"Is this how you break up with a man?\" Tuck asked into her ear. Amanda smiled. \"Dress code for dinner is no pants,\" she told him as she sent his pants sliding down to his ankles. \"I can deal with that.\" … … Katie waited up all night for Tuck's phone call, but obviously did not get one. That woman had lied to her. She was silly to have believed that she would have done that anyway. But she was going to get her husband back. The three of them were going to be reunited as a happy family. And this Amanda Simons was not going to get in the way. … Dun…dun…dunnn…. Author's Note: feel free to let me know what you thought![Chapter 18] A New War Chapter 18 \"So basically the two of you were just having sex for four days?\" Trish asked. Trish, Lauren and Amanda were out to brunch that Sunday morning. Amanda had finally, yet reluctantly, left Tuck's apartment. Her house was now livable again and she had collected Thommas from Jeanne's house and took him home. Now she was enjoying a mid-morning mimosa before the girls came home. Amanda nodded around her bite of Belgian waffle. She swallowed then responded. \"I haven't been able to do that…ever…\" Amanda said. \"I think that would kill Bob,\" Trish said flatly. \"I'll remember that.\" \"I'm so happy for you guys,\" Lauren said, beginning to cry. \"These damn hormones,\" she said, blotting her eyes with her napkin. \"Everything was really great until his ex-wife showed up in his apartment and I was alone with no pants on,\" Amanda said. \"What did she want?\" Lauren asked. \"She thinks she wants Tuck,\" Amanda told her. Lauren drank down her orange juice. \"Katie said that?\" \"She sure did.\" \"That bitch,\" Trish said. \"What game is she playing?\" \"I don't know,\" Amanda shook her head. \"What did you tell her?\" Lauren asked. \"I probably would have slapped her.\" Amanda looked around. \"I lied. I told her I'd break up with him,\" she laughed. \"She has to know now. Tuck is so angry with her. I had to keep him from calling her and yelling at her.\" \"I can imagine,\" Lauren said. \"I know you're trained and all, but be careful with Katie. She's kind of crazy. FDR has told me some things. Like Joe might have been a little more planned than she let Tuck believe.\" \"What?\" Amanda said. \"FDR said she and Tuck were kind of on the rocks when she found out that she was pregnant with Joe. Don't tell Tuck, please. FDR'll be pissed that I said anything to you.\" Trish waved her hand. \"If you can't tell your girlfriends that kind of stuff, what can you tell us?\" she said. \"I did the total opposite. Bob and I decided to start having kids and I chickened out and got a diaphragm.\" \"You did? You didn't want kids at the same time?' Amanda asked. \"When I sobered up? No. Everything sounded better after a pitcher of margaritas. I agreed to marry him after we were doing tequila shots,\" Trish laughed. \"That is such a lie,\" Lauren said. \"She loves Bob and the kids. She was dying to settle down.\" \"All right. Fine,\" Trish conceded. \"But I did try to not get knocked up the first few months…\" she trailed off. \"Bob seems like a great dad,\" Amanda said. \"He is,\" Trish said. \"The best.\" \"Do you think FDR is going to be a good dad?\" Lauren asked. \"Yes,\" Amanda said. \"No,\" Trish told her. The three of them laughed. \"He's actually probably going to be one of those really attentive dads that pisses off all the other dads at the park,\" Trish said. \"FDR has gone all out for the baby's room,\" Lauren said as she buttered another croissant. \"I think we have enough for three newborns.\" \"I'm swooning,\" Amanda laughed. \"That is just weird,\" Trish said. \"Bob wouldn't go near the baby stores.\" \"Why not?\" Amanda asked. \"He figured most of his job was finished after he got me pregnant. It was like pulling teeth to get him to the birthing classes. I was lucky he drove me to the hospital when I went into labor. He's a great dad now, but those nine months were hell. This one over here makes it look so damn easy,\" Trish said. \"It's not easy,\" Lauren said. \"I've got stretch marks and stuff...\" \"I don't believe that for a second. You probably don't' even have any hemorrhoids. You probably don't even know what those are. I've got them right now, as we're sitting here,\" she said. \"Um, too much information,\" Amanda laughed. \"Don't you want to settle down?\" Lauren asked Amanda. \"Because the both of you have sold marriage and children so well?\" Amanda said. \"I have kids already. As far as I'm concerned, I am settled down.\" \"Only until your brother comes home,\" Lauren told her. \"And then what?\" \"And then what, what?\" Amanda replied. \"Your plans? Your life? You're what? 27?\" Trish asked. \"28,\" Amanda said. \"Oh, okay. Well, I stand corrected,\" Trish said. \"But at some point, you won't be their sole caretaker and you can have a life. Have you considered that?\" \"No,\" Amanda said honestly. \"I guess I haven't.\" \"Well. We know you like Tuck,\" Lauren said. \"Considering you just had a 90 hour sex-fest with him…\" \"It wasn't all sex…\" Amanda argued. \"Well, it was mostly sex. Besides, Tuck will Get tired of me. That's how it always seems to work out.\" \"What happened with your last boyfriend?\" Trish asked. \"He freaked when he found out I had all the kids. Even when I told him they were Nieces it didn't change his mind,\" she said. \"He was clearly an ass-hat,\" Trish said. \"You aren't going to have to worry about that with Tuck.\" \"Tuck has his own son to care for. Even if I'm not the girls' sole caretaker, Tuck will still be a dad. That doesn't bother me one bit. But there will always be Katie.\" \"What grown woman goes by Katie anyway?\" Trish asked. \"I've never liked her.\" \"Lots of women go by Katie,\" Lauren told her. \"Shut up; I'm trying to comfort Amanda,\" Trish said. \"In a perfect world, women wouldn't be psycho when they got jealous, but…\" Amanda said. \"I think she's going to be a bigger problem than even Tuck thought.\" Amanda's cell phone rang and she read the display. An unfamiliar number. \"One sec,\" she said standing. \"Hello?\" \"Amanda Simons?\" a female voice asked. \"Yes. Who is this?\" \"Denise Lemhoff, Department of Child and Family Services. We've had a claim that we need to investigate,\" she said. \"Oh,\" Amanda said. \"A claim of what?\" \"I need to set up a time to meet with your nieces in the home,\" Denise said. \"How is Tomorrow night?\" \"I thought you folks surprised people; I didn't know you made appointments.\" \"We do make appointments,\" the woman said. \"Case by case.\" \"The girls will be home from Disneyland with their grandparents tonight, so tomorrow after school should be fine.\" \"Hmm. How long were they out of school?\" \"A week. But I've spoken to all of their teachers and I have their homework,\" Amanda explained. \"What was the claim about?\" she asked again. \"I can't tell you that, ma'am,\" Denise said fast. \"Well, I don't know if I want you in my home, bothering my girls if you won't tell me what I'm being investigated for,\" Amanda said. \"You were not home at the time of your two youngest nieces being kidnapped, correct?\" Denise asked. \"That is classified information, ma'am,\" Amanda fired back. \"It will be much better if you cooperated with us, Ms. Simons.\" \"It's Agent Simons, Ms. Lemhoff. And I hope you know who you're dealing with.\" \"Are you threatening me?\" \"You are referring to classified information. I will be more than happy to meet with you, so long as my lawyer is present.\" \"If you have nothing to hide, I see no reason why you would need a lawyer.\" \"I told you, it's classified, Ms. Lemhoff. I will speak to you, so long as my lawyer says it's all right. I have nothing to hide because my girls are well taken care of. But until we have a time worked out, I think we're done.\" Amanda ended the call and she walked back to the table. \"What's wrong?\" Lauren asked, noting her worried expression. \"Someone called Child Protective Services on me. She said something about the kidnapping,\" Amanda told them in a low whisper. \"How is that even a real thing? Do they have any grounds for that?\" Lauren said. \"No,\" Trish said firmly. \"But I know CPS needs to investigate all the claims it gets.\" \"I wonder if Tuck got a call, too?\" Amanda asked. \"This could have something to do with the case. … Author's Note: As always, let me know what you thought …[Chapter 19] A New War Chapter 19 \"No, no one has called me from CPS,\" Tuck told her. He and Joe came over to the house to surprise the girls and Amanda's parents. Joe was out in the living room playing with Thommas while Amanda and Tuck put the leaves in the table to expand it. Amanda sighed. She knew there was no basis for the CPS claim, but it was making her anxious anyway. \"That doesn't mean I won't,\" Tuck told her. Amanda put the placemats out and Tuck walked around the table to her. He took her hand and kissed her knuckles. \"It's going to be fine.\" \"I just don't know where this is coming from,\" Amanda said. \"It's so frustrating.\" \"I know, but we'll get through it,\" Tuck told her. \"We?\" \"We,\" he repeated. Joe wandered into the dining room carrying the big furry cat. \"Your cat just sneezed in my ear,\" Joe told them. \"That means he likes you,\" she laughed. \"I thought so,\" Joe said. \"Can he have some more of those treats?\" \"He's probably had enough. But he likes his medicine off of a spoon. Wanna see?\" \"Cool,\" Joe replied. Tuck began to follow them back into the kitchen when his phone rang. He could hear his son's laughter while his phone rang. Tuck looked down to the display: Katie. \"What, Katie?\" he said. \"Is that any way to greet your wife?\" Amanda had convinced him to not yell at her. In fact, she'd asked him to not mention the conversation she'd shared with his ex. Tuck had reluctantly agreed. But his resolve was crumbling. \"Ex-wife,\" he replied. \"What do you need, Katie?\" he asked. \"I was thinking you could bring Joe over at dinner time and we could all eat as a family,\" Katie said. \"We're having dinner with friends, actually. I'll have Joe home by the normal time,\" Tuck told her. \"I sure hope it's not that Amanda. I don't think I want her around my son…did you hear what she said to me? Did she even tell you that I stopped by the other day?\" Katie asked. \"Of course she told me you were there,\" he said. \"She was so rude. Awful, really. Told me I wasn't welcome there…\" \"Oddly enough, she didn't say that.\" \"She's a liar, obviously. And unfit to take care of those girls. It's no wonder someone called Child Protective Services on her,\" Katie said offhandedly. \"Who said anything about CPS?\" \"One of my friends told me,\" Katie told him. \"Honey…\" \"Stay away from Amanda. And her nieces. I really hope you weren't the one to call CPS. It's a federal crime.\" Tuck heard his son's laughter in the kitchen again. \"Bye, Katie.\" He needed to tell Amanda about Katie and the possibility that she called CPS. But the doorbell rang and then Jeanne let herself into the house. \"Well, hey there, Tuck,\" Jeanne said. He moved to take the pizza boxes from the woman. \"Why didn't you let me come help you with these?\" Tuck asked as they set the boxes down. \"I don't always need a man's help,\" Jeanne replied. \"But you're so cute, I might change my stance on woman's lib.\" Both of them laughed as Joe and Amanda came into the room. \"You got enough pizza to feed an army,\" Amanda said. \"Thanks Jeanne.\" \"Well, the fella that owns the place is a friend of my husband. He threw me a great deal. Hey you! How are ya?\" Jeanne asked Joe. \"I'm Joe,\" he said, holding out his hand to shake Jeanne's. \"Well, aren't you just a little gentleman?\" Jeanne said. \"No wonder Sophie likes you.\" Tuck walked up to Amanda and touched her elbow to get her attention. \"Can I talk to you for a quick moment?\" he asked her. \"Uh, sure,\" she replied as she tried to read his expression. He led her outside onto the deck and closed the door behind her. She leaned up to kiss him, but something was different. \"Something wrong?\" Amanda asked. \"I just got off of the phone with Katie…\" \"Oh. Okay,\" Amanda said. \"What did she need?\" Amanda asked as she tried to keep her tone level. She really didn't want to be the jealous girlfriend, no matter how she felt about the other woman. \"I don't know how else to tell you, so… I'm pretty certain that she was the call to CPS.\" \"What?\" \"She mentioned something about it. I never told her about it, so…\" \"I sure hope she knows what she's gotten herself into, Tuck,\" Amanda said angrily. \"Amanda, I'm sorry,\" he said as she began to walk back into the house. \"Yeah, well, it's not your problem if I lose the girls, is it?\" she said before walking inside. … Monday morning rolled around and Amanda was getting the girls ready for school. \"Are you ready, Cam?\" Amanda yelled up the stairs. \"My hair won't do anything!\" she yelled back down to her aunt. Amanda looked down at Sophie who had been glued to her side since she'd been home. Sophie shrugged and smiled. This was typical of her oldest sister. \"Do we really have to meet with that woman tonight?\" Sophie asked. Amanda crouched down to play with Sophie's ponytail. \"Yes. I'm sorry. But I am going to do my best to get us out of it.\" \"I still don't understand,\" Sophie said. \"You didn't kidnap us.\" Amanda nodded. \"You're right. If we have to meet with that lady, we'll be fine because we don't have anything to hide.\" \"She's going to be mad that I opened the door to a stranger, too.\" \"I'm not mad. Who's mad at you?\" \"Grandma.\" Amanda rolled her eyes. \"Your grandmother could never be mad at you no matter what you did. Even if you set her eyebrows on fire. And don't get any ideas…\" Sophie giggled. \"Okay,\" she smiled. This kid couldn't be down for long, no matter what. \"Cameron! You have forty seconds to get down here. We have got to go!\" Cameron stomped down the stairs a few seconds later with a hat pulled down over her eyes. \"Hats aren't allowed in school, Cam,\" Amanda said. \"But my hair…\" Cameron whined. Amanda snatched the hat from her oldest niece's head and looked at her. \"Oh my god!\" she yelled in mock horror. \"It must suck so much to have perfectly straight and non-frizzy blond hair.\" \"I wish my hair curled like yours,\" Cameron told Amanda. \"We can get you a perm,\" Amanda suggested. \"What's a perm?\" Sophie asked. \"It's for girls who aren't happy with their straight hair,\" Alex told her little sister. \"I personally enjoy having to do nothing with my hair in the morning. And so will you,\" Alex said. \"Well, it appears that I've taught one of you right. And now she's teaching the next generation.\" She pulled all the girls into a tight hug. \"I love you.\" Cameron struggled out of the embrace a second later. \"This family is so weird. Are we going?\" Amanda released the other two girls. Once they were on the road, Amanda addressed them. \"Remember, please don't tell anyone I work for the CIA. And if you need anything, you can call me. Anytime, okay? What you girls went through was not a small thing. It was a big deal and I don't want you to think that it wasn't, okay?\" \"Okay,\" the girls said together. \"Cam and Al, you will be in school til 2:30, like normal. Jeanne will pick you up out front your respective schools. Sophie, you will be picked up by Jeanne as 11,\" Amanda said. \"And the woman is coming over at 6:30 unless I can pull some strings. You guys don't think I'm neglecting you, do you?\" \"I think you spend too much time with us…\" Cameron told her. \"By the way, are you and Tuck fighting?\" \"Why would you ask that?\" Amanda asked. \"Because you barely looked at him last night.\" \"You're 15. How do you notice stuff like that?\" Amanda asked. \"You have to be old to see that people aren't talking to each other?\" Cam asked. \"Oh, I'm old now?\" \"Yes.\" \"Awesome.\" \"I think you're pretty,\" Sophie said from her seat behind Amanda. \"Thanks, honey.\" \"But that's not what we're talking about, Soph,\" Alex pointed out. \"Thanks, Alex,\" Amanda replied sarcastically. \"Don't you want to get married and have kids of your own?\" Cam asked. \"Uh…\" Amanda said. She was caught off guard. Where the hell was this coming from? Luckily, they were in front of the high school. \"Okay, well, have a great day, Cam!\" Amanda said. Cam rolled her eyes and exited the vehicle. Alex was smart enough that she said nothing on the ride from the high school to the junior high. But once it was just Sophie and Amanda in the car, the little girl was clearly on a mission. \"I think you should have a baby with Tuck,\" Sophie said. \"What?\" …. Author's note: Let me know… :{)[Chapter 20] A New War Chapter 20 After a week of her intentionally ducking him and not answering his phone calls, Tuck couldn't stand it any longer. He cornered Amanda in the kitchen on their floor of the building. \"How much longer are you going to pretend I don't exist?\" Tuck as her as he closed the door behind him. Amanda did not look up; she continued to stir her cup of coffee. \"I'm not pretending that you don't exist. I'm simply trying to avoid your presence and not give your ex-wife any more reason to come after my family.\" Someone tried to open the door, but Tuck put his hand up to keep the door from opening any further. He slammed it closed again. \"How did the visit go?\" he asked. \"Why do you care?\" Amanda replied coldly. \"Because I do. What happened?\" Tuck asked. \"Look at me.\" \"Well, I'm not being investigated by CPS, but I'm not going to be taking care of the girls anymore,\" Amanda told him. \"What?\" Tuck asked. \"I don't think I understand.\" \"My brother-in-law showed up at the house four days ago. No warning. He's done. Honorable discharge from active duty. And he's moving into the house.\" \"Why didn't you call me?\" Tuck asked. \"Because I…I chickened out. I haven't been nice to you and you didn't deserve that kind of treatment. And I know I should be incredibly happy that Greg has come back into his girls' lives for good, I feel like…empty,\" a tell-tale tear fell down her cheek. \"Damn it,\" she said as she wiped it away. Tuck pulled her into a tight hug. \"You have every right to be upset.\" \"I just…got so close to them. I was there when each one of those girls was born. I cut their umbilical cords. I'm not trying to complain about him, because he was doing something so incredibly important, but what happens now?\" Amanda asked. \"I don't know,\" he said into her hair. \"But we'll figure it out. We'll get through it. On the brighter side, were the girls happy to see their dad?\" Amanda took a step back from Tuck and smiled. \"Holy shit. When he showed up in the damn doorway, Sophie wouldn't stop crying and Alex and Cameron knocked a six foot six Marine down to the ground. You should have seen the look on Jeanne's face.\" \"Are you all going to live together then?\" he asked. \"I think I'm going to find an apartment. Greg is going to work as a Marine recruiter here in the area, so he'll only be gone during the day. He's going to keep Jeanne on, though. He wanted to know if he should find a new place, but I don't think he should move the girls again. They've just gotten used to this house.\" \"No, I suppose that would be rough for them,\" Tuck replied. \"So, I'm selling him the house and its furniture,\" Amanda explained. \"So you are essentially homeless and furniture-less,\" Tuck said. \"Just so you know, you're welcome to stay with me.\" \"I appreciate that, Tuck. But I leave tomorrow,\" Amanda told him. \"What?\" Tuck asked. \"Leave for where?\" \"It's an undercover deal. And it's extremely classified,\" Amanda told him. \"You can't even tell me?\" \"Collins told me specifically not to say anything,\" Amanda told him. Tuck sighed. \"So tomorrow, you're just not going to be here?\" he asked. \"It's more like in 18 hours I'm not going to be here,\" Amanda replied. \"When did you find out about this?\" Amanda looked down at her feet. \"Two days ago.\" Tuck said nothing, but turned and put his fist through the drywall next to him. \"Tuck…\" Amanda started. \"Did you ask Collins to send you or was this in the works?\" \"Tuck…\" \"Answer me.\" \"I asked Collins to send me,\" Amanda told him. \"I asked if there was anything…\" Tuck shook his head. \"You're just going to run away. You're up and leaving. Those girls need you.\" \"Those girls have their father and they need him a hell of a lot more than they need me. I got them kidnapped. And I'm not running away!\" she yelled at him. He wasn't looking at her and she couldn't stand it. \"This is what happens sometimes with this job. You can't stand there and make me feel guilty because I'm going to be gone for a while. It could have just as well as been you that got sent away.\" Tuck looked back up into her eyes. \"That's the logic you're going to use?\" he asked her. \"It could have been me?\" \"Why are you so mad about this?\" Amanda asked him. \"I know it's not ideal, but it isn't the end of the world.\" \"You want to know why I'm mad? I'm mad because I've totally fallen for you and now you're leaving. Why is your natural reaction to run away?\" he asked quietly. The door to the kitchen opened and interrupted their conversation. \"What the hell are you two doing in here?\" FDR asked as he walked in. \"I am glad to find out that I didn't just interrupt sex.\" He stopped and poked his head out the door way. \"Turner, you lost!\" They heard a distant, \"aww, man!\" from a man's voice out in the office. \"Franklin, it is not the time right now,\" Tuck said. \"I don't care; this isn't your own private kitchen that the two of you can use for your own strange reasons,\" FDR told them. \"We need coffee and we're all too lazy to walk to another floor to get it. Now, what the hell are you doing in here?\" \"Why don't you tell him, Amanda?\" Tuck said. \"I don't think I'm supposed to tell that many…\" Tuck laughed sarcastically. \"Like the people here aren't going to know when you aren't here tomorrow?\" he said. \"Wait, what?\" FDR said. \"Why is everyone surprised that I'm going undercover? That's what we've all trained for!\" she said. Amanda started to push past the two men in the kitchen area when Collins came into view. She was staring at them, hands on her hips and a stern look on her face. \"I want to see you and Tuck in my office, immediately,\" Collins said. \"Follow me right now.\" \"Perfect,\" Amanda hissed under her breath. She started to follow Collins who had turned on her heel and started walking towards her office. Tuck started to follow her, but FDR tapped his shoulder. \"Did you do that?\" he pointed to the fist-shaped hole in the wall. Tuck said nothing, but nodded his head slightly before continuing his walk out of the kitchen. … Once in Collins' office, both Tuck and Amanda were seated opposite her at her desk. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Collins asked. \"You're screaming at each other in the kitchen on your floor. I get that you're romantically involved, but keep it from my building. Keep it away from your work!\" she said, standing up. \"We understand,\" Amanda said. \"I'm sorry that we let this…\" \"You're sending her out so quickly?\" Tuck asked. \"Excuse me?\" Collins asked. Tuck remained seated, but he was leaned forward towards Collins. \"She's going through some stuff and you're letting her run away,\" Tuck said. Collins smiled a devious, almost evil smile. She stood from her chair and walked around to the front of her desk to lean on it between the two of them. Amanda was staring at her feet while Tuck hadn't broken eye contact with Collins yet. \"Agent Simons volunteered to take on this particular mission because the agent that had been assigned to it is going through her father passing away. It happened to fall during a time that she is able to go and I'm happy to send her because she meets the qualifications better than the previous agent,\" Collins said evenly. \"I shouldn't tell you this, because I don't want to get involved in your personal lives and I definitely don't want to let your personal lives get in the way of what Amanda has to go do. But Amanda is being sent to Las Vegas. There's a burlesque club there, and Amanda is going undercover to help us bring down the mob that is using it as their cover. They're bringing in drugs, money, and women,\" Collins said. \"The owner, Frankie, is an old friend of mine, and they've got her in a bad place. Now, do you feel better now that you know?\" … Author's Note…okay, there ya go…what do you think about this new turn of events?[Chapter 21] A New War 21 Opening her eyes, she looked around the room. She did not recognize where she was for a minute. A moment more, and Amanda knew where she was. It was not her bedroom and it wasn't Tuck's apartment. She was in the shithole apartment that the agency put her up in. She would probably re-think ever volunteering for something like this again, if she survived this. Amanda wasn't so sure if 'shithole' was a strong enough term for the apartment that she was currently staying in. She roused herself from the almost-comfort of the bed. Amanda went and inspected herself in the mirror and almost didn't recognize herself, but that was probably the blond hair, dyed with extensions, on the top of her head that had replaced her dark curls. It would have looked out of place, but they had smartly taken care of her eyebrows as well. And spray-tanned to booth. \"I probably should have gone with the red hair,\" she said out loud to herself as she twisted the pink streak of hair around her finger. Despite her complete distaste for her new look, which now included an eyebrow piercing, she looked at least five years younger. And that was going to be beneficial right now. She was going by Mandy now. Her driver's license reflected her new name and her old hometown of a fictitious birthday that made her three years younger. She sighed and pulled the long blond hair into a ponytail and headed to the shower. Today was going to be a long day. … \"She's been gone like an hour, dude,\" FDR said as he threw a ball of paper at his best friend's face. Tuck snapped out of his trance and stared at him angrily. \"She's been gone since last night.\" \"At least you guys made up before she left,\" FDR said. \"It's unlikely that she's going to do some other guy this way.\" Tuck chucked a ball of paper at FDR's forehead and connected right between the eyes. \"Are you not worried about her?\" FDR asked. \"I'm not worried about her sleeping with someone else,\" Tuck said under his breath. \"I'm more worried about her in general. I don't know where she was going,\" he lied. \"I'm kind of surprised that Collins wouldn't tell you; considering the circumstances,\" FDR said. \"You want to hack into the system and find her?\" \"As much fun as that sounds…\" Tuck trailed off. \"You didn't get laid before she left,\" FDR said. \"That's why you're distracted.\" \"Do you have to announce it to the whole building? Maybe you should send out a mass email to make sure everyone knows,\" Tuck spat. \"Will you relax, man?\" FDR said. \"I love you, but you're going to drive yourself crazy if you don't think about something else. What came from Katie's CPS call?\" \"Amanda decided not to press charges and if she doesn't put in her own claim against Katie, CPS looks at it as a legit claim that they needed to investigate. Katie won't get taken to court and there are, of course, no charges against Amanda,\" Tuck explained. \"I just can't believe that she'd do something like that.\" FDR stood from his desk and walked to sit on the edge of Tuck's. \"Can I tell you something? And you have to promise to not be mad at me?\" \"No,\" Tuck said, his eyebrows furrowed. \"You generally have done something awful when you preface like that.\" \"All right, well, Katie once told me that she stopped taking her birth control when you guys were…you know…\" \"What? Why…?\" \"She intentionally got pregnant when you guys were about to break up for good so you wouldn't leave her,\" FDR said. \"That's ridiculous,\" Tuck said. \"Is it?\" \"She just old you one day?\" he asked. \"Out of nowhere?\" \"It was the night that we were celebrating my birthday. You got a sitter for Joe and we were all drinking at the bar. You got up to call and check on Joe and she just looked at me and wound up telling me. That was right before she threw up over the bar,\" FDR explained. Tuck remembered the night. Joe was just a little over a year old. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but you seemed so happy with Katie, it didn't matter. And then when you guys broke up, well, it mattered even less,\" FDR said. \"Does Lauren know?\" Tuck asked. \"Um…\" \"It's all right, mate,\" he said as he slapped his friend on the shoulder. \"I wouldn't give up my son for the world. He's the best thing in the world. Things happen for a reason.\" \"Maybe you should have another kid so we could have kids that grow up together,\" FDR smiled. \"I think I'd have to find a willing woman at this point in the game.\" \"I think you'd probably have a likely candidate in Amanda…\" \"It scares me when you get all philosophical,\" Tuck said. \"I'm never prepared.\" \"I like to catch you off guard,\" FDR said. \"Come on. Let's go get some lunch.\" \"And then we should probably do some work.\" \"Nah,\" he said waving his hand. … \"Size six?\" he asked her as he examined her. \"On a good day,\" Amanda replied. Amanda was stripped down to her tank top and leggings while the club's costume designer looked her over. \"Do I really need costumes for a waitress gig? Can't I just wear something black?\" she asked. \"Oh, darling, I think you're confused. You'll be dancing.\" Amanda's mouth fell open. Johnny put a hand to her chin and gently closed it. He shook his head. \"Not a good look, baby.\" He turned and pulled a couple things from the rack. \"Here, go over there, try these on. And I want to see you in each one of these outfits. I make the decisions, not you,\" he told her. Amanda had met Johnny a mere 10 minutes ago and now she was taking fashion orders from him. She accepted the articles of clothing wordlessly. She turned around on her heel and headed to a small area in the corner with a curtain. A second later, she came out in a sparkly, mostly spandex, costume. \"Your boobs are fabulous! And I'm gay and I love your boobs anyway! That's a fantastic sign!\" \"Thank you?\" \"They're real right?\" he said as he touched them. \"Yes, they are,\" Amanda nodded. \"Like a D-cup, right? You're going to need some amazing pasties.\" \"Pasties?\" \"You know,\" he said as he did a small whirl with his fingers at chest height. \"I really thought I was hired as a waitress,\" Amanda told him as he held up another costume to her body. \"Well, I need a dancer now,\" a woman's voice said. A second later, the woman known as Frankie (short for Francesca), walked into full view. Upon first look, she reminded Amanda of a weird combo of Cher, Ann Margaret and Pam Anderson. She was slightly shorter than Amanda as she stood barefoot in the dressing room. \"Do you have a problem with this?\" Frankie asked. \"Of course not,\" Amanda replied. \"I really need a job.\" \"Here, go try this one on,\" Johnny said as he handed her a hot pink and black number. \"Can she dance?\" Johnny asked when Amanda walked away. \"She was a stripper,\" Frankie lied. \"Are you sure?\" Johnny asked. \"She doesn't seem like an exhibitionist.\" Amanda overheard the conversation even though she had actively tried to ignore it. She finished wiggling into the ridiculous outfit and pulled the curtain back. This outfit left little to the imagination and stopped Johnny mid-sentence. \"Never mind,\" Johnny muttered as Amanda did a turn. \"She'll be fine,\" Frankie smiled. … \"Now, I normally don't take the new girls out for coffee, but I'm fairly certain my whole place is bugged,\" Frankie explained. They were seated at a small café off of the strip. They were seated at the only table outside and there were zero people around them. No one was going to bother them. \"I have very basic info as to what's going on. Would you fill me in a little more?\" Amanda asked. \"Well, my now-deceased husband made a deal with the mob out here. You know, old-school, grab you while you're not looking, drive you out to the desert, shoot you and leave your body for the buzzards kind of mob.\" \"I get it,\" Amanda said. She had her long hair pulled into a long braid that fell over her shoulder. Large sunglasses covered most of her face. \"Well, since I'm never going to be able to make good on the money for my husband's loan and they aren't the forgiving type, they run the club.\" \"They run it?\" \"It used to be a straight cabaret. Sideshows, sexy burlesque and we did have a bit of a boost from that movie a few years back, but in the slow times, well they're running drugs, and money. And sometimes women. \"My girls used to be tasteful, but seductive performers. Now some of them are strippers and some of them are hookers.\" \"The mob guys, they in there often?\" Amanda asked. \"Every night,\" she said dejectedly. \"Are you ready for this?\" \"To be a stripper turned burlesque dancer who is actually a stripper and possible hooker?\" Amanda asked. \"I'm sure there's room on my resume for that.\" \"You used to be a brunette, right?\" \"Are my roots showing already? I had this done yesterday.\" \"Oh, no. I can just tell. I've been in this business a long time. Well, we should be going. You've got a dozen dance routines to learn. You have danced before, right?\" \"A dozen?\" Amanda said as she stood from the chair. \"A dozen,\" Frankie told her. \"Yeah, I used to dance.\" \"How about lapdances?\" Frankie asked as they headed back towards the club. … The whole first day that Amanda was gone was difficult for Tuck. He almost felt bad lying to FDR, but he knew he couldn't divulge the whereabouts of Amanda to anyone. It would compromise her as well as the case. And he definitely wasn't able to call her. And he really wanted to call her. He knew it wasn't just because he had feelings for her. He wanted to make sure she was safe. This is what led him to Collins' office. \"I just don't know what you would do in a burlesque club, Tuck,\" Collins said, sitting back in her chair. \"I just mean, should she have gone by herself?\" Tuck asked. \"You don't sound like you have much faith in your girlfriend.\" \"Of course, I have faith in her,\" Tuck said. \"But it's always good when someone's got your back when you're out in the field.\" \"One of the bouncers is undercover, as well,\" Collins said. \"Oh.\" \"Tuck, I know you've got feelings for the woman and…\" \"Director Collins', I mean this with the most respect possible, I would appreciate that you would quit accusing me of letting my feelings cloud my work. My concern at this point in time is to make sure she's okay as a coworker versus simply a girlfriend,\" Tuck said. \"Well said,\" Collins smiled. \"Well said, but I know that it is total and complete bull shit.\" … Author's note: what did you think? Let me know![Chapter 22] A New War Chapter 22 It had been three weeks since Amanda had joined the crew at Frankie's club, which Amanda quickly learned had no name. It simply held a sign above the door that read cabaret. So far, in the 17 nights that she'd worked, she had seen just about the whole business ran through club. And she also quickly learned that most of the other girls turned a blind eye to the goings on. Well, that and some of them were the actual products of the business that these men were doing. The twins, Lara and Lana, were from eastern Russia, Amanda thought. Michelle was from the south of France and Sofia was from Sicily. All of them had been \"found\" by a \"talent agent\" and brought here to Las Vegas. Only to find out they were going to be dancers, strippers, and possible prostitutes. Stacy, Dee, Kellie, Rox and Markie were strippers by profession that were lured here by mob guys that were always in the place. She suspected this was the group of drug users, but Amanda wasn't totally certain yet. The routine was this: choreographed shows Tuesday through Saturday at 7:30 and 8:45. At 10:30, the club closed down and at 11, it re-opened as a gentleman's club. The women that had been dancing in legit, burlesque performances became strippers. Saturday nights, some of them even got totally nude. So far, Amanda had been able to avoid actual stripping performances by being a social butterfly. When she wasn't dancing with the group on the stage, Amanda was floating around, smiling and flirting with the men. She was getting to know their names and what exactly they did at the club. She was gathering intel to send back to HQ. But it looked like she was just enjoying perching in some man's lap while he played poker and put bills in her bra strap. Amanda had been sending her reports back to California in encrypted emails, but she hadn't been able to talk to anyone back home. She missed her desk job, and her bed. And Tuck. And especially her nieces. Living alone really sucked. A voice broke her from her thoughts. \"How come we never see you up there?\" he asked. She smiled back at the man who was talking to her. Vince Jr. He was one of the younger men in the operation; he was probably only thirty-five versus the rest of the men in their sixties that were really running the joint. He tugged on her hand and out of habit, she smiled wider. Vince was a little cute. Vince pulled harder on her hand and down into his lap. \"Seriously, we all know you can move,\" he told her. She felt the blush creep up her face. Why was she blushing? Amanda thought of Tuck and felt a pang; a mixture of guilt and sadness. She really missed him. \"I'm just shy,\" Amanda told him sweetly. Vince laughed and played with the fringe skirt falling over her bare thigh. \"Mandy, I don't think you could be shy if you tried.\" Amanda shrugged innocently. \"I think you should go up there. Tonight. Right now,\" he smiled at her. \"Tonight?\" \"Yup,\" Vince replied. \"What do you think fellas?\" he asked the rest of the men at the table. A round of grunts signaled their approval. \"See?\" Vince smiled. He had a charming smile. He also had a receding hairline and a beer gut, but at least his smile was charming. \"Well, I'm not prepared,\" she whispered in his ear. \"I wouldn't want to be embarrassed.\" Her head was turned so she didn't see that another man had strolled into the club. He spotted her, though. \"Honey, I don't think you could do anything to embarrass yourself,\" Vince told her. It was clear that he had a thing for her. Markie was topless on the stripper pole in the center of the stage and he didn't even look away from Amanda. \"I don't know…\" \"My son said he wants to see you up there, sweetheart. So, you'll be going up there. Next,\" an older gentleman told her. Vince's dad. Vincent Sr. Unlike his son, nothing about Vincent Sr. was charming. He had full head of silver hair and a thick neck. And he talked like he was really trying to be Joe Pesci. \"So, get going, honey,\" Vincent Sr. told her. \"And wear something see-through,\" he said as she stood to leave. Amanda joined the other women backstage. She'd been practicing for just such an occasion, but it didn't mean that she was excited at the idea. As Amanda was going through the racks of costumes, Johnny, or aka Mr. Sexy as he decided he wanted to be called that night while he wore his skintight leather pants, came in and handed her a note. \"Who is that from?\" Amanda asked. \"Do you think I read your note?\" Johnny asked. From behind the ornate screen in the dressing room, she laughed. \"Of course you read it.\" \"Okay, okay, I did.\" \"So? What is it?\" she asked. \"I've got to get changed.\" \"It's from your number one fan, Vinny.\" \"He hates being called Vinny.\" \"Not the point. The note says that he wants you to go home with him tonight,\" Johnny told her. Amanda popped her head out from the screen. \"What? He wants me to sleep with him?\" \"Oh, Mandy. I don't think sleeping is what he had in mind.\" Amanda walked out in her costume for her performance. \"Damn, where were you hiding the abs?\" he poked her stomach. \"Well, Mr. Sexy, I definitely have worked my ass off the last couple of weeks.\" \"So, you're finally going to go home with him?\" Johnny asked. \"No.\" \"I don't know if that's an option,\" Johnny told her. \"Mandy! You're on!\" a voice shouted. \"I'll figure it out, Johnny. Don't worry.\" Amanda heard the music start and she dashed out of the room. There was no time to be nervous now. She had to look like she'd done this as a job before. Amanda was taking calculated steps as she walked out onto the stage. She had a floor length coat on the dark stage. She looked around the room and made eye contact with Vince. The man was grinning at her from ear to ear. She began her practiced routine and the crowd of men were hooting and hollering. Apparently, they had all been waiting for her to do this. She did her final turn and looked into the audience. And met the single pair of eyes. She recognized with her whole body. Amanda struggled to finish the last of the routine and rushed from the stage. \"That was a quick exit,\" Johnny told her as he followed her into the room. \"I know,\" Amanda said. \"I know.\" \"They really liked you,\" he smiled. \"You'll probably be added to the regular line up. If you can walk tomorrow,\" he winked. \"Hey!\" Kellie popped her head in the room while Amanda rushed to get dressed again. \"Vince wants to buy you a drink.\" \"Can you tell him I'll be right there?\" Amanda asked. She needed a few more minutes to compose herself before she wandered back out as a stripper in front of Tuck. Kellie nodded and disappeared. \"You can get yourself a sugar daddy, honey,\" Johnny said. \"I expect since I dress you, that you'll share the wealth,\" he smiled. \"I don't really want a sugar daddy,\" Amanda said as she fixed her lip gloss. \"Too much work.\" \"You sound like you've had one before.\" \"I did,\" Amanda lied. \"A lot of pretending and faking that I was having a good time…if you know what I mean. And I didn't have enough time to get him to change the will before he died,\" she continued to make up the story. \"Oh, boo,\" Johnny said, smoothing her hair. \"We have to do your roots tomorrow, okay?\" \"Are they that bad?\" \"No! No! But they need to be done sooner rather than later. Now, go out there and claim your man.\" Amanda smiled a huge smile and strutted out of the room. Tuck had watched the entire performance and he had to make sure he kept his mouth closed. He'd read the reports; they definitely didn't include this bit in them. Collins had suspected that she was leaving some parts out and had finally decided to let Tuck come out here. Tuck was really worried about her. And even more now that he was watching another man groping her. Temporarily ignoring what was happening on the other side of the room, he walked up to the bar and got the bartender's attention. \"Hey, mate,\" Tuck said. \"Do these girls ever go home with any of these blokes?\" \"Depends how much cash they've got on them,\" he replied over the loud bead of the music that just started. \"How much do they normally go for?\" \"Couple a hundred.\" \"Who do I talk to?\" The bartender smacked his gum and pointed to the back of the place. \"His name is Vincent.\" \"Thanks, mate,\" Tuck said. \"Hey, tell him Austin sent you!\" he called. Tuck waved his thanks and headed towards Vincent. Once Tuck was there, he made sure he could still see Amanda on the other side of the club. She was laughing and giggling with the man who had his hand on her ass. He tried to calm himself, but he was pissed as hell. He needed to talk to Amanda. \"Excuse me,\" Tuck said as he approached Vincent. The man turned and looked up at Tuck. \"Who the hell are you?\" Vincent asked. \"I was told to talk to you in case I wanted to take one of these lovely creatures home for the night,\" Tuck told him. Vincent surveyed Tuck. Tuck was dressed nicely, in a pair of pants and a button up shirt. His dress shirt was short sleeved and it showed off some of his tattoos as well as his muscles. \"You don't look like you need to be buying,\" Vincent said. Tuck shrugged. \"It's easier, mate,\" Tuck said, his teeth clenched. Vincent nodded slowly. \"Which one you have your eye on?\" \"The tall blond. That one,\" he pointed to Amanda who was now in that man's lap, smiling. \"Oooh, see, I don't think so. My kid, the one with the blond in his lap, he wants her, so…\" \"I've got a thousand,\" he said, pulling a wad of cash for him to see. Vincent contemplated it. \"All right. You got it, kid. I like you. Are you foreign?\" Tuck smiled. \"Yes, I'm English.\" \"I like that. I think you should join our little operation here. You take Mandy home tonight and then let me know who she was tomorrow. We'll play a little game of poker. You like cigars?\" \"I do,\" Tuck said. \"Good,\" Vincent nodded. \"I think we're going to get along real well.\" Vincent took the cash from Tuck's hand and he waved one of the bouncers over. He came forward and Vincent told him something. He nodded and moved to Amanda. Vince Jr. frowned when the bouncer spoke to them. He shot Tuck a dirty look while Amanda kissed him on the cheek. Tuck watched as Amanda climbed out of the man's lap and looked straight at him. His chest tightened as the woman started to walk towards him. As she drew closer, his eyes started at her feet, up her bare legs, and all the way up to her face. She was tanned, blond and had an eyebrow piercing, but it was definitely all Amanda. \"Hi,\" she said sweetly. \"I'm Mandy,\" she said, extending her hand. \"James,\" he said. \"Bond?\" Amanda asked, smiling. \"We'll find out later, won't we?\" one of his eyebrows went up. \"Who the hell are you?\" Vince Jr. asked as he came up behind Amanda. \"He's paid for Mandy tonight, kid,\" Vincent Sr. said. \"Suck it up.\" \"It's all right, Vince,\" Amanda said to him softly. She touched his hand and his anger seemed to calm down slightly. \"I'll take good care of her, mate,\" Tuck said, slapping the man on the shoulder, probably a little harder than he should. But at least he didn't punch the man in the face like he'd intended. \"You wanna get out of here, darling?\" he said, letting his accent come out completely. \"You sound like Jack Sparrow,\" she giggled. Vincent Sr. rolled his eyes. Just another bimbo. His son didn't need that anyway. \"Let's go.\" \"I just need to get my purse.\" … Author's Note…let me know what you thought! Thank you![Chapter 23] A New War 23 \"I talk like Jack Sparrow?\" Tuck said one they'd exited the club and were a fair enough distance away. \"I panicked,\" Amanda giggled. \"You look…\" \"Awful,\" she said. \"I feel awful.\" \"Are you hungry?\" he asked. \"Let's get you something to eat. You've lost weight,\" he said as he touched her side. \"My car is this way.\" Once in the car, he leaned over and kissed Amanda hard. When he pulled away, Amanda was breathless. \"Holy shit,\" Amanda said. \"Where are you staying?\" \"The Mirage,\" he told her. \"Drive fast.\" Tuck drove with his left hand and held Amanda's with his right. Now that he had her, he was unwilling to let her go again. Amanda finally felt better. Until she saw the headlights in the mirror. \"I think we've got a tail,\" she said as she looked out the window. Tuck looked briefly into the rearview mirror. \"I think you're right.\" \"Shit. They don't trust me?\" Amanda asked sarcastically. \"It's all right. I've got someone I can call. We're going to the Montecito though.\" \"I have a room at…\" \"It'll be safer at the Montecito,\" Amanda told him. Tuck took her direction and she got her phone out. \"This blond hair is…\" Tuck trailed off. \"Wow.\" \"Wow, good ? Or wow, that's really bad… ?\" she asked. \"It's different,\" Tuck said. Tuck found the entrance to the Montecito's parking lot and pulled in.. The dark colored SUV followed them in. The Montecito's valet came and opened the door for Amanda. She climbed out and was typing something into her phone while they walked in to the casino. Amanda still very much looked like a stripper. She had Tuck's discarded suit jacket on, but she had a mile long area of bare leg underneath it. She latched on to Tuck as they walked in while still continued to send a text. Instantly, a tall man in a very expensive suit walked purposefully towards them. \"Oh, shit. Not again,\" Amanda sighed. Tuck looked confused. \"I'm Danny McCoy, Head of Surveillance and Security for the Montecito. I'm going to have to ask the both of you to come with me.\" A group of people was beginning to stare at them. The two men who had followed them into the casino were watching, but hung back out of the way. \"For the record, I have a room booked here, Mr. Security Man,\" Amanda said loudly. \"Ma'am, we don't rent by the hour,\" he said as he walked the two of them across the floor and into the inner workings of the casino. Once they were safely out of sight of the general public, Amanda dropped the attitude and smiled. \"Thanks, Danny,\" Amanda said. \"I owe you one.\" \"Eh, I owed you,\" he said. They stopped in the corridor. \"Danny McCoy, Agent Tuck Hansen,\" Amanda said, introducing the men. They shook hands. \"Care to catch me up?\" Tuck asked. \"Once we get in to see Ed. He's still here, right?\" Amanda asked. \"He got your text and told me he was staying,\" Danny said. \"Are you hungry? You're probably starving,\" he said looking at his watch. \"How'd you get out early?\" he asked as they started walking again. Amanda pointed to Tuck. \"He bought me,\" she smiled. \"Good choice, man,\" Danny smiled. \"Are you sure you wouldn't like a sandwich or something? How 'bout you Agent Hansen?\" \"Call me Tuck,\" Tuck replied. \"And I could deal with a sandwich.\" \"I like this guy already, MandyAnn,\" Danny said and led them to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, he snagged a couple sandwiches and a couple bottles of water for them. \"You're really tall,\" Tuck said as he looked up at the man with him and Amanda. Tuck was no slouch, but he certainly didn't compare in height to this man. \"I know. I'm six-four. I just kept growing,\" Danny said. \"How much does Danny know?\" Tuck asked quietly when the other man turned to look for something. \"He's okay,\" Amanda smiled. \"We can trust him.\" Tuck remained unconvinced. Who the hell was this guy? \"What the hell are you doing in the kitchen?\" A voice asked. \"You were supposed to bring them upstairs.\" Tuck looked at him and saw a man who was definitely more 'mob' than the idiots down at the club. \"Ed Deline,\" he said, extending his hand to shake Tuck's. His shirt sleeves were rolled up and Tuck could clearly make out the CIA insignia tattooed on his left forearm. \"Tuck Hansen.\" \"What the hell kind of name is Tuck?\" he smiled. \"Hey there, little girl,\" he said to Amanda. \"Hi, Ed,\" Amanda smiled and put her arms around the man in a hug. \"Come on. Bring your damn sandwich to my office. We'll talk there,\" Ed said. \"Amanda said she was hungry,\" Danny explained. \"And yet you two have the sandwiches,\" Ed said. Tuck was still confused as hell, but as the group stepped out of the kitchen and walked the halls, his mind wandered to Amanda who was three steps ahead of him. She was still wearing his jacket, but the glitter on her legs kept catching the fluorescent lights. He smiled without realizing it and was still smiling when Amanda turned to look at him. \"Come on,\" she said, waving for him to catch up. They continued to a private elevator past a surveillance room that looked a lot like a CIA operation. The elevator opened up into a large office and Danny let Amanda and Tuck follow after Ed. Danny brought up the rear. \"I'm going to go change,\" Amanda said once they were all inside. \"Of course, honey. You know where to go,\" Ed said as he sat down on the front edge of his desk. All three men watched her walk away. \"She's something, isn't she?\" Ed asked. Danny nodded and Tuck looked confused, still. All of them waited in silence until Amanda came out of the bathroom five minutes later. She was in a pair of yoga pants and a long sleeve t-shirt. Her long hair was pulled up into a bun and some of the make-up had been washed off. \"Would someone care to explain now?\" Tuck asked. \"Why don't you start, Amanda, since this is your mission,\" Ed asked. \"Of course, well, I've known Ed for several years. I worked with him in…was it Beirut?\" she said. \"Yep,\" he replied. \"Well, I knew Ed was out here and he's been keeping me sane. Well, him and Danny.\" A jealous look crossed Tuck's face as he saw Danny's smile to Amanda. \"Danny and Ed know everyone in Vegas. And they are helping me get a handle on the task. I was given. \"And Ed lets me crash here sometimes…when I can't stand it at my shithole apartment. But since I had a tail tonight, it's unlikely that I'll be able to do that again.\" \"So you're both part of the agency?\" Tuck asked, crossing his arms across his chest. His shirt sleeve revealed the tattoo on his bicep. \"I'm retired. Just helping out a friend. And Danny…\" \"I was…I am a Marine. And I'm Ed's right hand here. You can trust me.\" \"I generally find that I can't trust the people who tell me to trust them,\" Tuck replied. \"I'm just helping MandyAnn.\" \"Amanda…\" \"Before a fight breaks out, would you both relax?\" Amanda said. \"I know Ed and he wouldn't have brought Danny in on this unless we could really trust him. And Tuck, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?\" \"I thought you'd be a little happier about it,\" Tuck replied. \"Wait,\" Danny said. \"Is this the guy?\" he asked Amanda. Amanda smiled. \"Yeah. He's the guy.\" \"Oh, thank god. No matter how you described him, I kept picturing Austin Powers.\" \"What the hell is with all the British stereotypes?\" Tuck asked, the vein in his exposed bicep twitching ominously. \"Is that some kind of record? Jack Sparrow and Austin Powers in one night?\" Amanda asked. Tuck finally saw the humor in the situation and smiled. Danny's cell phone ran and he read the display. \"I gotta take this,\" he said. \"Hey Dee,\" he said. \"How are you, baby?\" he said before he left the office. Tuck looked at Amanda for an explanation. \"Dee is Delinda, Ed's daughter. And Danny's fiancé and mother of his soon to be baby boy,\" Amanda said. \"Oh.\" \"Oh,\" Amanda said sweetly. \"You thought? Danny and I?\" \"He is tall.\" \"Yes, he is. But he's not you.\" \"All right. Can we get down to business?\" Ed asked. \"Collins sent me because, after reading your reports, she's convinced you're almost to the point of cracking the case,\" Tuck explained. \"There are four women who claim that they were brought as models to the US. But I've looked them up; I've taken fingerprints. They're American citizens, born here. They're lying, and unfortunately, we can't bring them in for lying. But I think they're here telling people these stories to keep the real stories from getting out.\" \"What do you mean?\" Tuck asked. \"Frankie told me that there have been new girls, in and out, in a matter of a week or less. They barely speak English, they dance once or twice and then they're never here again. \"I heard there's going to be another drop. Both women and drugs. Probably within the next week.\" \"Is Frankie the only source you have for this info?\" Tuck asked. \"No. I'm always listening. They don't think I'm listening when I'm refilling their drinks and…well, never mind. If I could get Vince alone…I could get the details. He'd tell me anything,\" Amanda said. \"No,\" Ed and Tuck answered together. \"I don't think I like that idea,\" Ed said. \"I don't think I like Vince,\" Tuck said, saying his name snidely. \"You'd have to be alone with him.\" \"Right…\" she said. \"That's the point.\" \"Vince isn't the one you have to worry about,\" Danny said, rejoining the conversation. \"Vince is all bark and no bite. And no hair. Basically a nerd. I went to high school with him.\" The other three stared at Danny. \"Well, Vince isn't going to randomly start divulging his father's business dealings in the middle of the club. I'm going to have to go home with him.\" … To be continued…[Chapter 24] A New War 24 Amanda woke up and blinked into the sunlight. For the second time in only a matter of weeks, she woke up and had no idea where she was. But this time an arm was slung across her waist. She was not alone this time for sure. Following the arm, she found Tuck still sleeping soundly next to her. She smiled as she remembered. First, the four of them, Ed, Danny, Tuck and Amanda, had argued in Ed's office. They'd all screamed and shouted. Then a plan had been developed and agreed upon. Once everything was smoothed over, it was even later in the night and Ed had offered them one of the rooms at the Montecito. Of course, they had him up on the offer. Amanda had Tuck out of his shirt before the hotel room's door was open and his belt and top button on his pants were undone while he swiped the key for the room. As she looked around the hotel room, clothes were strewn all about. Amanda knew she'd missed Tuck, but she didn't realized how much until she had him in her arms. \"So, breakfast in bed?\" he yawned beside her. Amanda looked at the clock, then back at Tuck. \"I have rehearsal.\" \"You don't really work there.\" \"I still do for the next week,\" she replied. Amanda stood from the bed with a sheet wrapped around her. \"So you can stay, but I have to go,\" Amanda told him. Tuck was wearing his sad, disappointed face. He was pouting at her. \"That isn't going to work. Do you know what happens to the girls that are late? Frankie makes them run laps. I hate running.\" \"More than stripping?\" he said as he set up. \"That's definitely a toss up right there. But I like Brussels sprouts more than I like running,\" Amanda said as she got dressed. \"You're really going?\" Amanda smiled. \"Gotta keep the illusion alive,\" she said. \"Where's your wallet?\" \"What?\" he laughed. \"Never been robbed by a hooker before?\" she asked. \"Well, no,\" Tuck continued to laugh. \"I'm glad to hear that.\" \"Are you sure you want to go ahead with this plan?\" Tuck said as he found his wallet in his pants pocket. He opened it up and handed her some money. Agency money. \"I want to be able to end the reign of drugs and people trafficking that's happening out of this bar,\" Amanda said. \"I want it to end yesterday.\" \"I know, but…\" \"I'm not really going to do anything. It'll be like that part in Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\" \"Do you have a purse that turns into a grappling hook so you can repel down the side of a building?\" he asked her. \"Maybe I'm Batman?\" she said before kissing him. \"Nah, you can't be Batman,\" he told her. \"And why is that?\" \"I've never cared for Batman,\" he said before kissing her again. … \"Look who decided to join us?\" Frankie said as she watched Amanda stroll into their rehearsal space. \"Sorry, sorry. Got a late start. Earned a little more cash this morning, if you know what I mean,\" Amanda said as she winked to the girls. \"You do what you need to do in your own time, missy. You don't keep me waiting, okay?\" Frankie said sternly. \"Five laps around the block. All of you.\" All of the women started to complain. \"One peep out of any of you and it'll be ten! Get a move on!\" Frankie was extra hard on Amanda the rest of the afternoon and she'd wished she'd slept more the night before. Amanda had blisters on six toes and each blister had another one on top of it. The other women, all of them were sending dirty looks and bad vibes in her general direction. But last week they'd all done it to Lana and Lara and they were forgiven this week, so Amanda took it. With any luck, this would all be over in a few days anyway. … That night, Tuck and Danny strolled into the club. This time, Tuck was welcomed back and ushered to the head table. \"Who's this?\" Vincent Sr. asked, pointing at Danny. \"He's a friend of mine. He likes poker, too,\" Tuck said. \"Wants to buy in.\" \"He looks suspicious,\" Vincent Sr. told them. \"What do you do?\" \"I was a Marine. Now I'm an investment banker,\" Danny lied. \"I'm Tim.\" \"James and Tim, huh?\" he said. \"Well, Tim, if James here vouches for you, you must be an okay guy. You got the money to buy in?\" Danny produced a wad of cash almost as big as his fist. \"I think I've got enough.\" \"Hey, let's get these boys a drink!\" Vincent Sr. said as he snapped his fingers. \"Have a seat, gentlemen.\" Both Danny and Tuck sad in the seats indicated to them. One of Frankie's dancers, not Amanda, produced a bottle of vodka and some glasses filled with ice. \"Enjoy,\" she smiled in both of their directions before she sashayed back towards the bar. They'd been 'drinking' and playing poker for an hour and still hadn't seen Amanda. Danny was breaking even and Tuck was up five hundred. Their table of ten had shrunk to six. Vincent Sr., Vincent Jr. and two men that Tuck didn't know before tonight. And the conversation was starting to get good. \"You both seem like good guys,\" Vincent Sr. said. \"And both of you came back okay.\" \"Meaning?\" Danny said. \"We ran your names. You both are who you say you are. We can't be too careful, ya know. You could be Feds,\" he further explained. Both men nodded. \"Not Feds,\" Tuck replied honestly. \"Would either of you be interested in a little side business?\" Vincent Sr. asked. \"What do you mean?\" Danny asked. Vince Jr. eyed Danny carefully. \"You don't get things too quick, do ya?\" \"We had a few pre-party drinks,' Tuck told them. \"Always knocks the big guy on his ass.\" \"Don't know how to stop when you're having a good time?\" Vincent Sr. said. \"I think you'll do well here. Speaking of a good time…did you have a good time with Mandy last night?\" he asked Tuck. He'd prepared himself for some variation of that question, but Tuck hadn't prepared himself for the feeling that came with it. He had actually slept with Amanda last night, and it was a great time, but when he said that, it would only encourage these men. \"You got what you paid for, right buddy?\" Danny interjected. \"Oh yeah, well worth it, mate,\" Tuck smiled. If he'd had any reservations about bringing Danny McCoy along with him, they were gone now. They were almost as good together as he and FDR were. Vincent Sr. stood and clapped Tuck on the back. \"You like her, you should see the twins.\" The music was starting and only a few beats in, Tuck knew it was Def Leopard's Pour Some Sugar On Me . Both nights that Tuck had been here, he'd seen it start as a semi-classy burlesque club and morph seamlessly into a very generic strip club. On cue, the twins came strutting out in matching leopard print outfits. \"Should my Vince here check Mandy out?\" Vincent Sr. asked. \"Uh, well…\" Tuck began. \"I only want the best for my boy, so you can be honest with me.\" \"You can quit talking about me like I ain't here,\" Vince said. \"I already made my arrangements with Mandy tonight,\" he smiled as she came out a side door and waved at him. He pushed out his chest and smiled probably what he imagined was a charming smile. It wasn't. \"You guys go talk about your thing, I'm going to have a chat with Mandy,\" he said, never taking his eyes away from her. \"Come with me,\" he said. Both Tuck and Danny stood to follow him. Vincent Sr. put his arm around Danny's shoulders. \"You two come in back with me. To my office. We'll talk about what I have in mind. Vince, you join us in ten minutes, okay? And don't bring the girl.\" Vincent Sr.'s office had to have been Frankie's office at one point. While there was definitely a man's touch to the décor now, some hints of a woman were still there. Tuck found himself staring at a very revealing photograph of Frankie when she was 30 years younger and then the bustier featured was mounted to the wall next to it. \"Sit down, boys,\" Vincent Sr. said. Both Danny and Tuck sat and Vincent opened the drawer and found himself a cigar box. He offered one to each of the men and then they went to task lighting them. \"Now, down to business. I pride myself on being an excellent judge of character. I like you two. I told Vincey that you two either had to be Feds or just good boys.\" He laughed with a huge smile on his face. \"We are definitely not Feds,\" Tuck said. \"I'm not American, could I even work for the American government?\" he asked, laughing. \"No,\" Danny said. \"Now, I want to know if your allegiance lies with me. You were a Marine. What we're doing could be argued that it is less than honorable.\" \"What exactly are we doing?\" Tuck said. \"We bring women here, from all over the world. They're looking to come to America and we give them that chance…for a nominal fee,\" Vincent Sr. said. \"we arrange for travel and accommodations here in the US and these ladies, well, they work for me until I decide their debt has been paid off. Then they're free to go. It depends on how hard we had to work to get them here.\" Danny and Tuck were trying their hardest to not to stand up and punch the man's lights out. \"First, we see how badly they want to get here. That determines their 'job'. Some women are mules. They bring in cocaine and heroin. You know, they…\" he made a swallowing motion. \"And these women buy their passage to the US by becoming drug mules?\" Tuck asked. \"Some do. The women who are hesitant to do that, well, they become my pros.\" \"Not all women here are from other countries, though,\" Danny said. \"Do you think I keep 'em all here? That would be inviting disaster to dinner.\" \"Right, of course,\" Tuck said. \"I got some back in Jersey, some in New York, Miami, LA and of course, right here. These women want to come to America…land of dreams…and they're willing to do what they have to do to get here,\" Vincent Sr. said. \"Some are merely dancers, if I decide to let them, but most are either smuggled in the drugs, or are paying off their debts.\" \"What about A-Mandy?\" Tuck asked. \"What's her story? She made something up last night, but I could tell something was up,\" he told him. \"She's different. Frankie said that this girl owed her. So, we made a deal. All of us. I let Frankie hire the lady and the girly would do whatever we told her to until we stopped telling her to do it.\" \"So she doesn't see any of the money that I paid you, right?\" Tuck said. \"She's probably a junkie.\" He said snidely. He felt like a total bastard saying it, but he had to keep playing the part. \"You ask a lot of questions, dontcha?\" Vincent asked around his cigar. \"He's always been like that,\" Danny said. \"Asks so many questions, never knows when to shut up.\" \"Hey, questions aren't such a bad thing. Just so many at once, they give me a migraine,\" Vincent Sr. said. He leaned back in his chair and puffed out a cloud of smoke. He then sat forward in his chair and leaned on his arms while he looked seriously at Tuck and Danny. \"I've decided…\" Vincent Sr. started. \"You'll both help me. You're good guys and you, you bug the piss outta my son,\" he said to Tuck. \"And I like that because he bugs the piss outta me sometimes.\" \"Tomorrow night, we leave for Canada. And you two are coming with me,\" Vincent Sr. said. \"Canada?\" \"Canada, boys. Our girls, they come from Europe and Asia and their first stop is Canada. Then we smuggle them across the border in Montana. We have an airstrip once we're across the border and we'll be back in Vegas in no time,\" he grinned evilly. \"Where in Canada, exactly?\" Danny asked. \"Saskachewan,\" he told them. \"Pack your bags, gentlemen.\" … To Be Concluded…[Chapter 25] A New War Chapter 25 Tuck needed to get to Amanda before she left with Vince Jr. that night. And in reality, he wanted to keep Amanda from leaving with him at all. He and Danny had already gotten all the information they needed to stop these men from ever doing this again; they had no reason to stick around and no reason to have Amanda do this. The problem was, he couldn't find her. \"Listen, I want another night with Mandy,\" Tuck told Vince Sr. \"I had a really good time with her last night.\" The three men were out in the open area and another one of the girls was dancing on the stage. The strobe lights that were pulsating to the music and were likely to cause someone a seizure. \"I'm afraid that's a no-go,\" Vince Sr. said. \"My boy has arrangements with her tonight. You heard him. I doubt he's gonna wanna share.\" \"I'm willing to make it worth your while,\" Tuck said as he pulled a large wad of money held with a clip out of his pocket. \"There isn't enough…\" Tuck pulled the money from the clip and handed the clip itself to Vincent Sr. \"It's 24 carat gold inlaid with platinum. I won it in a poker game off a billionaire in Morocco. It's worth a hundred grand easy. It's yours…if I can have Mandy.\" \"She must really know what gets you goin', kid,\" Vince Sr. said as he inspected the clip. \"Platinum, eh?\" \"It's totally legit; I had it checked out,\" Tuck said. Vince Sr. stared at Tuck for a minute before calling over one of the guys. He whispered something to the guy, who was built like a brick wall and the man nodded to his boss. The brick wall looked at Tuck and Danny and then headed back into the dressing room area of the bar. Vince Sr. was still admiring the money clip that was offered as payment. It was gold and the 'platinum' was a highly sophisticated alloy created to behave just like the clip, there lay an almost-unbreakable GPS transmitter. Tuck was lucky he'd packed that particular gadget. A few minutes later, Amanda was being pulled out by her elbow. \"What the hell?\" she said. \"What about Vince?\" she asked. \"You let me take care of him,\" Vince Sr. told her. \"You just take care of my pay, James.\" Amanda looked up through her eyelashes at Tuck. \"No problem, Mr. Caputo,\" she smiled. \"That's what I like to hear,\" Vincent Sr. said. \"You know what?\" You go with them,\" he told Danny. \"Huh?\" Danny said. \"You, Timmy, you go with James and Mandy. I promise you'll enjoy yourself,\" Vince said. \"I don't know. I'm more of a one on one kind of man,\" Danny said. \"Besides, he's the one who paid.\" \"Yeah. I don't think I want to share,\" Tuck said. He roughly pulled Amanda to him and let his hand wander down her body. \"I know I don't want to share,\" he smacked her ass. Amanda had no idea what was going on. She was at a loss while the men around her talked about her like she was a steak. \"Take him upstairs,\" Vince Sr. said. \"You know where,\" he told Amanda. Amanda nodded. She did know where. But it made her want to throw up. The room upstairs was a 'private' room that had two-way glass that benefitted the people on the other side. Tuck could tell by the way Amanda was hesitant in her movements that this was not a good place to end up. He tried to read her to get more information, but it wasn't happening. \"Get a move on,\" Vince Sr. said. He reached out and smacked Amanda on the ass next. It was so hard that she almost yelped in pain. And Tuck almost reached out and grabbed the man by the throat. However, he restrained himself and made a mental note to hurt him later. \"Come with me,\" Amanda tried to say as sexily as she could. She took his hand just as Vince Jr. walked into the room. \"What the hell?\" he shouted at both Tuck and Amanda. \"Uh…\" Amanda stuttered. Vince's face was red and sweaty. And he was pissed as hell. He pushed Amanda out of the way and launched at Tuck. Tuck let him land a nice punch before he came back with a hit to Vince Jr.'s gut. He hit again and connected with Vince Jr.'s chin. He fell to the ground with a loud moan and an equally loud thud. Vince Jr. continued to lay on the ground while the rest of the club cheered. Tuck grinned until he turned around and looked at Vince Sr. He was not finding this amusing. \"You punched my son. And now there is a grown man laying on the ground,\" Vince Sr. said. \"What makes you think you can just come in here and do that to my family? To my blood? What do you have to say for yourself?\" \"He started it?\" Tuck offered? Vincent narrowed his eyes then kicked his son. \"Get your ass up,\" he told him. He turned back to Tuck. \"Sometimes it is so painful to call him my son. He's such a wuss.\" \"I am not a wuss!\" he shouted at his dad. \"You have never thought I fit in.\" \"You just got your ass handed to you by this guy,\" he pointed to Tuck. \"You wonder why I don't rely on you?\" Vince Sr. said. \"I can't rely on you. Ever.\" The music stopped and the girls took their chance to dash backstage. What was coming was not going to be pleasant and they didn't want to be there for it. But Vince wasn't about to let the rest of the people in the club watch the family business go down. \"What the hell does everyone think they're looking at?\" he yelled. \"We're closed now! Get the hell out!\" The group of men in the club did as they were told and started to file towards the door. \"You!\" he pointed to Amanda. \"You started all of this shit! You owe my friend, James, a good time. Do whatever you want with her. And she'll accompany us tomorrow morning. It makes the other women more comfortable to see a girl there,\" he explained. \"And you,\" he said down to his son. \"She might just be a hooker, but she's too good for you.\" He turned back so he could address Tuck and Danny again. \"It's a sad day when a father can't even trust his son to win a fight. I'm ashamed that I raised him. His mother and I must have been too soft. He shook his head sadly. \"But I have to take you anyway. You are the contact person for the women. I wish I hadn't done that…oh, well, hindsight. Okay, we leave at eight. You bring her here at seven-thirty. I'm going to trust you two to have her here and presentable. I'll meet you here and we'll all go to the airport together.\" \"Sure, Vince,\" Danny said. \"You do what you gotta do to make sure she's here. If you wanna little security, see Max on the way out. He's my…pharmacist.\" Tuck smacked Amanda hard on the ass. \"Let's go. I've got plans for this one,\" he said conspiratorially. Amanda's eyes went wide when Tuck spoke to her. … Once the three of them had escaped the club and it was safely in the rearview mirror, Amanda really started to freak out. \"What the hell was all of that?\" she shouted. \"And if you ever smack me on the ass like that ever again…\" \"Sorry,\" Tuck half-assed apologized with a slight grin on his face. \"Where are we going tomorrow and why did he suggest that you drug me?\" This time, Danny replied. \"Saskatchewan.\" \"Why?\" \"That's where the next batch of women are,\" Danny told her. \"They have some kind of holding facility there.\" \"I've been here for weeks, undercover, and haven't been able to get info like that. How the hell did you two come in twice and somehow secure yourselves a place in Vincent Caputo's effing court?\" \"I had a hunch,\" Tuck told her. \"You had a hunch,\" she repeated slowly if she would comprehend it better. \"A hunch?\" He nodded. Amanda reached up from the back seat and smacked him on the shoulder. \"Let me know what's going on next time,\" Amanda said. Danny pulled up next to Tuck's motel. \"Pretend you don't hate me, okay?\" he told Amanda as they got ready to exit the car. \"In case someone followed us.\" Amanda narrowed her eyes, but accepted his hand when he opened the car door for her. \"See you in the morning!\" Danny cheerfully called from the car. Amanda latched onto Tuck's arm and smiled up at him as if in a blissful cloud of ignorance and drug-induced euphoria. He opened the motel room door and held it open for her. She ran her hand over his muscled chest as she walked into the room past him. Tuck checked the immediate area around them before locking the door behind them. \"This is almost as shitty as my apartment,\" Amanda said as she took in Tuck's room. \"I didn't want to attract too much attention.\" \"Yet, you're carrying wads of cash and platinum money clips.\" \"It's a GPS device,\" Tuck told her. \"The Agency will be able to track Caputo as soon as I let them know he has it.\" She nodded. \"I see. In case the wire you're wearing didn't work?\" It has been barely noticeable. In fact, she had only noticed it when she'd run her hand across his chest a minute ago. And even then, anyone else could have thought it was muscle. \"Interesting choice considering you're wearing such a tight-fitting shirt,\" she told him. \"I'm going to let FDR know what's going on and then we can start tracking Caputo,\" Tuck said. \"Do you have hot water here?\" Amanda asked. Tuck's expression was confused. \"Yes...\" \"Sweet. I'm going to take a shower. I don't have hot water at my place. Guess it costs extra.\" He smiled at her. \"Give me a sec. I'll be there in a minute.\" Tuck moved to dial his phone and Amanda was turning the door knob when there was a knock at the motel room door. \"Room service!\" a voice boomed. Tuck looked at Amanda and shook his head. Both indicating to not go to the door and that this motel didn't have room service. Amanda slipped silently into the bathroom to turn the shower on while Tuck readied his gun and stood where he would be hidden behind the soon to-be-opened door. \"Room service!\" the voice called, more impatient this time. \"Coming!\" Amanda sing-songed. She steadied herself and opened the door. It was Vince Jr. \"Vince!\" she said, pretending to be surprised. \"What are you doing here?\" He pushed into the room and looked around. Everywhere but behind him. \"Where is he? Where is the asshole?\" \"Showering,\" Amanda pointed. He took another step into the room. \"Good. I can surprise him.\" Vince took another step and Tuck was able to bring the barrel of his gun down into Vince's skull. The man's eyes rolled back into his head while he fell to the floor in a heap. He was totally unconscious. \"I think I might like hitting him a bit too much,\" Tuck said while he kicked the motel room's door closed. \"What if he hadn't come alone?\" \"He came alone.\" \"What if he hadn't?\" \"He was going to come in here and kill me. He's drunk and angry and he hates me. He wanted to prove some things to his dad.\" \"Oh, okay,\" Amanda replied sarcastically. \"So now we have a hostage. What do we do now?\" \"Never kept a hostage before?\" \"Not a 250 pound hostage,\" she replied. \"He won't be out forever. What do we do when he comes to?\" \"We have to tie him up,\" Tuck told her. She offered him a 'duh' look in reply. \"Okay, then what?\" \"He can stay here. The Agency can come get him and take him in.\" \"I had been hoping for a decent night's sleep in a semi-comfortable bed,\" Amanda said, pouting slightly. \"Oh, you weren't going to have one anyway. We have to plan and coordinate our day tomorrow,\" Tuck told her. \"You forget how this all works?\" \"Too much glitter in the brain.\" Tuck smiled at her and then opened one of his suitcases. A variety of tools and gadgets were inside, including zip-ties and a set of noise-cancelling headphones. \"What the shit?\" she asked holding up a blindfold. \"What would you have said if you were stopped when flying?\" \"I would have asked them if they'd ever heard of Fifty Shades of Grey ,\" he smirked. Amanda slapped his bicep slightly. \"You aren't funny.\" \"I thought it was good,\" he said. \"Anyway, we can blindfold him and put the headphones on him. We'll have to gag him, too. So he can't scream. And he won't know our plans.\" \"I know I should have expected this from you, but it kind of freaks me out.\" \"You don't have a bag of tricks like this?\" he asked while he began zip-tying Vince's hands together. \"Um, I usually travel with my gun and handcuffs. Not a bag of torture devices,\" Amanda explained as she unceremoniously snapped the headphones on Vince's head roughly. \"Although, the taser is a nice touch,\" she said as she admired the rest of the contents of the case. \"It comes in handy more often than you'd think.\" \"I only tased a guy once. Then had to explain to his family why he was foaming at the mouth and why he'd pissed himself,\" Amanda said. \"You hit him hard,\" he observed. \"He made me mad,\" Amanda grinned. \"Noted,\" he replied. Vince was beginning to come to and was staring at both Tuck and Amanda with wide, watery eyes. But he hadn't said anything yet, because he couldn't hear a sound that they were saying. \"Oh, look, he's starting to freak out,\" Amanda said. \"Don't worry,\" she said as she bopped his nose. \"Really?\" Tuck asked. \"Yeah, really. Look, honey, he's all confused,\" She laughed. \"He can't hear us, of course he's confused,\" Tuck told her. \"Are you guys Feds?!\" he shouted. Amanda leaned down and pulled back the headphones. \"No. Worse…CIA,\" she said. \"You should make sure he doesn't have a tracking device on him.\" \"You should call Ed.\" Amanda grinned. \"Ed Deline would love to see you, Vince. He's a big fan of you and your dad.\" \"Holy shit!\" he shouted as Amanda found her phone. Tuck let the headphones snap on his head once more. \"Who are you really getting?\" \"An armored car to come get him,\" Amanda said. \"We can move him out the bathroom window in case anyone is watching the front door.\" \"We?\" \"Yes, we,\" Amanda said. \"Like it or not, you and I are in this mess together, Mr. Hansen.\" \"Oh, I definitely like it,\" he said as he ran a hand down Amanda's arm. \"Cut it out,\" Amanda said, pulling away. \"We've got work to do first.\" … Author's Note: It's almost the end! Hope everyone is still with me. Also, I don't own the characters Danny McCoy, Ed Deline or Delinda Deline…they are characters from the tv show Las Vegas , and I just wanted to mention it. Thanks![Chapter 26] A New War Chapter 26 Tuck, Amanda and Danny arrived to the club a few minutes early. She thought it would be best if they showed up so Vince Sr. wouldn't send out a search party for them. \"Punctual,\" Vince Sr. said as he looked at the group of them. \"I like that. And you don't look like a whore; good job,\" he said to Amanda. \"Gee, thanks,\" Amanda said sarcastically. \"You have a good time last night? You look exhausted as shit,\" he clapped Tuck on the shoulder. \"It was a good night,\" he smiled slyly. \"And you?\" he turned to Danny Danny hadn't slept a wink, but for a totally different reason. His very pregnant girlfriend was dealing with \"all the time\" sickness. Delinda was difficult normally and the pregnancy made it a thousand times worse. \"I'm good,\" Danny lied. All three of them had discussed the plan on the ride over. Each one of them had a hidden panic button; Amanda was wearing three at Tuck's insistence. They would land in Montana first. Pick up a bigger plane and then head to Canada. It would be the return to Montana when they all split into different vehicles with the women. That was when the CIA was going to bust them. Tuck would be in charge of sending the encrypted messages during the flights. It would be too suspicious if Amanda was texting. Danny would be just trying not to fall asleep. \"I think we'd better get a move on, boys!\" Vince Sr. said. \"Has anyone seen my son?\" he asked as he looked around. \"Wait? Vince isn't here?\" Tuck said. \"No! That no good kid!\" Vince Sr. shouted. \"Lazy ass probably got wasted last night and overslept.\" \"He do that often?\" Tuck asked. \"Wouldn't you, if you were him? Short, fat and balding. And no actual job skills. Basically useless. And I can't fire him 'cause he's my son,\" Vince Sr. said. Tuck said nothing. \"Your pop must be real proud of you, kid. He tell you that?\" \"He died when I was young. I don't know,\" Tuck replied. His tone was sincere, but flat. Amanda knew he was telling the truth. Why hadn't they ever talked about that? \"I'm sorry to hear that, kid,\" Vince Sr. said. \"It's all right. I can tell my son how proud of him I am instead,\" Tuck replied. \"You got a kid, too? We got plenty to talk about on the plan ride out to Montana.\" The plan ride from Las Vegas to Montana was an incredibly short ride. That was fantastic because the small plane made Amanda nauseous. It took them about a minute and a half to de-plane and get on the larger plane. As soon as they were up in the air, Tuck fired off a text message. \"Who you messaging?\" Vince Sr. asked as soon as he saw Tuck do it. \"My wife,\" Tuck replied quickly. \"Your wife?\" Vince Sr. and Amanda asked together. Amanda looked up from her nail-filing and stared at Tuck while Vince Sr. whore a confused expression. \"You're married?\" Amanda shouted. This woke Danny up and he was even more confused than everyone else. \"Well, yeah,\" he said. \"You didn't think that you and I were…Oh, that's hilarious.\" Amanda looked furious while Tuck shared a laugh with Vince Sr. \"How much longer until we're in Canada? I want off of this damn plane. I don't want anything to do with any of you people,\" she pouted. Danny was enjoying the show. He was happy he'd woken up to see it, actually. Truthfully, Amanda was legitimately surprised when Tuck launched into his tale about his wife. And she still wasn't happy with the shit his ex had caused her. So, in reality, Amanda Simons was actually pissed at the mention of Katie. It just wasn't entirely the real reason she was pissed. \"Honey, did you really think you would be able to marry up like that? You're a cheap wh…\" Vince Sr. said. A phone rang and all four of them jumped. \"Mine,\" Vince Sr. said. The phone was up to his ear a mere millisecond later and he was in a whole different world from them. But Amanda continued to argue. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Amanda shouted. \"Oh, you're texting her again?\" \"You were there for a good time, baby,\" Tuck said. \"But I'm going to go home and you won't be going with me, Mandy. You've been great, though,\" he offered in a smart ass tone. \"There are ten girls waiting for us and their big break here in the States. So if this one here is giving us too much trouble, we can even have a pick of the new ones,\" Vince Sr. said. \"Everything all right?\" Danny asked when he saw the concerned look on his face. \"My guys back in Vegas can't find Vincent and now they think that there are Fed crawling around the club. I wish they'd all get their heads outta their asses or they'll find themselves wearing cement shoes,\" Vince Sr. explained. \"You all do that?\" Danny asked. \"It's more of an expression,\" he smiled back at Danny. \"We aren't mob. We're just businessmen with a very specific set of job skills. That didn't make Amanda feel better. She hoped that they weren't going to decide that she wasn't needed and fit her with a pair of cement shoes. Well, that's how she wanted to look. In reality, she had a gun hidden on her and would shoot this bastard if and when she had to. Tuck rapid fired off another text message. \"How long you been married?\" Vince Sr. asked. \"Almost ten years,\" Tuck lied. \"Her name is Katie.\" \"Rebecca,\" Vince Sr. offered. \"32 years.\" \"What's your secret to a long and what I assume a happy marriage?\" Tuck asked. \"She's got her own place and a boy-toy up in the mountains. And I get along down here with a bevy of women.\" \"Does your wife know what you do?\" Amanda asked. \"She used to be the bait before she retired. She's from Yugoslavia,\" Vince Sr. said with a look of actual admiration on his face. \"I love her, you know. She's a great lady. Although, we have that good for nothin' son. But I can hardly blame that all on her.\" \"Sounds great…\" Danny said flatly. \"Are you married?\" \"Engaged,\" Danny said. \"She's pregnant.\" \"Driving you crazy with cravings?\" Vince Sr. said \"Driving me crazy period,\" Danny laughed. This was all good. Vince Sr. was getting comfortable with them. His guard was coming down and who knew what kind of information he would divulge when his guard came down. \"Mr. Caputo!\" a voice called over the loudspeaker. \"We'll be landing in ten minutes.\" \"Thank you, Red,\" he said back into the intercom. \"I always feel like I'm on the Enterprise when I fly on this jet. Now you,\" he said to Amanda. \"You're going to pretend that this is all good. These girls freak or run, it's your ass on the line, got it?\" Amanda rolled her eyes. \"Sheesh.\" \"No, you listen to me, Mandy,\" he said snidely. \"Your safety, as well as that of these ten girls, is all dependant on you. Your name is Rachel, okay? You came over two years ago and you're very successful. All of these girls are going to have success just like you.\" Amanda listened to the story. This was the most ridiculous thing so far. More than the stripping, more than the idiotic fake mobster thing. But she needed to focus on maintaining the whole story. These women, their safety, it really did all ride on her. And she was going to make sure that she helped stop this human trafficking. All of them put their seatbelts on and the jet began its descent. Once they were on the ground and had come to a stop, Vince Sr. made Amanda go out and welcome the ladies. Amanda disembarked from the plane and was more horrified than she thought it would be. These ten women were in various states of dress, well, they were all dressed for different seasons. And she felt epically bad for the ladies who had pre-dressed for desert and were made to stand out on the cold tarmac. \"Go ahead,\" he shoved her forward slightly with his elbow. \"Half of them are freezing. Get them into the plane,\" Amanda said. \"Seriously, have a heart this time.\" \"Don't tell me what to do, bitch,\" he told her out of the corner of his mouth. \"Get your ass in gear, put a smile on your face and go greet them. And then we can get them on the plane and get back to the States.\" Amanda looked around. This airport was in the middle of nowhere. She knew that Customs hadn't found it yet, so they were almost totally off of the radar. But only for a few more hours. \"Fine,\" Amanda hissed. She flipped her hair and sashayed over to the women in a way that had all of the eyes on her. \"Welcome, ladies!\" Amanda shouted. She rambled and smiled and despite the language barrier, she had all of them excited. A few minutes later, they were all being led back into the plane. Amanda was the last woman back up on the plane and Vince Sr. congratulated her while Tuck and Danny were making sure the other ladies were safely tucked in the other part of the airplane. \"You did good. Maybe you aren't such a dumb bitch after all. I could use you from now on…\" Vince Sr. said. Amanda sneered. \"You're an asshole and I will never work for you or with you ever again. Please count on that,\" she replied. She stomped past him and back into the private cabin. Vince Sr. joined her only a moment later. They stared at one another for a split second. The cabin was tense. \"Something's off about you. I can't figure you out and I can figure everyone out. You show up at my club for a job claiming you know Frankie. You strip okay and you put out, but only for the English guy. You've got a lousy attitude no matter what you're doing. And no matter how many times I run a background check on you, I don't find anything. You don't act like a stripper or a pro. I don't know where you come from or why you came to my club.\" \"Frankie owed me a favor. And I needed to get out from where I was.\" \"An escape?\" he narrowed his eyes. \"Let's just say I've got some daddy issues.\" \"I just want to know what the hell your deal is.\" \"It doesn't matter. It didn't matter when you traded me for a goddamned money clip. You don't give a flying fuck about anyone but yourself. You promise girls from all over the world a better life and sell them into slavery. They do all the work, you don't do shit. I did what you told me to do, now leave me the hell alone,\" she hissed back at him. The door to the private cabin opened and they were joined by Danny and Tuck. And it looked like the both of them could tell something had just happened between Vince and Amanda. \"Everything good here?\" Danny asked. Amanda put on a fake smile. \"Of course.\" Once up in the air again, Amanda began her countdown until they landed. Showtime would be in a mere 45 minutes and things would be moving quickly at that point. She was certain that there would be more than a few fireworks. \"I love picking up souvenirs from Canada,\" Vince Sr. grinned. Amanda grimaced and stared down at her shoes. Out of habit, Tuck reached over and tucked some hair out of her eyes. \"Don't touch me!\" Amanda snapped. Tuck drew his hand back so quickly it was as if he'd been electrocuted. And he wore a hurt expression on his face for a split second. \"Oooh, trouble in paradise,\" Vince grinned. \"Bite me,\" Amanda hissed. \"Where and how hard, sweetheart?\" Vince Sr. challenged her. \"I swear…\" Amanda started. Vince Sr. was out of his seat and got in her face. \"Remember what I told you? You don't play nice and all of these ladies, yourself included, will meet an untimely demise,\" he said. \"Do you understand what I'm saying?\" Amanda nodded slowly so he'd back off. He did and moved to the intercom. \"Rex, how long until we land in Montana?\" There was a brief pause while they waited for a response from Red, the pilot. \"Mr. Caputo, we have exactly 20 more minutes until we land. I would advise that you all buckle up,\" Red said. \"Thanks, Red!\" he replied before clicking off. \"Good, I have 20 more minutes to decide to push you outta the plane. Then I don't gotta worry about clean up,\" he said to Amanda. \"Well…\" Danny began. \"Someone will end up with bits and pieces.\" All the other faces turned to him. \"I knew a guy, he was dying of cancer. He and I went skydiving with another friend. Last minute, he took off his parachute and jumped,\" Danny explained. \"Really?\" Amanda asked. She'd been skydiving before and didn't particularly care for it. \"He smiled all the way down. Well, probably,\" Danny said. \"He was a good guy.\" Amanda nodded and looked back to her shoes. She should have worn better shoes. Tuck finished sending one last text message and put his phone away. Things were in a place in the airfield in Montana. It was going to be an ambush as soon as the plane landed. Agents were already in place as the henchmen drivers Caputo had no idea that he'd been infiltrated to this degree. All of them were armed and ready to take down one of the most offensive and disgusting human traffickers alive. \"What's the final plan when we land? What do you want us to do?\" Danny asked. \"Seven black Lincoln SUVs will be waiting for us on the ground. The girls will be split into pairs and put in a different vehicle. Each will be heading to a specific location. You three can have the sixth SUV and I will have my own ride back to Vegas.\" \"What do you want me to do with her?\" Tuck asked. \"She's not exactly the anniversary gift my wife asked for.\" \"Unless your wife is into stuff like that, and in that case…\" Danny laughed. \"Do whatever you want with her. I don't give a shit. But I don't want her back at my club,\" Vince Sr. said. \"Oh, please continue to talk about me as if I'm not here,\" Amanda said. \"And you, you asshole, you just offered me a job being your bait, but I can't take my clothes off in your club anymore?\" Amanda ranted. \"You need to shut the hell up!\" Vince Sr. shouted. \"I thought we'd already discussed this!\" Both were up, face to face, screaming at one another. \"No, you need to shut up!\" \"You both need to calm down!\" Tuck said, pulling on her arm. He was worried she'd finally snapped. \"No! This guy is an asshole and you two are assholes for helping him. Go home to your wife and girlfriend. This man…\" Vince Sr. snapped, too, and slapped her hard across the face. Amanda's hand flew to her cheek and she clutched it in pain. She and Vince stared at each other while a stray tear rolled down her cheek. Tuck was ready to pull his gun and shoot the man, but it wasn't the time to out themselves as CIA yet. And despite the tears coming down her face, he saw that she was actually fine. He had to remember she could cry on command. The plane was losing altitude and they felt the landing gear come out. After taxiing down the world's shortest runway, the plane finally slowed to a stop. Red finally emerged from the cockpit and took in the red face on Amanda and gleeful look on his boss' face. \"Everything okay?\" Red asked. \"Sure, swell,\" Vince Sr. replied. \"Go get Frank and get the girls loaded up in the SUVs.\" \"You're sure everything is okay?\" \"Peachy,\" Danny replied. \"Yup. This one wont' cause any more trouble. She just had to be brought down a couple pegs so she remembered what she really is,\" he said as she looked into his eyes. Red nodded and headed into the other cabin to meet with Frank and put the girls into the different cars. \"You boys go, too. Leave us alone for a bit,\" Vince Sr. said. \"Yeah, why don't we go see if we can speed this all along?\" Danny said to Tuck. Tuck reluctantly stood and followed Danny into the other cabin. Leaving Amanda alone again was not what Tuck had planned on, but he didn't want to have Vince become suspicious. Amanda's heart was pounding in her ears when the door to the other cabin closed. She needed to hide her nervousness or he would have the upper hand. \"I'm trying to decide what to really do with you. Part of me really wants to know how good you are, and you know which part of me that is,\" he grinned maniacally. \"The other part of me wants to shoot you and leave you in Montana. No one will miss you. You ran away from home, right?\" Amanda said nothing. In the silence, they heard the door to the airplane open and people could be heard filing out. \"See, no one cares about you, you know it,\" Vince Sr. said. \"You're disgusting,\" Amanda spat. \"No wonder your wife has her own fun without you.\" Vince Sr. had his gun out and was pointing it at her. \"You don't dare bring my wife into this! I love your feisty attitude, Mandy, but it's that same big mouth that is going to get you in trouble. In fact, you're already in trouble. Lucky for you, I'm fond of the bad girls.\" Amanda was horrified at what he was eluding to. But she would never let him do anything to her; she wouldn't. Just as Vince Sr. was approaching her, he heard a shout from outside the plane. He moved, gun still pointed at Amanda, to look out one of the jet's small windows. His pilot and the other man were pinned down by people dressed in all black. There were no SUVs in sight and Tuck and Danny were talking with more people dressed in all black SWAT gear. \"What the fuck?\" he asked out loud. \"It's the end of the road, Mr. Caputo,\" Amanda said, her calm voice was almost off-putting and he stared at her with a confused expression. \"Who the hell are you?\" \"My name is Agent Amanda Simons. And I work for the CIA,\" she said. \"And you, you're going to prison for a very long time.\" \"I could shoot you and…\" \"And leave? Do you know how to fly a plane?\" He was silent. \"I didn't think so.\" \"I'll bet you thought you were pretty damn smart. But my guys got away…the SUVs are gone.\" \"Newsflash jackass, your guys are actually our guys. Your little operation is caput, Mr. Caputo,\" Amanda smiled. \"So, you can shoot me if you want, but those guys out there won't let you leave on your own accord.\" \"Get up!\" Vince shouted. He pulled her roughly and she didn't fight because she wanted to remain bullet-less for as long as was available. \"Your little boyfriend out there, how's he gonna like it if you're a hostage?\" \"It's all an act. He's just a coworker,\" Amanda said. \"Move towards the door. Any funny business and I'm putting one or more bullets in your skull. Are you packing, too?\" Amanda didn't respond. \"Where is it?\" Amanda slowly moved one hand and drew out the gun. He snatched it from her and put it in his belt. \"How come you all didn't kill me before?\" he asked. \"We want you.\" \"What if I kill myself?\" he asked as they approached the door. \"You won't,\" Amanda said smugly. \"What makes you say that?\" \"You're too vain. And you're a spineless asshole.\" \"An asshole can kill himself,\" he pointed out. \"True. But you're too scared to do that.\" \"Shut up!\" he hissed in her ear. He had the gun placed to the base of her skull as they made their appearance in the open doorway of the jet. Immediately, all of the agents in black, along with Tuck and Danny, had their weapons trained on Vince and Amanda. \"Hold your fire!\" Tuck shouted. \"Do not shoot until I say so!\" … …to be continued… … Author's note: Hello all, I'm so sorry that I haven't updated in sooooooo long. But here was a very long chapter. Hopefully, you're all still with me. Leave me some reviews? Please?[Chapter 27] A New War Chapter 27 Amanda Simons was that girl in all of her classes whose hand always shot up when the teacher asked if there were any questions. She'd quickly learned to ignore the chorus of groans that it always seemed to elicit. She always had questions. Now, most of the time, her teacher hadn't really cleared up anything. However, she very clearly remembered her question about hostage situations and more specifically: what was going to happen if you found yourself as a hostage. Her instructor at the agency very simply answered: expect to be shot. This could be either by the person holding you as their hostage, or another agent who believed that shooting the hostage would distract the person holding the hostage. All of these things were running through her mind as Vince Sr. held the gun to the back of her skull. None of the agents down on the tarmac would have a clear shot to take out Caputo. But they could try to shoot her, just a non-fatal would that would make it impossible to take her with him. She could hear \"shoot the hostage\" in Keanu Reeves' voice as she stood there. It felt like forever as she stood there. Like time had frozen. But she saw Tuck giving orders. Time wasn't frozen. \"What do you want, Mr. Caputo?\" she asked. \"What?\" he asked. \"What exactly is your goal here?\" she asked. \"I'm just trying to figure you out. Honestly, as much as I don't want to end up dead, it wouldn't matter much to the Agency. They like me, but shit, one less person on the payroll…\" she said. \"What is this brave shit you're trying to pull? I don't believe it for one flippin' second, lady. Your little boyfriend down there wouldn't be telling them not to shoot if you weren't sort of important. They wouldn't have put you undercover if you weren't important,\" Vince said. \"You think I'm just some dumbass like my son. By the way, what'd you do to him?\" \"Oh, Vinny? He's in CIA custody. He came after me last night, but…\" \"What?\" \"He was going to try to prove something to his dear ol' dad. However, he was totally drunk. Easy to knock out.\" \"Geez, shit,\" he said in a disappointed tone. \"Useless.\" \"No points for effort?\" She suggested. \"If he weren't so fat.\" \"He's not fat, really. Just…disproportionate.\" \"His head is kinda too small for his body,\" Vince told her. She nodded. \"Wait! Don't distract me! I'm not going to fall for any more of your distractions or reverse psychology bull shit, lady,\" he told her firmly. \"Fine,\" Amanda said firmly. \"You want to know what I'm really thinking?\" \"No.\" \"Well, you're going to listen anyway because we seem to have some time.\" \"I could just shoot you right now,\" he said. Amanda ignored him. \"I'm pissed as hell that after all of my training and all of my experience in the field, here I am, unable to do anything to prevent myself from being shot. I'm not some helpless female with a sad past and lots of mysterious circumstances. But I did grew up being taught that I could do anything I wanted to do and you're crushing my self-esteem.\" \"Oh, geez. Not your self-esteem,\" he said sarcastically. \"This isn't Oprah and I don't give a shit.\" \"I know it won't stop you from using me as your human shield, but I just wanted to get that off my chest before I died. Damn, it feels better being honest,\" Amanda said. \"Good for you. Now move!\" he said, elbowing her in the shoulder blade to shove her forward. \"Where are you going?\" \"I can't tell you that,\" he said. \"You're making this up as you go, aren't you? Admit it, we surprised the hell outta you, didn't we?\" she said as she took a slow step down the stairs. A second later, it was all over. Sort of. She barely had time to think as she heard a gunshot and suddenly something heavy was bearing down on her and knocking her down the stairs. Realizing that it was Vince, she tried to roll as best as she could down the stairs from the plane that would do the least amount of damage to herself. At this point, she didn't give a shit about Vince. However, rolling safely down a flight of stairs was virtually impossible now that a 175 pound unconscious man was falling any which was he felt like. She counted all 12 stairs down to the bottom and then finally lost consciousness. Amanda had hit her head too hard on the tarmac. ////// Amanda blinked hard into the bright light above her. They were of the horrible fluorescent kind and it hurt her head. \"You look like hell,\" FDR told her as he smiled at her from the chair at the end of the bed. Amanda swallowed. Her throat felt dry, as if it were full of cotton. \"My head hurts like hell,\" she said. \"What happened?\" \"You lost consciousness for a minute. Doc said no concussion, though.\" \"Oooh, fantastic,\" she said. \"Wait, what are you doing here?\" \"It's nice to see you, too,\" he laughed. \"You already told me I looked like hell. My skirt didn't go over my head in the fall, did it?\" FDR laughed, a loud belly laugh, and Amanda tried to follow suit, but it hurt too much. \"No, but I'm glad to see where your priorities lie. Especially since you were undercover as a stripper. I hear you were in a lot less at some points…\" \"Don't you have a wife?\" \"That I love very much. However, I'm not blind…\" \"You're so funny. But what really happened?\" she asked. \"And Tuck and Danny?\" \"McCoy headed back to Vegas. His fiancé is in labor. And Tuck is baby-sitting Mr. Caputo while he's in surgery. What's the last thing you remember?\" he asked. \"Vince was pushing me to walk down the stairs. And then there was a gunshot and we fell. Who shot him?\" \"I did.\" \" You saved my life?\" she asked incredulously. \"Great.\" \"Hey now!\" he laughed. \"How?\" \"Tuck didn't know I was there, either. I told Collins that I had to be there for the takedown and she actually let me come. And so did Lauren. I was set up as a sniper. I was in a treestand.\" \"Where'd ya get him?\" Amanda asked. \"Shoulder.\" \"Nice shot.\" \"I was aiming for his head,\" FDR said. \"You weren't,\" she said, calling him out on his BS. \"Maybe I was aiming for your horrible extensions.\" \"That might be true,\" she smiled. \"I'll go switch with Tuck. He'll want to see you. Will you be okay?\" \"Yeah. I'll be fine,\" she said. FDR squeezed her hand and smiled at her before exiting the hospital room. Amanda knew she had to be a disaster. She was sore and her head screamed in pain when she moved it. But she hadn't been shot, so, she was counting her blessings. She was up and out of the bed attempting to locate a mirror. She finally resigned herself to checking her reflection in the hand towel dispenser. Even though it was distorted, she could tell she had a huge bruise on her forehead. The door opened behind her and she whirled around. \"It got a big dodgy here in the middle, huh?\" \"I haven't had a lot of experience with undercover jobs, but the ones I was part of didn't get like this,\" she replied. \"Well…\" Tuck said. \"You should be taking advantage of this. Get some rest.\" \"The shitty bed I had at my apartment in Vegas was more comfortable than this one. I just want to go home,\" she said. \"I think you should be pleased that you took down one of the most-wanted sex traffickers in the world.\" \"I don't want any more focus on me. Besides, without you, Danny and FDR, I wouldn't have done this. It all moved so much faster once you became involved. Thank you.\" \"Just doing my job, ma'am,\" Tuck told her. He leaned down to kiss her, but she backed away. \"What? Don't I get my reward?\" he asked. \"What reward do you think you deserve?\" she asked. \"I was going to start with a kiss and go from there…\" \"So, what do you think FDR will want since he took the shot?\" she asked, a smile on her face. \"He gets nothing because I thought you'd been hit,\" Tuck said. \"I was…\" They were face to face now. Nose to nose. \"You were what?\" she asked, egging him on. \"I was worried that you were dead, Amanda. I don't want to lose you. I just found you.\" \"What are you saying?\" she asked. \"Will you...move in with me?\" he asked. \"Oh gosh yes!\" she said. Amanda threw her hands around him and she hugged him tightly. \"Thank you for not asking me to marry you…\" \"Well, I think it's a bit early for that and I…well, I'm just…\" \"Shut up and kiss me,\" Amanda told him. ///////////// EPILOGUE It had been six months since the Las Vegas undercover mission. Things had essentially gone back to the way they had been, with the exception of Amanda now being in permanent resident at Tuck's place. Her mail was now even going there. It was the second Wednesday of the month, and as usual, the gang: Amanda, Tuck, Joe, Cameron, Alex and Sophie, along with FDR, Lauren and their son, Jacob and Bob and Trish and their children headed out for dinner. After they were all seated, Tuck was whispering to Joe, who was seated in between him and Amanda. When he was finished, Joe looked at Amanda and smiled. \"What?\" Amanda asked him. \"What's so funny?\" He motioned for Amanda to bend down so he could whisper in her ear. Once he was finished, Amanda looked at Tuck with a shocked expression on her face. \"Really?\" she asked. He nodded and smiled. \"So?\" \"Yes!\" she shouted. \"What the heck is going on?\" Trish asked. \"I feel like I've missed something.\" The entire table stared at both Tuck and Amanda. \"I think Amanda has agreed to marry me,\" he smiled. The table cheered, the baby started to cry and Tuck moved to Amanda. \"Will you marry me?\" he asked her. \"Of course!\" He presented her with a simple tear-shaped diamond and she held out her left hand so he could slip it on her finger. \"You sure you're okay with me marrying your dad?\" she asked Joe. He nodded and smiled. \"You'll be a great stepmom!\" \"Oh!\" Trish moaned. \"I hate you all,\" she said as she dabbed her eyes. \"Are you crying?\" FDR asked her. \"I am a human. I have feelings,\" she shouted. \"Could've fooled me!\" FDR laughed. \"Mandy, can we help pick out your wedding dress?\" Sophie asked. \"Yeah, I think we should get final say,\" Cameron said. \"I think it should be pink and…\" Alex started. \"Maybe elope?\" Amanda said to Tuck over the girls who were all hugging her. \"No!\" the entire crowd shouted at her. /..
