He fell before Alex had even landed. Alex skates over to him, a gash on his head spilling crimson blood all over the ice. \"Zach, Zach!\" Zach doesn't respond the EMT's quickly coming on to the ice. They steadied Zach's head and rolled him into the ambulance. Alex, not caring about damaging her blades, follows closely behind. They help Alex into the ambulance and head to the hospital. Alex sits in the waiting room, silently praying for any news on Zach. Finally a doctor comes out. \"Family of Zach Conroy,\" the doctor goes on as Alex stands up, \"Mr. Conroy suffered some serious head trauma and will not be able to skate again.\" Alex thanks the doctor and goes to Zach's room. As Alex stands at the door looking at Zach she makes a promise to herself. A promise to never leave Zach. AN: I just wanted to write this to give a new spin on why Zach left.

Over the loudspeaker the gold medal winners were announced and she watched with a stab of longing as Smilkov and Brushkin skated their victory lap before stopping at the red carpet and ascending the podium. \"Here we go,\" Doug step on to the ice behind her and placed his hand at her waist. The lilting voice of the French announcer rang out again, followed quickly by the voice of the English announcer, \"MÃ©daille d'argent,\" \"Silver medal,\" They pushed off as the French announcer said, \"Moseley et Dorsey\", but the rest of the introduction was drowned out as the crowd surged to its feet and roared. Her head spun and Doug had to keep a firm grasp on her back as she stepped up onto the podium. \"I think they like you,\" the IOC officer, an elderly Indian man, said with a twinkle in his eye, \"But then, your performance was my favorite as well.\" Her hand went to the medal around her neck and she could see her reflection in the highly polished metal. The third place pair was announced and then someone was giving her flowers, but the next think she really was aware of was Doug's voice, \"Man, that must really suck.\" \"What?\" \"It's one thing to not hear your anthem because you came in second, but to win it and then...\" She glanced over at the Russians, who were staring ahead stoically while the Olympic hymn played. \"At least it is our flag up there,\" she finished his thought. \"Yup, and we are the sweethearts of the games,\" he continued, \"Maybe we should kiss again. You know, give the people what they want.\" \"You really are a Neanderthal.\" Notes: For the 1992 Summer and Winter Olympic games six of the former USSR republics competed as The Unified Team.

Because, okay, Matt Lanter is in this ice-skating movie called \"The Cutting Edge 3: Chasing the Dream\" and throughout the whole movie, they make a really big deal out of how his character never stretches properly and how, like, the Pamchenko is a super-deadly move, and there's foreshadowing galore and it gets to the end and SPOILER ALERT: they pull off the move perfectly and everyone lives happily ever after. So, uh, this is how the movie should have ended. \"They're going for the Pamchenko! Flawless so far, perfect form, but wait! Conroy's down, and Delgado - oh!\" A crack, a sickening thud. The camera jerkily closes in on the two skaters, then quickly cuts to commercial. The flowers in Zach's room are overpowering. He wants to get rid of all of them, but somewhere in the back of his mind he knows she'd say it was rude. People care about his recovery, such that it will be, and are just trying to be nice. He rewinds the tape, plays it over. His therapist has tried to take the tape away, but it's being replayed on every major news outlet and sports channel in the world, so it's not like he could escape it anyway. Besides, with all the drugs they've got him on, it all kind of seems like a bad dream. Like any second, he's going to wake up and Alex's neck won't be broken and his right hamstring will still be attached where it's supposed to be, and he won't be having the \"now, Zach, this means you won't be able to skate again,\" conversation with every fucking doctor who comes into his room. Complete hamstring avulsion isn't something seen often, even in athletes of Zach's caliber. But Alex had warned him, hadn't she? She'd tried to get him to stretch better, to ease himself into their new routines, to do what he needed to do to keep his body from so completely betraying him. Even without warming up before their long-form, if he'd just listened to her, maybe he wouldn't be waiting for a surgical specialist to fly in from the States, and maybe Alex wouldn't be dead. The what-ifs are overpowering, and Celeste's visits don't help matters. \"I know how you feel,\" she says, as if her broken ankle can even possibly measure up to the bone-deep bruise and bunched muscles in his knee (\"It snapped right off your pelvis, it came to rest right where your leg would normally bend,\" the doctor had said after the first MRI). As if it could even remotely measure up to killing his partner. He makes her leave the second time it happens, and has never in his entire life felt more alone. \"They're going for the Pamchenko! Flawless so far, perfect form, but wait! Conroy's down, and Delgado - oh!\" A crack, a sickening thud. The camera jerkily closes in on the two skaters, then quickly cuts to commercial. When he wakes up from surgery, Alex's brother is there. He's surprised, sort of, but mostly groggy, and disoriented. He's not sure how long it's been since the accident - long enough for them to bury Alex back home? He expects the other man to hit him. Hell, if he had lost his sister because some golden child shitty-ass athlete couldn't even bother to stretch his fucking leg muscles, he probably would have killed the guy. But he's not dead, and Bobby looks sad, not angry. \"I'm sorry,\" he manages, and talking hurts. Everything hurts, and he looks for the first time, and his leg is up in some sort of harness and he can see his toes but he can't really move them and everything feels swollen and fragile. \"It was an accident,\" Bobby replies, and when Zach wakes up again, he's pretty sure it never really happened. \"They're going for the Pamchenko! Flawless so far, perfect form, but wait! Conroy's down, and Delgado - oh!\" A crack, a sickening thud. The camera jerkily closes in on the two skaters, then quickly cuts to commercial. When he's recovered enough to fly, he and Jackie go back to the States. She wheels him into the middle of his big, empty house and leaves, letting him know that she'll be back to check on him later. He doesn't want to just sit in the fucking chair, so he decides he's going to walk to the kitchen. He can't, and she finds him the next day curled in on himself. She's angry with him, he can tell, and he doesn't blame her. It's his fault, all of it, and he replays the video again and again and again and it's the snap of his muscle and the scream and the crack of her head hitting the ice. His physical therapist is frustrated with him; he won't do it. He can't. He's not going to skate again anyway, so what's the use. His therapist-therapist tries to get him into grief counseling, but she's gone and won't come back, so what's the use. \"They're going for the Pamchenko! Flawless so far, perfect form, but wait! Conroy's down, and Delgado - oh!\" A crack, a sickening thud. The camera jerkily closes in on the two skaters, then quickly cuts to commercial.

Alex could hear Zach behind her as she sprinted into the rink area. She knew they had about two minutes to get on the ice, and she didn't intend to miss it. When she finally reached her destination, she stopped, waiting for Zach. \"Alex, please!\" Zach came up behind her and grabbed her arm. \"No Zach, it's too much.\" She pulled away from him, but he turned her around so that she faced him. \"Okay then, I'll try to make this simple.\" Alex felt like her heart was breaking. \"I love you Alex. I love you. And I'm still waiting for you to answer the first question I ever asked you. Will you skate with me?\" Alex wanted to scream. He loved her! She had loved him for ages, and finally, here he was declaring his love for her. The stupid French guy ruined their moment when he came over and muttered something in French. \"He said take the ice,\" Jackie said helpfully. Alex turned to Zach again, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We're gonna do it!' She said, and skated on to the ice. \"Do what?\" She heard Zach behind her, and he had a suspicious tone in his voice. \"You know, the move!\" They both waved to the crowds and took their positions. \"No Alex, it's too dangerous!\" Zach insisted. \"Look, I didn't come all this way just to buck out. Remember when I said I don't break easily? I wasn't kidding.\" She felt her determined self coming back out again after her display of emotion. They skated beautifully. Their harmony was flawless, both of them reveling in being with each other. At one point, Alex looked down at their intertwined hands and couldn't tell where she left off and he began. \"Ready?\" She heard Zach question as he got into position for the Pamchenko. \"Are you kidding? I've been ready for this moment my whole life!\" Alex smiled, and felt herself be grabbed by the ankles. Zach held her ankles as she flew through the air around him. Finally, he released her, and she spun through the air before he caught her. As their routine came to an end, she smiled at him. \"The answer is yes. I'll skate with you, always.\" Before she could do anything, she saw that adorable smile of his, and their lips met in a sweet kiss. And at that moment, she knew. Dreams do come true.

This is a Cutting Edge story. It is how Will's sister hates Alex, and is likes to show her, but Will won't stand for it. Her name is Kylie Ann and she is 12. She is pretty for her age; she is not dumb but not really smart. She lives with her 23 year old brother, and has for 3 years. Her parents were killed in a car accident, which left Will as her legal guardian. She is a skater, but prefers hockey, and has a Canadian boyfriend. Oh, she hates her brother's new partner, Alex. Here is the story of Will, Kylie, and Alex. \"So you got a new partner?\" I asked my brother as he drove me home from hockey practice. \"Yeah, her name is Alex, and she was a hockey player, you know.\" He smiled as he made the turn to our too big, insanely expensive home. \"She is inside and would love to meet you.\" \"Oh, cool.\" We walk inside and I see her. \"Its you?\" \"Um, hi I'm Alex.\" She introduced slightly confused.\" Do you know me?\" \"No, but is your sister Meghan?\" I asked with disgust. \"Yes, do you know her?\" This time she was more confused. I looked at my brother, \"I have to go to Matt's!\" with that I ran out. You see, Meghan is my enemy. She is a spoiled brat, and I absolutely hate her. First, she started flirting with my awesome boyfriend. Then, she tried out on my hockey team, and made it. She proceeded to tell lies about me to the coach to get me trouble and eventually kicked off the team. So, I hate her and everyone in her family. What was my brother thinking? I mean Alex is pretty, but I thought Will was smart enough to know to look beyond the face. I guess somehow I will have to get Alex to quit, but how that is question. My thoughts were cut off by my phone ringing. \"Hello.\" \"Where are you?\" My brother demanded, and he didn't sound happy. \"I told you I am going to Matt's house!\" Annoyed that he didn't remember or didn't pay attention. \"NO, you are not. Get your butt back over here. You never asked to go, and I am not giving permission for you to go now.\" Wow something must be really bugging him. \"What is your problem? God, you're acting all grumpy!\" probably not the right thing to say to a brother that is getting madder by the second. \"You some come home right now, and apologize to Alex.\" He seemed to have calmed down a little. \"Fine I will come home, but I will not apologize!\" Ha, I told him. \"You will, or you won't be able sit at school tomorrow.\" With that I hung up and ran home. I knew what he meant and it wasn't good. Just because I was 12 and his sister didn't mean Will wouldn't spank me. I stepped in the house and saw Alex standing there. \"Um, I'm sorry for running out that was rude of me. I am Kylie by the way.\" I smiled at her, and then looked at Will, and to my delight he smiled and nodded. \"I know what Meghan did to you, and I am sorry, but I am not my sister, and I hope you will let me prove that. I would love to get to know you, if you would give me a chance.\" I believed it for a minute then I saw her smile at my brother, and he winked at her. \"How dare you! You were going to pretend to get close to me, to get to my brother. You're a bitch, just like your sister! So no I will not give you a chance!\" I quickly responded. How could she? I knew exactly what her plan was, and I was not going to let her get away with it. Then I felt myself get pulled up, and felt a slap on my butt. \"This is nothing to what you are going to get.\" My brother whispered in my ear. Alex took the hint, I think, because she grabbed her bag, and told Will that she would see him tomorrow. And just like that I was all alone to face my brother. \"Go to your room!!\" He yelled. \"I'm sorry, it just came out, and I don't know what I was thinking!\" I pleaded because I knew what was going to happen and I didn't like it at all. \"You are not going to get out of this one, now go!\" he pointed up to my room, and I decided it was best just to listen at this point. I wasn't going to get out of it, and the last thing I wanted was to make it worse. So I went up to my room, sat on my bed and waited. It seemed like an eternity before my brother walked in, but it was really only about three minutes. \"Kylie, I hate doing this, but I do because I love you.\" As he said these words I stared at him, and was shocked at how much he looked like our dad. My memories were cut off when I saw the wooden spoon in his hand. \"Stand up.\" He told me as he sat on my bed. I stood up hoping that this would all be over soon. Then he bent me over his knee, and flipped up my skirt and pulled my boy shorts down. I shuttered as I awaited the first smack, and then it came. SMACK!! SMACK!! SMACK!!! SMACK!!! SMACK!!! Then I started to cry, it hurt so much. \"You are going to get twenty.\" My brother delivered the horrible news. SMACK!!! SMACK!! SMACK!!! SMACK!! SMACK!!! After the tenth I started to kick and fight back, you would to if you had a wooden spoon smacking your ass!! SMACK!!! SMACK!! SMACK!!! SMACK!!! SMACK!!!! \"Please, no more!\" I cried to my brother, I knew this was hard for him to do, so maybe if I asked he would stop. \"Sorry baby, I can't. You deserve every one of these.\" And with that he gave me the last five. SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! And then it was over. He pulled my boy shorts back up and flipped down my skirt. Then he gave me a hug, and I just cried into his chest. \"Shhh. Its okay, it's all over.\" I looked up at him and was sorry I had hurt him. \"I'm sorry, Will.\" \"All right, baby. Let's go watch a movie, okay.\" We walked to the living room and started watching Slap Shot. I snuggled into my big brothers lap and fell asleep; when I woke up in the morning we were in the same position as last night. The spanking still hurt, but it reminded me that my brother loved and cared about me. If you want more review! ","Summary":" Diclaimer, I don't own any of the charcters except Kylie.

As their lips touch for the first time they let out a sigh of relief. They had been holding on to so much, both too stubborn to admit their feelings for one another. Kate's lips and face were delicate, like petals that threated to be squashed at any minute. She smelt warm and sweet in his arms. Her fingers entangled in his hair, struggling to get him closer while Doug's hands on her back and around her waist felt strong and secure, like he would never let go. Abruptly Kate pulled away suddenly remembering where they were. \"Shit! The olympics\" she muttered as Doug realised the same thing. \"Hell of a first kiss\" he replied still smirking. As they skated of the ice hand in hand, reporters flocked to their side, all startled by the kiss and the pamchenko. \"Doug, Kate! It was reported that you were going to be taking the pamchenko out of your routine, why the sudden change in events?\", \"Oh, there was a slight communication error between us\" , she smiled cheekily looking up to Doug who was stifling a laugh, \"but we have that figured out know I suppose.\" Doug couldn't hold it in any longer, he spurted out the water he was drinking at the time after hearing what Kate said and trying not to laugh meant he had almost choked himself.

Their hands so well fitted it was amazing they even came apart. We used to be like that. Me and Alex. My Alex. No. He wasn't mine anymore. That was made certain almost a year ago. Or was it a year ago? I've done such a good job of forgetting that I can't remember. Funny how that happens isn't it? What's even funnier is that I could have happily gone on without remembering, probably forever, if these two hadn't suddenly glided their way into my life, reminding me of everything I had before and would never have again. I imagine it wouldn't have been so bad if Zach hadn't said her name. I could have taught them without feeling a thing if it weren't for that. Alex. Of all names why, why, why did her name have to be Alex? Was God trying to torture me? Rub it in my face that my fairy-tale had a broken glass slipper? And why did I have to watch them play out my story all over again like an old movie? The looks, the touches, the smiles. Everything. It was us all over again and watching them I couldn't help but be pulled back into it. And that kiss. My heart breaks just remembering it. They were so elated. So carefree and unknowing of the pain that they were causing me. How could they? I've never talked about it. I don't need to talk about it. And yet it was always there. Simmering below the surface just waiting for a reason to erupt. That kiss was the end for me. I only thank God that I could pass my tears of as ones of joy instead of pain. Did I really wish that their 'happily ever after' would end as abruptly as mine did? Of course not. But I will admit that I wish mine had ended as beautifully as theirs began. I deserved at least a small amount of pleasure in my life didn't I? I just can't see why that pleasure couldn't be my Alex. The dreams I had that night were of us. The times that we spent training together, learning together. Our first fight out on the beaches of California. My heartbreaking confession and the 'swoosh' of airy elation at winning, not only the Olympics, but the love of my Alex. I awoke in tears. The pain in my heart was so fresh, so tender, even after all this time. The wounds I had buried so deeply beneath false strength and brisk confidence had never healed. Even after almost a year of separation. Why did we separate? Where had things gone wrong? It was a fight, I remember that much. I think it had something to do with skating. The memories flashed through my mind unbidden; of the fall I took in the World Championship last spring. I fell hard coming out of a lift. It was stupid really; it was a lift that Alex and I had done a hundred times in competition and a thousand more in practice. I couldn't begin to tell you how it went wrong. Even now I don't know. But I do know that Alex never forgave himself. He apologized so many times, again and again, until finally we started to fight. I started it, I'll admit, but I was just so sick of him saying he was sorry. It was an accident. And an unpleasant combination of just the right coincidences. I landed on my side from over a five foot fall and my elbow was in just the right position; against a stress point on my ribs is what the doctor's said. Two of them broke and a third one was partially fractured. It was hard for me, at first, to realize I could never skate professionally again but even as I retired from my illustrious career I didn't have any regrets. I did what I set out to do, and what's better is that I did it with Alex by my side. Having him there is what kept me sane. So why, how , had it ended so badly? Not even two months after the accident Alex and I were separated. Divorced. Ugh, I hate that word. It's so final. Soâ¦unforgiving. And what a stupid reason we had for it. Because he said sorry? Because I got hurt? Funny, I always thought that hardships were supposed to strengthen a relationship. That's how it always worked for my parents. There was a knock on my door and I belatedly realized it was already morning. The sun had risen over Paris and I didn't even so much as care. After all, since almost a year ago my life had been on a permanent sunset. If I'm always facing west it would be impossible to see what was coming from the east. I pushed aside my blanket and did my best to stretch out my tired, sore muscles. It was probably Zach andâ¦Alex. Alejandra. We were supposed to have a celebratory victory breakfast this morning before they left to do whatever couples do after professing their love for each other on the ice the day before. Something I'm perfectly aware of but would rather not be reminded of at the moment. Another knock and I shook my head remembering where I was and what I was doing. Not bothering to dress, it was probably just Alex anyway, I rubbed the puffy bags beneath my eyes, hoping they wouldn't to obviously give away my restless night and crossed the room to the door. I was right about one thing, it was Alex. It was just the wrong Alex. What is a girl to do when her handsome, shy smiled, bright-eyed ex-husband knocks on the door of her hotel room more then halfway around the world from where he should be? Well, this girl slammed the door. Or I tried to at least. I tried to take satisfaction in the grunt of pain that came when Alex used his foot as a door jam but I was to busy fretting about the fact that my hair wasn't combed, my teeth weren't brushed, and, for goodness sake, I wasn't even wearing a bra. All of which were positions Alex had seen me in before, but it was different then. I had a ring on my finger. Well, on the right finger. Yes, I still wear my wedding ring. It's stupid I know, especially after it's been almost a year (have I said that already?) but I just couldn't give it up. Judging by the flash of gold on Alex's left middle finger it seems like he feels the same way. Oh, please, please let him feel the same way. \"What are you doing here?\" I said, my voice all distance and ice and I hated it. \"Aren't you supposed to be on a half pipe somewhere?\" \"Funny story about that,\" Alex said, a shyâdare I say nervous?âsmile on his face. \"It seems like my agent didn't much care for me jumping on the first plane to Paris last night from Florida. Looks like I'll have to hang up another pair of skates.\" \"Why?\" I said. \"What reason could you possibly have to come here, now, of all times?\" Silence. It's the most terrifying thing a person could ever here. Why is it so quiet? Isn't he breathing? Aren't I? Oh, no, I'm not actually. I forgot how to once my Alex walked back into my life. \"I saw the program yesterday.\" His sudden response almost startled me but I managed to hide it well. \"Oh yeah?\" I said, doing my best to appear nonchalant. \"Well it was a good one to see. The skaters all did wellâ.\" \"You know what I mean Jackie.\" Of course I did. But that doesn't mean I have to admit it. \"I'm afraid I don't.\" I said, the ice back in my voice. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a breakfast to get ready for.\" \"Not anymore.\" Alex said. \"I'm afraid you cancelled. You see, there was this guy that was looking for you down in the lobby and your nice little protÃ©gÃ©, Zach, was considerate enough to send him up to your room. Not to mention give you some time alone to talk to him.\" \"I have nothing to say.\" \"Is that right?\" I threw my hands up in exasperation, tears once again rimming my eyes even as I did my best to hide them. \"What do you want me to say Alex?\" I said. \"That it was stupid and wrong to leave like I did? That I miss you and love you and want to be with you again? Do you honestly expect me, of all people, to just fall into your arms and forget everything that we said to just start over where we ended?\" \"No,\" Alex said, and my heart dropped. I would have; I knew that. At that very moment I would have dropped to my knees and begged him to forgive me, to take me back. I would have done anything and everything for him if he had just asked me too. The sound of my breaking heart was almost loud enough to block out the sound of Alex's knees hitting the floor. Almost; but not quite. My eyes were wide in surprise, the tears still falling as I looked down into the deep, sorrowful depths of Alex's eyes. My Alex. Always mine. Why did I give him up? \"I don't want you to say any of that,\" Alex said. \"Because then you wouldn't be able to hear me say it instead.\" My mouth dropped in shock and more tears overflowed. What did he just say? \"I'm so sorry Jackie. For everything. For the accident, for the arguments, for every word I ever said that made you think you had to get away. But mostly I'm sorry for not stopping you; for not saying what it was I wanted to say that day.\" \"A-and what's that?\" I said, hoping, but not daring to believe. \"That I'm madly in love with you.\" He said, and my heart stopped. \"I love you Jackie, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" Suddenly I was back to five years ago with the crowds and the music and the victory all fresh in my ears. I was being cradled in his arms once again, his smile so bright I could have gone blind. \"Yes!\" I said, not even aware of my own words but still wanting them to be said. \"The answer to everything is yes!\" And then I dropped to my knees in front of him and threw my arms around his neck. I hugged him close as I cried and I knew, by the tremble in his shoulders, that he was crying too. \"I'm so sorry!\" I said. \"So, so sorry!\" Several more minutes passed by before our sobs finally quieted and our tears finally dried, but still we held each other; unwilling to let go. \"So is this the part where we start over where we ended?\" Alex asked, and despite myself I pulled away. \"I did say my answer to everything was 'yes'.\" I said it shyly. I was afraid; terrified even. What would he say? \"I'm glad,\" Alex said, as he took the ring off my middle finger and moved it back to its proper place. \"Skating singles is really lonely.\" I laughed once but it came out as more of a sob and I dropped into his arms once again. \"It is,\" I said. \"It really, really is.\" Kaliea: I'll admit that I didn't watch the entire thing of the third cutting edge. Just the important parts. But I was really upset about Jackie and Alex's divorce. I mean, what the heck? People watch movies for a 'happily every after', not a 'well it sucks that didn't work out'.

For LadyFest 2010. Spontaneity is not a word in Kate's vocabulary (well, it is, but not in the euphemistic way where it means she constantly does it). She's had tutors her entire life, tutors on a schedule who bill hourly, therefore, Kate, for daddy's sake, you have to be in this room at this time for geometry for x amount of hours five days out of the week. Fine. There's skating, then, which devours more of her life than she sometimes wished it would. Skating six days a week, five hours a day. But skating is only half of it. There are ballet lessons to ensure that her death spirals are always a delightfully whimsical thirty-eight degrees from the flat plane of the ice (there's that pesky geometry again), weight training to keep her toned and fit enough to try and attempt to be said amount of flexible, and finally, an hour's worth of cardio. This balances out her week. There are facts and figures, statistics, numbers, calculations involved in every minute of her day. When she goes to work with Coach, it is always crazy drunken Russian counting, raz and dva and things she would care not to study. 1988, Calgary. Time, place. Game, set, match. She has a partner (not a particularly good one, she might add) and they make their way through the ranks so that by the time they're up for the scheduled free skate (ticking clocks, every minute, every hour), she is calm. She is collected. She is ready. When they finish, she is prepared to tear every inch of flesh off of Brian herself. Turns out, Calgary is not the place. 1988 is not the time. - In 1992, it is her last chance. Or it feels like her last chance. She has run out of partners, out of patience, and it seems, out of time. People are talking. Isn't Kate Mosley near retirement age by now? Well, they can all kindly go fuck themselves. Kate Mosley is here and her double axel is solid and consistent and clean, thank you very much, which is more than she can say for Lorie Peckarovski. Who the hell spells Lorie with an 'e' on the end anyway? 1992 is the time, Albertville is the place. Doug is the guy. - So, it turns out Doug's the guy for more than just winning Olympic gold. Which they haven't done yet, because they did what could qualify as an illegal move and the International Skating Union just serves to piss Kate off on a daily basis so if they don't win the gold and they go home empty handed, she's going to go vandalize their table before retirement. Okay. That might have been nerves talking. But still, it's nerve wracking, sitting in the kiss-and-cry as the judges all look bewildered back and forth and Doug is holding her hands and shaking them and his nervousness is making her nervous so she just snaps, \"Would you please stop doing that?\" And he just looks at her with that dumb mulish slack-jawed look. \"Stop doing what?\" \"Shaking your hands.\" \"Oh,\" he says. \"Sorry.\" Which, of course, makes her feel terrible because he's confessed his love for her not that long ago and she said it back not that long ago and they finished skating their fucking program not that long ago so if it wouldn't trouble the judge from Italy too much, could they please have their scores sometime this century? Doug sets his hand on top of hers to try and be reassuring and he says, \"We got this, Kate. We have to have.\" And she thinks, god, if only it could be that audience reaction determined the fate of the Olympic pairs competitors. The ISU does not like her and the feeling is mutual and if she somehow loses because of this, she will shank people with the blade of her skate before the night is over. Okay. That might have been the anticipation talking. But then the technical scores come up and then the presentations, and three perfect sixes, they got three perfect sixes and she is kind of stunned but Anton claps her on the back and Doug has got his arms around her neck and she's having a little trouble breathing and she feels a little dizzy and she knows her mouth is hanging open but she can't really get around to fixing that right now. - It doesn't feel real. It doesn't feel real until she is being handed bouquets on the platform and the head of the committee is placing a medal around her neck. 1992 - this was the time, this was the place.

My best friend, Jane, was sitting at the desk next to me, playing Sims on her computer, and my evil boss was in her office across the hall. This was my life every day, boring and dull. Liven Books was the most popular publishing company in the country. I hung up with the client on the phone and turned to Jane. \"Do you think our lives will ever be exciting?\" I asked. She rolled her eyes, \"You had your chance for excitement, Anna, but you gave it up for all of this.\" Jane pointed around the office. I sighed, agreeing with her. I used to be a figure skater, and an awesome one at that. But after a while, all of the publicity and spotlight got to me. Sometimes, I do regret giving it up, but I wasn't happy anymore. \"Anna, where are you!\" A shrill voice called. I stood up and walked to her desk, \"Yes, Marie?\" I asked in a sweet voice. \"Did you set up that meeting with Leah Lakers?\" She asked, not even bothering to look up from her computer. \"Yes, she said she'll be here March 23rd at 3:30.\" I said. \"Splendid! We'll need you here as well, Anna, and if you play your cards right, you could get promoted.\" She said, still not looking up. I smiled and started thinking about what that would be like, a huge office, with my own assistant. \"Hello? What are you still doing here?\" Marie said, glaring at you. \"Sorry, I'll just be leaving.\" I said, walking out. My phone rang, \"Hello, Liven Books, how may I direct your call?\" I recited. \"Hey there, Anna!\" a deep voice said. \"Oh, hey dad, what's up?\" I asked. \"So guess who I ran into today?\" He said. \"Who did you run into?\" I asked, cautiously. \"Have you ever heard of Luke McCarthy?\" My dad asked. \"Yeah, the hockey player, right? I've seen him all over TV\" I said. \"Well, I ran into his coach today, and he said that Luke wants to get into figure skating and he asked if I knew anyone.\" He said, excitedly. My mouth fell open, \"What does this mean?\" I asked. \"This means that you're meeting with Luke and his coach today at 3:30 to discuss the possibility of the two of you skating together! Isn't that great?\" He asked. \"Dad, are you kidding me? I hate when you make decisions for me like I'm a little kid! I am 22 years old!\" I said, getting mad. Jane shot me a look; I shrugged and rolled my eyes. \"Fine, I will go to the rink at 3:30, but it's no guarantee that I'm going to skate with him, bye dad.\" I threw the phone down and sighed, loudly. \"Your dad wants you to skate again, doesn't he?\" She asked, smirking. I threw my pen at her, and put my head on my desk. Luke's P.O.V \"So did you talk to her father about getting her to skate?\" I asked Steve, my hockey coach. He nodded, \"Yeah, and he said she would meet us at 3:30 to discuss things!\" He said, high-fiving me. I smiled, and looked back down at the pictures of her. \"I've seen her skate before, she's pretty good.\" I said. \"Yeah, and this will put your career back on track as more than just bad boy with a head as hard as a hockey puck.\" Steve said, smirking. \"Very funny, but what am I supposed to tell her? That I'm using her to make me look good?\" I asked. \"No, tell her that you want to give figure skating a try, simple as that!\" He said, walking out. I sighed, going to get ready to go meet this girl. Anna's P.O.V I walked into the ice skating rink with my head held high. When I looked around, memories flooded my mind, all of the lessons I took, waking up at 5:45 every morning and the competitions. I hadn't been to an ice skating rink in years, yet it was all very familiar. My dad waved me over, \"Ah, Anastasia, there you are, you're late!\" he scolded. \"Yeah, sorry, I was late getting out of work.\" I took my father's hand as he pulled me over to when two men sat. One, older and almost bald, the other extremely good looking. That must be Luke, I thought to myself. \"Gentlemen, this is my daughter, Anna. Anna, this is Luke and Steve Jones, Luke's coach.\" My father said, proudly. \"Hi, it's really nice to meet you.\" I said politely, even though inside, I wanted to smack both of them. Luke looked me up and down, as if checking me out. I wanted so badly to gag, but instead I just rolled my eyes. I saw down, and for the next two hours, we talked about skating and what was going to happen in the future. Luke kept eyeing me the whole time, I had a feeling he was more into me than the skating. \"We'll leave you two to get to know each other.\" Steve said. I nodded and waved at my dad. When they were gone, I turned to Luke. \"Look, I don't know how serious you are about skating, but let me tell you, skating used to be my life! So if I get back into this, I'm not going to put up with your crap, you understand me!\" I said. He just stared blankly at me. \"Oh my goodness, what are you staring at?\" I shouted. \"I was just imagining what you would look like in one of those cute skating dresses, or whatever they're called.\" He said, winking. \"Ugh, you're disgusting.\" I got up and walked toward the door. \"See you tomorrow!\" He called. Don't turn around, don't turn around, I said to myself. I walked out to my car and sat there for a few minutes. \"Oh crap.\" I said to myself. What did I just get myself into? Love it? Hate it? Let me know (a review would be nice =D) The next chapter should be up tomorrow![Chapter 2] Anna's P.O.V I walked into work the next day, barely keeping my eyes open. I didn't get home last night until close to 12:30, due to my father insisting that we go celebrate. \"Good morning, Jane.\" I sighed. \"Hey, Anna, how did it go last night?\" Jane smirked. I rolled my eyes, \"I think I'm making a mistake. I mean, I obviously quit for a reason...maybe getting back into skating is a bad idea.\" I said. \"Obviously, it was brought back into your life for a reason. I'm sure once you get back into it, you'll feel like you're at home again! By the way, who's your partner going to be?\" She asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Jake McCarthy...he's a-\"I didn't finish my sentence because I was cut off my Jane's squeals. \"You mean Jake McCarthy as in sexy hockey player, Jake McCarthy?\" Jane said, turning her computer in my direction, revealing multiple pictures of Jake, most of which were him shirtless. I scoffed, shaking my head. \"What are you scoffing for, he's hot.\" She mumbled. Jake's P.O.V \"Jake, what is it like getting into figure skating?\" \"Kayla, how do you feel about this?\" I sighed, as I walked into the front doors of my apartment building. My girlfriend, Kayla, was running up behind me. \"Jake, wait, don't go so fast!\" She said in that annoying voice I hate. I really only kept her around for convenience. She makes my image look a little bit better than it is. If it were up to me, I would've gotten rid of her long ago. \"So, this Anna girl, is she pretty?\" Kayla asked when we got into my apartment. I looked at her; did she really just ask me that? \"Why does it matter?\" I asked. \"I just want to know if she's pretty!\" Kayla said. \"She okay, I guess.\" I shrugged. \"Oh...well, okay then.\" She leaned in to kiss me, but I just stood up off the couch and went into the kitchen. \"Hockey's biggest bad boy says no to a kiss? What a shock!\" She muttered. \"Shut up, Kayla! Just shut up! I am so sick of you and your little comments!\" I snapped. She gasped, \"What are you saying?\" Is she really that dumb? \"We. Are. Over.\" I said, slowly. \"Are you breaking up with me?\" She cried. \"Uh...yeah, I think so!\" I said. \"Just know this, Jake McCarthy! You will never find anyone as good as me!\" She gave a little squeal, and ran out. I sighed in relief, and leaned against the counter. I took my phone out of my pocket and looked through my contacts, stopping on one in particular. \"Hey, Anna...it's Jake!\" Anna's P.O.V \"Y'know, I was a little bit surprised, that out of all of your famous friends, you called me.\" I said, sipping my coffee. Jake had called me and asked me to meet him for coffee. \"Well, I thought since we have to deal with each other every day starting next weeks, we should get to know each other.\" Jake said, grinning. I laughed, and nodded. \"So, tell me about you.\" I offered. \"What do you want to know?\" He asked. \"Hmm...how did you get into hockey?\" I asked. \"Well, my parents split when I was 10, so I had a lot of alone time. One of my dad's assistants played hockey, so he taught me how to play. I remember going outside every morning, and playing until sundown. Let's just say, my family was never close, so I don't think anyone was looking for me.\" He said, looking down. It was silent for a few minutes. \"So, what about you, I mean before you got to the rink yesterday, all your dad could talk about were how proud he is of you. How did you get into skating?\" He asked. \"My mom was a dancer before she died, and I wanted to continue the \"legacy\" if you could call it that. I don't know, it was like, when I got on the ice, I felt at home. I woke up at 5:45 every morning for practice, went on these crazy diets, and worked my ass off to achieve success.\" I sighed. \"Why did you quit?\" Jake asked. \"I just wasn't happy, anymore. There was no...\" I couldn't think of the correct word. \"There was no spark?\" Jake asked, raising an eyebrow. I grinned, \"Yeah, there was no spark.\" We smiled at eachother. I looked at my phone. \"Crap, I have to get back to work. I'll see you at the rink tomorrow?\" I asked, hopefully. He nodded and laughed at the edge in my voice. As I was walking out I looked back, \"Hey, Jake, I was wrong about you.\" I said. He gave me a confused look. \"There's so much more to you than meets the eye.\" I smiled. He laughed, \"Thanks, I think.\" I winked at walked out to my car. Jake was really awesome, and sweet. He was nothing like the image he portrays in public. He's different from any other guy I've known. Jake's P.O.V I hung around the cafÃ© for a little bit, staring mindlessly into space. Anna was a really cool girl. I was wrong about her too. She knows what she wants out of life, and she doesn't let people walk all over her. She's different from any other girl I've know. Jake AND Anna's P.O.V I'm pretty sure I walked around all day, with a huge smile on my face. Okay, I love this chapter! Look out for the next chapter within the week![Chapter 3] Jake's P.O.V I opened the door to my apartment with a huge smile on my face. I had only known Anna for a day, and yet there was something about her, something that saw me as a real person. I went to check my house phone. I had 17 missed calls. I sighed, and pressed play to listen to the messages. \"Baby, please...we can work this out. I'm sorry for whatever I said!\" Kayla's voice said, sobbing. There were 16 of those...the last message is what interested me. \"Jacob Matthew McCarthy, if you don't call me back by 5:00, I will call Steve and make sure he gives you hell for dumping me.\" I looked at the clock. 5:45, \"Crap.\" I muttered. Bang, Bang, Bang. I sighed and walked to the door. As soon as I opened it, Steve came barreling in. \"Are you freaking kidding me, Jake? You broke up with her!\" He shouted. \"Do you even realize how annoying she is? This break up was long overdue, dude.\" I said, shrugging. \"Well, dude ,\" he said mocking me, \"Do you even realize how this will affect your image? What are you supposed to do now?\" At this point, I really didn't care. I stayed silent, glaring at him. Steve sighed, and then his head snapped up. \"Oh my goodness, that's perfect!\" He said to himself. I raised an eyebrow, now listening to what he had to say. \"What are you thinking?\" I asked, warily. \"You're right; you need something new, something fresh...something innocent.\"He said, grinning. \"Ok, I have no clue what you're talking about...\" I shrugged. \"Let me clue you in...Anna.\"He said, his grin turning into a huge smile. \"Whoa, no, uh-uh...I'm not using Anna to get publicity.\" I said, shaking my head. \"Why does it matter, Jake, really? You just met her yesterday...so what does it matter if we use her for a little bit?\" I sighed, and shook my head again. \"Listen Jake, you better do this, or I swear I will make sure your career goes down the drain, that's including Anna's. So take this deal, or everything you've worked your ass off for will be finished.\" He said, turning for the door. \"Fine, I'll go with whatever little scheme you have, but only for my career.\" I said, sighing. \"Ha-ha, great! Call her up, ask her out for drinks or something, just make her fall for you!\" He said, walking out. I threw my hands over my head; this is going to end very badly. Anna's P.O.V I walked to my desk in a daze; there was something about Jake that made me smile. \"Hey miss thing...how was your 'date'?\" Jane asked, smirking. I rolled my eyes, \"it wasn't a date!\" I said. \"Ok, so a super sexy athlete asks you to coffee. I think that's a date!\" She said. I laughed, \"Okay, maybe.\" She squealed and clapped her hands. \"Tell me everything.\" She said. \"He's the sweetest guy, he told me about his childhood and about how that whole bad boy image isn't the real person that he is! It was amazing.\" I sighed. \"Aww, so are you going to see him again?\" Jane asked. \"Well, I have to be at the rink tomorrow after work so yeah.\" I said, smiling. \"Anna, get in here.\" Marie yelled. I sighed, and walked into her office. \"Yes, Marie?\" I asked, quietly. \"I asked you to email me your story idea, and instead, you email me this crap!\" She shoved my paper at me. \"This is my...story idea.\" I squeaked. \"Yeah, well it's terrible, go write me something else!\" She yelled. I nodded and ran out. I went to my desk, and saw Jane smiling at me. I raised an eyebrow, as she pointed to my desk. There was a note: \" Anna, meet me for drinks? Give me a call.-Jake\" I grabbed my phone, and dialed him number. Jane gave me a thumbs-up and I grinned. \"Hello?\" A voice answered. \"Hey, Jake, drinks sound great!\" Like it? Hate it? Let me know!

I loved it, but the ending was just too sad for me! I needed a happy fuzzy ending. So this is it! This is my first film fic, so please be gentle. ;) Jo xx Nelson stared out over the city, grasping the ends of the scarf that was tied around his neck. He'd lost her. She'd persuaded him to give up everything he had - or in some cases didn't have - and now he'd lost her too. He didn't want those other things back now, just Sara. Sara Deeva. That name would be with him forever. She'd left him so that he could have a life, but without her he had nothing. Still holding onto the scarf tightly he turned away from the city, and began to walk home. But where was home? He couldn't go back to the flat with ten TVs, it felt wrong now. He didn't belong there. Who needed that many TVs anyway? Home was the messy little flat, with that crazy dog, Abner across the street, a cross-dresser downstairs. And Sara. He didn't want to believe she'd actually gone. Still he held the scarf tightly. Something she'd left for him, a reminder of the times they'd spent together. Those evenings chasing her around the flat, blindfolded, had been crazy. To start with he'd had little success, but soon he was able to find her. 'Just use your instincts,' she'd told him. 'Just use your instincts.' Nelson unwound the scarf from around his neck and stared at it. He could find her. He would find her. No matter what it took, he knew that his instincts would be enough to lead him back to Sara. *** Nelson knocked firmly on the door to the house. It had taken him a while, but he hoped that he'd found her. The chill wind of late December whipped around him as he waited for someone to open the door. After what seemed like forever the door crept open, revealing a pale, thin Sara. \"Nelson.\" She stared at him, shocked. \"Can I come in?\" he asked immediately. She stood still, unable to answer him. \"Sara, who is it?\" a female voice called from inside. \"No one Mum,\" Sara replied, quietly. \"Then shut the door, you shouldn't be out in the cold, the doctor said so.\" \"Can I come in?\" Nelson asked again, staring at the woman before him. He noticed the front door open at the next house, and a man stepped out. \"Hey, guess what?\" he said, turning to the man. \"We've got a load of porn videos upstairs, do you want to come up and watch with us? We could make a night of it.\" \"Nelson, what are you doing?!\" Sara exclaimed, staring at him. \"Let me in?\" She nodded, stepping aside and letting him into the house. \"Sorry Mr. Rogers,\" she apologised, before closing the door quickly. \"That's my neighbour Nelson! What were you doing?\" \"Taking a leaf out of your book,\" he replied, looking her up and down. \"Right,\" she said, remembering that time at his apartment building. \"Why are you here?\" \"I couldn't leave it how it was.\" He pulled the scarf out of his coat pocket. \"I couldn't stand the thought of never seeing you again. So I used my instincts.\" He passed her the scarf. \"You want this back? It was always your favourite.\" She quietly took the scarf, eyeing him cautiously. \"I left you Nelson.\" \"And I've come back.\" He took her hands in his. \"I fell in love with you Sara Deeva, I can't be another day without you. This month while I was trying to find you has been the longest month of my life. I don't need TVs, or cars or a big job anymore, you helped me to see that, I...\" \"You were my November.

Her mother looked at them cautiously, before turning and going up the stairs. \"This is not reality,\" he stated once again, more quietly. \"Reality is, I love you. And I know you love me. Face that reality!\" \"November, you were November,\" she whispered, tears beginning to trickle down her face. She looked up at him. \"You were November.\" \"I know.\" He took her hands once again. \"But let me be forever.\" He stared into her eyes, willing her to reply. \"Forever,\" she whispered, falling happily into his arms and holding onto him tightly as the tears continued to fall.

The movie is sappy-sweet, and yet, surprisingly hard to resist. The fanfiction is difficult to explain, except for I was curious about how an aloof British box-maker took to plumbing. Thirty Days Hath Charlie doesn't particularly like to be reminded of his innate, sensible Britishness by way of her blatant, carefree Americanisms, but it appears, sometimes, that neither of them can help it. Case in point: she wants him to help her with a plumbing call, but it's obviously going to take a bit of explanation. They haven't even gotten out the front doorâ they're still mired elbows-deep in her once-neat toolbox. He purses his lips. \"Tell me again, now.\" She tilts her head up to look at him, one eye squinting. \"You're pouting, Charlie.\" \"It's not a pout,\" he informs her with great dignity. \"My lips naturally look this way.\" She still thinks he's being sulky; it's evident in the resigned way she looks at him. \"It's a wrench.\" \"It's a spanner,\" he contradicts, gently. \"Spanner is some sort of British slang for wrench, then.\" He backs off a step or two and makes the sound of a buzzer, briefly obnoxious. \"Wrong, Miss Deever! All answers must be couched in the form of a question. Care to try again?\" She doesn't. She just takes the maligned spanner from him and puts it into the nearly empty toolbox. \"What do you call this, then?\" he asks, moving on to a ball-peen hammer. \"A pounder? A chicken-sticker? Santa Claus?\" \"I would have thought you'd say 'Father Christmas.'\" Not since she asked him if were his real accent or if he affected it 'cause he was pompous has her tone been so carelessly insulting. Charlie can hear her irritationâ she doesn't bother hide what she was feeling. Most of the time. It's her realness, her utter uncompromising truthfulness that makes him smile now, and reach for her. \"Oh Sara, Sara,\" he murmurs in her hair, wrapping one lanky arm around her and holding the hammer up in front of them. \"I'm not a complete git, you know. So don't you go thinking that I am.\" \"I don't know what that is.\" She takes the hammer from him and smooths a thumb over the rounded head. \"Well, it probably fits in with what you call my 'Wisenheimer remarks.'\" His tone is airy, his eyes lifted heavenwards, while his hands play with her hair. \"Oh yes.\" A slight frown; she sets the hammer neatly in the toolbox. \"I did hope you'd finished with those, Charlie.\" \"Mr. Charles Blake,\" he says, releasing her and groping amidst the tools littering the table till he locates a screwdriver, the handle of which is wrapped round about with bicycle tape. \"Wisenheimer and plumber extraordinaire.\" \"You haven't plumbed anything yet,\" she objects, snatching likewise at the screwdriver to lay it to rest among its fellows in the toolbox. He waves his hands exaggeratedly. \"Only the depths of the human soul, Sara. The deeps of abject misery, the heights of extreme joy, the wonder and the pity of every girl and boy.\" She beams, laughs. He's surprised it out of her. He's surprised himself ; he grins, briefly, toothily. \"Oh, Charlie, Charlie.\" \"Oh, Sara, Sara.\" \"Oh, Charlie, I know what you are.\" She bites her lip. \"You are a poet, and did not know it.\" One hand goes up to cover her giggle. He wraps distracted fingers around it, abjectly, and pulls it back down to disclose even white teeth. \"It's coming out of you, it's coming back to you. Little by little.\" \"I think I am a fisherman, to fish upon the sea,\" says Charlie winsomely. \"From bigger fish little 'uns run, and they run straight to me.\" She applauds him. \"Not quite topical. But that can be forgiven.\" \"Use Bryce Ice!\" Charlie goes on, now with added enthusiasm. \"It makes your Spice twice as nice!\" Sara's smile fades. \"Now, Charlie,\" she admonishes, \"culling from the Colgate Comedy Hour isn't admissible.\" Charlie's smile turns beatific as he pulls her towards him again. \"How about pulling â pulling from the Darling Deever's Domesticated Delight? At three in the afternoon, no less.\" \"I've got to get rid of that watch of yours.\" \"But I shall miss it so. Saraâ\" \"Nonsense, Charlie.\" She slaps his hands away. \"Concentrate on the matter at hand.\" \"I'm trying to, baby.\" His attempt at an American accent falls flat. \"Charlieâ\" She struggles, only a little but it's plenty enough to dim his ardor. \"If I may remind you, you were about to get a lesson in plumbing.\" \"Yes, butâ\" \"Nowâ now Charlie, remember, we've got a time limit on things. You know?\" It takes him a moment to realize she means, not the plumbing call, but the month itself. \"Of course,\" he says, resigned somewhat. \"But it is only the sixth of November, Sara, and you've already accomplished so much. Shouldn't you be, I don't know, resting on your laurels, so to speak? I mean, you've already got me in trousers made from processed jerky.\" \"Regardless of the date, we'veâ we've no time to lose. And they're not jerky.\" \"What's not?\" He blinks. \"The pants. They're made from leather.\" \"Funny,\" says Charlie, looking down at himself. \"They taste like jerky.\" \"Oh, they do not .\" She hits him lightly on the shoulder, with the back of her hand. \"Now pay attention. When you have an emergencyâ\" \"Coffee grounds into the drain. Espresso,\" Charlie grouses. She takes a moment and looks at him, slouched at her side like a puppet with the strings cut. The thick sweater she chose for him gives him a curiously hunched look, like his shoulders are encroaching on his neck. On his calmly petulant faceâ calm at the moment, anywayâ his thin mouth curves down, his grey eyes under heavy brows are directed at the floor. Sara softens a little. She has done good work, and Charlie has been a very good boy, so far. \"I haveâ a question for you.\" \"Mmph.\" \"In England, Charlieâ in England, what do they callâ\" She pushes up to him, delicate little hands laid on his shoulders over the much-hated sweater, delicate little mouth on his. He stands for a moment with hands in pockets, then relaxes into her, spreads his fingers in a span over her back and loosens all over. When she lets him go his dark eyes are undeniably twinkling. \"That,\" he says deliberately, \"is the same in any language, Miss Deever.\" She tugs on his hand. \"Come on, Mr. Blake. And don't forget the toolbox. We've got a drain to rescue.\" \"Emergency, emergency,\" hums Charlie, gathering tools and getting tangled in bicycle tape. \"My love has an emergencyâ \" He shuts the door neatly behind them.

O quarto parecia deserto, sem nenhum movimento, sem nenhum barulho. O caos e a bagunÃ§a prevaleciam no ambiente, na escrivaninha, livros jogados ao lado do computar ligado, roupas empilhadas em um canto do quarto, um violÃ£o em cima de mil partituras, DVDs empilhados em uma estante e por fim uma cama com uma menina escondida em meio as cobertas. Quando, de repente, o telefone comeÃ§a a tocar com um som alto que acorda a menina. - Hum...Que merda Ã© essa? â Murmurou a garota sonolenta olhando para o relÃ³gio â Ah, fala sÃ©rio... 7 da manhÃ£, ninguÃ©m merece. â disse levantando da cama e procurando o telefone no meio da pilha de roupas. Enquanto a menina procurava o telefone que jÃ¡ parara de tocar, alguÃ©m bate a porta de seu quarto e diz: -Filha, telefone pra vocÃª â Disse a voz do lado de fora do aposento â Ã a Sofia, quer falar com vocÃª, pode atender? - Ta bom mÃ£e, fala pra ela esperar sÃ³ um minuto â Gritou a menina deixando a pilha de roupas e revirando as cobertas procurando o telefone. â Finalmente! â Exclamou aliviada ao encontrar o aparelho e atendendo logo em seguida. - AlÃ´! â Disse a menina. SARA â exclamou Sofia â Mas que demora pra atender!Eu te acordei? NÃ£o Sofia, eu acordo todo dia as 7 da manhÃ£ nos sÃ¡bados depois de ir dormir Ã¡s 5 por livre e espontÃ¢nea vontade â Exclamou Sara com tom irÃ´nico mas ainda sonolento. Desculpa SÃ¡, Ã© realmente importante â disse em um tom mais sÃ©rio â Lembra daquilo que tÃ­nhamos planejado fazer no colÃ©gio? Lembro sim, alguÃ©m descobriu? â perguntou Sara que passara a ficar mais atenta e acordada com a mudanÃ§a de assunto. NÃ£o â disse Sofia. UÃ©, entÃ£o qual Ã© o problema? â perguntou Sara curiosa. Vamos ter um probleminha â disse dando uma pausa e continuando a falar â Ã que quase descobriram...Mas nÃ£o hÃ¡ nada pra se preocupar sÃ³ teremos que mudar o plano â disse rapidamente antes que Sara interrompesse. Certo â disse Sara pensando â Vamos resolver isso...hum... mas nÃ£o agora, melhor fazermos isso nÃ£o no telefone. â concluiu. Ta ok â aceitou Sofia â JÃ¡ liguei para a Pandora e marquei de irmos ao Shopping hoje ver alguma coisa, quer ir? Podemos resolver isso lÃ¡. Vou sim â disse Sara â Nossa, se vocÃª ligou pra mim Ã¡s 7 que horas vocÃª ligou para a Dora? â perguntou com a sobrancelha erguida. Hahahaha â riu Sofia â Liguei mais cedo. Mas me arrependi, porque deu pra sentir a fÃºria da Pandora de longe por ser acordada. NÃ£o Ã© pra menos nÃ© SofÃ­? â Riu Sara mais ainda.- Bom, vou indo, nos vemos mais tarde. Que horas? As 8 da noite â respondeu Sofia. â Eu passo na tua casa e encontramos a Pandora lÃ¡. Ta certo entÃ£o...BeijÃ£o! Tchau SÃ¡! Ao desligar,Sara fitou o telefone por um instante e olhou deprimida para seu quarto e pensou consigo mesma \"Ã,realmente, preciso arrumar meu quarto\". Quando faltava 5 minutos para as 8 horas, a campainha da casa de Sara toca. Tchau mÃ£e! Deve ser a Sofia â gritou Sara descendo as escadas vestindo seu moletom rapidamente. Filha por favor nÃ£o chegue tarde, vocÃª sabe como as coisas andam perigosas nos dias de hoje. â Exclamou a mÃ£e na cozinha. Sara virou os olhos. Ta certo mÃ£e â disse dirigindo-se a porta, atÃ© ser impedida por sua mÃ£e gritando. Filha, tem certeza que nÃ£o quer comer nada antes de ir!? Sim mÃ£e â Respondeu irritada, mas ao mesmo tempo rindo. Sua mÃ£e nunca havia sido tÃ£o protetora como agora, o motivo dessa preocupaÃ§Ã£o exagerada foi pela perda de uma de suas primas ao ser assaltada uma noite ao voltar para casa.Sara entendia que tinha que ser mais paciente com sua mÃ£e, mas essa proteÃ§Ã£o intensa irritava-a muito. E por fim concluiu â To indo mÃ£e, pode deixar que eu vou me cuidar. Sara correu atÃ© a porta prestes a esmurrar a pessoa do outro lado por tocar a campainha sem piedade. VocÃª quer parar com isso? â Disse Sara a Sofia quando abriu a porta.- VocÃª por acaso estÃ¡ tentando bater o recorde de quantas vezes consegue tocar a campainha em um intervalo de 30 segundos? QuÃª vocÃª quer que eu faÃ§a? Tava mofando aqui fora, pensava que vocÃª tinha desistido de sair. Por quÃª a demora? â perguntou Sofia. Ah, deixa pra lÃ¡, era minha mÃ£e preocupada. âDisse olhando para o tÃ¡xi que esperava no lado de fora. â Vamos entÃ£o? Vamos. Durante a viagem atÃ© o shopping as duas garotas foram discutindo o assunto que tinham para resolver mais cedo.Quando chegaram o taxÃ­metro mostrava uma conta de vinte cinco reais. Sofia olhou feio para Sara pois sabia que o motorista havia cobrado a mais o tempo que esperaram por ela.Ao saÃ­rem do carro Sara diz: NÃ£o olha pra mim desse jeito â disse SÃ¡ meio sem graÃ§a.- NÃ£o foi minha culpa ter demorado tanto. Ah, beleza, nem esquenta.O Ãºnico problema agora Ã© que nÃ£o temos dinheiro pra nada alÃ©m dos ingressos do cinema e a viagem de volta. â Disse Sofia ainda um pouco brava com Sara. Encontraram Pandora esperando na frente da bilheteria com cara de poucos amigos. Como Ã© que vocÃªs conseguem???? â comeÃ§ou brava Pandora brava. Oi Pandora. â Exclamaram Sofia e Sara em coro â Conseguimos o quÃª? â Perguntou Sofia. Estou esperando aqui faz meia hora e vocÃªs nem ligam pra avisar que iam se atrasar. â Disse Pandora. E como reflexo Sofia olhou diretamente para Sara. Foi culpa da SÃ¡, que demorou pra sair de casa. â Disse Sofia ao mesmo tempo que Sara olhava torto para ela. Tudo bem â respondeu Pandora â To um pouco estressada hoje, o dia foi uma Merda pra nÃ£o falar outra coisa. â falou em um tom cansado. Tudo bem, nÃ³s perdoamos vocÃª Pandy! â disseram Sara e Sofia juntas â Ã quase impossÃ­vel vocÃª se estressar, vocÃª tem direito de ficar assim tanto quanto a gente. â Exclamou Sara, dando um sorriso para Pandora. Bom, e ai? Que foi que aconteceu? â Perguntou Sofia a Pandora. Ah, deixa pra depois. Vamos logo entrar na sala, senÃ£o o filme vai comeÃ§ar e ainda estaremos aqui fora.. â Sara e Sofia acenaram com a cabeÃ§a e foram em direÃ§Ã£o a entrada, quando lembraram que nÃ£o tinham ingresso. Ta aqui, comprei pra vocÃªs, depois do filme acertam comigo. â Disse Pandora rindo. Brigada Pandy â Exclamaram as duas. No caminho para sala Sara olhou para a lanchonete e sentiu aquele maravilhoso cheiro de pipoca vindo de lÃ¡.Sentiu uma vontade incontrolÃ¡vel de comer pipoca, quando Sofia lembrou-a: SÃ¡, nÃ£o esquece que nÃ£o temos dinheiro pra mais nada, nem para o saquinho da pipoca. Eu tenho uma idÃ©ia â disse enquanto Pandora nem havia reparado que as duas tinham parado de andar. â Fica de olho pra ver se ninguÃ©m olha ok? â murmurou Sara. Sara...que vocÃª vai fazer? â disse curiosa, porÃ©m Sara estava determinada demais para responder. Sara posicionou-se ao lado do lixo quando um casal passou e jogou um balde de pipoca quase acabado no lixo. Sara nÃ£o pensou duas vezes e puxou o balde do latÃ£o. Sofia olhou incrÃ©dula e perguntou: -VocÃª nÃ£o vai comer isso nÃ©? â perguntou rapidamente ansiando para que ela nÃ£o fizesse essa nojeira, Claro que nÃ£o â respondeu Sara,olhando torto enquanto segurava o balde. â Vem comigo que eu te mostro. Sofia seguiu-a atÃ© a lanchonete sem entender absolutamente nada, porÃ©m muito curiosa pra ver o que Sara faria. Nesta hora Pandora sentiu falta das duas quando notou que falava sozinha e avistou-as na lanchonete e foi na direÃ§Ã£o delas. Com licenÃ§a â disse Sara a atendente da lanchonete. Pois nÃ£o? ârespondeu a moÃ§a. Eu comprei essa pipoca neste estabelecimento e ela estava com um pedaÃ§o de unha dentro dela e minha amiga aqui quase vomitou quando viu!-disse Sara,calmamente para atendente, e foi ai que Sofia finalmente percebeu as intenÃ§Ãµes de Sara. Como Ã© que eu vou saber se vocÃª ta falando a verdade e tinha mesmo uma unha ai dentro?-perguntou ela,com uma cara meio desconfiada. Como Ã© que Ã©?-disse Sara,cinicamente e nervosa, prestes a interpretar um falso ataque â eu estudo o ano inteiro,quando eu decido assistir um filme e nÃ£o posso nem mais comprar uma pipoca porque ela pode ter um pedaÃ§o de unha com sujeira dentro!-disse Sara,comeÃ§ando a elevar a voz. Nesse momento,todos se viraram para observara confusÃ£o e comeÃ§aram a desistir de comprar na lanchonete.Pandora,conforme se aproximava escutou uma voz conhecida e pensou consigo mesma \"Que merda Ã© essa...NÃ£o, nÃ£o, nÃ£o, nÃ£o pode ser...Que serÃ¡ que essas duas tÃ£o aprontando dessa vez?\". Sofia,vendo que a encenaÃ§Ã£o estava fazendo efeito,comeÃ§ou tambÃ©m: Isso Ã© um absurdo!A gente vai processar essa espelunca!A gente vai reclamar com o PROCON! â bradou Sofia,tentando parecer o mais Â´seria possÃ­vel. A atendente,vendo a perda de clientes,murmurou baixinho: -TÃ¡ bom.Levem 2 pipocas grandes e 2 refrigerantes e esqueÃ§am isso... ok? - Tudo bem, obrigada - Agradeceram juntas. As meninas satisfeitas por conseguirem o que queriam se afastaram da lanchonete enquanto os clientes continuavam a olhar para elas. Pandora ainda incrÃ©dula, resolveu nem comentar e foram em direÃ§Ã£o a sala de cinema onde assistiram o filme enquanto Sara se divertia jogando pipoca na cabeÃ§a de um casal a frente de Pandora, que ao virarem, repreenderam Pandora enquanto Sara segurava o riso. Depois de tudo cada uma voltou para suas respectivas casas. No dia seguinte,Sara foi acordada pelas lambidas de Nick, um pug robusto, pequeno e de nariz achatado, e por Shadow, uma grande, peluda,e dourada Golden Retriever. Sara mal podia se equilibrar de tanto sono, quase caiu quando desceu as escadas para tomar cafÃ© da manhÃ£. Na geladeira sua mÃ£e havia deixado um bilhete avisando que havia saÃ­do e sÃ³ voltaria lÃ¡ pelas 8 da noite.Sara tomou cafÃ© com leite e comeu uma barra de cereal enquanto pensava o que poderia fazer para passar o tempo.Por fim decidiu levar os cÃ£es para passear, jÃ¡ que Shadow nÃ£o parava de trazer a guia da coleira na boca. Era uma manhÃ£ de inverno, com o cÃ©u acinzentado, e tempo frio. Sara tratou de vestir seu agasalho e seu tÃªnis favorito, o qual nunca tirava do pÃ©, pegou os cÃ£es e saiu em direÃ§Ã£o ao bosque onde sempre passeava. Foi um passeio tranqÃ¼ilo,o bosque parecia deserto, as Ã¡rvores balanÃ§avam sobre sua cabeÃ§a, o vento soprava as folhas no chÃ£o, e o agradÃ¡vel frio a envolvia. Perfeito. Pensou ela.Quando de repente Shadow puxou a guia, soltando-se, e saiu correndo em direÃ§Ã£o a trilha. Sara no mesmo instante comeÃ§ou a berrar pelo nome Shadow correndo atrÃ¡s dela com o pequeno Nick ao seu lado. NÃ£o era comum Shadow fazer isso, sempre fora tÃ£o educada quanto Nick, nÃ£o tinha a mania de puxar como se fosse um cÃ£o puxador de trenÃ³s. Sara correu uns 20 metros dentro da trilha olhando para todos os lados, quando sem prestar atenÃ§Ã£o para onde ia esbarrou com forÃ§a em um garoto. Nenhum dos dois pÃ´de falar nada, o impacto foi tÃ£o forte que Sara se desequilibrou segurando-se no garoto e levando-o ao chÃ£o. Para mÃ¡ sorte deles saÃ­ram rolando pelo monte atÃ© caÃ­rem no lago. Nick se desvencilhara da confusÃ£o e saiu correndo para longe. Sara ao sentir a Ã¡gua fria por todo o corpo soltou um sonoro palavrÃ£o que ecoou entre as Ã¡rvores, e quando lembrou que nÃ£o estava sozinha sua bochecha corou. O garoto tentava fixar todos os acontecimentos em sua cabeÃ§a. Batida.ChÃ£o.Rolar. Lago. Tudo aconteceu em menos de meio minuto.Quando o silencio comeÃ§ou a perturbar, os dois se olharam por uma fraÃ§Ã£o de segundo e explodiram a rir, imaginando a cena dos dois rolando. Depois de quase um minuto rindo o garoto diz: Bom, eu nem sei nem o que falar â disse rindo outra vez â Meu nome Ã© Josh, desculpe por isso â disse sendo gentil, mesmo sabendo que a culpa de terem caÃ­do lÃ¡ nÃ£o era dele. Meu nome Ã© Sara â disse â NÃ£o se desculpe, foi tudo minha culpa â sorriu sem graÃ§a. Ah...nÃ£o esquenta â disse Josh com ar despreocupado. Observando-a atentamente. Nossa, preciso ir, preciso pegar meus cÃ£es â disse levantando em um pulo, andando atÃ© a margem do rio com a Ã¡gua atÃ© os joelhos. Eu vi uma Golden Retriever â disse, dando uma pausa e continuando â Estava passeando com meu labrador quando ele saiu correndo em direÃ§Ã£o a cadela. Alguma chance de ser sua? Sim, Ã© minha â respondeu sorrindo enquanto Josh se levantava e saia do rio junto com ela. â VocÃª viu para que lado foi? Vi sim, foi para o mesmo lado que o meu, podemos procurar juntos , com certeza estarÃ£o no mesmo lugar. â disse torcendo a camiseta para tirar a Ã¡gua, Sara nÃ£o pÃ´de deixar de notar a barriga bem definida que Josh tinha. Sim claro, vamos juntos â disse retirando os olhos na barriga de Josh com muita dificuldade. Os dois caminharam juntos gritando o nome de seus cÃ£es, para que voltassem, mesmo sabendo que isso nÃ£o aconteceria. Sara caminhava perguntando a si mesma qual seria a idade de Josh, tinha um corpo bem desenvolvido, pra nÃ£o falar outra coisa, entÃ£o imaginou que deveria ser bem mais velho que ela. Sim, definitivamente ele teria mais que dezesseis anos. Josh, como se pudesse ler os pensamentos de Sara, parou e pergunta: Quantos anos vocÃª tem? Dezesseis â disse timidamente, jÃ¡ se arrependendo por nÃ£o mentir sobre a idade. â E vocÃª? â perguntou de volta. Dezesseis tambÃ©m â respondeu dando um sorriso e voltando a andar. EstÃ¡ brincando comigo! VocÃª nÃ£o tem sÃ³ isso! â falou Sara em descrenÃ§a. Acredite. Tenho dezesseis - falou sorrindo. Sara sorriu de volta. NÃ£o demorou muito mais que uns minutos para que encontrassem os cÃ£es, os trÃªs, brincando feito alucinados no campo onde as crianÃ§as costumavam empinar pipa. Josh e Sara jÃ¡ estavam quase secos quando voltavam pela trilha. Pararam no quiosque e conversaram mais um pouco,e descobriam vÃ¡rias coisas que tinham em comum. Sara estava sentindo-se estranha, sentia como se conhecesse Josh havia anos, como se fossem bons amigos desde sempre .Josh parecia sentir o mesmo. 'Nossa' pensou Sara observando-o enquanto ele falava sobre algo que ela nÃ£o estava prestando atenÃ§Ã£o, devido a atenÃ§Ã£o que estava dando ao rosto dele, nunca virÃ¡ traÃ§os tÃ£o perfeitos e mÃºsculos tÃ£o bem definidos como os dele, que atÃ© pareciam terem sidos pintados por um artista.De repente Josh fala e Sara volta para a realidade. O que vocÃª acha sobre isso? â perguntou. Ah sim, a mesma coisa que vocÃª â respondeu Sara rapidamente tentando parecer que sabia o que ele estava falando, quando Josh comeÃ§ou a rir. â Que tem de engraÃ§ado?-retrucou a menina. VocÃª nÃ£o ouviu uma palavra que eu disse, nÃ£o Ã©? â disse fingindo estar sÃ©rio,mas estava apenas brincando. Olhava fixamente para ela. Sara fez menÃ§Ã£o de falar para poder argumentar, porÃ©m foi interrompida com um beijo em seus lÃ¡bios. Um beijo que no inÃ­cio nÃ£o foi correspondido, pois Sara nÃ£o esperava, mas aos poucos foi cedendo ao desejo que nÃ£o conseguia explicar de onde vinha, o beijo foi ficando cada vez mais intenso e profundo. Sara nÃ£o sabia o porque mas algo a mantinha conectada a ele, nÃ£o queria deixa-lo. Por fim, a necessidade de respirar os venceu e pararam de se beijar. Josh, o que foi isso? â perguntou em um tom que Josh nÃ£o conseguia diferenciar se era frieza ou falta de ar. Um beijo â respondeu rindo, preferindo acreditar que o tom de Sara havia sido por falta de ar. Muito bom por sinal â falou Sara depois de algum tempo em silencio. Ficaram assim, quietos, olhando-se por mais um tempo atÃ© que o relÃ³gio de Sara tocou e ela finalmente lembrou das horas. 'Minha nossa...SÃ£o 7 da noite ' pensou e disse: Josh... â comeÃ§ou, mas foi empedida pelo garoto. Tudo bem, pode ir... â disse, e completou sorrindo â mas me dÃª seu telefone,nÃ£o quero perder contato. Sara nÃ£o queria ir mas precisava, tinha de estar em casa antes que a mÃ£e chegasse e ficasse toda preocupada pensando que estava na rua. Sara anotou seu telefone em um pedaÃ§o de papel ainda molhado que encontrou no bolso e deu a Josh. Despediram-se com um beijo que infelizmente durou pouco pois Sara realmente tinha de ir. - Tchau, Josh â falou e virou as costas em direÃ§Ã£o a saÃ­da com Nick e Shadow na guia. Tchau, Sara â falou dando um pequeno aceno, voltou-se para Frodo, seu labrador chocolate e disse â Pronto garoto, agora somos sÃ³ eu e vocÃª. âsuspirou tristemente. Josh foi caminhando atÃ© estar tÃ£o longe, que nÃ£o dava mais pra ver nada alÃ©m da sombra do garoto e do labrador. Sara durante o caminho de volta tentava fixar tudo que se passou em sua cabeÃ§a. Tudo aconteceu tÃ£o rÃ¡pido; conheceu Josh de repente como em um filme, e logo depois jÃ¡ estava beijando ele. Sara por mais explosiva, impulsiva e baderneira que fosse nunca curtiu essa histÃ³ria de sair beijando vÃ¡rios em festas sem ao menos conhecer o menino. Sofia sempre achava estranho esse jeito de Sara, pois era o oposto dela, beijava o mÃ¡ximo que pudesse e a maior quantidade que fosse possÃ­vel. Enfim, Sara chegou em casa, tirou a guia dos cÃ£es e deu Ã¡gua a eles. Nick parecia estar morrendo de tÃ£o ofegante que estava; depois que bebeu Ã¡gua foi para o tapete junto a Shadow e caiu em um sono profundo. Sara tomou um banho e colocou seu pijama pois sabia que nÃ£o sairia mais de casa;sua mÃ£e chegou logo em seguida. JÃ¡ era 7 e meia da noite, e Sara resolveu ir arrumar seu quarto, uma coisa que nÃ£o fazia hÃ¡ meses. Sara em meio sua bagunÃ§a encontrou diversos bilhetes que escrevera na sala de aula na 8ÂªsÃ©rie com seu melhor amigo na Ã©poca. Vendo aquilo, Sara nÃ£o pÃ´de deixar de lembrar dos bons tempos que teve aquele ano. 'Minha nossa, agora jÃ¡ estou no segundo ano, como passou rÃ¡pido' . Subitamente uma enorme tristeza a consumiu, ' por que serÃ¡ que nossa amizade chegou a esse ponto?Como se fossemos dois estranhos?' pensou referindo-se a seu ex-melhor amigo. Sara preferiu nÃ£o responder, desviou seus pensamentos e foi ler um dos livros de seu autor favorito,Stephen King. Por volta das 9 da noite o telefone toca e Sara corre imediatamente para atender rezando pra que fosse Josh. - AlÃ´ â Sara atende ansiosamente. AlÃ´ â fala Pandora â Tudo bem com vocÃª? Ah...Ã© vocÃª Dora. Imaginei que fosse outra pessoa. â diz Sara aliviada mas ao mesmo tempo triste por nÃ£o ser Josh. Quem mais seria? â perguntou Pandora â VocÃª nÃ£o parece estar muito legal, aconteceu alguma coisa? Sua voz estÃ¡ estranha. Ah nÃ£o, estÃ¡ tudo bem â mentiu. Bom, se vocÃª diz...- disse Pandora, sabendo que nÃ£o adiantaria nada insistir no assunto- De qualquer forma, SÃ¡, voce jÃ¡ pediu Ã  sua mÃ£e autorizaÃ§Ã£o para irmos a Campos de JordÃ£o? Campos? â perguntou confusa. Como assim, vocÃª nÃ£o sabe? Campos!- A viagem de formatura que estamos planejando ir acampar, lembra?- Perguntou Dora na tentativa de trazer Sara de volta a realidade. Ah sim!Claro que sei, mas ainda nÃ£o pedi a minha mÃ£e,vou fazer isso assim que ela chegar, certo?- disse em um tom cansado. Ãtimo, amanhÃ£ vocÃª nos dÃ¡ uma resposta.

Disclaimer: Slash Warning: This fic deals with the romantic relationship between Chaz and Brandon. Feedback: Please! But please, don't flame me! ********** Chaz turned the key and unlocked the door and kicked it open with his foot. He shut it behind him with a loud bang, and let his sticky briefcase hit the floor by his feet. \"Chaz, that you?\" he heard Brandon call from the kitchen. Chaz groaned in agreement, and threw himself onto the couch. He waited for a moment, listening to the silence in the apartment, and then finally Brandon made his way out from the kitchen and came up behind him. He felt Brandon's strong hands on his shoulders and he moaned as he received a mini back rub. It ended abruptly, and Brandon walked around the couch and sat next to him. \"You ok?\" he asked. Chaz looked at him with tired eyes, \"I am so fed up with the corporate world.\" Brandon smiled, \"Well, it's Friday. We can go out dancing if you like?\" \"No, I'm too tired.\" He complained, his Scottish accent shining through. Brandon put his arm around Chaz's shoulders, \"Poor baby.\" Chaz smiled, but then closed his eyes and leaned his head back. Brandon got up and stretched in front of him. Chaz blinked open one eye to catch a glimpse of Brandon's flat stomach showing from under his shirt. Chaz jumped to his feet and slid his arms around Brandon's slender waist, folding his hands behind his back. Brandon smiled as he brought his arms down from above his head and wrapped them around Chaz's neck. They came nose to nose, smiling at each other. \"I missed you today.\" Chaz said. \"I missed you more.\" Brandon smiled. \"Oh I doubt that.\" Chaz laughed. Brandon chuckled, \"I love you.\" \"I love you more.\" \"I don't think that's humanly possible.\" He smiled sweetly. Chaz pulled him closer, and planted a soft, gentle kiss on his lips. Brandon closed his eyes to savor the moment, but suddenly there was a knock on the door and Chaz pulled away. Brandon opened his eyes to watch his lover walk over to the door and let Sara in. She was in tears and soaking wet from the rain outside. She fell into Chaz's open arms and Brandon rushed over to join her side. \"What happened deary?\" Chaz asked, gently rubbing Sara's back. Brandon came over and rest a gentle hand on her arm and she pulled away from Chaz and leaped into Brandon's arms. Brandon was surprised, but he smiled and tried his best to console her as Chaz went into the kitchen. Brandon led Sara to the couch where they sat, and Chaz came back with a glass of water and some Tylenol. Sara gratefully took them, swallowed them, then leaned her head on Brandon's shoulder. \"I'm swearing off men.\" She mumbled through her tears. Chaz looked at Brandon, who smirked. \"You don't mean that.\" Chaz said sympathetically. \"Why not?\" she asked, sniffing loudly. Brandon rubbed her arm, \"Because sweetie, you wouldn't make a good lesbian.\" After a moment Sara started to laugh, and Brandon and Chaz both sighed in relief and then chuckled along with her. She sat up, wiping away her tears, and looked down at her feet. Then he stood up. \"Your couch is all wet now.\" She said as if she was heartbroken again. Chaz stood up and took her hands, \"That doesn't matter. Come on, I'll take you downstairs.\" She pulled away from him, and backed into Brandon, who had stood up next to her. \"I don't want to go home. I don't want to be alone. Can I sleep here tonight?\" Sara looked at Brandon pleadingly, who smiled, and looked at Chaz with the same look. Suddenly Chaz had these two puppy dog faces in front of him, and he laughed. \"Sure you can, why not?\" he said cheerily. \"Come on babe, we'll find you some dry clothes.\" Brandon said, taking Sara's hand in his and leading her into the bedroom he shared with Chaz. ********** \"Who wants popcorn?\" Brandon chimed once he walked into the living room. Chaz and Sara sat up on the pulled out bed and smiled at him. \"I do!\" Sara laughed. Brandon came over with the bowl of popcorn and handed it to Sara as he sat down next to her. The three of them laid back on the dozens of pillows they had piled up behind them. Sara lay between Chaz and Brandon, holding the bowl of popcorn on her stomach. The lights were off and the TV glowed at them waiting for Chaz to press the play button on the remote control. \"What movie are we watching?\" Sara asked. \"Gone With The Wind.\" Brandon said triumphantly. Chaz aimed the remote at the VCR and pressed play, and suddenly the coming attractions started to play before them. Chaz reached into the bowl of popcorn and instead of popcorn he found Brandon's hand, which was also searching for popcorn. Sara smiled and bit her lip as she watched the two of them play with each other's fingers, and it wasn't until it looked like one of them might roll over her to get to the other that she finally broke them up. They retreated back to their corners and all three of them chuckled to themselves as the movie started. Brandon bent his legs and crossed his legs up in the air, dangling his foot in front of Sara's view. She laughed and hit his foot away and his legs fell back to the mattress. \"Questa cinema Ã© triste!\" Brandon shouted. \"Stop speaking in Italian!\" Sara shouted back, laughing. Brandon sat up and took the bowl of popcorn from Sara's hands. He ignored the movie and threw himself on top of Sara, burying his face in her neck to tickle her as she screamed and laughed. Chaz snickered and climbed off the bed to get out of the way as Brandon tickled Sara until she was almost falling off the bed. Almost four hours later, the three of them sat on the floor at the end of the bed, each wrapped and entangled in the bed covers and pillows as they watched the movie with teary eyes. Sara buried her teary eyes in Chaz's shoulder and he smiled down at her. Once the movie had ended, the three of them struggled to get back onto the bed. Sara snuggled up under the covers as Brandon took the empty popcorn bowl back into the kitchen. Chaz found his way to an empty chair and stretched his legs out until his feet rested upon the edge of the pull of bed. Brandon came in and sat in the other chair on the other side of the bed. They were all silent for a few minutes, the fact that it was almost three in the morning was beginning to take its toll on them. \"So what should we do now?\" Brandon asked. \"Sleep?\" Chaz suggested, laying his head back and shutting his eyes. \"I'm not sleepy.\" Sara whined playfully. Brandon laughed, \"Come on Chaz you can't be tired yet. You slept through most of the movie, you should be raring to go.\" Chaz opened his eyes and smiled at Brandon slightly. \"We could play a game?\" Sara suggested. \"Yeah, how about hide and seek?\" Brandon smiled. \"How old are you?\" Chaz asked mockingly. Brandon narrowed his eyes at him and laughed, \"I haven't played that since I was in grade school.\" \"Ok, Brandon, you're it!\" Sara screeched as she jumped out of her warm covers and ran out of the room. \"Hey! I don't want to be it!\" Brandon called after her. He looked back at Chaz, but Chaz was already disappearing into the kitchen. \"No peeking!\" he heard Sara call from the other room. Brandon sighed and covered his eyes. He started to count, to what number he wasn't sure, but when he got bored he gave up and looked around. \"Ready or not, here I come!\" he shouted. He could hear a few smothered giggles as he walked into the kitchen. It was empty. He walked through the other door and was surprised when Chaz tackled him in the dark. They both fell to the floor, rolled, and ended up with feet and arms flailing as they forgot about the game. Suddenly they stopped when they saw Sara's feet in front of them. Chaz lifted his head as he lay on top of Brandon to see Sara with her hands on her hips. \"That is not how you play hide and seek.\" She said, trying not to laugh. \"I'll show you hide and seek.\" Brandon said threatening. He pushed Chaz off of him and before he got to his feet Sara realized he was going to chase her and she ran off screaming. Brandon ran after her, following her through the bedroom, the dining room, and back into the living room. She ran over the bed, then stood there, watching him carefully. Brandon moved to the left, and Sara did the same, ready to run. Brandon moved the other way and Sara copied him, laughing almost hysterically. Brandon smiled and quickly hopped onto the bed as Sara screeched. He tackled her when he got to her side, wrapping his arms around her and spinning her around. She laughed as he lifted her off the floor, spinning her, and suddenly the two of them were on the floor. In what seemed like slow motion, Brandon held himself above her as she rested her hands on his sides. For a moment he forgot all about Chaz, the apartment, eve the fact that he had been a homosexual for years and years. He forgot all this when he stared down at Sara and how beautiful she was. Sara smiled up at him, caught in the same whirlwind that he was. She put her hands on his cheeks as he leaned down and softly kissed her lips. It didn't feel much different to kiss her than it did to kiss Chaz, he thought, as he blindly sucked on her tongue, her hands running through his hair. Suddenly they both realized what they were doing, and opened their eyes widely to stare at each other. Brandon pushed off of her and jumped to his feet. He stood for a moment, looking down at her, but not really seeing her, not until she reached up for his hand. He snapped back to reality and took her hand, helping her to her feet. She stood in front of him for a moment, until they heard Chaz clear his throat. Sara glanced over her shoulder, then pushed past Brandon to go sit on the bed. Brandon stood in front of his lover as if he had just killed the very thing that kept them together. \"Hope you two are finished.\" Chaz said blankly. He looked from Brandon to Sara, who was looking in the other direction. As Chaz started to walk into the kitchen, Brandon quickly followed. \"Chaz wait.\" He pleaded. Chaz turned to face him and leaned against the sink. Brandon suddenly felt very naked standing in front of him like that. \"What?\" Chaz asked. \"Chaz-\" \"What? What, you're going to tell me it wasn't anything. It didn't mean anything, the fact that you were just making out with our best friend, a woman. You'd think I would be more mad if I caught you making out with another man, but for some odd reason, the fact that you were making out with the woman we've called sister for so many years, it bothers me even more.\" Chaz said, finally realizing he was going off rambling after he had finished. \"It didn't mean anything. It was just a kiss.\" \"A kiss between friends.\" Chaz said sarcastically. Suddenly Sara came up behind Brandon, running her hand down his arm. \"What are you doing in here? Can't you see that your two gay men are having a fight?\" \"Chaz.\" Sara started. \"Sara, I think you should leave.\" Sara's eyes widened, Chaz had never asked her to leave before. \"What?\" \"You heard me. I need to talk to Brandon.\" \"Chaz. I don't think of you guys as the two gay men in my life. You guys are my best friends, I don't label you like that. It was just a stupid kiss, we weren't even thinking-\" \"Oh so if I hadn't walked in would you have not thought about going farther?\" \"What? Chaz-\" Brandon started. \"No, no I don't want to hear it.\" Chaz said, putting up his hands. He walked out of the kitchen and into the bedroom, where he stood in the doorway for a moment, looking back at them. \"I'm going to bed. Don't bother me.\" He said coldly. He shut the door and left Brandon and Sara alone. ********* Brandon sat curled up under the covers of the pulled out bed. Sara was gathering her clothes and she walked into the living room and stopped when she saw him. \"It'll be ok Brandon.\" She said, trying to make him feel better. \"How do you know?\" he mumbled. She smiled, \"Because, Chaz is just cranky.\" She said, this time trying to convince herself as well as Brandon, \"He just needs to get some sleep, things will be ok in the morning.\" She said as she leaned on the edge of the bed. She gently rested her hand on Brandon's head. He turned and looked up at her. \"I hope you're right.\" He said. She leaned down and kissed the top of his head. She said a quiet goodnight to him and silently left the apartment. She made her way down the stairs to her own apartment and climbed into bed. She laid awake for almost an hour, listening for some sign of movement above her. Suddenly she heard her door open and close, and was surprised to see Brandon standing in the doorway to her bedroom. \"Brandon?\" she asked, groggy, even though she hadn't slept. Without a word, Brandon shuffled over to the side of her bed, pulled back the covers, and climbed in next to her. She remembered all the times he had done the same thing and they had snuggled together, Chaz too sometimes. As Brandon put his arm over Sara's stomach and snuggled his chin against her shoulder, she frowned at how different it felt now. She looked down at him through the corners of her eyes and smiled. She turned over and put her arms around his warm body and he smiled, keeping his eyes shut. The two of them stayed like that for almost an hour, until Sara's bedroom door creaked open once again and she cracked an eye open to see Chaz's silhouette standing before her. Brandon was quietly sleeping in her neck. Sara smiled and slowly lifted a tired arm and outstretched it towards Chaz. He lingered for a moment, but finally scurried over and hopped onto the other side of her bed. Putting his arms around her as he lay behind her, and gently rubbing Brandon's back as the three of them quietly fell asleep together.

November is your name and your rabbity ways. Your gamin smile and giggle. That faraway look in your eyes that says sadness. Your body warm with mine and your heart beating irregularly. Your hair of gold and our first night together under the winter sky coming on us, as we watched it through your skylight. Your smallness and your tall ideas. Your courage and your pills and your deepest generosity and you are gone now, so long ago, caught in the mantrap or woman trap of mortality. Alonzo too. And all the days from then to now have taken a man and changed him. You taught me love, Sara. You taught me we couldn't live in cardboard boxes like I did and like so many people do. You changed my world, Sara. You have caught New York in a winter globe and have given it to me, and I so wanted to save you, to make you not ill, to see Christmas in and the New Year too. I write you these letters once a week, you know. And I like to think you do indeed know. From England to America, from a driving test renewal you made me fail, to here, and I fell in love with your winsomeness and the fact I couldn't tell you sometimes between woman and child. I doubt, Sara, and I still despair, but I cannot see your grave site for that will have finality written on it, but you are in my bloodstream and I find myself happy and weeping at odd moments. Who taught you my darling? Who taught your hands and your mouth and your legs? Who taught your golden head to conquer me so beautifully? Where I live now is far from Manhattan. I live in a comfortable pine house on the edge of a copse of woods. It is snowing now, which I see outside my writing room window. It is almost dusk, and I find my heart so perfectly cast with yours. It takes a brave man to be in love with a dream for over 35 years. It takes a brave man or just perhaps a stubborn one not to give up trying to find you, trying to make you real again, or were you ever real? I know the Figis brothers were and every creak and tremble on that bed floor landing I never forgot. I know dear Alonzo was real for you and for me. I wish you alive. I pray often when I never prayed before you came running into my heart, and when you were in there, you rescheduled everything. I got out of the box business for one thing. I kept feeling your delicate bones and your warm breasts at my mouth and your sigh like from a faraway place. You were poetry and you were the entire world smoothed over easily as if you made gingham out of everything there was and is. I became a writer, Sara. I became a believer in chasing rainbows and you at the end of them. My hair has gone gray. My British accent has become muted. My dancing eyes no longer dance. The quips come hard or not at all. My eyebrows thick as ever are now gray as well. My clowny face has become lined with age. My mouth so expressive once is not that anymore, for on its lips constantly is your name and I love you more with every day that passes. I cling to you as I did on that last day of November and it's true, my heart is still brim full of you, my love and that will live past eternity. I don't know why people love. I think it's best we don't. Eyes remind me of your eyes and smiles when there are any remind me of yours, I feel like Pip, a little lost child, in Miss Haversham's house, where all is moldy and dead and gone away to cobwebs, for without you I had to live for you. Without you I had to live your life and mine. I still have the letter from Alonzo, sweet man, and gentle dreamer even if he had a bizarre taste in food; ah remember the special turkey dinner you made him for Thanksgiving out of Jell-O? Only you Sara, only you in a million facets as the snow falls. And as lovely as Manhattan in Autumn, it is lovelier here. I see you in the dark and in the light. I pretend it snows because you make it so. Because you say, here, Charlie, here's my yearly gift to you. I sing the body Sara, I drift into your world and it's wacky and bizarre and giddy and a constant amazement that one man could find one woman he loves so much, when he didn't think he could love at all. All our adventures to relive. And I do. And I do. To hold your quivering hand again, to bring my lips to yours again. To dream your eyes while looking at them. To write poetry for you and to read it to youâiambic pentameter no lessâand I live in November, my darling. I live in November because there is no other month. I rush through the calendar of the year to here and count the months and weeks and days and minutes, and on this day like all the firsts of November, I expect you to come through my door and say with head slightly bowed, with eyes that have trouble looking any one in the eye, you will say Hello Charlie, with your unsure smile, and your voice will quiver and I will run to you and death will not take you from me. Oh Sara, I put my head on my desk now. My stomach is heavier. My thoughts are too. I never married, never had a date after one or two, for I save myself for a twist of fate, for it was a twist of fate, my meeting you on that cooling Autumn day at the license bureau and the sweet ridiculousness of it, that that was where we were to meet and spend our November together. I wish you had let me stay to take care of you. I wish you had not died with someone else. I am glad Alonzo was there. I am yours Sara; I am yours forever and a day. After I finish writing this, to put in a stack of letters to you, a tumbling tower of them, I shall walk into the woods and I shall see night and the moon and the snow and the trees and shall walk among them. And I shall see you again, and you will stand there shivering, a small flame in winter cold, your hands in your pockets, your chin a tremble. And the calendar in my house always says November, a world of Novembers that do not end, and I shall walk to you like walking softly to a precious diamond that is so fragile, and so hurt by so much. I shall stand there in my jeans and winter shirt and my work boots, no more three piece suits for me with a handkerchief in my coat pocket, folded so properly, a vest even, back then and a can you believe it?âa pocket watch. I can't imagine that man back there before you or any Novembers before you happened by, and I wanted to be with you because I wanted to hold you and before you closed your eyes that last time, I wanted to say from me to you, I love you Sara. And where you go I will follow. I write poetry now, and all the poems are about you in one way or another. Some are published. I make do. Once I got a note from someone asking me why I was so sad and how they wished they could help me in some way. It was kind of them, and I wrote back the nicest letter I could. But I didn't tell them about you Sara, you knit me up and tear me apart, you subsume me and hold me together and tonight, (I held onto the day as hard as I could, but it slipped away from me) for its night now, is like the first night in your flat, sorry, apartment, with the snow falling onto the glass and us underneath it, making love and me reveling in the pure perfection of you. We were children once, you and I, and we rode on ferries and you knitted me that wonderful sweater I named Rex, and which I still have and keep safe and protected from the years. You taught me how to unstop sinks and you taught me how to fall in love with a voice and how it echoes in my mind all the time and makes my heart so glad I got to spend sweet November with you. I'll put on my coat now, not a Burberry, I've done away with all that finery, also because the money doesn't come easily nowâI pour out my heart in poems, but I made much more money with my box companyâgo figure. I will count the minutes of November. I will have my calendar with me above my computer, on the wall and I will luxuriate in all my memories, for you my Sara are November, its colors, its bracing cold, its brown and red crisp leaves. I've discovered November has a voice and its voice says many words but the sweetest of them is \"Home.\" I close now, Sara. I love you. And bless you, my Sara November Hourglass. You made me live and made time and distance give up the ghost as I remember us running down the streets of Manhattan, just a minute ago, as you stole my heart and keep it in trust and gave yours in return, to hold it in its sacredness. I'll write again next week. And keep on writing you till I don't have to anymore. And we will be together forever, you and me and November for November is indeed the sweetest month.

God its such a great movie. More to the point, I wouldn't have watched it if Keanu Reeves wasn't in it. Overview of Sweet November: Nelson Moss (KEANU REEVES) and Sara Deever (CHARLIZE THERON) have nothing in common except an hour spent in DMV hell. She's a charming spirit who brings out the best in men. He's a workaholic executive whose only intimate relationship is with the bottom line...until he meets Sara. Intrigued by each other, but not quite ready to commit, they settle on a rather unconventional courtship: a one-month trial, after which they'll go their separate ways. No expectations. No pressure. No strings attached. ----------- Chapter One ----------- \"Sara, I love you,\" he said in a deep voice while looking into her eyes. \"I love you, and nothing else matters. You have taught me how to live life, and I want to spend it all with you.\" \"This is the end Nelson!\" Sara said furiously. \"I said one month, and now that time has passed.\" \"Let me take care of you, you're not well,\" he said seriously. His handsome eyes gazed deeply into hers. His love for her was stronger than ever, he didn't want to lose it all. How would he be able to live without her? \"Why aren't you listening to me?\" Sara said as she began getting angrier. \"I hate this world, I don't want to share my life with anyone. I want to live alone, by myself, away from others, where no one knows me, where no one is there.\" \"You're telling me this month that we shared our love in meant nothing to you?\" Nelson began raising his voice. \"What do I have to do to prove to you that I want to be with you?\" \"Prove that you love me?\" she said with with a faded voice, \"Leave me!\" \"Bye Sara,\" Nelson began, \"I'll never forget you.\" He gave her one last kiss and went out that door. Sara felt aweful. She leaned against the wall and slowly began to sit down as she thought about what she had just done. What have I done? she thought to herself as a tear rolled down her cheek. She began having flashbacks of those good times she spent with Nelson in November.

Die Blondine verfehlte ihre Haut mit dem feuchten Papierhandtuch und zeigte so eindeutig, dass sie mehr als nur etwas angeheitert war. \"Mmm... ja. Muss mich nur noch fragen\", sagte Liv mit einem leichten Lallen, aber ihre Augen glÃ¤nzten und waren glasig ... aber fÃ¼r Emma war nur der Ausdruck puren GlÃ¼ckes von Bedeutung. \"Gratuliere\", Emma versuchte aufrichtig zu klingen, aber sie schaffte es nicht ganz. Sie war dankbar das ihre beste Freundin betrunken war. \"Wirst du mich... vermissen?\" \"Du wirst immer noch hier sein, nur als Mrs. Williams\", Emma zwang ihre HÃ¤nde aufzuhÃ¶ren zu zittern. Sie hatte diesen Blick auf Livs Gesicht schon vorher gesehen, jedes Mal wenn die Blondine betrunken war und Emma in einen Raum mit sich alleine bekam. Nach jeder High School-Party mit dem allgegenwÃ¤rtigen verbotenem und billigem Bier; nach jeder Collegeparty mit aufgepeppten Punsch und BierfÃ¤ssern. Jedes Mal hatte sich Liv besoffen und hatte ihren betrunkenen Impulsen mit Emma nachgegeben. Einer sehr nÃ¼chternen und willigen Emma. Es passierte selbst nach ihrem gemeinsamen Abschluss, nur mit weniger HÃ¤ufigkeit. Darum war Emma aufgesprungen auf die Chance als Fletcher sie fragte, ob sie bei ihm einziehen wollte. Sie liebte ihn nicht, aber sie war verliebt in ihre beste, frisch verlobte, Freundin. \"Das is' nicht was ich meine und du weiÃt das.\" Liv gab ihr Bestes verfÃ¼hrerisch zu sein als sie wackelig auf ihren AbsÃ¤tzen schwankte. Emma fand es absolut hinreiÃend in der gleichen seltsamen Art weswegen sie immer ja sagte. \"Wirst du mich vermissen?\" Emmas Atem stockte als Liv zu ihr kam und die BrÃ¼nette gegen die Wand drÃ¼ckte um ihr einen nassen Kuss zu geben. Livs Mund schmeckte genauso sÃ¤uerlich und salzig wie die GlÃ¤ser mit Tequila, die sie wie Wasser herunter gekippt hatte. Es erschien als kÃ¼ssten sie sich eine Ewigkeit. Als sie sich von einander trennten, Ã¶ffneten sich Emmas Augen flatternd nur um Livs Augen dunkel mit Lust und deren von den KÃ¼ssen geschwollenen Lippen zu sehen. Emma wollte sich fallen lassen und sich selbst in diesen GefÃ¼hlen verlieren. Aber es wÃ¼rde unweigerlich enden. Am nÃ¤chsten Morgen wÃ¼rde Emma frÃ¼h aufstehen, aus Livs Bett und zurÃ¼ck in ihr eigenes kriechen, wo sie sich zusammenrollen und heulen wÃ¼rde. Es war Routine. Aber diese Routine war alt und Zeiten hatten sich geÃ¤ndert. Niemand von ihnen lebte allein und Liv wÃ¼rde heiraten . \"Wir kÃ¶nnen das nicht tun. Was ist mit Daniel? Was ist mit Fletcher?\", protestierte Emma und hielt Liv auf ArmlÃ¤nge von sich. \"Es wÃ¤re wie in alten Zeiten\", bettelte Liv, schmollend, und klimperte mit ihren Wimpern so wie sie es schon so viele Mal zuvor getan hatte. \"Liv, wir sind keine Kinder mehr! Du bist verlobt und ich bin mit Fletcher zusamen.\" \"Du liebst ihn nicht. Niemand kann dich lieben wie ich!\", schrie sie, stolperte gegen den Tresen und ihre Wangen waren rot und ihren Augen blitzten. Sie war fuchsteufelswild und Emma hatte immer gedacht das Liv wunderschÃ¶n aussah, wenn sie wÃ¼tend war. \"Lebewohl Liv und Gratulation\", sagte Emma zitternd und ihre Unterlippe zitterte wegen dem starken Verlangen zu weinen. \"Nur vergiss nicht, Em. Ich bin immer die Braut\", rief Liv und ihre Stimme war ein ungestÃ¼mer Mix aus Ãrger, Schmerz und Traurigkeit. Emma war fÃ¤hig ihre TrÃ¤nen zurÃ¼ckzuhalten bis sie es erfolgreich nach drauÃen geschafft hatte.

I absolutely LOVE Emma and Nate. They are too adorable! And since there aren't any Emma/Nate stories for me to readâ¦ guess I'll write my own! I just got through watching it actually, that's why I'm currently obsessed with thisâ¦ and I caught something when Emma and Nate were in the Tux place when he asked to buy her a cup of coffee. What if she had said yes? What would have been said? Disclaimer: I own nothing of this movie, except the turn of events where Emma goes for coffee instead. Coffee The suit rental shop smells like over-priced fabric. He hates over-priced fabric. He looks down at her one last time, and surprises himself by blurting out, \"Hey- umâ¦ let me buy you a cup of coffee.\" He hadn't meant to, but she looks like she could use some cheering up. After all, that's what your best friend's brother is for right? At first he thinks she'll decline, and part of him is glad, but more of him is disappointed. He'd slipped up earlier, with the whole waiting around too long thing. It probably isn't a good idea to spend any more time with her. But a larger part of him is screaming that he wants to drink in every moment of her while she's still unmarried. \"You know what? I might just take you up on that,\" She says, smiling. It almost conceals the pain and fatigue in her eyes, but he knows her better than that. It takes him a moment to realize that she's accepted. \"Right. Just-uh-let me go-uh-change,\" he stutters, jerking his thumb toward the dressing room, half smiling. His smile widens slightly as he sees her own lips tug upwards in another smile. Two in one minute. Probably the most she's smiled all week , he thinks to himself as he retreats to the dressing room. They sit in a secluded corner of the coffee shop, he sipping black coffee, she opting for a Chai Latte. While she stares at the Styrofoam cup she's turning between her fingers, Nate muses about how their choices of drink reflect their personalities, in a way. The black coffee represents his simple, uncomplicated outlook on life. Although his feelings for Emma are anything but simple, just about everything else about his life is. He's uncomplicated by cream and sugar, preferring to just show the world what he is, instead of masking it. She, on the other hand, is quiet and serene. The sweetness of the Chai Latte reflects her natural kindness, the shy exterior that gives way to the gentle-hearted yet fiery woman beneath. She spins between her fingers a calm drink that holds just enough spice to balance it all out perfectly. \"I can't understand how you drink that stuff,\" She wrinkles her nose as he takes a drink of his coffee. He lowers the cup, smiling, \"What? It's simple. I like it.\" \"Simply disgusting.\" He laughs again, louder, \"Coming from you.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" She asks, feigning insult. \"You sitting there drinking Chung-ho whatever. General rule. If you can't pronounce it, don't drink it.\" She shakes her head, looking down and laughing slightly. \"Chai Latte.\" \"What? Couldn't hear you,\" he jokes, smile still in place. He's pretty sure he doesn't ever smile as much as he does when he's with her. \"Chai. Latte.\" She repeats, enunciating each word, still smiling. \"I'm sorry, what? Is that some kind of fungus orâ¦\" She laughs, soft and musical, making him join in. He loves the sound of her laugh. \"Thanks,\" she says softly, after the laughter subsides. \"For what?\" \"For this. Making me laugh. I needed it.\" His lips lift in a small half-smile, \"I know.\" Her eyes have returned to her cup, studying where her thumbs are running lightly over the cardboard sleeve. The glint of the diamond ring on her finger catches his eye, reminding him that she's promised her life to another man. A man who can't possibly love her more than he does. \"How's Liv?\" She asks, breaking the silence. \"She's good. Keeping it together.\" \"Typical Liv.\" He nods in agreement, \"She misses you.\" Something flashes in her eye, \"I miss her, too.\" \"Why don't youâ¦ Why not give her a call? I'm sure she wants to talk to you.\" She bites her lip, considering. She removes her right hand from the cup and rests it against the table while she takes a sip of the Latte. \"Em, you're best friends,\" He implores, reaching across the table involuntarily to lay his hand over hers. He expects her to pull away, and when she doesn't, he can almost convince himself that he's allowed to do this. Finally she looks up, meeting his eyes, \"Maybe I will.\" They sit in silence, neither withdrawing their hand, and finally he plucks up the courage to ask what he's been wanting to since the day Fletcher did his taxes. \"Are you happy, Em?\" She looks confused, \"Why wouldn't I be?\" \"No reason, I justâ¦ Wanted to make sure,\" He can't say what he really wants to, so he settles for what would be acceptable instead. \"Nate,\" She looks genuinely touched, \"It's just a stressful time. Me and Fletchâ¦ We're ok, really. We'll get through it. I'm happy.\" \"You sure?\" \"Positive. I couldn't be happier.\" He doesn't tell her that he can see the lie in her eyes. The rest of the time passes quickly, and before they know it, they've been sitting in the coffee shop for an hour and a half. He's pretty sure that this is the happiest she's been for a while, but he doesn't say anything. He likes to see her smiling and laughing. Too soon, she checks her watch and realizes that she has to go. They rise and start the walk back to the real world. She reaches out for some unknown reason and grabs hold of his arm, not that he's complaining. \"Hey, isn't your office back there?\" She asks after a few minutes of silent walking. He shrugs, \"Didn't you know? Fancy magazine writers like me only work half-days.\" She laughs again, and he savours it. After too short of a time interval, they reach her destination. She turns to face him, removing her grip on his arm. \"Thanks for coffee,\" She tells him, although they both know that she isn't just thanking him for that, \"We're going to have to go again sometime. My treat.\" He grins, \"Definitely.\" \"I'll-uh- see you, I guess?\" \"I'll be around,\" He affirms, shoving his hands into his pockets and rocking back on his heels casually. She starts to turn toward the building, then suddenly turns back to him. Before he can ask what she's going to do, her arms encircle his neck in a hug he wishes weren't so friendly. He hugs her back before she pulls back, leaving a quick peck on his cheek. \"Thanks again,\" She smiles, reaching out to squeeze his hand quickly before turning and proceeding into the building, turning back slightly at the top of the stairs to wave once more. He raises his hand in farewell, putting all of his effort into smiling normally. Once the door closes behind her, Nate turns and walks back the way they came, feeling the slight tingle of his cheek where her lips had been, and wishing once again that he hadn't just waited around.

Liv had married Daniel and Emma was a little surprised to find that she held no resentment toward the happy newlyweds. Her selfless heart was full with pride and genuine happiness for her friends. Watching the way her best friend looked into her new husband's eyes as they danced together, Emma couldn't help but realize that the way that Daniel looked at Liv was not the way Fletcher had looked at her. Although she knew Liv had only been trying to plant a poisonous seed of doubt in her head at the time, Emma also realized that Liv had been right, and that she really had been settling with her ex-fiancÃ©. \"I want that,\" Nate said suddenly, voicing Emma's own thoughts, as they danced together and watched the bride and groom from across the room. Emma looked at Nate affectionately and smiled. She vowed at that moment to never tell Liv about Nate's moment of jealousy toward his baby sister. Most things she told Liv without a second thought, but she could keep this one a secret. For Nathan. \"They do make it look pretty good, don't they,\" Emma agreed with a little half-smile. \"Oh, jeesh,\" Nate scoffed, looking at Emma guiltily. \"I'm sorry, Em. In the midst of all the . . . uh, insanity . . . I completely forgot . . .\" Emma looked at him curiously and he sighed, \"That should have been you today too. I'm sorry. I can't believe we've all been soâ\" \"No, no ,\" Emma said sternly, stopping Nate's sputtering apology. \"You know what? Giving Liv away at the altar and standing beside her for all of this?\" She looked over to her best friend, who was looking back at her with a bright smile and a slight wave. \"There's honestly no place I'd rather be than right here with her today.\" She looked at Nathan to find him smiling at her with an odd expression. \"What?\" she asked self-consciously. \"You're really amazing, you know that?\" he asked, sounding well and truly in awe of her. \"What? Why do say that?\" she asked. Nathan tilted his head to the side in a reluctant manner. \"Well, not to rub salt in open wounds or anything, but you call off your fairytale wedding to the guy you've been in love with for ten years, and then immediately after that, you walk your best friend âwho you've been at war with for the last three months â down the aisle so that she can get married, and yet you feel no resentment, you're completely put together, and I can see it in your eyes that you're genuinely happy for her,\" Nate explained, the amazement never wavering in his tone. \"You have got to be the most selfless person I've ever known, Emma. You always have been.\" After a moment he added, \"Although that's probably a good thing since I don't think you could have been friends with my sister for twenty years if you weren't.\" Emma gasped indignantly on Liv's behalf and slapped Nate's chest. \"Be nice!\" she scolded. \"Liv is who she is and we love her for it. Don't forget that.\" Nate laughed. \"As if she'd ever let me,\" he joked with a shrug. Emma gave a shrug of her own. \"No, the truth is, I'm too proud of her to be resentful. She found a great guy who understands her and accepts her for who she is, and who loves her almost as much as we do.\" \"And there you go again, being amazing!\" Nate said, taking a step back and holding his hands out to gesture towards her. He took her hands again and, after twirling her around, pulled her back to him. \"Just remember that I've known you as long as Liv has, and almost as well as she does. Just don't forget that it's okay to be sad too, okay?\" \"Tell you what,\" Emma replied coyly, stepping closer to Nate to wrap her arm around his neck while he held her other hand in his, \"tonight, I'll celebrate Liv and Daniel. Tomorrow, I'll be sad and confused and try to sort out the mess I've made of my life. Deal?\" She held out her hand to him like they were in a board room at a conference rather than in a ball room at a wedding reception. He took her hand. \"Deal. Just remember, you're not alone, okay? You need anything, you give me a call. I'll be there,\" Nate promised her. Emma smiled, but there was a light in her eyes that seemed to change all of a sudden and, as if realizing it for the first time, she said, \"You always have been.\" Emma felt a sudden arm around her shoulders and she turned her head to see Liv looking at her contently. \"Hey,\" she greeted. \"Is my brother giving you grief?\" \"No,\" Emma answered, as if the idea were preposterous. She set her head on Liv's shoulder and felt Liv rest her cheek against her hair. \"We were just talking about all the trouble we're going to get into while you guys are on your honeymoon!\" \"Actually,\" Daniel began slowly, \"Liv and I were talking about that and . . . you know, maybe we should postpone the honeymoon until things settle down.\" Emma lifted her head from Liv's shoulder to look at her. \"What things?\" Liv tilted her head from side to side with a pained expression. \"Well . . . you know, things with . . youâ\" \"âAnd Fletcher,\" Daniel added helpfully. Emma gave him an incredulous look. \"Come on, do you really think we'd leave you here by yourself after you just called off your wedding and broke up with Fletcher?\" \"Daniel, Liv,\" Emma began sternly, \"listen to me very carefully.\" Emma folded her hands together and pointed at them. \"The two of you? Yeah, you're going on your honeymoon, tonight. And I will be fine.\" As Liv was about to interrupt, Emma held up an uncharacteristically assertive hand to silence her. \"No. I will be. You'll be gone two weeks, and when you get back, I'll still be here and I'll be fine. Go to Barbados and have fun .\" \"You're sure?\" Liv asked, looking imploringly into her best friend's eyes. \"Yes,\" Emma answered, leaving no room for argument. Daniel sighed. \"Well, in that case, do you still have your key to our apartment?\" he asked. Momentarily thrown for a loop, Emma's brow crinkled in confusion. \"Yeah. Why?\" \"Because, we need a house-sitter and you might need a place to stay until you and Fletcher figure out what you're going to do with the apartment,\" he pointed out. \"Who better to watch the apartment than someone who's already lived there?\" Emma felt tears spring to her eyes and she wrapped an arm around Liv and Daniel's necks. \"Thank you,\" she whispered with tears falling from her eyes. Eventually, Emma pulled away and laughed at her emotional self. She wiped tears from her eyes embarrassedly and let out a breath she hadn't known she had been holding. \"Ha. Well, thank you. I guess you'll be leaving soon, huh?\" Liv touched Emma's bicep supportively. \"You'll call if you need anything, right? Day or night? Even if you know I'm halfway around the world, if I hear your ringtone, you know I'll answer,\" she said. Feeling those pesky tears welling again, Emma nodded. \"I know,\" she said. Liv wrapped her up in another hug and she squeezed back just as tightly. \"Ooh. I love you.\" \"I love you,\" Liv returned, rubbing her thumb across Emma's cheek. She scrunched her nose and leaned her forehead momentarily against Emma's before turning her attention to her big brother. \"And I love you too, big brother,\" she added, pulling Nate into a hug. Into his ear she whispered, \"Please take care of her. Care , not advantage. Hagen Das chocolate fudge ice cream. The Breakfast Club, Can't Buy Me Love, and The Wedding Date . Kurt Cobain. I'll text you further instructions.\" \"Okay. I love you. Please leave,\" Nate replied with a laugh. To Daniel, he mouthed, \"Take her.\" Meanwhile, Emma had given Daniel a hug, telling him to, \"Take care of our girl,\" as well. \"I will, I promise,\" Daniel replied, understanding that if anything happened to Liv on his watch, he would not only have his own guilt to deal with but also Emma's wrath which he had seen plenty of in recent weeks. He preferred his hair brown instead of blue. \"Okay, go. Go and have a good time, and thanks again for letting me stay at your apartment. I swear, I'll be out before you get back,\" Emma promised. Liv gave Emma one last one-armed hug. \"Sweetie, don't worry about it. You can stay as long as you need to,\" Liv told her. \"But if you are out before we get back then I won't hold it against you.\" Emma laughed as she and Nate walked the newlyweds out to the limo waiting outside to take them to the airport. Nate opened the door for his sister and new brother-in-law and waited until they were both safely in. \"We'll see you when you get back. Remember to have fun, but not too much!\" Nate told them sternly. He flashed a smile before he closed the door. Liv rolled the window down and called out, \"I love you! I'll see you in two weeks!\" Nate and Emma stood shoulder to shoulder, watching the limousine drive away until the painted letters that spelled 'just married' on the back windshield were too small to read and the then the car disappeared around the corner. \"No tin cans,\" Nate commented disappointedly. Emma looked at him oddly. \" What ?\" she asked. Nate pointed to where the back bumper of the limo had been only minutes ago. \"There's supposed to be cans tied to the back of the limousine, right? Liv probably thought it was tacky,\" he clarified. He leaned back and smiled while shoving his hands into his pockets. \"She's going to have a fit when there are cans tied to the limousine at my wedding.\" With a quirked eyebrow, Emma asked disbelievingly, \" You have plans for your wedding?\" Nate gave a short nod. \"Sure I do,\" he replied. \"You think I grew up with Liv as my sister and didn't learn anything about weddings?\" Emma was quiet as she looked at Nate for several more seconds. \"You wanna get a coffee and you can tell me all about what your wedding is going to be like? Or are you hoping to have slutty wedding sex with a drunk bridesmaid?\" \"Uh, well, the drunk bridesmaids are all daughters of my editor, so I think I'm gonna pass on that one,\" he answered, scratching the back of his neck. \"Coffee sounds great.\" Later that same night, after being regaled with Nate's ideal wedding over a cup of coffee, Nate had walked Emma back to Daniel and Liv's apartment. Emma knew that under different circumstances, she might have felt weird coming home to an apartment that wasn't hers, but since it once had been, she had lost that sense of strangeness. She put her key into the lock and opened the door, before she turned back to see Nate hesitating in the doorway. \"You wanna come inside?\" Emma asked, thinking it was odd that Nate hadn't been right behind her in the first place. \"You sure you don't want some time to yourself?\" Nate asked respectfully. The reality of her situation came back to hit Emma like a ton of bricks. \"Yeah, I'm sure. Come on in,\" she told him, leaving the door open behind him. She flipped on the lights and stepped into the kitchen, glancing at the clock on the stove. It's digital green glow glared one a.m. back at her. She thought about what she would be doing right now if she had gone through with her wedding to Fletcher, but she almost immediately shook the thought from her mind. It was sad, but it didn't even strike her as strange that she didn't feel heartbroken or upset, just confused and lost and oddly free. \"Em? You okay?\" Nate asked from behind her, and for a moment, Emma could almost pretend it was Liv asking her that question. That they were back in high school and Emma's first boyfriend had just dumped her at the Sadie Hawkins Dance. Emma turned to look at Nate. \"I'm . . . \" fine . That was what she was about to say anyway, but she looked at Nate and his concerned face and his honest eyes and she realized how much of a lie that was. In all honesty, she wasn't fine. This was supposed to be the best day of her life and instead she was husband-less, homeless, and, as of the coming Friday, she would be jobless too as school would soon be letting out for the summer. As Emma thought more about it though, she realized she hadn't been ' fine' in a long time. She hadn't been happy . \"Nate, I don't think I'm fine,\" Emma said suddenly, her voice breaking on the final word. Nathan Lerner, the man who had known Emma practically her whole life, nodded in understanding. \"Their plane hasn't taken off yet, I don't think. Do you want me to call Liv?\" he asked. Emma tried to catch her breath against the onslaught of tears as she lowered herself shakily to sit on the sofa. She shook her head 'no', even as the tears rolled down her cheeks. This was Liv and Daniel's time; it wasn't their fault it had taken Emma until the day of her wedding to realize that Fletcher wasn't right for her. \"Do you want to be alone?\" Nate asked. Emma shook her head 'no' again, despite knowing that Nate probably wanted to bolt from her sobbing, messy, would-have-been bride self right now. Then Nate said something that surprised her. \"Do you need me to be your backup-Liv?\" he asked, and she suddenly looked up at him. She expected him to be smiling at his joke, but he wasn't. His face was serious and he had since been hedging toward the sofa. Finally, once the shock wore off and the reality set in, Emma nodded and let a sob break forth from her chest. Nate sat down next to her and wrapped his arms around her. For a long time, he just held her while she cried and cried and cried. Emma cried for the ten years of her life she had lost that she would never get back. She cried for all the damage she had done to Liv's wedding all because of a wedding that she now realized had been doomed from the beginning. She cried because she was lost and she had no idea how to even begin finding her way. She only stopped crying when she had no tears left in her to cry. All the while Nate held her and rubbed her shoulder and told her all the things that he knew his sister would have said had she been there. He guessed he should have felt guilty for comforting the should-have-been bride of a guy he had called his friend, but he had known and cared for and felt loyalty toward Emma for much longer than Fletcher had ever been in the picture. Comforting Emma felt like the most natural thing in the world. Nate had two people in his life that he loved more than anything else: Liv and Emma. It had been that way for as long as he could remember. If sides had to be taken, then Nate would be in Emma's corner, no debate about it. \"I'm in your corner,\" he said out loud, just so Emma would know. \"What?\" she asked, picking her head up off his shoulder to look at him. \"No matter what happens, I'm in your corner, Em,\" he told her again. \"The next two weeks, it's gonna be you and me. We're gonna dust you off, put you back on your feet, set you going in the right direction. You and me, Em.\" \"Nate, you don't have to do that,\" Emma told him, shaking her head while tears of gratitude welled in her eyes. \"It's what Liv would do and, since I'm your Stand-in Liv for the next two weeks, that's what we're going to do,\" he said firmly, leaving no room for argument. He heaved himself off the couch. \"Starting with breakfast.\" He offered his hand out to her to help her off the couch as well. \"Come on, I make some crazy good french toast.\" \"I have to admit,\" Emma said, wiping the corner of her mouth with her napkin, \"I've never had french toast and coffee with brandy for breakfast.\" Nate looked at her with wide-eyes, like he had had no idea. \"Seriously? It's what all us single folk have for breakfast when we're wallowing in self-pity,\" he said. \"Uh-huh. And what do 'single folk' eat when they're feeling particularly motivated to get their lives back on track?\" Emma asked. Nate pretended to think about it for a moment. \"Huh. I don't know. I don't think that's ever happened before,\" he joked. Emma smiled. \"Okay, so what's phase two of this master plan of yours?\" she asked. \"What makes you think there's a master plan?\" Nate asked, standing and gathering his and Emma's dishes to rinse them before putting them in the dishwasher. \"You're Stand-in Liv,\" Emma replied simply. \"Liv always has a master plan. Don't you know that?\" \"Well I do, yes,\" Nate agreed. He leaned on his forearms across the table toward Emma. \"Which is why phase two involves embracing your newly acquired freedom. What have you always wanted to do that Fletcher never went along with?\" \"Can there be a list?\" Emma asked wryly, setting her head in her hand on the table. Nate smiled and opened a drawer at the breakfast island and pulled out a pad of paper, which he threw down on the table in in front of Emma. He gave her a roguish smile and offered her a pen. \"There can be a whole book,\" he answered. Emma wrote down everything she had ever wanted to do that Fletcher had said no to, which ended up amounting to a three-page list of prohibited activities. When she couldn't think of any others, she turned the paper pad around and pushed it back across the table to Nathan, who had been reading the newspaper with unusual patience. He looked at it and smiled. \"Paint the kitchen cupboards black,\" he read, then he looked up at her. \"We might have to find you your own apartment before we do that one. My sister would have a head fit if she came home and her cupboards were black.\" His eyes returned to the list. \"Sing show tunes in the park, that one we can do. Ride a motorcycle?\" \"He always starts telling me about how many accidents happen per year due to motorcycles,\" Emma explained. Nate smiled. \"I've got a buddy with a bike,\" he said. \"He lives outside the city but we could take a train out.\" His eyes went back to the list. \"Toss a coin into a wishing well?\" \"Fletcher thought it was a waste of money.\" \"Pick flowers from the public botanical gardens?\" \"Illegal, I know, but sometimes they're just really pretty and I want to take them home.\" \"Shout from a rooftop,\" Nate said. He looked at her. \"Seriously? You've never shouted from a rooftop in New York?\" Emma shrugged. \"Fletcher always said it was obnoxious,\" she answered. Nate rolled his eyes. \"Okay, we have got to get started on this list before you die an unhappy and unfulfilled life,\" he told her. \"Get dressed. We're going to start living.\" That day, Emma did all the things she had been wanting to do for years; stupid, silly little things that she never would have done with Fletcher, but were somehow so easy to do with Nathan. By the end of the day, Emma realized that while yesterday was supposed to be the best day of her life, today was exactly that. It was both a surprise and not a surprise at all, that throughout all of it, Nathan was right there beside her, egging her on to have fun and live life. \"Okay, so,\" Nathan said as they sat on Liv's couch with Nate on one end and Emma sitting sideways with her legs stretched out and her feet stopping just short of Nate's outer thigh, \"out of the one-hundred-and-three items on your list, today we managed to complete . . . drum roll please . . .\" â Emma patted her hands against her thighs as he crossed off the final one â \"thirty-eight.\" \"Aww,\" Emma groaned. \"We suck.\" \"Hey, now! Rome wasn't built in a day, you know,\" Nate argued. \"I think we did pretty good for a Sunday afternoon. I mean, if you break it down, we managed to fit three and a third years' worth of missed opportunities into a twelve hour span. That's pretty good.\" \"Well, when you put it like that . . .\" Emma conceded, picking up a carton of Hagen Das chocolate fudge ice cream and a spoon from the coffee table. She pretended to turn her attention to The Wedding Date that was playing on the television. \"Tomorrow's my last Monday of the school year,\" she mentioned. \"But I took the week off for my honeymoon. I wonder if it's too late to cancel the sub and go in.\" \"I'm sure Deb wouldn't mind taking the week off if you wanted to cover her class,\" Nate joked, having heard all about Deb Delgado shirking all her responsibilities onto Emma. Emma looked at him. \"That's actually not a bad idea,\" she said. \"I was kidding. Look, take the day off tomorrow, I'll take it off with you, and you can call the school and cancel the sub for the rest of the week,\" Nathan suggested. \"I'll go with you to get your stuff from the apartment and we'll look for a new one.\" \"You'd go apartment hunting with me?\" Emma asked skeptically. Nate pointed to himself. \"Stand-in Liv, remember? Would she do it? Yes. So that's what I'm going to do,\" he said plainly. He leaned forward and grabbed the newspaper off the coffee table, and continued, \"I even took the liberty of circling some potential prospects within walking distance of both the school and here. Look, this one is even right around the corner from your favorite coffee place. You could grab coffee on your way to work.\" Emma looked at Nathan, who was still looking at the newspaper. \"It is. How did you know Sylvia's Cup was my favorite coffee place?\" she asked. \"Huh? Oh, I've just seen you holding a coffee cup from Sylvia's a lot when I meet up with you and Liv,\" he answered distractedly. Emma smiled, resting her elbow on the back of the couch and putting her head in her hand as she looked at Nate in awe. He knew her favorite coffee place from the coffee cup she was holding. He'd taken note of something so small. Why? Emma questioned. She had been with Fletcher ten years and even he hadn't known that. Emma wondered vaguely if even Liv knew that little factoid. It left Emma wondering, what else did Nate know about her that no one else did? ","Summary":" Despite her own ruined nuptials, Emma considered the night a success.

I really hope it doesn't suck! It's set about a week after the last instalment, even if this is posted like two years after I wrote that oneâ¦ Disclaimer: still isn't mine. Coffee 3 (keeping up with the really creative titles!) He's just slipped beneath the covers when his phone vibrates, signalling a call. Groaning, he debates ignoring it and going to sleep as he planned, but figures that if it's his boss he'll probably have to hear all about it in the morning, so he throws the covers back, pads across the carpet, and snatches up the phone from his dresser. This isn't the first time his boss has called him in the middle of the night, and he's sure it won't be the last; it's the only reason he leaves his phone on all the time. He made the mistake of turning it off once and was treated to a half hour lecture about dependability. \"Hello?\" He answers without checking the caller ID, making sure to insert over-the-top sleepiness into his voice. Just because he has to answer the phone doesn't mean he can't try to make her feel guilty for calling so late. \"Nate? Were you sleeping? I'm so sorry!\" He's immediately wide awake as he recognizes the voice. It isn't his boss. \"No, no. I was awake. I just thought you were my boss.\" She laughs, \"Booty call?\" His face immediately reddens, even though he's alone. \"I wish. That would be far more pleasant than having to endure her 'inspirational ideas' that will take the magazine to the next level!\" He exclaimed, in perfect imitation of his boss. She laughs again, and he smiles in return, even though she can't see it. As silence falls between them and all he can hear on the other end of the line is her soft breathing, he remembers that it's the middle of the night. \"Is everything ok, Em?\" He asks, suddenly concerned. She wouldn't call this late if it wasn't important, but on the other hand, if it was urgent, she wouldn't have left telling him this late into the conversation. Her small intake of breath lets him know that she is trying to decide how to say whatever it is. \"I'm sorry, I don't know why I called you. Normally I'd call Liv, but she's still on her honeymoon and even if she wasn't, she's still a newlywed and I feel like my problems would just depress her and she doesn't need that right now, and-\" \"Emma, it's ok,\" He interrupts her, \"Really.\" \"No, you were going to bed and its midnight and I really shouldn't-\" \"Emma, seriously, it's fine. What do you need?\" He interrupts again. All thoughts of going to sleep are now gone. Truth be told, he's happy she called him. \"It's stupid. I just can't sleep and usually I call Liv, like I said, but-\" \"Whoa, slow down. It's fine, Em.\" \"No, you know what? I just need to get out of the apartment for a bit, take a walk. I'll be fine. I'm sorry I bothered you, Nate.\" \"Emma, would you stop apologizing? Look, why don't you meet me at Harvey's?\" He asks, already slipping on his coat and heading to the door, thankful he hasn't yet changed for bed. He knows what's coming and is two steps ahead of her. \"And I'm already out the door so don't say no.\" Her sigh signals his triumph and he grins as he steps into the cool night air. Harvey's is halfway between their apartments, something they discovered coincidentally about three years back. They'd made it a point to meet up at least once every couple of weeks after that. He likes the cozy little 24 hour diner, despite Liv calling it an infestation of disease when Emma brought her along one night. When he arrives, he finds her already seated in the corner booth and heads over. Before he can do more than give a quick 'hey' the extremely unlucky waitress pulling the night shift approaches eagerly. In her defence, they're probably the only customers she'll get all night. \"Can I get a coffee, black, please?\" He asks. Emma scans the menu for a moment more before seeming to throw caution to the wind and smiling up at the waitress as she says, \"Make mine an Irish.\" His eyebrows shoot up even as he tries to control his surprise. Emma rarely drinks coffee, let alone alcohol. \"You want to tell me what's up?\" He asks after a few minutes of silence in which the waitress brings their drinks. \"It's stupid, really. Fletcher, uh, he came to get some clothes today, and talk about what we wanted to do with the apartment,\" she says finally, staring out the window. He nods. \"What did you guys decide?\" \"We still have a few months left on the lease, so he said I could stay there if I wanted but I-\" She pauses, trying to control her emotions, \"I just can't. So he's going to move back in after I find a place. I just don't really know what I'm supposed to do next, you know? I haven't had to worry about finding an apartment for years, and nowâ¦\" \"Hey,\" he says softly, reaching out and touching her arm lightly, \"It's going to be ok. You're not alone in this. You have help.\" She tries to smile and almost succeeds, \"Yeah, I just don't want to be a burden. Especially not to Liv when she and Daniel are in this new stage.\" \"And what am I? Chopped liver?\" He asks, grinning. She smiles for real this time, grasping onto the humorous direction the conversation has taken. \"Well you have bigger priorities in your life than helping the damsel in distress. You work, what, three days next week?\" \"Four, actually,\" he replies, laughing. He takes a quick drink of his coffee before returning to the seriousness of before. \"Really, though. Anything you need, I'm here for you. Think of me as your back-up Liv.\" This time her smile is more grateful and appreciative than humorous, and she reaches across the table to squeeze his hand lightly. \"Thank you. Really.\" They fall into a comfortable silence for a while as the waitress files her nails behind the register, shooting them not so inconspicuous glances every so often. \"So, tell me about you. What's going on in your life?\" She asks abruptly. Caught off guard, he shrugs. \"Nothing much.\" \"Oh, come on. There has to be something . Maybe a prospective bride?\" She hints, grinning. He laughs to cover his discomfort and embarrassment, shaking his head. \"What? Seriously? Why not?\" He shrugs again, trying to think of a way to change the subject. \"I just haven't met anyone recently?\" She shakes her head in disbelief. \"I don't believe that at all.\" \"Why not? You've met the women I work with.\" She lets out a short laugh. \"I guess that's true.\" They sit in silence for a bit, each wrapped up in their own thoughts. He covertly studies the sadness in Emma's eyes as she stares at the coffee in her hand. It isn't as pronounced as it once was, but it's still there. Fletcher's visit definitely didn't help, but she's slowly healing. He has to remind himself that it will take time. Fletcher was her life for ten years, and that isn't something that can be easily erased. His words in the tux rental shop echo in his head. Sometimes I think I wait around too long . Now, he's not so sure. If he waits for a while longer, maybe she'll see him the way he has seen her since they were teenagers. Maybe he'll finally get the happy ending he's secretly imagined for years. Provided she chooses him, of course. For now, though, he'll have to keep waiting. He can be there for her; he wants to be there for her. It's already been over ten years; a little longer won't kill him. \"Nate?\" Her voice brings him back to the present. She's moved her head in an attempt to get his attention. He blinks in surprise. \"Sorry, zoned out. What were you saying?\" \"Nothing, you just looked far away. Everything OK?\" He grins, \"Everything's fine.\" He chooses that moment to yawn, despite his attempt to stop it. She shoots him a knowing look. \"You're tired,\" she states. \"I shouldn't have called you so late. I'm-\" He holds up a hand. \"No, don't apologize. If I wanted to be at home right now, I would be.\" \"We should probably get going, though,\" she tells him, and he can swear there's a hint of regret in her voice, \"It's nearly two in the morning.\" Once again, time has gotten away from them. Time always seems to fly when he's with Emma. He nods, \"Probably a good idea.\" They stand and he drops some cash on the table, along with a healthy tip for the poor waitress who now looks like she's about to fall asleep. Emma protests, but he waves her off, telling her she can get the next one. His stomach fills with warmth as she agrees to a next time. He knows it's dangerous, letting these feelings out again after so long, but he can't help it. He thought she was lost to him, but then Fletcher turned away the best thing that would probably ever happen to the man. He can't help but hope that this is his chance. She shoots him a warm smile as they part ways at the corner, dismissing his offer to see her safely home. He settles for the promise of a text message when she arrives safely after ensuring one of his own. Receiving it and typing out a quick reply, he rolls over in his bed and falls asleep smiling slightly. She'll be okay eventually, and he'll drink as much coffee and wait as long as it takes until that happens. A/N: Ok, so I know it's short, but there was really nothing else I wanted to have happen, and it's taken me so long to get this right that I figured that was enough progress for one installment.

Coffee 2 (because I can't come up with a more creative title) He sits watching the dance floor where his sister spins around and around, laughing and basking in the joy of being a newlywed. He won't admit it, but part of him is jealous that she is the one to be married first. He's had to withstand a fair share of pitying gazes tonight, people wondering when this will be his wedding. He gives the same answer every time: When he finds the right woman. Speaking of the right woman, he watches as Daniel pulls Liv closer, whispering something in her ear that makes her laugh loudly, smacking him on the arm. She breaks away from him to pull Emma from the fringes of the floor, swinging their arms like they did when they were little. He smiles lightly, glad to see them enjoying themselves, however he can tell that all of this happiness is starting to wear Emma down. Everyone seems to forget that Emma was supposed to be married today as well. After the song ends, Emma pulls Liv closer, hugging her tightly before walking off the dance floor, looking slightly relieved. Nate watches as she makes her way over to a chair in the far corner of the room, dropping her chin into her hand as she takes in the happily oblivious crowd. Before he can stop himself, he's weaving through the people towards her. About halfway across the dance floor he realizes what he's doing and stops before he can make an even bigger fool of himself. She is grieving over her lost marriage; she doesn't need him in the way. A short while later, he decides he's had enough of standing around and watching her put on a brave face. He takes a deep breath and approaches her from behind. Over the noise of the music and the yelling, he's surprised that she notices his sudden presence. She looks at him expectantly, as though waiting for the heartfelt apology she knows must be coming. \"Want to dance?\" He asks instead, knowing that she doesn't want anyone else pitying her tonight. Her response is only slightly delayed, and when she gives it, she sounds relieved. \"Yes.\" She places her hand in his and he leads her onto the dance floor. She fits easily into his arms, and he smiles to himself to think that it feels right , although he knows such thoughts are wrong. Up until a couple of hours ago, Emma was walking down the aisle, in love with another man; there's no way she's thinking the same things he is at this moment. In fact, she's probably thinking about how she wishes he were Fletcher, and about how she isn't supposed to be here right now. She's probably thinking of how she is supposed to be in the room across the hall, sharing the same dances with her new husband as Liv is sharing with Daniel at this very moment. These thoughts bother him more than he would have imagined, and so he pushes them away, concentrating on the woman in front of him. She looks as though she's stuck in her mind, reliving the past few days over and over again, wondering how they all led to this point. \"You know, I really think this hairstyle suits you,\" He comments, before he can stop himself. This will probably only bring up thoughts of things she doesn't want to think about, and he regrets the words the instant they leave his lips. Instead of the expected reaction, however, Emma raises an eyebrow and says, \"Oh really? You think so?\" He nods, grinning at her as he replies, \"Definitely. You should try for the fluffed poodle look more often. It brings out your eyes.\" She throws her head back as she laughs, and the sound makes his smile widen. When she recovers, he notices that they are much closer together than before, but he makes no effort to change that. \"I would,\" She says, still laughing slightly, \"But it takes two hours, a bottle of hairspray, and a hundred dollars.\" His eyes widen. \"The lengths women go to for hair that great.\" She nods, \"I know. It's shocking.\" He grins and shakes his head, catching Liv and Daniel in some sort of good-natured argument. He sees Liv glance over at him and realizes what they're talking about. Of course she won't be able to keep her nose out of this. Not that there is a this . If there ever is a this , it will be in the distant future. After a couple more songs, they leave the dance floor, exhausted, and collapse into chairs. Emma laughs to herself and he smiles. He's glad she's happy for now. \"It's hot in here. You want to go get some air?\" She asks, fanning herself with her hand and exhaling loudly. He nods and tries to ignore the look he can feel Liv giving them as they leave the Plaza banquet hall. She can mind her own business, for once. They sit outside for a long while, enjoying the warm night. Neither of them says a word until finally she speaks. \"You know, I still owe you that coffee.\" He doesn't look at her as he grins, replying, \"You do.\" Nothing else needs to be said as she rises from the bench, grinning slightly. He's surprised she brought it up, but goes with it. He suspects that she doesn't want to go back inside and watch the remaining people happily dancing and laughing. He can't blame her. He's happy for Liv, just as Emma is, but seeing the people watching him isn't appealing anymore. They take advantage of the beautiful night, walking down the street at a leisurely pace until they find a coffee shop. It must look odd, a man in a suit and a woman in a disheveled wedding dress, strolling down the sidewalk as though they have all the time in the world to arrive at their destination, and it must look even odder to the cashier at the small diner, but neither of them cares. They seat themselves in a small booth with red fabric covering the seats, ripping at the seams. He picks up a menu, mostly to have something to look at, and she mirrors the action. Studying the choices, he realizes something and looks up at her, suppressing a grin. \"You know, they don't have anything unpronounceable on this menu.\" A hint of a smile breaks out on her face as her eyes scan down to the bottom of the menu. \"It appears you're right. Guess I'm going to have to go with something moreâ¦ traditional.\" 'Traditional' turns out to be regular orange pekoe tea. He orders his usual black coffee and studies her as they wait for their drinks. She's tired, he can tell. The weeks of stress and struggle have taken their toll on her, and he knows she can't wait to sleep tonight. Although, he's sure that at the same time she doesn't want to go back to her apartment and risk running into Fletcher. As their drinks arrive, he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket. He takes it out as inconspicuously as he can manage, checking the caller ID. Fletcher. He knows that he is supposed to be the guy's friend, but he can't manage friendly at the moment. He knows it's wrong to feel this much resentment toward the man; after all, he hasn't really done anything wrong, except being a complete ass. He presses 'Ignore' and slides the phone back into his pocket, returning his attention to Emma. \"You know, you could have taken that. If they're calling this late, it must be important.\" \"Nah, it wasn't important,\" He replies, shaking his head. The waitress comes with their drinks, interrupting whatever her reply might have been. He watches as she proceeds to dump two creams and sugars into the tea, and then wraps her hands around the mug. She studies the swirling liquid for a moment before looking up to meet his eyes. \"I'm sorry it turned out like this,\" He says, knowing the words won't make up for what's happened. \"Me too,\" She whispers. For a while they sit in silence, but it isn't uncomfortable. He takes comfort in her presence, and knows she feels the same. He isn't sure when it happens, but suddenly he realizes that they're talking and laughing easily. It's almost as though nothing has happened, but there is always that slight tension that reminds him. Her shoulders remain set and her eyes betray a hint of sadness, but otherwise she's perfectly normal. If he didn't know her so well, he would think she was perfectly fine. \"Ok, so be straight with me,\" He finally says, turning the conversation down a more serious avenue, \"How are you?\" As soon as he says it he knows it was a stupid way to phrase the question. How should she be expected to be doing? She shrugs, not angering as he expects her to. It's the first time he's been surprised by her reaction. Her next words only shock him more. \"I don't know, I guess I'm surprised. I thought I'd feel moreâ¦ well, more anything, really. I'm not all that sad. Mostly relieved. I keep feeling like I shouldn't feel like that, but I can't bring myself to be sad that it's over anymore. I was at first, but now I justâ¦ I don't know.\" She stares at her mug while he processes her words. The fingers of her right hand are wrapped around the handle, while her left fingers barely brush the base of the ceramic cup. He doesn't fail to notice that light no longer glints off an engagement ring. She scoffs suddenly, raising her mug to take a drink as she looks out the window. He sees tears shining in her eyes, and reaches out automatically to rest his hand over hers across the table. Her lips curl upward slightly, but no words pass between them. They sit in silence for a long while before finally deciding to leave the dingy diner behind them. She puts a couple of bills on the table to pay for the coffee and they proceed to the door. Once outside, they turn aimlessly down streets, neither wanting to return home to empty apartments for the night. He knows she's thinking of where she would be now, if she hadn't called off her engagement. She claims to be alright with it, but he knows her better than she thinks. He believes that she does feel relief to some degree, but he also knows that she does feel sadness and regret as the reality of her actions begins to sink in. He knows that she is starting to panic as she finally processes the fact that she has thrown out ten years of her life. When they finally come to a stop, they've reached her apartment. Looking at his watch covertly, he discovers that it is nearly two in the morning. They left the wedding at 11:30. She stares up at the window belonging to her apartment and sighs. Fletcher won't be there; they agreed that he would only stop by to get a few things and stay with a friend until everything was sorted out. \"Hey,\" he says softly, capturing her attention, \"It'll be okay. You made the right decision.\" \"How do you know that?\" She asks, her eyes searching his for answers. He longs to tell her the real reason he feels that way, that it was the right decision because Fletcher wasn't good enough for her and never had been, but that won't help, not now. So, instead, he swallows his true feelings, because they aren't what she needs. They will only confuse her. \"Because if it wasn't, you wouldn't have done it.\" She attempts to smile in return and squeezes his hand. He hadn't even realized they were joined. \"I should probably go up and try to sleep. I'll talk to you tomorrow?\" She asks, almost hopeful. \"For sure,\" he replies. \"Thanks,\" she replies, smiling in earnest now. She leans in and wraps her arms around him. It's a different hug than last time. Last time, their embrace was brief, meant to reassure and support her. This time, it lingers, meant to comfort. She buries her head in his shoulder briefly before regaining her composure and pulling back, ascending the steps to her building and disappearing inside. Nate remains on the sidewalk until he sees the light in her apartment turn on, and then begins the trek home. Yes, he'll be there as long as she wants him to be. Liv will be gone for two weeks at least, and she'll need a friend. He can be that, he tells himself. He's already been her friend for how long, a little longer won't kill him.

Summary : A \"missing\" scene after Liv prematurely announces that she's engaged. ---- \"So you're really getting married,\" Emma said lightly as she entered the bar's bathroom where Liv was unsuccessfully trying to wash tequila off her chest. The blonde kept missing her skin with the damp paper towel, showing that she was well past tipsy. \"Mmâ¦yeah. Just has to ask me,\" Liv said with a slight slur, but her eyes were brightâ¦and glazedâ¦but all that mattered to Emma was the shining look of happiness. \"Congratulations,\" Emma tried to sound sincere, but couldn't quite pull it off. She was grateful her best friend was drunk. \"Are you gonnaâ¦miss me?\" \"You'll still be here, just as Mrs. Williams,\" Emma willed her hands to stop trembling. She had seen the look on Liv's face before, every time the blonde was drunk and got Emma into a room by themselves. After ever high school party with its ubiquitous illicit and cheap beer; after every college shindig with its spiked punch and beer kegs. Every time Liv would get smashed and act on her drunken impulses with Emma. A very sober and willing Emma. It even happened after their graduation, just with less frequency. So when Fletcher had asked her to move in with him, Emma jumped at the chance to escape. She wasn't in love with him, but she was in love with her newly engaged best friend. \"S'not what I meant and you know it,\" Liv tried her best to be seductive as she teetered unsteadily on her heels. Emma found it utterly endearing in the same odd way she always said yes. \"Are you going to miss me?\" Emma's breath left her as Liv surged forward, pushing the brunette against the wall as she planted a sloppy kiss on her. Liv's mouth tasted as sharp and salty as the shots of tequila she'd been downing like they were water. They kissed for what seemed like an eternity. When they pulled away, Emma's eyes fluttered open to see Liv's eyes dark with lust and her kiss-swollen lips. Emma wanted to dive back in, lose herself in sensation. But it would inevitably end. The next morning, Emma would get up early, creep out of Liv's bed and back to her own where she would curl up and cry. It was routine. But that routine was old, and times had changed. Neither of them lived alone, and Liv was getting married. \"We can't. What about Daniel? What about Fletcher?\" Emma protested, holding Liv at arms' length. \"It'd be like old times,\" Liv cajoled, pouting and batting her eyelashes like she'd done so many times before. \"Liv, we aren't kids anymore! You're engaged and I'm with Fletcher.\" \"You don't love him. No one can love you like I do!\" She shouted, stumbling back against the counter, her cheeks red and eyes blazing. She was furious, and Emma had always thought Liv looked beautiful while angry. \"Goodbye, Liv, and congratulations,\" Emma said tremulously, her lower lip trembling with the strong urge to cry. \"Just remember, Em. I'm always the bride,\" Liv called out, her voice a tumultuous mix of anger, hurt, and sadness. Emma was able to hold her tears until she successfully made it outside.

However, curiosity began to get the best of him when he dreamed of a beautiful woman calling to him. So when Charlene and Judson gave him time off from his job at the Metropolitan Public Library, the city he chose was New Orleans (after reading the travel brochure over again after Charlene left his apartment). What he didn't realize was that he was in for an adventure that would change his life forever. He had found the woman who had appeared in his dreams. He knew there was something about her that was alluring but couldn't quite put his hand on it. After spending one night he knew wanted her, but she disappeared the next morning. He searched for her but couldn't find her. Great just my luck, I find the one special person and she leaves me, it happened with Emily, Nicole, Katie, and now Simone. Acting out of character he begins to drink and flirt a lot with whomever. It had gotten so bad that he passed out in a deserted location; he never thought that someone would find him there. What seemed like an eternity, he woke up to find he was in a place that was dimly lit. \"Ah good you're awake, I made you some tea.\" \"What happened?\" asked Flynn in a dazed state with monster headache and hangover. \"Well I had sensed you were in trouble and came by to get you. When I found you were drunk beyond belief.\" \"Wait where am I?\" \"My place.\" Flynn had a weird look on his face and then he realized; now he know why Simone came out at night and why her face was cold.

While he checked Simone put something else she had planned into motion; tonight she was going make him his. Just as he was satisfied that he had no puncture marks on his neck he heard a song begin to play. He turned around and his knees nearly buckled. There was Simone in an enthralling red low cut v-neck dress with a look of lust on her face. What on earth is going on? Then he heard her sing once more. Under a lovers' sky Gonna be with you And no one's gonna be around If you think that you won't fall Well just wait until Til the sun goes down Underneath the starlight - starlight There's a magical feeling - so right It'll steal your heart tonight You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark You'll surrender your heart But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight No, you can't fight it It's gonna get to your heart There's no escape from love Once a gentle breeze Weaves it's spell upon your heart No matter what you think It won't be too long Til your in my arms Underneath the starlight - starlight We'll be lost in the rhythm - so right Feel it steal your heart tonight You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark You'll surrender your heart But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight No you can't fight it No matter what you do The night is gonna get to you Don't try then You're never gonna win Underneath the starlight - starlight There's a magical feeling - so right It will steal your heart tonight You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark You'll surrender your heart But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight No, you can't fight it You can try to resist Try to hide from my kiss But you know Don't you know that you can't fight the moonlight Deep in the dark You'll surrender your heart But you know But you know that you can't fight the moonlight No, you can't fight it It's gonna get to your heart What Flynn hadn't realized was that as Simone sang she had walked towards him like she was stalking her prey causing him to walk backwards.

He'd just had a complete meltdown in front Judson and Charlene. He was sick of The Library ruling his life. He felt overworked and underappreciated. Hadn't he given enough for the The Library? Didn't he deserve to have some of the things he wanted? Nicole had said a similar thing to him once. At the time he'd thought nothing was more important than The Library, but she had seen past it, and he'd lost her because he couldn't. Now he'd reached that place she'd been, unfortunately he was a couple of years too late... xxx It was over, they'd retrieved the artifact and made it out alive. Back in their motel room they could finally relax, or so Flynn had hoped. \"I'm done with The Library,\" Nicole declared, as she shoved her belongings into her bag, clearly she was upset. Her agitation was understandable after what they'd just been through, it was a closer call than usual. \"You're just upset,\" Flynn assured her, she didn't really mean she was done with The Library, once she'd calmed down she'd be alright. \"No, it's different this time. I won't do it anymore,\" she said as she continued to 'pack' her bag. But then she stopped, halfway through shoving a shirt in the badly arranged duffle and turned to face him. \"I really thought you were going to die.\" Her voice was softer now, and she looked as vulnerable as he'd ever seen her. \"But I didn't, we made it out,\" Flynn said with a grin, hoping to lighten her frightening mood. Her face didn't change, she was past messing around. He went to her, wrapping his arms around her and she felt different. Usually she was the tough one, but in this moment she clung to him as though he was the one who did the protecting. It gave him a bad feeling, it wasn't that he didn't want to comfort her, he did, it was the fact that she allowed it which worried him. He pressed his lips to her forehead but it wasn't enough. He leaned down and kissed her mouth, needing to reassure himself as much as wanting to reassure her. He wanted to feel the powerful demanding way she kissed him, he wanted to feel that it was still the same. But it was different and Flynn pulled away to search her face. \"I want you to resign as Librarian,\" Nicole told him, \"I want us to have our own life now.\" Resign as Librarian? It was unthinkable, being The Librarian had given him everything he'd ever wanted. \"Nicole, I can't do that.\" \"Of course you can, just walk away Flynn. We could have a real life if you did.\" Wasn't that what they had now? \"I love our lives, we kickass together, we have fun. How many artifacts have we saved for The Library?\" Couldn't she see the good they did? Not to mention how awesome all this was? \"We do...we did, but aren't you sick of risking your life? Maybe we could be good at other things too. How will we know if we don't try?\" \"What kinda things are we talking about here?\" \"I don't know exactly. Things that don't involve being shot at or stabbed or cursed. Maybe we could go to the movies, or eat in a restaurant without looking over our shoulders. We could travel without a deadline or racing the bad guys, actually have more than five seconds to enjoy the sights. And maybe one day we could even get a house, a big one...\" It all sounded so good and Flynn was tempted but he knew he couldn't do it. But God, when she looked at him like that, spoke the way she had, she was damn near irresistible. He pressed his mouth to hers and she responded eagerly to his kiss, and he knew he'd given her the wrong impression. \"I can't...\" Flynn managed to say between kisses, hoping she would understand. \"I know,\" was Nicole's reply. They didn't need words after that. It was slow and tender and different to anything they'd ever shared. It was goodbye. When Flynn woke, all that was left of Nicole was a note: \"I told you once before there's only one thing I'm not supposed to do on this job, and I've done it. I know you remember, you remember everything...and so will I.\" Flynn thought for a moment, what had Nicole told him? I did the one thing I'm not supposed to do on this job. I fell in love with him... No woman, besides his mother, had ever loved him before, and now Nicole was gone. Flynn packed up his belongings to head back to New York. The next quest Judson had for him better be a good one... xxx And it was a good one, and so was the one after that. But now he'd reached a point where his best friend was a sword, and that can't be healthy for anyone. Maybe Charlene was right, maybe he should take a holiday.

Disclaimer: I do not own anyone or anything from The Librarians! AN: So I know the show is new, but I am hooked already and since I've had really bad writers block, I knew I had to write this down as soon as it popped in to my head. I love the characters Cassandra and Jake and I think they would be good together even though they had a kind of rocky start to their friendship. I adore the Ezekiel and Cassandra friendship because he understands why she did what she did and he doesn't blame her so I think a great friendship will blossom from that. Jake watched as Cassandra walked away after her attempted apology. He realized he had been harsh with her, but trust was very important to him and she had broken that trust. It wasn't that he couldn't see where she was coming from because he could, but understanding her reasoning did not change the act of betrayal. He would, however, give her credit for doing right by the group in the end, yet that is all he could give her. \"You shouldn't be so hard on her.\" Ezekiel had been wandering around when Cassandra approached Jake and he'd heard the entire conversation. After she left he decided to make his presence known. \"At least she is trying to make amends which is more than most people would do and you know it. You act as if she did it to hurt you, but she did it out of fear. The girl has a timer on her life and it's counting down with each second that passes. If it were me, well I wouldn't have come back and I sure as hell wouldn't apologize for what I did. She saved our lives today and that has to count for something. This is the second time she has saved our asses and that tips the scale in to the right thing basket if you ask me.\" \"I didn't ask you.\" The art expert shot back quickly. \"I don't care if you asked me or not.\" The thief replied just as swiftly. \"I'm telling you to give her a break; she has enough to deal with and doesn't need you making her feel any guiltier than she already does. One say in the near future you are going to have to make a choice between giving you her trust or not giving it to her. I hope when that day does come you choose correctly because if it not it may end up costing lives, maybe even yours; hopefully not mine.\" Jake felt his fist clench at his side. \"I never would have expected a master thief to care so much. Why do you even care? You admitted that if it had been you then we would have been left to die so I am going to ask again; why do you care?\" The younger male smirked for a second as if he knew something Jake didn't even though the art expert highly doubted that to be true considering there wasn't much he didn't know about. \"That's just something you are going to have to figure out on your own. All I am saying is that you should give her the benefit of the doubt and if you can't trust her then trust me when I tell you she can be trusted and I don't usually trust anybody so think on that.\" With those words he walked off knowing he had given the other male something to ponder. The End! AN: This was just a short one-shot, but I may do more in the future. Hopefully my writers block is gone now, but I suppose only time will tell. Happy holidays and please R&R; like always!

Yet he felt something was missing. He pinpointed it right awayâ¦Simone. He never knew he could love someone as deep as he had loved her; he had her ring near him as a reminder. He may never find anyone else like her. After working hard the next couple of weeks, he almost felt better but he could his heart still ached. As he headed to his favorite cafÃ© for lunch he absentmindedly ran into something or someone rather. \"Oh I am sorry I-,\" said Flynn said but paused when he saw who he walked into. He had walked into the most beautiful woman who had wavy brown hair like Simone, and she even looked eerily like her. Once the brief pause had passed he continued, \"I am sorry I didn't watch where I was going.\" \"That's okay,\" said woman smiling a beautiful smile. \"Hey would you like to join me for lunch, um,\" \"I'm Aimee.\" \"Aimee, what a beautiful name, I am Flynn.\" \"Nice to meet you Flynn and yes I would like to join you for lunch.\" With that he offered his arm to her and she took it and they headed to lunch.

Genre: Romance Pairing: Simone/Flynn Rating: T (to be safe) Chapter 2: Reunited Forever -Takes place five decades after the movie- For the past fifty years Flynn Carsen had lived a somewhat of a full life after returning home from his vacation. He kept his promise and continued on to fulfill his destiny. He remained a bachelor for the rest of his life. He dated here and there but nothing serious. He couldn't see himself committing to anyone, especially after his time with Simone. There were times where he missed her dearly; yet somehow he felt her presence wherever he was. Now his life was about to conclude. The last years was spent in a nursing home where he was slowly fading fade after a fall and knee facture. I guess it is better to pass on the natural way. Suddenly he felt himself and take his last breath, he closed his eyes and was no longer on earth. In a flash he was in a different location and he never felt better he noticed that he was strong again. The location he was now at was soothing and relaxing. As he was about to walk around and explore he heard a familiar French-accented voice call to him stopping him in his tracks. \"Welcome Flynn.\" Flynn turned around him and there she was; Simone was as beautiful as ever he had ever seen her. Her face glowed with the most radiant smile on her face. Flynn walked towards her. They couldn't hold back any longer and ran into each others arms. It felt so good to hold her again. Right as they came apart from the hug, Flynn cradled her neck and ran his thumbs over her smooth cheek, leaned in, tilted his head and kissed her full on the lips. Once they came apart, they smiled. From that point on he knew that they are together for all of eternity. A/N 2: Thanks for reading Chapter 2 of \"Love Always Lives\". Reviews are appreciated!

The male Librarian / female Guardian partnerships remind me of Yin and Yang and I thought that would also be another reason explaining why their friendship and faith in each other was so strong. Disclaimer: I do not own anything in relation to The Librarians. If I did, Judson would not be dead and we would see way more of Charlene. Although, I adore John Larroquette... Chapter 1: Mirror, Mirror Charlene slowly stirs her spoon in her tea cup, watching the milk swirl around as the color changes when she hears the familiar and longed for voice of Judson. \"You need to stop working so late, Charlene, you need your rest.\" \"I've always worked late,\" she replies without looking at him. She hates seeing him in that damn mirror. \"Yes, but we've always done that together, when...when I was here.\" He stares at her miserably, he hates to remind her that he's dead. \"You're not here anymore,\" she notes dully while she lifts her cup and takes a sip, \"so I have to go on alone.\" The expression on his face contains a mixture of pity and frustration. \"But you're not alone, you have Flynn.\" She gives a snort of derision. \"Flynn is hardly ever here! Ever since you...you...,\" she stares hopelessly down at the table, still unable to utter the words after all of this time. She finally moves to straighten herself fully in her chair but continues to avoid his gaze. \"He's hardly ever here since you left us.\" \"It wasn't my choice to leave,\" he returns defensively. \"Well, it certainly wasn't mine!\" she shouts, suddenly spinning around to face him. \"Do you think that it's easy handling both my workload and yours? Not to mention the paperwork! The paperwork alone might have me joining you sooner than you think!\" \"I wouldn't want that!\" he blurts out hastily. When she hardens her gaze, he shifts uncomfortably and instantly amends, \"What...what I meant to say is that it would be a bad thing because you're needed here. Sometimes, you have to give up what you want for the greater good.\" \"Don't give me that psychobabble, that only works on Flynn!\" she huffs as she turns away from him again. His expression droops slightly and he timidly asks, \"How is Flynn doing?\" Her eyes soften as she looks back at him. \"Same as he is always is, missing you, just like we all are.\" Judson gives a helpless shrug. \"I'm still here when you need me.\" \"Not as much as I'd like.\" She removes her glasses and begins rubbing at her temples to ease her sudden headache. \"Or for Flynn for that matter. Although you already know that, you see him more than I do lately. He only checks in with me before seeking you out for advice on his next adventure.\" Her expression is grim. \"He's just not ready, Judson. He's not ready to accept that you're gone much less take over in the capacity that we need him.\" \"Then he needs to learn and you need to help him.\" He offers her a wide grin. \"Just like you helped me.\" She chuckles softly. \"You obviously needed it.\" \"I did,\" he agrees with a soft nod, \"and that's how I know that you can do this.\" He attempts an enthusiastic tone when she remains silent. \"Remember, Pandora's Box, Arachne's Loom and the shield of Perseus?\" He seems to stare off somewhere deep in his memory. \"That was a pretty good shield too, it saved Perseus from the Gorgon.\" \"Yes,\" she replies with an amused smirk, \"and I seem to recall that it also saved you from a lot of those angry fathers of the girls that you enjoyed romancing so much.\" Slightly embarrassed, he links his hands behind his back and clears his throat. \"Well, everyone needs a hobby.\" Shaking her head in disgust, she chastises, \"You were such a pig,\" before widening her eyes in remembrance. \"Speaking of which, do you remember that time that Circe turned you into a pig?\" She laughs out loud. \"It took me weeks to track her down and convince her to turn you back. She kept insisting that she was only correcting nature's mistake.\" He shudders in recollection. \"I remember that all too well, thank you, it put me off of bacon for years.\" He grimaces in irritation as he adds, \"And it wouldn't have taken weeks if you hadn't decided to take a sight-seeing tour!\" \"You're always telling me that I work too hard,\" she protests laughingly. Pleased at her laughter, he seeks to encourage it. \"And how about helping Thor retreive his hammer, Mjolnir? Talk about the original hammer time!\" Her countenance lightens further into a dreamy state. \"He may have been the God of Thunder but at least he wasn't quick as lightning.\" Judson automatically starts nodding in agreement before stilling and eyeing her in suspicion. \"What was that?\" She knows that some secrets best remain in the past and quickly dismisses, \"Never mind. Besides, he was no Ponce de Leon.\" Knowing that there's another story there that he doesn't want to hear, he decides not to delve too deeply into the matter. \"Ah, yes, the Fountain of Youth. Although in my opinion, you would never need it.\" \"Oh, please,\" she scoffs, \"enough with the lame compliments!\" He flashes a teasing grin. \"I'm sorry, are you too old to hear that?\" \"No,\" she declares unwaveringly, \"I'm too smart!\" She gazes at his ghostly visage wistfully. \"You were our best Librarian.\" \"And you were my finest Guardian,\" he returns wholeheartedly. \"Not to mention the only Guardian that I had personally. Those were some good times weren't they?\" he inquires with a hearty chuckle. \"Yes, they were.\" Her smile fades slightly. \"I could've done with a few more.\" He gazes kindly at her. \"And we'll have more of those adventures, \" he holds his hands out to his sides beseeching her understanding, \"eventually.\" His tone becomes more earnest. \"But right now, I need you here and so does Flynn.\" They both hear footsteps approaching from the hallway. \"I better go. If I don't then Flynn will keep us here half the night talking, and as I said earlier, you need your rest.\" Tempted to alert Flynn to Judson's presence so that they can spend a little more time together like the old days, she stubbornly refutes, \"Rest is for the dead.\" He eyes her sternly in reprimand. \"Sorry,\" she petulantly relents. \"You better go while you can,\" she waves him off just before hurriedly insisting, \"but promise that you'll come back!\" \"I promise,\" he answers readily with a soft smile, \"at least until he's ready.\" His image fades from the mirror and Charlene releases a heavy sigh. \"He can't even save his receipts. I'm beginning to wonder if he'll ever be ready.\" \"If who will ever be ready? Me?\" questions Flynn curiously as he walks into the room, never once taking his eyes off of the scroll that he recently discovered on his last quest. She plucks the scroll out of his hand and sets it down on the table. \"Yes, you! I've been waiting for ages for you to finish up so that we can go home. You need your rest,\" she admonishes gently as she tugs on his lapels to straighten his jacket and smoothes down the rumpled material on his shoulders. \"Charlene,\" I'm a grown man,\" he protests as he reaches for the scroll and she bats his hand away. \"I don't need a babysitter! Besides,\" he mutters sheepishly as he gestures towards the mirror, \"I was hoping that I could talk to Judson.\" \"He's not here, Flynn, and he's not always going to be here,\" she tells him in a no-nonsense tone before her voice gentles, \"and you have to accept that.\" Bristling, he starts raising his voice and wildly gesticulating. \"I have to accept that? I have to accept that?\" he repeats, his voice increasing in volume with each word. \"Why do I have to accept that? You haven't even accepted that!\" Charlene swallows harshly. \"No, I haven't accepted it yet but one day I will\", she takes his hand in a sympathetic grasp, \"and so will you.\" \"Yeah, well...,\" he hems as he runs a hand roughly through his hair and stares down at the floor, \"today is not that day.\" \"No, it's not,\" she agrees with a rueful smile as she links her arm through his and tugs him towards the doorway. \"So let's put an end to this one. Come on,\" she insists when he tries to resist, \"I'll even walk with you home to make sure you arrive safely.\" Flynn barks out a laugh. \"First a babysitter and now you think that I need a bodyguard?\" He waves his hands around in front of him, unsure how to proceed without risking personal injury. \"And no offense, Charlene, but you don't seem the type to...well...I don't know, protect anything but the budget.\" \"That shows you what you know,\" she contends with a haughty tilt of her head. \"Bodyguards, just like Guardians, come in all shapes and sizes. In fact, Mr. Librarian, \" she ignores his correction of, \"I'm The Librarian , and continues, \"I'm going to tell you something that you don't know.\" He releases an incredulous laugh and gives her an indulgent smile. \"I highly doubt that's possible but go ahead, give it your best shot.\" She squeezes his arm in excitement and leans in closer as if she's sharing her darkest secret, and to Flynn, it may seem that she's very well about to do that. \"I'm going to tell you about the day that I met Judson and was recruited for the Library.\" A mischevious twinkle suddenly appears in her eye. \"And it wasn't so that I could protect the budget.\" TO BE CONTINUEDâ¦[Chapter 2] Author's Note: I would like to dedicate this story to Kelly on AO3 whose encouragement sparked a few ideas to continue this story and in my humble opinion, made it so much better. I can't claim any great knowledge of history and mythology but I did try my best and basically, I just wanted this story to be fun. Thank you again, Kelly, I hope the remainder of this story reflects the inspiration that you gave me. :) Chapter 2: When Danger Looms Standing atop the hill at the edge of the latest town, a young man sports a smile of relief at having finally reached his destination. He takes in a deep breath and allows his gaze to leisurely travel over the neighboring hillsides and savors the moment to appreciate how far he has come in his journey and his first mission as The Librarian. \"At least it's not as hot as Alexandria.\" His gaze drops to the valley below and his eyes suddenly widen in shock as he spies a woman surrounded by four men. Rushing down the hillside to come to her aid, his hand reaches for a sword that he remembers that he no longer has but doesn't allow that fact to deter him. He has taken an oath to help others, regardless of the risk to himself, and if that particular risk includes young, beautiful women in distressâ¦well, that's only part of the fun. His face set with determination, he quickly enters the fray and narrowly misses a strike of the sword from one of the attackers. Stepping back to avoid the hit, he stumbles into one of the men who trips over him and who is then instantly elbowed in the back of the head by the young woman, successfully rendering him unconscious. \"Don't worry,\" he calls out to her, \"I'm here to help!\" The woman is silent at first as she is busy holding off one man by locking swords while dropping another by kicking him in an extremely sensitive region of his anatomy. \"Move out of the way, I can take care of them on my own!\" He's about to ignore her and jump back in again when he glances down at the man on the ground clutching himself while writhing around in agony and thinks better of it. Before taking a seat on a large boulder underneath an apple tree, he plucks an apple off of a low hanging branch and starts eating it. He normally wouldn't sit by and watch a woman fight off a group of men but she seemed more than capable of taking care of them on her own and he had missed breakfast after all. He watches in awe as she counteracts their every move while they remain unable to block her own. The beauty of Cleopatra and the skills of the fiercest gladiator and mmmm, this apple is delicious. His attention is immediately drawn back to the fighting when the two remaining men lunge forward simultaneously. Her response is to bring her sword down to block one of them and then slightly changing her stance so that she can deliver a hard punch directly to the other man's face, knocking him out completely. Using her leverage to push the other man away from her, she watches in disdain as he begins to swing his sword in a windmill motion, an obvious tactic of trying to intimidate her with his swordsmanship as he moves closer to her. All flash and no substance , she muses before circling him to find her opening and speedily raise up her sword to hit him hard with the flat of her blade, watching in supreme satisfaction as he crumples to the ground. When the man who is still moaning in pain makes a half-hearted attempt to rise, she walks over and brings the hilt of her sword down onto his head ensuring that this time, he stays down. Clap, clap, clap! The young man stands up and applauds the woman as he waves the hand holding the apple to indicate the unconscious men. \"That was quite a feat! I had intended to offer my assistance but it obviously wasn't necessary.\" He offers her a congratulatory grin. \"Your fighting skills are most impressive.\" She gives a snort of derision. \"Around here, they're not considered so much as impressive as they are a rite of passage.\" She looks at him curiously. \"Just who are you, anyway?\" \"I'm Yahu-, \" he cuts himself off as he reflects on his new life and ponders on the man he was told that he was meant to become. \"You, who, what?\" she asks impatiently. \"I'm sorry,\" he apologizes for his momentary distraction. \"My name is Judson.\" \"Judson,\" she repeats to him, watching him nod curtly and with pride despite his earlier hesitation. \"Are you sure about that?\" \"I am now,\" he affirms with a resolution that even she can't doubt. Still not ready to let her guard down, she continues to keep him in her peripheral vision as she gathers the fallen swords and deposits them through the crack of the apple tree that he had been sitting under. When she catches him watching her, she barks, \"What?\" His brow wrinkles in confusion. \"You'reâ¦,\" he looks over to the men on the ground and then back to the tree, \"you're stealing from the thieves?\" She stares back at him with a look that clearly states that she thinks that he's a moron before bending down to retrieve eight daggers along with a quiver and bow. Tucking the daggers beneath her belt and taking hold of the bow with one hand while hoisting the quiver around her shoulder, she explains, \"In case you haven't noticed, I was just attacked by these four gentlemen that you are so concerned about. And since not everyone is blessed with the ability to fight, I'm taking their weapons off of them in order to give someone else a fighting chance. Besides, the swords and daggers that I'm storing will be given to families who can't afford their own weapons to defend themselves.\" She drops the remaining daggers through the tree and takes note of his inquiring stare directed to the weapons that she kept for herself. \"Let's just say that I believe that it's time that they gave back to the community.\" Her flippant quip earns her a smile and then a blush when she eyes him up and down. \"You're not from around here or I would have noticed you before.\" She gives him a cheeky grin. \"So what brings a nice boy like you to a place like this?\" \"I've recently accepted a prestigious position that has brought me here for a very specific purpose,\" he declares enigmatically as he straightens himself to his full height. \"I'm The Librarian.\" She stares back at him blankly. \"So, you're a librarian.\" \"Noâ¦no,\" he shuffles his feet as he attempts to imbue his tone with the importance of his position. \"I'm The Librarian.\" \"Oh, I see,\" she replies blithely, \"so that must make me The Local Serving Wench.\" He releases a soft chuckle before he realizes that she's not joking. \"No, I really am The Librarian, from The Library in Alexandria. They've sent me on a mission that has brought me to your province. Have you happened to come across any strangers bearing tattoos of a snake? They may have mentioned a Serpent Brotherhood.\" \"Who are they,\" she questions interestedly, \"some fanatics who worship Medusa?\" \"Not quite,\" he denies with a small shake of his head. \"They are a group of malevolent men who are searching for Arachne.\" \"What do they want with her?\" she asks in a more serious tone, quickly grasping that this man was not the mere fool that she had first thought him to be. \"She recently acquired the Fates' tapestry and is planning to use her loom to reweave it and regain her human appearance.\" He's slightly taken aback when his answer seems to mollify her. \"Well, I can't fault her for that. To be fair, I think that she has more than paid for her crime of boasting that her weaving skills outshone those of Athena.\" She shakes her head sadly. \"The gods can be so harsh in their judgments.\" \"And I agree, but Arachne isn't remorseful. In truth, she is full more of vengeance than any other emotion.\" The urgency of the situation is laced throughout his tone. \"She is determined to take revenge on Athena for cursing her as well as the enemies that she has made over the years of both warriors and villages.\" She suddenly appears to take a greater interest in his story. \"Then that would include my village as well. We're the only village who has been able to confine her to one area for any one great length of time.\" \"That's why I'm here,\" he explains earnestly, \"The Library heard the news of Arachne being trapped in the caves near your village. Unfortunately, so has the Serpent Brotherhood,\" he notes with a grimace. \"It's crucial that I retrieve the tapestry before she unravels the deeds of good men and women and history as well, all for the sake of revenge.\" His eyes alight with fierce determination. \"I can't allow that to happen.\" \"You mean that we can't allow that to happen.\" She interrupts him when he starts to argue. \"This is my home and my people that I have known all of my life. You can't expect me to ignore this now that I know.\" He wears a sad smile. \"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\" \"Ignorance will have to be blissful some other time. Besides,\" she notes while giving him a quick once-over, \"you're going to need my help. I know where to find Arachne, I'm willing and I'm able to fight while all you have is a cloth sack, a bedroll and a charming grin.\" He smiles brightly at the last bit of her assessment. \"That doesn't work on me.\" She repeatedly jabs him in the chest to emphasize each word. \"You need me.\" He leans away from her with a gulp. \"Yes, you've made your point.\" He closes his eyes as he gathers his thoughts and swallows his pride. \"I would imagine that a Librarian would not require assistance very often but as new as I am to this position, even I know that this is definitely one of those times. I do so happen to find myself in need of your help and if you are indeed so willing then I would be honored for you to join me.\" He opens his eyes, not to view her humble acceptance but to stare off in shock as he sees her stalking ahead of him and already halfway across the field. \"Are you coming or not?\" she yells without even looking back at him. He blows out a puff of air in frustration. \"Right,\" he mutters under his breath before running after her. \"Coming!\" Once he catches up to her, he slows down his pace to match her stride. \"If you don't mind my asking, seeing as we are going to be working together, may I at least have the privilege of knowing your name?\" She struggles to stamp down a smile in response to his beseeching gaze. \"My name is Charlenestia.\" \"That a lovely name, although most unusual for this area, isn't it?\" he quizzes, always eager to learn another fact or point of interest. \"It's a combination of an old family name and that of the goddess Hestia. As farmers, my family has always had a strong belief in hearth and home and so we have a tradition of combining our given names with those of the goddess for each female born into my family.\" She spares him a glance along with a small grin. \"Most people around here just call me Charlene.\" She reaches out and directs him away from a hole in the ground. \"Tell me about this Library that you work in, I've never known a library that sends their employees out on missions.\" Judson's face instantly morphs into one of excitement. \"The Library is the most amazing place in the entire world. Not only do they have a copy of every book ever written but they have the most incredible artifacts, ones with great power. That's actually the reason that there is a Librarian. The Library's sole existence is to find and preserve the knowledge and magic that would give the wrong sort unimaginable power.\" He suddenly stops talking so animatedly and looks miserable. \"I wasn't supposed to tell you that,\" he confesses with a disheartened sigh. \"You'll have to forgive me, I'm still new at this.\" \"I never would have noticed,\" she replies, her voice completely deadpan. \"Now, what exactly do you mean by the wrong sort?\" This time, it is his turn to stare at her as if she's not the sharpest dagger in the box. \"The wrong sortâ¦evildoers, villains, ne'er-do-wellsâ¦you know, bad guys!\" Charlene gradually slows her pace to a full stop. \"And what makes your Library the right sort to hold all of that imaginable power?\" His answer is immediate, without any misdirection or hesitation. \"Because we don't control the power, we contain it and we don't use it except in extreme emergenciesâ¦like this one. The Serpent Brotherhood is determined to conquer the known world while the Library is destined to protect it. I'm willing to give my life to keep the world safe, Charlene, I can't offer you any more assurance than that.\" The sincerity of his words and gaze touch her heart in a way that she has long since forgotten. It was the part that used to allow her to be so open with people, the part that had allowed her to trust. He attempted to come to her aid when she was completely unknown to him but he has also spoken of having access to as well as seeking out great magic. Is this truly someone that I can trust? she wonders silently. Or is this simply magic at work? Moments pass as both her thoughts and gaze remain solely on him. She looks at him, this Librarian who is still more of a boy than a man, all gangly limbs with a hopeful expression and in him, she recognizes a kindred spirit. She sees someone who is trying to break free of the life that he was born into and instead is trying to create one that allows him to be who he was always meant to be. To Charlene, there was no higher aspiration and it was one that they both shared. And so in that moment, in that newly reawakened part of her heart, she knew without doubt that she could trust him. \"Alright,\" she proclaims resolutely as she once again stalks off in the direction of the caves, \"let's go find Arachne.\" \"You trust me?\" he asks in surprise, smiling widely when she answers in the affirmative. He trots along beside her excitedly and questions, \"What was it that convinced you? Was it my heartfelt argument, my calm reasoning, my utter selflessness and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice?\" She gave him that moron look again. \"That and I doubt that you're smart enough to pull off something so evil of this magnitude.\" \"What? Of course I could, I'm The Librarian! I can accomplish anything that I set my mind to!\" She shoots him a withering glare. \"You knowâ¦if I was evil,\" he finishes, his voice barely discernible. \"I'm sure you could,\" she concedes with a condescending nod, \"but why don't we leave that option behind us for now and you tell me about yourself? Convince me that I'm making the right choice.\" \"There's not much to tell, really. As I said, I recently obtained the position of The Librarian and following that, I boarded a ship in Alexandria that was delivering grain to this island.\" His expression reveals his weariness. \"After that was a very, very, very long walk from the sea shore.\" Knowing how far the nearest sea port is, she offers him a compassionate smile and a gentle tone. \"I'm sure there must be more to your story than being an excellent hiker.\" Her gaze rests on his garments. \"Since your post of Librarian is so recent, I'm assuming that your clothing isn't brand new and judging by the quality of the linen, you definitely weren't manual labor.\" He grins in appreciation of her deductive reasoning. \"No, I was a court scribe from a long line of court scribes.\" His countenance is downcast. \"That was our family tradition.\" \"So then I can take it that you're educated?\" she states more than inquires. \"Yes,\" he replies simply, with no trace of arrogance. Instead of the sarcastic retort that he's expecting, she releases a wistful sigh. \"I envy you.\" \"With all that you can do? Why would you? I yearn to have even a fraction of your fighting skill,\" he shares, his voice thick with longing. \"You could learn to fight easily enough, I could teach you,\" she remarks off-handedly. He waggles his eyebrows at her. \"I would love for you to teach me a few things.\" \"Careful, Judson,\" she warns good-naturedly, \"class can be just as easily dismissed.\" She glances at the bag that's hanging off of his shoulder. \"Speaking of fighting, do you even have any weapons in there?\" \"I did have a flint axe but I lost it,\" he mentions casually as he avoids her gaze to study the landscape. \"Did you lose it in battle?\" she asks, clearly impressed. \"No,\" he admits while still averting his eyes, \"I lost it while gambling on the ship. Coincidentally, that's also how I lost my sword and other various weapons.\" She chuckles softly and pats him on the back consolingly. \"Don't worry, Judson, that scenario is a lot more common than you would think.\" Charlene glances at him curiously. \"So, why did you leave the courts to work in The Library?\" His expression hardens as if reflecting a grave weight. \"I wanted to do more with my life, to make a difference inâ¦in the lives of others. Scribes assess taxes, keep records and court scribes document everything in a court case from the complaint, the testimony and the verdict.\" His gaze is both sad and defeated when he looks at her. \"Verdicts aren't only monetary issues, scribes witness and document the punishments as well. And after bearing witness to executions that were carried out by decapitation, drowning or impalement, I was more than ready for a new career.\" He looks over to her for understanding which he readily receives. \"I didn't want to just stand by and take an account of others' lives anymore, not when I was finally ready to account for my own.\" The memory of his next statement prompts a smile that is both wide and full of hope. \"That's when a piece of papyrus appeared on my desk at home, it was an invitation to join The Library.\" \"And you just believed them when they told you that they find and store magic to keep it safe?\" she questions skeptically. \"No, of course not,\" he hurriedly denies, \"but I did believe them once they showed me the magic that they're protecting and I saw for myself its effects in the wrong hands.\" His tone is solemn as he explains, \"I have seen a great many cruelties during my time as a scribe, but nothing in comparison to what magic could do in the wrong hands. That's when I knew that I had to help, that I needed to help, in any way that I could to stop these atrocities from ever happening again.\" Charlene's countenance becomes one of admiration. \"You're very fortunate to do something that you enjoy while making such a difference in people's lives.\" She sighs wistfully. \"I would love to be able to do that.\" \"Have you ever considered leaving home and making a new start? I'm positive that a young woman with you confidence and assertiveness could easily find work.\" \"I tried that once, years ago, but apparently the other towns and larger cities were only interested in hiring me for one thing,\" she replies with a tight smile. Judson offers a sympathetic sigh. \"Let me guess, the type of work that only lasts for one night?\" She merely nods in response. \"I'm sorry, you deserve to be seen for your whole potential, not simply that of a courtesan.\" Her eyebrows rise slightly in surprise. \"Courtesans usually reside in the finest houses. How would someone who works in a library find entrance to such a place?\" The smile he bears reflects one carrying a secret, a very enjoyable secret judging by the size of his grin. \"There's a reason that I was chosen to become The Librarian. You would be surprised at the many ways I know of to enter such forbidden places.\" Charlene gives him an assessing glance before she quips, \"Yes, and I'm sure the majority of them lead to maidens' bedchambers.\" He chuckles softly as he reaches for his animal skin to take a drink, only to find it empty with the exception of a few drops of water leaking out the bottom. \"I can't believe that this is already coming apart, I only bought this at the market three days ago!\" She plucks the animal skin from his grasp and examines it. \"Oh dear, this is shoddy workmanship. This is exactly why I always create a bargaining scroll.\" His gaze is perplexed. \"Aâ¦a what?\" \"A bargaining scroll, I create one for every transaction involving the purchase of goods. That way if the product fails then the vendor has to return my money.\" \"And if the vendor refuses to sign the scroll?\" he counters with interest. \"Then there's no sale. If a craftsman is unable to stand by their work by attesting that with a simple agreement then I see no need to waste my time or hard-earned savings.\" He stares off in consideration. \"That's actually quite sensible.\" \"Of course it is,\" she remarks confidently, \"that's how I know that I would make a fantastic financial advisor!\" \"Is that something that you've studied for?\" he asks curiously. \"I haven't been officially trained, but I'm very good with numbers and with my organizational skills, I could easily monitor the income and expenditures of a wealthy family or business. I cannot tell you how many times that I've seen costly mistakes that could have been so easily avoided if only for the advice of a good advisor.\" She scrunches up her face in disgust. \"I hate that. I also know how to read, a rarity for the women on this island.\" \"I apologize if this sounds rude,\" he begins nervously, \"but how did you learn to read? I have heard that it's quite uncommon for any woman to be so educated in Greece.\" \"My grandfather was a General in the army so he knew how to read and he made sure that every member in our family learned to read as well.\" The light in her eyes reflects her pride. \"My father was a Hoplite, he was the one who trained me on how to fight. He didn't want to worry about leaving my mother and I alone whenever he was called away to fight.\" She flashes a warm smile. \"It was his way of protecting us. And there are always travelers coming through the tavern who are less prejudiced about sharing knowledge with someone who dares to reach beyond her grasp.\" She places her hand on his back to push him down to avoid a low hanging branch. \"I've lost count of how many nights' sleep I've lost reading borrowed books, Judson, and of how many hours I've dreamt of using the knowledge that I've acquired.\" He shakes his head in amazement. \"You are truly a remarkable young woman,\" he notes with approval. \"If you ever decide to venture out on your own again, I would be honored to show you around Alexandria.\" Charlene's gaze is skeptical. \"Really? And what exactly is the going rate for Courtesans in Alexandria these days?\" He jerks back in shock. \"What? No, no, that's not what I meant at all! Opportunities for women who seek education or employment are much greater in Alexandria than they are in Greece.\" As she is still eyeing him with disbelief, he confesses, \"True, not many women move into high positions of power but there's still more of a chance for the life that you seek there than here.\" \"I'd have to think about itâ¦\" she offers but he can tell that she's giving it some serious consideration. She suddenly stops dead in her tracks and scans the area. \"What happened here?\" They lock gazes for a moment before taking in the ravaged field lying before them, a field that was once rather lush and green but now only contains dried bits of plants. Judson bends over and inspects the dried leaves that crumble to dust when he gently rubs them between his fingers. \"This is basil,\" he murmurs quietly. \"Does that matter?\" she questions as she looks around trying to find what could have caused this. He straightens up and dusts off his hands. \"Basil leaves attract spiders and then the spiders drain the nutrients from them. \"Impossible, there's no way that a few spiders did all of this!\" She turns to him for further explanation. \"No, not a few spiders,\" he agrees readily, \"it would take thousands of them or about a hundred of them, I suppose, depending on their size. Do you realize what this means?\" he questions excitedly as he takes hold of her hand and starts running towards the mountain ahead while dragging her behind him. \"We're definitely heading in the right direction!\" Hours later as they trek up the mountainside with the day's heat bearing down on them, Judson longs for the cool water that he had poured into his animal skin earlier that morning. \"Are you sure that we're on the right path?\" he asks irritably. \"Well, I was assured by The Librarian ,\" she snipes back at him, just as hot and tired as he is, \"but besides that, this is the area that we confined her to and where she was seen last. And despite the absence of dying basil patches,\" she stops her tirade as her eyes widen at the sight of a dozen spiders the size of dinner plates running down the mountain towards them, \"I'd have to say that we are definitely on the right path.\" Unable to locate an escape route, she withdraws two of the daggers and mentally prepares herself to fend off the oncoming wave of arachnids. \"Any ideas?\" she yells out over the sound of scuttling spiders. \"No need to worry,\" he shouts back encouragingly, \"a good Librarian is always prepared for every situation!\" He immediately reaches into his cloth sack and pulls out and old and worn book. Judson hurriedly flips through the pages and instantly lights up with satisfaction as he finds the passage that he's been searching for and begins chanting in an unknown language. Without warning, a large expanse of diatomaceous earth appears out of nowhere and covers enough of the immediate area to separate them from the spiders. Judson moves closer to Charlene and takes hold of her elbow to slowly draw her back in case his plan doesn't work. As the spiders react to their contact with the diatomaceous earth, the two watch in a mix of fascination and horror as the spiders begin to release ear-splitting screeches as they stagger and crumple to the ground before shriveling up and turning to dust. Charlene pulls slightly away from Judson's grasp to try and figure out what's causing the spiders to fall in their path. On closer examination, she notes that the ground that they're running across is causing wounds as they move over it and whatever fluid is held within their bodies leaks out onto the ground causing them to shrivel up into empty husks. \"What in Hades is that?\" she questions in the barest whisper. \"That is diatomaceous earth,\" he answers while keeping his eyes trained on the dying arachnids, \"the powder of naturally formed fossils of a sea creature known as the Diatom.\" Charlene shakes her head in awe. \"And that normally happens?\" \"It does but at a much slower pace than normal by nature's standards. However, when magic comes into play,\" he closes the tome with a sharp snap, \"it becomes a great deal more expedient and effective.\" She watches as the last remaining spiders dry up into dust. \"That is so disgusting.\" \"Yes,\" he states as if trying to point out the obvious, \"but itâ¦it's effective.\" He places the book back into his sack. \"I suggest we head out before she sends out more of her little friends.\" After one last look to ensure that they're safe, she puts the daggers away and walks over to the steep part of the mountainside that they need to climb in order to reach Arachne's caves. \"It's not that far now,\" she finds a handhold and starts climbing, \"there's a bridge at the top of mountain, it leads to the caves that she's been living in for the past few months.\" \"There's a bridge? Isn't that rather dangerous for your people?\" She looks at him questioningly. \"I mean, you've given her a direct path from the caves to your town.\" She grasps another handhold and pulls herself up before looking down at him. \"Arachne wouldn't dare to cross the bridge, her spindles fall too easily between the slats. And with the way it sways under someone's weight, she would never be able to cross without crashing through, the wood is practically ancient.\" She watches him struggle for purchase before taking pity on him and offering him her hand. He reaches up to take it andâ¦ \"Hey, watch the hands, Librarian!\" Flushing with embarrassment, he smiles sheepishly and stammers out an apology. \"Sorry,\" he gulps when he sees her venomous glare, \"myâ¦my hand slipped.\" He pushes himself up part way and begins to slip again when Charlene's hand darts out and grabs the front of his tunic to haul him up alongside her. \"Just make sure that it doesn't happen again or next time I might let something slip,\" she loosens her grasp causing him to slide down a few inches, \"something like you.\" Eyes widening in alarm, he immediately nods in agreement before they silently continue their way up the mountainside and with the exception of a few grunts, groans and withering stares, he only needs to request her hand once more to make it over a particularly rough spot. Finally, they arrive at the apex of the mountaintop and haul themselves over the peak with one final lunge quickly followed by flopping onto their backs as they attempt to regain their breath. \"Well,\" he notes with a heavy pant, \"thatâ¦that wasn't so bad.\" \"It's not usually so difficult,\" she takes a deep breath, \"but in my defense, I did have you holding me back.\" \"Yes,\" he returns sarcastically with a scowl, \"thank you.\" A few more minutes rest and then they push themselves off of the ground and head over to the bridge or what's left of it. The slats are all gone and although the rope structure that supported it remains, it is covered with thick strands of webbing that has also taken the place of the slats. His eyes narrow as he studies the webbing. \"This is obviously how the spiderlings were able to cross over from the caves to attack us.\" \"Apparently,\" she agrees in a disheartened tone, silently wondering how many spiderlings have already escaped from the caves and possibly entered the unsuspecting village. \"So, what do we do now, Librarian?\" He stares back at her with a grimace before returning his gaze back to the remnants of the bridge. What now, indeed? To Be Continuedâ¦ ","Summary":" Author's Note: I'm still catching up on The Librarians so I'm going to assume that I went a bit AU "},{"Movie":"Librarian","Title":"Cold Shoulder","Author":"LittleMissDementorsKiss","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6899511","Passage":"[Chapter 1] He had just sat down at the linoleum topped table when a girl walked up and sat across from him. Like him, she was sweating. Her bangs were shoved back, making her look like she had some sort of mullet-gone-worse but effectively cooling her forehead. Flynn eyed her for a moment, then pulled out his Big Mac. \"Who are you?\" He asked calmly before taking a bite. \"Those things will give you a heart attack.\" She pointed out, not answering his question. \"Believe me, a heart attack is probably the least likely thing to kill me.\" He replied, smiling slightly at his own private joke before taking a long sip of his Coke. Still, it would suck to be killed by a burger after all the death-defying missions you've been on, wouldn't it?\" She said, grinning. \"Who are you?\" He repeated, a bit more urgently this time. \"Relax, Carsen. Judson sent me.\" \"Because that answers my question.\" He retorted sarcastically. She giggled. \"Keep your wig on. My name is Claire. I'm supposed to go with you to Verkhoyansk.\" She said. He had noticed that her clothing was, like his own, unusual for the sweltering heat outside. He still couldn't believe they were shipping him off to the coldest permanent settlement on earth. \"How can I be sure?\" He asked suspiciously. Being the Librarian had taught him a thing or two about caution. \"Have I given you any reason to distrust me?\" She asked in return. \"With all due respect, I've met several dishonest people in my time and none of them have said 'before I introduce myself, here are the reasons you shouldn't trust meâ¦' I have a feeling you're smarter than that. So let me repeat myself; how can I be sure?\" \"Do I look dangerous?\" she tried again. \"Do I?\" He asked her, raising an eyebrow. She hesitated, then seemed to mentally agree that he had a point. \"Fine, fine. Finish up your McHeartAttack and let's pay a visit to the library.\" It didn't take long for him to scarf down the rest of his burger, and they left for the library. He let her lead him to the shelf with the secret lever. She knew her way there, which made him relax a little. Still, he reminded himself, that doesn't mean she's legit. She pulled down the copy of Midsummer's Night Dream and he felt the floor vibrate slightly as the shelf moved. They stepped into the elevator and waited for the small chamber to make its way down to the many stories to the most precious rooms of the building. After a while, she spoke up, breaking the patient silence. \"I remember my first trip down here. It was awkward how long it took when I didn't know where I was going.\" She reminisced Flynn remembered the same feeling. \"Judson didn't seem to find anything wrong with it though.\" She continued thoughtfully. Then the doors opened, and they stepped together through the security. \"Judson!\" She called out as she stepped foot directly in front of the arc of the covenant. She was close to the box, too close for Flynn to be comfortable. He halfway stepped forward. \"Don't touch it.\" He warned. She shot him a look. \"I'm not stupid, Carsen.\" She said, then turned back to the empty room. She folded her arms impatiently in front of her and tapped her foot. \"Judson\" she repeated. \"I'm coming, I'm coming.\" As always, his voice came before he did, but it didn't take long for him to appear before them. \"Claire?\" He asked, surprised. I wasn't expecting you. You were supposed to leave with Flynn almost an hour ago. \"He didn't believe me.\" She said. She rolled her eyes and hooked her thumb over her shoulder indicating he was right behind her. \"I told you about this, Flynn.\" Judson said, wrinkling his brow. Flynn shook his head. Judson nodded his. \"Can you just tell him that I'm O.K. so we can get a move on. Verkhoyansk will melt by the time he figures this out on his own.\" Claire suggested impatiently \"Why are you so damn condescending?\" Flynn asked. \"Why do you have to be so overcautious?\" she countered. \"And you should know better than to be wearing glasses. Don't you own contact lenses?\" \"Yes.\" He said. \"But why are glasses bad. Do they annoy you or something.\" He noticed that both Judson and Claire were staring at him, openmouthed. He rethought his words, then gasped at his own stupidity. \"Figure it out, did you?\" Claire asked smugly. \"I've heard all these stories about how smart you are, but I must say I'm disappointed.\" \"Shut up.\" Said Flynn, somewhat embarrassed. He remembered that glasses weren't the only thing he had packed that could freeze onto him. \"I need to repack.\" By this point he was completely ashamed of the idiocy he'd displayed. \"Whatevs.\" She said, trying hard not to laugh. \"I'll wait here.\" \"Oh, no you don't.\" said Judson. \"I'm buying two more tickets for you, telling Charlene it was your fault that we wasted money on a flight you missed, and you're going straight to the airport. You are not missing another flight.\" \"So why can't I wait here?\" Claire asked, not seeing his point. \"Because you're going with him. Directly from his apartment to the plane. No dilly-dallying. This is not the time to smell the roses. You need to save the world, here.\" Claire scowled. \"You better make it quick.\" She said, glaring at him. \"Well, this will be a fun flight.\" Flynn said loudly 'to himself' as they walked back to the McDonalds down the street. \"Whose car will we take?\" \"Yours\" Claire said simply, then went on to explain the decision. \"I live right there. I walked.\" She pointed at a building across the street diagonally. Flynn was exasperated with this girl's ego. Even saying the simplest things she managed to make him feel inferior. It was her tone of voice, he decided. She sounded pretentious, and the faint British accent didn't help. She couldn't even call him by his first name! Though, when he thought about it, Carsen sounded a lot more informal than Flynn would have coming from her lips. It was backwards and nonsensical, but it seemed true. When they got to his house, he let her in and left her in the front room. He focused on un-packing and repacking his suitcase. He needed to change his parka to one with a plastic zipper, change all his jeans to zipperless sweats, and painstakingly search each and every sweater, sweatshirt, and hoodie for traces of metal. When he was sure nothing could freeze together, he switched his bag to one with a plastic zip and hauled it over his shoulder. He passed through the front room on his way to the door and realized it was empty. He dropped his bag on the floor by the door and turned. \"Claire?\" He called. There was no answer. \"Claire?\" He called once more, and this time heard a loud crash and a cry of pain in the room to his right.[Chapter 2] He rushed into the room, and was horrified at what he saw. \"Damn it, Claire! How could you do something like that?\" The library paid him a pretty hefty salary, even with the routine deductions Charlene took pride in making. It was enough for him to afford his own personal library. It had all of his favorite books, some he read just because he wanted to, some he read because he needed to do research, some he read for lack of anything else to read, and some that wereâ¦ all over the carpeted floor. \"It's your fault, Carsen. You left them in a precarious position! And look what that useless medical dictionary did to my arm.\" She pointed to a very thick leather-bound book that was laying on the floor. Its pages were bent and it looked broken. He knelt down beside it and cradled it in his arms. \"It's not useless.\" He said softly, rocking the book gently as if it were his baby. \"It's reference\" \"It is too.\" She protested, holding her left arm and wincing whenever she moved. \"It may be reference, but it's from 1988. It's outdated.\" \"Look at this.\" He said, showing her a page that had been torn in the process of falling. \"What on earth compelled you to do this?\" \"I was under the imperius curse.\" She said sarcastically. He glared at her before she gave the true cause of her suffering. \"I was looking through your library, which as much as I hate to say it is quite impressive, and you're books were stacked precariously. I ran my finger over the spines and they collapsed.\" Flynn shook his head in disbelief. He treated his books like children, and he'd never put them in danger. She was a liar, and that was that. After seeing that she was o.k., more as a civilized courtesy than out of actually caring, he quickly grabbed his duffle bag, slung his trusty carry-on messenger bag over his shoulder, and went to load his car. It was time to go to the airport. Claire was sick and tired of this. They were on a ten-year-or-so long layover in Fairbanks and she was bored. Flynn was too busy reading to talk to her and he didn't trust her enough to handle any of the hundreds of books he'd brought with him, so she had nothing to read. One of Judson's rules (of which he had many) was that while on adventures, they had to use disposable go-phones. The sad thing about the aforementioned go-phones was that the aforementioned go-phones had nothing fun on them. Her admittedly lame iPod Nano was out of charge. So yes, it was perfectly justifiable that she was bored. \"Flynn.\" she said, hoping to break him from his literary trance. \"Huh?\" He replied absentmindedly. \"I'm bored\" \"O.k.\" He answered. \"Are you even listening to me?\" \"vaguely.\" \"Do have any ideas as to what I could do?\" \"Not really.\" \"That's a great idea, Flynn. I'm sure that will occupy my mind!\" She said with sarcastic enthusiasm. \"Good for you.\" \"How much longer?\" \"You sound like a three year old.\" \"A bit irritated, are we?\" I don't like small planes, so yes, I am a bit grumpy.\" \"Give me a book and I'll shut up.\" She offered in a sing-song voice, almost taunting him \"You physically harmed an important diagnostic tool. You're coming nowhere near my books.\" He said. \"Now shut up and wait for the plane.\" \"We need to discuss the mission.\" She pointed out, literally. The tip of her hot pink self-manicured nails grazed his khaki-colored sweater as she did, and he flinched. \"We'll do that on the plane. And please don't touch me.\" \"Touching!\" She sang as she purposefully poked his arm. He shook it off. \"You really are three years old, aren't you.\" \"Maturity is overrated.\" She quipped, and he took in a deep breath, trying to steady his temper. He wasn't an angry person, but this girl could get on his nerves. How she was supposed to hold it together while they saved Russia was beyond him. Why anyone would expect her to was unfathomable, especially when the 'anyone' in question was someone like Charlene. \"Will you please attempt it until we board the plane. I'll talk to you then, when we'll need to discuss our plans. As for right now, I think shutting up would be the most beneficial route for you to take.\" \"Why do we have to wait 'til we're on the plane?\" She questioned, raising an eyebrow, sure she'd gotten one over on him again. \"Because there are people here.\" He replied, not looking up from his book. \"And the plane will also contain people, and will probably be a lot quieter as well.\" She said, not letting his valid point slow her down. \"Because so many people are bound to be going from Alaska to Siberia at one in the morning.\" He said. She frowned and crossed her arms over her chest as she slumped her shoulders. Hunched over in an airport chair was probably the least comfortable position she could have chosen, but God forbid she move. Her bulldog level tenacity really was going to get her killed one day. She might as well just take a nap. Yello all. Sorry for the lack of updatedness. Much thanks to onthewritetrack, who's review gave me motivation to keep going. See, you should all review. It leads to results. ","Summary":" He had just sat down at the linoleum topped table when a girl walked up and sat across from him.

Now I am not trying to clingy but,\" began Flynn and added, \"How about this if you come back with me and we can test the relationship. If it doesn't work out then I will let you leave in peace. Deal?\" Simone was silent. Somehow she could never resist his charm; especially after the first kiss he gave her. \"Okay I will take your deal and will leave it doesn't work out. We just need to stop by my place for a few things if that is okay with you for the short term and when I need more I will just quickly go there and back.\" \"Not a problem,\" said Flynn knowing what it was she needed. With that they made their way back to his hotel so he could get his stuff, checkout, and change the reservation for his flight home to after sunset and add hers as well. Once she got what she needed and shipped the rest they had a few hours of interlude in between. As soon as they got back to New York that first he noticed it was dark, perfect to take her to the library. \"How about we drop our stuff off and you can get the blood in the freezer, would you like to come with me to the library so that I can drop of the Chalice? And maybe afterwards I can show you around.\" \"Sounds great,\" Simone said with the smile that still made his heart beat fast. A short time later they walked hand in hand down the stairs and they first stopped at Charlene's office. \"Flynn you're back,\" began Charlene then noting the happy look on his face and had a woman on his arms. \"And I see that New Orleans treated you well.\" \"Yes it has. Charlene there is someone I would like you to meet, this lovely lady here,\" began Flynn, \"is Simone Renoir. Simone this is Charlene.\" \"It's nice to meet you Simone,\" said Charlene shaking Simone's hand thinking I knew that Flynn would be able to find someone new. \"Pleasure is mine.\" \"Uh I need to need to get the Chalice to Judson and then I have a lady to show the sights and sounds of NYC.\" \"You know where to find him.\" \"I most certainly do.\" He whisked Simone around and he led her out of Charlene's office. Soon they entered the private collections room and Simone was a bit surprised. \"This is where the Chalice will be kept mon cher,\" said Flynn leaning and gave Simone a quick peck on the cheek. \"Flynn you're back,\" said Judson out of the blue and he added, \"and you seem rested.\" \"Yes sir and with the Chalice,\" said Flynn handing Judson the Chalice. \"Who is the beauty here?\" asked Judson taking the Chalice. \"Oh where are my manners? Judson this is Simone Renoir, she is the one responsible for helping me find the Chalice. Simone this is Judson.\" \"It is such as pleasure to meet you,\" said Judson offering his hand and added, \"I see one of the reasons why Flynn is happier.\" \"Thank you sir,\" said Simone shaking Judson's hand. \"Well Judson. I am off to show Simone around town and then get home. Oh and Judson we may need talk about one important thing on Monday.\" Judson had a good idea what it was. They got back to his place so that they could change out of travel clothes and into leisure clothing and took her out for a night on the town. A few hours later the two were back at his place and as messy as it was maybe they could work something out. After getting her daily meal, Flynn snuck up on her, wrapped his arms around her waist and whispered, \"You know there is something I am looking forward to.\" \"Oh what is that mon amour?\" asked Simone cuddling into his embrace. \"Remember after that first night we met after the good time you showed me had me cornered?\" Simone knew exactly what he was talking about. No sooner did he leave teasing kisses did she become the fierce kisser and proceeded to do the same thing. Only this time they both knew that she wouldn't leave in the morning.

Canon in D is owned by Johann Pachelbel. Author's Note: I couldn't help after watching after watching the movie on DVD. What if somehow Flynn does convince Simone to come back with him? Genre: Romance Rating: T (to be safe) Pairing: Simone/Flynn Chapter 2: Happily Ever After -Six months later- Flynn could not be happier. His relationship with Simone was the best thing that ever happened and it was working so well they wondered how they lived without each other. Whenever he could he would spend time and romance her like no other. Even his mother, Margie had approved of Simone the moment he had finished the introductions. Flynn knew that he had to travel to get various relics and when talked to Judson, Judson agreed to let Simone work downstairs if his trip were close by. If the trips were far away, they would travel together. Whilst their happiness continued to soar through the roof, Flynn knew it was time to take the next step, propose to Simone. Flynn knew that her dream of getting married was taken away from her; he wanted to be able to make come true for her. Sure he had thought Katie would the one, but now he was certain Simone was definitely the one . Right before he was going to buy the ring, he had been promoted as Judson was retiring and Flynn would hire someone to take Flynn's place. And because of the promotion they were able to find a quaint house with a small yard located just outside of NYC. The moment he gave Judson and Charlene the heads up about the impending proposal, they promised that their lips were sealed so that the intended receiver does not find out and offered to help in any way possible. No sooner had Flynn stepped in to the jewelry store and looked into the display did he see the perfect ring for her. After finalizing the planning details he was ready. After her nourishment she and were lying outside on blanket outside in their backyard. With her in his arms he began, \"Simone I want you to straight into the sky and wait for a very special surprise.\" Simone looked at him and then did as she was told and when she did see the message she gasped; it read: Ms. Simone Renoir, I love you will you marry me?-Flynn Simone now with mists in her eyes turned and faced Flynn. \"Simone my darling, my sweetheart, there aren't enough words in the English language or any other language in the world to describe how beautiful you are and how you make me feel. I know that you did not get to live life you wanted to live the first time and never saw Francois again. All I have to say I want give to you a wedding and what you deserved and more. Simone veux-tu m'Ã©pouser?\" Simone will you marry me? Simone, who was now crying tears of joy when Flynn brought out the box, opened and presented the ring he had purchased for her. Simone's eyes widened when she saw the ring, a 0.51 carat Princess cut diamond set in 18k Yellow Gold Baguette Ring. Simone was speechless here she was getting a marriage proposal from Flynn when she almost left him. She found her voice and said at the top of her lungs, \"Oui Flynn, yes, yes, yes! I will marry you!\" Flynn smiled both sat up and as he got the ring out with his left hand and as he held her left hand with his right slid the ring on; it was snug and perfect fit on her finger. He kissed her hand after it was on. He then leaned forward and kissed her like the way he did that night. When they came apart they both saw nothing but love within their eyes. Without speaking another word, they quickly put away the picnic items and quickly went back to their home. No sooner had they made it past the door, they were all over each other. A couple of hours later Simone comfortable in her fiancÃ©'s arms realized something and spoke up. \"Flynn, I appreciate that you want to give me the wedding that I couldn't have and as much as I want to have a big wedding, would it be okay if we went small instead?\" Flynn looked at her and asked her even though he knew the answer, \"Are you sure?\" Simone smiled, \"Yes, I am I mean my whole family is no longer here right?\" Flynn smiled and kissed her on her forehead. \"So I guess you would be okay with a City Hall wedding or a small wedding at night with a Justice of Peace to officiate and have my mom, Judson, and Charlene present to witness it.\" \"That would be perfect,\" replied Simone kissing his chest whilst weaving her arms around his body. Before long they were both asleep and content to be in each other's arms. -Two weeks later- Following all the quick planning, Simone and Flynn decided to have small sunset ceremony in their backyard with a Justice of Peace and three witnesses. Simone had surprise planned for her fiancÃ©; she planned on wearing the same outfit the night she met Flynn; only now it was a one piece dress and a little more form fitting. She found a seamstress from Charlene's recommendation who finished dress within a week. When Margie and Charlene had finished assisting with the makeup, they went to wait in their places before the ceremony started. It wasn't long before she heard a knock and she said, \"Come in\". Judson went in and smiled when he saw Simone. Judson knew that Flynn struck gold when he found Simone. He remembered how touched he was when Simone asked him to walk to down the aisle. \"Ready to marry the handsome fellow waiting whose waiting for you?\" asked Judson. \"Yes sir I am,\" replied the glowing bride as she grabbed her bouquet of mixed colored roses. Simone took Judson's arm and walked from the room to the place where they would wait for the cue. Simone had not been waiting when the Canon in D began to play. Following a very short wait, Flynn saw Simone and beamed when their eyes met. Simone looked radiant her wedding gown, which Flynn recognized it was made in almost the same style of her original outfit. Nevertheless she looked absolutely gorgeous and it took his breath away. As soon as Judson placed Simone's hand in Flynn's the two joined hands and forgot about their surroundings, only focusing on each other and their moment. It wasn't until the love birds heard the Justice of Peace say, \"At this time both Flynn and Simone have written personal wedding vows\" did they come back in tune. They both smiled and Flynn said, \"You can go first Simone.\" Simone smiled and said, \"Flynn, from the first time I saw you I had a pretty good feeling you were the one for me. After spending sometime together thoughts and feelings were confirmed. Je me tiens ici affirmant aujourd'hui l'amour et mon dÃ©vouement Ã  vous. Je vous aime.\" I am standing here today affirming love and my devotion to you. I love you. Simone whose eyes had completed misted up and continued to smile that beautiful smile when began his vow. \"Simone, I have been very unlucky in love until I met you. It was after meeting you that I knew I did not want to be with anyone else but you. I am here today also affirming my love and loyalty. Je vous aime Simone Ã  jamais et toujours.\" I love you Simone forever and always. The Justice of Peace continued the service after a pause of silence. The two knew that his mother and Charlene were crying tears of joy by this time. No sooner had they heard the words 'for as long you both shall live' followed by exchanging rings along with their 'I do's' did the Justice of Peace say out aloud, \"By the power vested in me in the State of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Flynn you may kiss your bride.\" The instant the Justice of Peace said those words Flynn grinned broadly, placed his hands on her waist, gently pulling her in, leaned in and gave her a sweet short kisses. He had more amorous kisses planned for later. The moment they came apart two of them saw only love that would last them a lifetime. They know that will be together forever and for all of time.

Emma Allen had not expected to leave the Plaza hotel as a single woman. According to all her planning in the last three and half months, she should be leaving as Mrs Fletcher Flemson. But here she was, Emma Allen, newly single, heartbroken and alone. Liv and Daniel's reception was finally winding down as Emma waited in the lobby for her parents. She sat on a chair in the corner, half hidden behind a potted plant. Her parents had been amazing at running interference on all her wedding guests who wanted to question her more about her scandalous decision to leave her fiancÃ© at the altar. And between Liv's glares and Nate's constant presence at her side, they both had managed to fend off Liv's wedding guests too. So she hid now in the hopes of not being badgered. In truth, she was exhausted. She had compartmentalised earlier on, tucking her heartbreak away to be dealt with later, in order to give her best friend the support she deserved on her big day. But sitting by herself, it was hard to keep the waves of sadness at bay. She had changed out of her Mom's dress a little while ago, and it was Karen, to Emma's great surprise that told her that she would take care of what was left in her bridal suite. She was glad that Karen had taken her speech to heart, but Emma knew when things weren't about her and one of those times was during Liv's wedding. It was a moment she would never forget, be able to stand beside her best friend as she got married to the man of her dreams in their dream venue. It had been a crazy few months, Emma thought, of watching her life spiral out of control. After a lifetime of friendship, Emma was just glad that she the craziness of the fight with Liv had just been temporary. It had possibly been the worst three months of her life, losing her best friend and knowing that Fletcher was drifting away too. In the oddest way though, it had been life affirming. After years of going with the flow, of letting people walk all over her and not knowing who she was without using the words, \"Liv's friend\" or \"Fletcher's girlfriend.\" She found her backbone along with a realisation that she didn't have to bend to everybody else's wishes all the time. Of course now her life was up in the air, and the sadness and confusion came flooding back. Where was she going to live now? What about all the mutual friends she had with Fletcher? How would she deal with the looks of pity she was bound to get? Would she regret her decision? So she was leaving with her parents instead of spending the night with her new husband. She was pulled from her brooding and overthinking when she saw Nate walk by. He shrugged on his tux jacket as he headed for the doors. \"Hey Nate.\" She called as he walked past her, watching as he stopped and glanced over in her direction before his eyes focused on hers. \"You looking for someone?\" \"Yeah.\" His face lit up, \"I was looking for you.\" He crossed the distance in a few short steps and she made room for him to sit down next to her. It was a little snug, his shoulder was pushed against hers, but it didn't matter because this was Nate. The boy who had been her first crush, the man who had helped her to adjust to life in New York, the boy who had seen her best and worst growing up, the man who just knew that she wasn't fine a few weeks ago. He was Nate. \"Can I hide with you?\" He asked. Emma considered his words, wondering if he picked those very words on purpose. Such simple words and easy question but the last time they were spoken between them, they had held much more weight. At fourteen years old Emma didn't really know how to deal with death, much less the death of her friends' parents. Emma rambled around Nate and Liv's house after the funeral service. It was packed with family and friends and neighbours and Emma wondered if the entire town of Rutherford had descended on the house. Liv was sitting with her grandmother, both inconsolable after the tragic death of Liv and Nate's parents in a car accident. Emma had sat with Liv all day, holding her hand, wanting to do something to make the pain go away. But her parents had told her that there was nothing anybody could do. Emma had seen Nate drifting around all day, from group to group, making sure everything was going okay. He was, she supposed, the man of the house now. He seemed a lot older than his fifteen years, in his black suit and combed hair. But she noticed that he went missing. It felt like a pull at her stomach, that he wasn't around. She couldn't see him, or hear his voice, she just knew that he wasn't around. She promised Liv that she'd be back and began making her way through the crowded living room, through the hallway, checked the back garden then the kitchen, feeling restless with the need to see Nate and make sure he was okay. She checked all the upstairs rooms and came down the back staircase on the whim of hoping to find anyone who had seen him. It was there she had found him, suit jacket removed, sitting with his back to the right wall with his legs reaching out to the other wall, staring into nothingness. Her Nate. Strong, dependable, funny Nate who sat there looking broken. Her throat went dry, her mind went blank at the unfathomable concept of trying to make it all better. She stood, a few steps above him, knowing that he hadn't even noticed her presence. If he had, he would have smiled one of his small smiles and told her not to worry about him. She cleared her throat, \"Can I hide away with you?\" She cringed at her choice of words. Who was to say he was hiding? But she felt the need to give him an option to send her away and let him grieve in peace. He looked up at her, with those familiar brown eyes, in surprise as if she had just appeared out of thin air. \" Please.\" He croaked out, his voice raw. \" Can I do anything Nate? Do you want me to...?\" She fired off questions as she sat on the step above him but he just shook his head. \" No Em, Iâ¦I really appreciate it, I do. You being here is enough.\" He ran his hand through his hair, something she knew that he only did when he was frustrated, and scrunched his eyes closed and took a ragged breath. He opened his eyes as she placed her hand delicately on his hand that was laying on the step, she just wanted to make it better for him. She knew his heart was breaking, but hers was breaking for him now too. \" I justâ¦I thinkâ¦\" He shook his head, \"This is something I have to deal with myself you know? But it's good to know you're here.\" \"Can I?\" Nate repeated his question and Emma smiled. \"Please.\" \"I was wondering where you had gotten to.\" He said, \"How are you, really?\" She sent him a mock glare, wondering if he was daring her to say that she was fine . \"I don't know. I feel like everything is a complete mess and I don't even know where to start trying to clear it up.\" \"I can brush up the confetti and you can stack the chairs?\" He asked, the corners of his mouth twerking upwards. She let out a watery laugh. If only it was all that simple. Ten years of her life. And here she was feeling sorry for herself in the lobby of the Plaza. \"Em?\" He asked, his voice softer and she turned her head to look him in the eye. \"You'll be okay. You're strong, I know that. I like to think that things have a way of working out.\" \"Thanks Nate.\" She whispered, \"So what were you looking for me for?\" She asked, wiping at the tears that sprung to her eyes and trying to smile but failing miserably. \"Liv told me to give you this before she left.\" He said, rummaging around in the pocket of his trousers. Liv and Daniel had left for their honeymoon about an hour ago. A parting between Emma and Liv that had just ensured that they both completely ruined their wedding makeup with tears and promises to make up for lost time when Liv got back. \"She said that you were going to need it someday?\" He passed Emma a small black box. She took it from his hand and opened it slowly. She sighed, not knowing if she was happy or sad about it, upon seeing the blue hair clip. She ran her finger over it lightly, a little token of hope in her day of madness. A little token of hope that she would find love and get the happily ever after she had dreamed about as a little girl. \"Is that good or bad?\" Nate asked. Emma shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts, \"It's from that wedding keepsake box that Liv and I had. It's our old, borrowed and blue.\" She smiled. \"Ah from the infamous 'No boys allowed' attic, right?\" He smiled at the memories. It had been about the only time that the three of them had ever fought when they were kids. But Nate had not been allowed into their wedding playroom after he had made fun of it. Liv and Emma hadn't talked to him for a whole two days. She closed the box and put it in her handbag. \"I'm going to figure this out. I can do this. I can be single.\" She told him in a way of giving a peptalk to herself. \"I can find somebody else right?\" She ended up searching his eyes for answers. \"You will find somebody else Emma. Somebody who will love you, past, present and future. Somebody who will love you until death do you part.\" His expression was unreadable, even to Emma. And she found herself gazing at him longer than she should. Something she hadn't done since she was a teenager. But he didn't look away from her eyes either. \"Oh Sweetie, there you are!\" Emma's Mom's voice broke through their little hidden bubble and Emma jumped. \"Your father and I have been searching for you everywhere, we're all ready to go. Hi Nate.\" Emma watched as her mother smiled down at Nate like he was the son she never had. Which, he probably was. Liv and Nate had spent most of their time between Emma's house and their grandmother after their parents had died. Emma's parents had helped him move his things for college, her Dad had shown him how to drive, her Mom had cried when he graduated college and they had framed his first New York Magazine article and it hung beside Emma's graduation picture in the hallway at their house. \"Hi Mrs Allen.\" Still, after all this time, Emma couldn't help but smile. Nate insisted on calling her parents by their titles that were now a term of endearment. They had corrected him so much, telling him to call them by their first names that it had become an inside joke for them. \"Where are you off to?\" \"Home.\" Emma admitted, \"Aunt Katherine said we could stay with her in Rutherfield. It's closer than Boca, and well, none of us expected to leave tonight.\" She shrugged. \"Well take of yourself okay?\" He said as they stood up. He pulled her into a hug, placing a kiss in her hair. It had always felt as natural as breathing. \"And if there's anything I can do to help? Anything I can do at all, let me know okay Em?\" \"Thank you Nate.\" She whispered into the crook of his neck. \"I will but this is something I have to sort out myself.\" Emma's Dad appeared then, with some of their bags in tow. \"Are you ready to go Emma?\" \"Yeah.\" She said, casting another glance at Nate who looked like he wanted to pull her back in for another hug, not that she would have complained. \"Take care Emma.\" Nate reiterated, after saying his goodbyes to her parents. With that she walked from the Plaza, the place that had held so many romantic dreams for her, unmarried and flanked by her parents. She turned her head and got one last glance of Nate standing in the doorway, his hands in the pockets of the tux she helped him pick, looking as handsome as ever. She knew that he'd be there for her. But she had her life to go and sort out. A/N: I know I'm nearly ten years late to this fandom but I've always loved this movie. Especially Emma and Nate's relationship :) This story has been in my head for a long time and I thought it was time to get it down in words. Disclaimer: I don't own anything except my plot.[Chapter 2] Emma was still getting used to new haircut. It was the clichÃ© thing to do, she knew it was, getting her a new haircut after a relationship breakup. Even the barista in her local coffee shop commented on it, had she just got her heart broken? She had, of course, but not in the sense that most people assumed. She hadn't been cheated on or left without reason. She had broken things off, she had literally ran from the altar, but that didn't mean the end of her relationship with Fetcher had hurt any less. But standing alone in her new apartment, with the views that she adored and the little quirks that Fletcher would have hated, it gave her the odd sense of reassurance that she had done the right thing. They were different people. She would always love Fletcher, of course. She just wasn't in love with him anymore. They were the words that she repeated to herself on the nights that she had been kept awake from the plaguing thoughts of had she done the right thing? What had she been thinking? Fletcher was a good guy, what if she ended up alone now? But they were the words that Fletcher himself had said when, three weeks after their supposed wedding date, they had cleared out their apartment. It had taken him time to admit it to himself, he had said, but he just wasn't in love with her anymore and they both deserved a better kind of love than the one they shared now. He had told her that she was braver than he ever could have been, calling it off. It was, Emma thought, as she set about making her morning coffee, the most amicable split that she had ever heard of. Especially one that had happened on a wedding day. She was lucky. They wanted nothing but the best for each other. You couldn't just cut off ten years of friendship and forget about it. Her phone buzzed on the countertop and Emma picked it up, seeing Liv's number. She didn't even get to say hello. \"How are you feeling? Do you have that second copy of your contract with you? Remember to bring up those points I told you about. Are we still meeting for lunch?\" \"Yes Mom .\" Emma laughed at Liv's monologue. \"Liv. It's my first day at my new job. Shouldn't I e more nervous than you?\" She asked as she took a seat with her coffee and checked her emails on her laptop. \"I know. I know. You'll be fine. You'll be totally fine.\" Emma smiled at the sound of Liv trying to reassure herself rather than her friend. \"But we have to have lunch. I miss you. And you can tell me all about the day and if there any cute teacher men.\" Liv's priorities were in check. \"Uh huh.\" Emma mumbled down the phone. She loved her best friend, she really did. But Liv was taking her new found single-dom personally and wanted Emma back on the love train as soon as possible. She had been on four blind dates set up by Liv in the past month alone and two more dates with guys that Daniel knew but Liv just didn't like to hear that Emma was actually enjoying being single. She was learning to enjoy her own company more, she took up new hobbies just because and didn't have to match her schedule with anyone else's. \"Okay, okay, I'll leave you alone. But I love you. Have a great first day.\" Emma got off the phone with Liv just as a new email popped into her inbox. It was Nate. Hey Em, Liv's probably bombarded you with advice on your first day already right? For mine, yours and Daniel's sanity, PLEASE don't sign anything she hasn't read over first. Anyway, I'm working on an article and writing it feels like I'm trying to pull a tooth. I've attached what I've got so far, do you mind reading it and letting me know if it sucks as much as I think it does? Thanks, Nate. P.S. By the way don't worry about today, it couldn't go any worse than the day you and Liv signed up to that dog shelter right? Emma was glad she alone because the sound that came out of her mouth was something between a laugh and a cry. She reread his message. Sometimes she thought that he knew her better than even Liv did. He knew that she would be nervous on her first day at her new job. He never let anyone read his work in progress articles without good reason and Emma just knew that he sent in the hopes of giving her something to distract her with. Something to focus on other than the butterflies that were wreaking havoc in her stomach and the incessant need to check her bag again to make sure she had everything she needed for the day. She appreciated Nate's gesture. She always loved the reminder that the only way for her to go was up. Her worst first day she had ever had anywhere was when she and Liv had signed up to help out at the local dog shelter. They had spent so much time trying to act cool around the guy in the class that was working there that they hadn't relocked half the cages correctly. Some dogs escaped, they had somehow ended up with dogfood covering the floor of the reception and even set off the fire alarm. They hadn't been asked back. It had been front page of the Rutherford Gazette the next day complete with the headline: Who let the dogs out? Nate liked to claim that it was that article that inspired him to go into journalism. Emma had no doubt that he still kept a copy of that article. With a smile, she pushed her nerves from her mind and opened up Nate's article. She rolled her eyes as she finished it, it was great as always, but she appreciated it all the same. It certainly killed some time, because the next thing she knew she had to drop her mug in the sink, get her bag and say goodbye to her apartment for the day. It certainly was a better first day than the dog shelter, Emma thought, as she re-entered her apartment that evening. Liv had been given the complete run down at lunch and then at coffee after work. Everyone seemed to be realy dedicated to their roles as teachers and most seemed amazed at the amount of extracurricular activities she had managed in her last position. Finally the years of exhaustion had been worth it. She had been through all the first day back routines, setting up her classroom, trying to memorise the other teacher's names and really getting a feel for the place. She had a feeling she was going to like it. She couldn't wait to meet the kids the next day. Her buzzer shrilled just as she was just putting her dinner on her plate. She glanced over at the door as if it would tell her who was there. It couldn't be Liv, she had to go to Daniel's Mom's birthday party or she would be there. Emma's own parents were still away and her other friends didn't call so much anymore. She picked up the phone, \"Who is it?\" \"Hey Em, it's Nate.\" \"Hey Nate, come on up.\" She pressed the button to let him into the building and took out an extra plate while she waited for him to climb the stairs. He gave her door the same knock he had perfected as his personal knock as a kid arriving at her house. She smiled as she opened it. \"Hey, what are you doing here?\" She asked as she wrapped her arms around his neck and felt him hug her back. He scoffed, \"Thanks for the welcome Em. Can I not call over and see how your first day went?\" Of course he did. He was Nate. He had always been there for her. When she was ten and Jimmy Miles had told her she wasn't pretty, when her dog died when she was twelve, to help her move her things out for college and even in the last few months. Most importantly in the last few months. Her 'wedding' had acted as a serious magnifying glass on her life. Who she could count on and who she couldn't. She had a lot of friendly acquaintances but not many friends. Most people she had invited seemed scandalised by her decision and others sided with Fletcher. But Nate? He had picked up her calls even when she would call him whilst drunk wondering what the heck she was even doing with her life. He helped her redecorate her apartment. And he arrived to see how her first day went. \"Well it's a nice surprise.\" She told him, letting him follow her inside, \"I was just about ot have dinner, you want some? I still haven't mastered the art of cooking for one so I have plenty.\" She admitted. \"Yeah, sounds good.\" He said, placing a grocery bag on one of her chairs. \"I brought ice cream if it went bad and wine if it went well.\" \"Well we can have wine with dinner then I guess.\" She smiled. \"That's brilliant Emma.\" He smiled broadly. \"Seriously, you deserve a job that makes you happy.\" A few months ago she hadn't really believed it, but now she did. She dished out dinner and filled him in on her day as they ate. \"Sounds like it's a great place, all your research paid off.\" He commented. \"Yeah, I still can't believe I got the job.\" \"Well believe it. They're lucky to have you.\" She had missed this, time with Nate alone. Even as kids, when she was technically Liv's best friend, her and Nate had just connected. Even though he was older and she was shy, they had their own friendship that was completely their own. Liv had always found it annoying, having to share her best friend with her brother but after the accident she had stopped moaning about it, wanting Nate to have someone he could turn to like she had. But since then? She found it hard to think of many times it the past ten years that she had hung out with Nate by themselves. Fletcher had always been there, or Liv and then Daniel, or it had been at family gatherings. And she couldn't believe she had never noticed. Of course, she had had her happy ending planned with Fletcher, but she had never carved out time for just the two of them. \"So how are things with you? Is Betty from finance still bugging George?\" She grinned over her glass. She loved hearing about the newspaper offices drama he always had news on, it was like hearing about a soap opera. It did help that Nate was a great story teller and usually ended telling her the latest gossip when she nearly cried from laughter. \"Turns out it's because she had a thing for him.\" \"No way!\" \"Yeah, and then she had to catch him a conference room with Kat from reception.\" \"Ouch.\" Emma winced as she started to gather up their dishes. \"So how are things in your love life? How's Alice? I haven't heard about her in a while.\" She knew something was up straight away as she watched him shrug one shoulder and rub the back of his neck. He got up to help her dry the dishes she washed. \"Eh, actually we broke up.\" \"What?\" She asked, nearly dropping the plate she was holding. \"When? Are you okay?\" \"Last week. She justâ¦\" He sighed, \"I should have seen it coming really.\" \"Oh Nate I'm so sorry, you two were really cute together at Liv's wedding.\" \"Yeah, wellâ¦\" \"Why didn't you tell me sooner? I should be the one bringing you ice cream.\" \"I didn't want to ruin your big week leading up to your new job.\" He shrugged. \"But I made you come out with me and Liv and Daniel. I was forcing you to be happy. Nate I'm so sorry!\" She kicked herself for not noticing he hadn't been himself that night. \"It's alright Emma, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I'll be okay.\" She dried her hands quickly and pulled him in for another hug, \"You will be but you call me if you ever need anything or you want to talk.\" \"Will do, thanks.\" He smiled one of his soft smiles. They washed up and dried the rest of the dishes in a companionable silence. She stifled a yawn when they were finished. \"Not sleep much last night?\" He asked. \"How did you know?\" She laughed. \"Oh please, do you not remember the night before your senior year in high school?\" He laughed. Of course she did. \" Isn't it time for you to go to bed young lady?\" Her Dad asked as he turned up at the bottom of the staircase. It had become Nate and Emma's thing . They would sit on her staircase away from prying eyes and have conversations that would last hours. Liv had joined them that night, ruining their seating plan. He had had a growth spurt in the last few years and always sat a step below her so they were level. But Liv squeezed herself in the middle. \"And time for you two to be going home, your Grandma will be getting worried?\" \" Yeah it is I guess Mr Allen,\" Liv sighed, \"I still can't believe we're going to be seniors tomorrow. It's going to be the best year ever.\" Liv hugged Emma and then Emma's Dad as she made her way to the door. Emma had spent the last two hours listening to Liv dictate how they were going to spend their senior year. Boost their reputation, get the hot guys and made it an unforgettable year. Nate had tried to tell her that all that didn't matter, but she didn't listen. \" I better get going.\" Nate said, getting to his feet. \"I've been told I can't drop Liv off in the morning, I'd ruin her street cred. So I've a long drive back to New York tomorrow morning. But I wanted to be here tonight for her.\" \" I know. I'll take care of her. I promise.\" \" I know you will Em. But it's not all your responsibility for Liv's happiness, don't forget to focus on you too.\" Nate gave her a soft smile and descended the stairs, \"Thanks again for Mr Allen.\" Nate gave her Dad what Emma had nicknamed their 'man hugs'. Emma's Mom had brought them both shopping for going back to school and Emma's Dad had comforted a Liv that he had found crying by herself because her parents weren't there to see her become a senior. \" Anytime Nathan you know that. Give us a call tomorrow and let us know you got there safe okay?\" \" Will do.\" Nate turned to look up at her. She had to remind herself that she was over him. He was going to be a sophomore in college, he would never look at her like anything else but a high school kid. \"Have a great day Emma, don't let Liv drive you too mad, let me know how you get on.\" He waved as he followed his sister out the door and down the street to their house. She must have spent too long staring at the door after him because her Dad cleared his throat. \"How about getting ready for bed, big day tomorrow.\" She agreed, kissing her Dad on his cheek and climbing the stairs up to her room. He outfit for the next day (approved by Liv) was lying ready for her on her chair. She got ready for bed, saying goodnight to her parents and climbed into her bed. She thought she would fall straight to sleep like always. She hadn't been that fussed about starting senior year, it was just another year of school and she liked school. But Liv's constant chatter had gotten to her. She lay awake an hour later, wide awake and staring at the ceiling. What if she didn't have a great year like Liv had planned? What if she didn't get into the colleges she applied to? What colleges should she even apply to? How was she going to leave home? What if Liv got a boyfriend and she didn't? Her mind was racing so hard she had to sit up. She grabbled around for her phone and winced at the bright light that met her when she unlocked it. She tried calling Liv but got no answer, her best friend could sleep through anything. So she tried the next best option, feeling terrible if she was going to wake him with his long drive in the morning. He picked up on the third ring. \" Emma? Is everything okay?\" His voice sounded groggy. \" Hi Nate, everything's fine, sorry if I woke you.\" She whispered. \" Don't worry about it. I told you to call me any time remember?\" How could she forget? He had told her that as she held back tears leaving him on his first day in college so far away from her. \"What's up Em?\" \" Iâ¦nothingâ¦never mind, I shouldn't have woken you. I'm sorry. Just have a safe trip tomorrow okay? Okay, goodnight Nate.\" She hurried, hanging up before he could reply. What was she thinking? She was being a baby worrying about school when he was college student who had an entire life that didn't include her in New York. He probably thought she was so lame. There was no point in trying to go back to sleep now, so she swung the covers up and crept over to her school bag to make sure she had everything she needed. She had already triple checked it that day but one more time couldn't hurt right? She was half way through when her cell phone rang, she nearly fell rushing over to it, she didn't want her parents knowing she was still awake. \" Nate?\" She answered. \" Hey Em, are you sure you're alright?\" \" I'm fine.\" She told him swiftly. \" Uh huh, look out your window.\" She looked around before making her way over to it and opening the curtains. There he was. Waving a flashlight at her window. \" What are you doing?\" \" I figure we could go for a walk.\" \" Now?\" \" Well yeah, if I can't sleep I go for a walk to clear my head.\" \" How am I supposed to get down there?\" She asked him. \" Remember that time last year that you and Liv tried to sneak out to Simon Kay's party? Didn't you climb down from your window?\" \" How do you know that?\" \" My Grandma had great fun telling me the story.\" He laughed quietly. Okay so maybe Liv had suddenly developed a fear of heights and froze on the sloping roof of the porch until Emma had to call her Dad to help get them down. It hadn't been their best idea. \"So are you coming down?\" She didn't answer, instead she hung up and she grabbed her jacket and sneakers and opened the window. Liv mightn't have been able to do it, but Emma could. She had practised afterwards, she loved the thrill. She had stepped onto the patio table when Nate appeared at her side, placing a hand on her side to steady her. She climbed down as quickly as she could. \" How did you know I couldn't sleep?\" \" Because I didn't sleep before my first day of senior year either. And you wouldn't call me for nothing. What's on your mind?\" She took a breath. She wasn't sure he would want to listen but she had to remind herself that it was Nate, not some other guy. So she started to relay all the worries that had plagued her, all her doubts of what she was going to do, her fears for the future and her concern that she would somehow mess everything up the next day and ruin the entire year for Liv. He listened, like he always did, as they wandered through the meadow that neighboured the back of her house. He just seemed to know what to say, that she would figure things out, that she was one of the wisest people he knew. They sat under one of the trees as he relayed all the thoughts that hadn't let him sleep the entire first week of his freshman year in New York. She was glad to have him. It was nice to have someone who got her. Liv loved her, and they were best friends but they were such different people. They drifted off into reminiscing about childhood stories until Emma felt her eyes get heavy. \" I think I'll get to sleep now.\" She admitted with a yawn. She told him she would be fine, but he walked her home all the same. The night sky was clear and full of stars and was warm enough for the time of year. She could have stayed outside forever with him. \" Goodnight Emma. Sweet dreams.\" He kissed her on the cheek, \"Call me let me know how tomorrow goes.\" With that he began wandering home and she touched the spot that he kissed. Maybe she still did have that crush on him, just maybe. She fell straight to sleep as soon as she crawled into bed and her head hit the pillow. Her alarm shrilled after what felt like a few minutes sleep to alert her to the fact that she had to rise and shine. First day of senior year. Her mother was a wreck, crying happily ever so often that her baby was growing up so much. She and her Dad dished out the cereal they liked best. \" How did you sleep?\" Her Mom asked. Emma hesitated, \"Good, thanks.\" \" Ah you missed a beautiful night out, the skies were clear. It would have been a nice night for a walk.\" She was pretty sure her Dad winked at her. She practically shovelled up her cereal and made a run for the bus with the excuse to meet Liv. \"And what was I supposed to do, call you again and go for a walk around the city at night?\" She asked with a smile playing on her lips. \"New York under starlight. Doesn't sound like the worst thing in the world.\" He smirked, shrugging on his jacket. \"I'll let you get ready for tomorrow. Let me know how it goes.\" He smiled, leaning in to kiss her cheek. She walked him out of the building. It was only when she was back in her apartment alone that the question flashed like neon lights across her mind. Since when did Nate's chaste pecks on her cheeks make her knees weak?[Chapter 3] Ah, the annual Allen family reunion. It was, as Emma liked to put it, the craziest day of the year. Her aunt's house in Rutherford was overrun by various Allen cousins, by distant relatives and at this stage, half of Rutherford too. It was always held at the end of September. Emma wished this year it was held earlier so she could have used the excuse of still settling into her new job for not attending. But she had settled in better than she expected at work. She was learning all the quirks of the kids in her class and she had even gone or drinks with a few colleagues. It felt like a chance to start her life over. But her family reunion? She was dreading it. Emma had a seemingly never ending train of family members that just loved to push and poke and question her over everything she was doing and find ways to tear her down. As her Dad's only child, she got too much unwanted attention. And after leaving her fiancÃ©e at the altar? It was set to be the worst year yet. She felt like she was getting ready for an interrogation as she put her light blue summer dress on that morning. She could have used some armour. When she had been a kid it had been the day she looked forward to the most, a host of kids to play with and so much food, then as a teenager her and Liv had giggled over her cousins good looking friends who would come along. At least she was used to going to the event solo. Fletcher had gone to one and always managed to make excuses for the next eight years. He didn't do family things he had said. But she knew deep down that he just didn't do her family. \"Oh don't you look wonderful, did you put on weight?\" \"When did you get your hair cut?\" \"How are you dear, after that horrible incident?\" \"Oh why did you cut your hair?\" \"Your poor fiancÃ©e, sticks with you for so long and that's how it turns out.\" \"The clock is ticking, you'd want to be finding someone new soon huh?\" \"Do you still have Marion St Claire's information, my precious Elizabeth just got engaged, did you know?\" Emma somehow managed to smile through the questions that felt like arrows through her heart for the first hour, helping dish out food and making smile talk. \"There you are! Hey Emma, Liv's looking for you.\" Daniel appeared at her side as her 2nd cousin Hannah was harping on how she should have made it work with Fletcher. \"Oh right, sorry Hannah, I have to go, we'll talk later.\" She fake smiled. She had plans to never talk to the woman again. \"Is Liv okay?\" Emma asked as her and Daniel made their escape from the living room. \"Oh she's fine, talking the ear off your Uncle Anthony about some new legal procedures. You just looked like you needed an escape route.\" \"Have I mentioned that I love you Daniel? Because seriously I do.\" She laughed. She had liked Daniel the first time she met him. Liv still wasn't so sure about him, but Emma could see straight away just how much he complimented her best friend. They were perfect together. And it came with the added bonus of her becoming friends with him too. \"Ah Emma now c'mon, I'm a married man.\" He joked. She groaned, \"Please whatever you do, don't remind anyone that I'm unmarried.\" She grinned. \"You coming outside to watch the game. Allens vs Others is about to start I think.\" He asked. There were football games played in the backyard all day, kept all the kids entertained, and given teenage Emma and Liv a good chance to ogle the cute older boys. \"Sure, sounds good.\" They took a seat at one of the many round tables spotted in the large back garden. Daniel and her chatted away as the kids played. He asked about the dance class that she had joined. She now had time for hobbies after work and had taken up a dance class and flower arranging course just because . Because she wanted to. Because she didn't have to run it past Fletcher who would tell her that it was a waste of time. \"Daniel! Come over here and fill in Anthony on that new system you are implementing at work.\" Liv called from the patio. \"That's my cue.\" Daniel said as he waved over and smiled to Emma. \"Thanks for saving me back there.\" She told him as he got up. \"If you need saving from Uncle Anthony just pull on your ear.\" She grinned. \"I might have to use that. I love your family but sometimesâ¦\" \"Oh I know, believe me.\" With that she was left sitting by herself while the party went on around her. She shifted her attention to the game that was taking place, trying to ignore the feeling like she was some sort of exotic animal at the zoo under observation by the rest of the crowd. \"Help me.\" Nate huffed as he took a seat beside her with two beers in his hand and glanced over his shoulder. Emma laughed, she knew the reason he was hiding. Over his shoulder she could see her younger cousin Valerie walking around looking for someone, or more specially, looking for Nate. He handed her a beer, \"How are you not an expert at avoiding her by now?\" She asked. \"I don't know but every single year she finds a way of cornering me.\" He said. Valerie had had her sights set on Nate for years now. She often caught the younger woman bragging about how handsome he was, how reliable, how good of a job he had, how he would make an awesome boyfriend for her. Poor Nate, who tried to let her down easily every year, remained adamant that she just wasn't his type. What his type was exactly, Emma never knew, his girlfriends were never the same and barely had anything in common. Ever. \"Well I think you're pretty safe here, I'm the social pariah this year.\" \"Ah so you've taken over from Great Aunt May who married that guy our age then?\" \"Something like that.\" And it was true, they sat for the next three hours by themselves. Watching the game, talking and catching up. Nate had been away for two weeks with an assignment and she has missed his presence more than she would ever admit. Nobody bothered them, apart from the odd visit of Liv or Emma's parents. The hours ticked by. The sun waned in the sky, the smell of barbeque wafted on the air, the laughter was all that was heard. But they sat in their little bubble. Her light blue dress and his button down shirt. \"Hey Grammy.\" He stood up to kiss his grandmother on the cheek as she ambled over to them. \"You okay?\" Emma always had the upmost respect and love for the woman who had brought up her two teenage, grief ridden grandchildren. She was a force to be reckoned with, even if her shock of white hair and bad hip made her look soft. \"I'm just fine Pet. Be a dear and get me a drink would you?\" \"Of course.\" He said, \"Take a seat. Em, you want a drink?\" \"Sure thanks.\" She smiled. \"So how are you doing Dear?\" Grammy asked, because Emma had been told in no uncertain terms that she was part of the family after her daughter and son in law died and she was her Grandma too. \"I'mâ¦getting there.\" She admitted honestly. \"Well, I haven't seen you smile like this in months.\" She commented as Emma tore her gaze from Nate's retreating figure. Emma gave a small smile, \"Nate was always good at cheering me up.\" Grammy gave her a long look. \"He's a good man, my Nate.\" \"He definitely is.\" Emma said. \"He'd be a good husband too.\" She struck Emma with a straight look that could leave no uncertainty to the fact that she meant her grandson would a be a good husband for Emma. Nobody could call Grammy subtle as Emma felt like she was suddenly choking on air. \"Sorry what?\" She squeaked out. \"What's up?\" Nate asked as he came back, drinks in hand. \"That was quick.\" Grammy said. \"What can I say? Aunt Katherine loves me.\" He smirked. \"You okay Em?\" \"Yeah. I'm fine.\" She recovered quickly. He raised his eyebrows at her phrasing. \"I was just telling Emma about the surprise birthday party that Liv is organising for me.\" Grammy laughed, covering Emma's hand with her own. \"How do you know about that?\" Nate laughed. \"I know everything Dear.\" She patted his cheek. Emma couldn't argue with that. She thought it was impossible, she had never told anyone about her teenage crush on Nate. Not even Liv. As the evening set in, people started to drift off. Something that Emma was glad if, it meant she could make a run for it. \"Any chance you want to make an escape with me?\" Nate asked as he had just warded off an increasingly drunk Valerie. \"Thought you'd never ask.\" Emma grinned, \"I'll just tell Dad.\" He cleared up their empty drink bottles and she made a quick dash to tell her father she was leaving. \"What a day huh?\" Nate laughed as they made their way to their cars. \"Yeah it was a day, alright.\" She scoffed. \"If they learned to mind their own business it would be better, but I've given up hope on that front. Still, I'd hate to miss it, it's nice having traditions.\" He mused. She knew that he still missed his parents, even if he didn't mention them that much anymore. Maybe it was the beer or the fact that she was free from her busybody relations but she found herself winding her arm around his waist as they walked along, \"I like having you here. It wouldn't be the annual Allen family reunion without you and Liv.\" As if it were the most natural thing in the world, he wrapped an arm around her shoulder, \"Thanks Em.\" They reached her car first. \"Drive safe okay?\" He told her, giving her a proper hug. \"You too.\" She told him. But they stood there a few seconds too long, still holding onto each other. A breaths width apart and Emma felt it again. That fizzle of a spark deep in her soul that she hadn't felt in years around Nate. The kind that took her breath away and left her feeling like time had slowed down. \" Ugh Emma, stop stressing, it's not until tomorrow morning!\" Liv said with a stern voice from where she was sitting reading a magazine on the armchair in Emma's room. \"It's not that big of a deal\" Not a big deal? It was a huge deal. The next morning was Emma's first date. At sixteen, she was achingly aware that she was what her Mom called a 'late bloomer', even if her Dad was telling her stop 'blooming' and just stay a kid forever. Liv was fine, she had gone to camp the previous summer and had her first kiss and wrangled her first boyfriend, who incidentally was also her first heartbreak. But Emma had never kissed a boy. She was the quiet one to Liv's exuberance. She had boring brown hair compared to Liv's blonde. She was too tall and lanky and had none of the curves that Liv did. No boy ever even looked twice at her. Until last week when Michael Durran, a junior who had noticed her in the library, had asked her out. He was picking her up the next morning and Emma was freaking out. What if she was too awkward? What if she couldn't walk in the wedge heels that Liv had let her borrow? What if he kissed her and she didn't know how to kiss properly and it freaked him out? What if she ruined the whole night and no boy ever asked her out again? How was she supposed to get married at the Plaza if she couldn't even go on a first date? \" Emma. Breathe.\" Liv told her, coming over and putting her hands on her shoulders and speaking straight to her. \" Okay. Yeah. I can do this.\" Emma tried to convince herself. \" Yes you can, now come on we've spent forever picking your outfit Grammy is going to want me home soon.\" With that Emma followed her best friend silently down the stairs where she found her parents sitting in the kitchen with Nate and his Grammy. All she could do was blush because now everyone would know she was acting flustered because it was her first date tomorrow. Now Nate would know. She didn't know when her steadfast friendship with Nate suddenly took a u-turn to crushing on him. Sometime last summer when Liv was away and her and Nate would hang out like they had since they were kids. But there was something different about him that made her heart race like it never had before. He had grown tall in a short space of time and grew his hair a little longer, and suddenly it took all her effort not to fall over when she was around him. All he needed to do was smile at her and suddenly she had trouble catching her breath. \" Oh hello Dears, what are you two up to this evening? \" She's so nervous.\" Liv announced with a roll of her eyes. Emma could only avoid everyone's eyes and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \"We all get those first date nerves right? Seriously Emma you'll be fine.\" \" Livâ¦\" Emma chided. She didn't think she could blush anymore. \" And it's not like first kisses are as important as you say. Seriously, believe me, they won't care if act like a washing machine.\" \" There is no kissing.\" Her Dad cringing. \" Uh huh.\" Grammy said to Liv with an eyebrow raised, \"And we better be getting home shouldn't we.\" Emma didn't miss the wink she gave her parents over Liv's shoulder. \"Come on you two, we should give Emma some peace. Enjoy your night Darling.\" Emma gave a sigh of relief when they left. \" Morning Em.\" Nate greeted her as she stepped outside to hunt her Dad in for breakfast. She found Nate with her Dad looking under the bonnet of Nate's first car that had seemed to be dying a slow death the past few weeks. \" Hi Nate.\" She said, trying to act normal. She was still in her pyjama's of her oversized t-shirt and shorts and while Nate had seen her look a mess a million times growing up, lately it felt different, as if she didn't want him to see her when she looked anything less than perfect. \" Big day huh?\" He asked, sighing when her Dad tried to turn the key and the engine chugged almost painfully into life. \" Don't remind me.\" Her Dad commented, \"I'll try again after breakfast Nate.\" Her Dad said, wiping his hands and making his way inside. \" Do you want breakfast?\" She asked but then kicked herself. She had been doing that a lot around him too, second guessing herself, trying to be someone he would like. Would her inviting him sound desperate? \" No I'm good thanks, I had something before I came over.\" He said as he closed the bonnet. \"So how are you feeling about this date then?\" \" Fineâ¦\" He tipped his head to one side as if seeing right into her soul, \"How do you really feel?\" He prompted. \" I don't knowâ¦I'm nervous? I don't really know this guy, I mean he's cute and Liv thinks he's cute too. I'm just worriedâ¦\" She bit her lip, she had already said too much. \" Worried about what?\" He asked, leaning against his car. \" What if he kisses me?\" She blurted out then immediately felt her face go red. Had she really just said that out loud? She wanted to steal his car, drive away and never have to look him in the eye again, he was definitely going to think she was pathetic now, some silly sophomore. He glanced at the ground as if contemplating his words, \"You don't want him too?\" She shrugged helplessly, before throwing her hands up.\" I don't know!\" She started pacing, just to not have to look at him, \"I guess I justâ¦I just wanted my first kiss to be this amazing romantic experience, with someone I liked and trusted so even if I didn't do it right, they wouldn't care and out under the stars andâ¦\" She huffed, \"Liv thinks it's stupid.\" \" Liv doesn't like sharing attention.\" He retorted instantly. She just shot him a glare, that was her best friend he was talking about, and kept pacing, wringing her hands in mild panic. \" What if I mess up? And he tells everyone? And I end up alone for ever? And Liv gets married and I'll become the stupid best friend that no guy ever liked, all because I'm worried my first kiss won't be special.\" \" Emma!\" He appeared in front of her seemingly in an instant. He hands were placed lightly on her waist to hold her in place and stop the stressed out pacing. And his eyes were searching hers, for what she didn't know. \"That guy would be idiot not to see how awesome you are and you deserve an amazing first kiss.\" Everything seemed to slow down and she became acutely aware of her hands moving to rest on his upper arms, they weren't pushing him away, it was more like they were drawing him closer. Her stomach was doing summersaults and his intense gaze was going nothing to stop the weak feelings in her knees. \" Emma.\" He said her name in such a soft reverent whisper that she knew she could never forget it. \" Emma?\" Her Mom's voice came from inside her house, the door had been left open. And whatever that memorising experience had been was instantly shattered as they both seemed to jump, and he withdrew his hands as if she had burnt him. Her heart was hammering so hard in her chest that it took her a second to compose herself and shout to her mother that she was on her way. Nate was running a hand through his hair, \"Hey Em, tell your Dad not to worry about the car, I'll be back tomorrow anyway.\" He said as her brain rushed to keep up with the fact that he was suddenly not within reach and instead getting into his car. \"Have a good date.\" He said, with a fake smile all the while avoiding her eyes. She thought something magnificent was about to happen. But it was just in her head wasn't it? This was Nate. He couldn't possibly like her as she liked him. Still, she was left feeling light headed as he drove out of the driveway and she raised one hand in a wave. He looked at her with sad eyes, and with a tortured smile, he tucked a stray piece of hair behind her ear. \"Emmaâ¦Iâ¦\" Whatever he had been going to say got cut off by Liv's shout from behind him. His arms disappeared from her waist and were behind his own back in an instant. And Emma was left with a dizzy feeling, trying to keep up, did she just imagine it all again? It was ridiculous. She was over Nate Learner. End of story. \"Are you two going home already?\" Liv asked as she approached and then she stopped, glancing between the pair. \"What's going on?\" She asked with a smile playing on her lips. So maybe Emma was blushing a little but she could kick her friend for trying to point it out. \"Nothing I was just hoping Nate's new car his more reliable than his first car.\" She didn't know the words were coming out of her mouth but she felt all of sixteen again. \"What was wrong with his first car?\" Liv scrunched up her nose, trying to remember. But Emma didn't blame her for not remember, she had been in the depths of her first heartbreak when Nate had bought the rust bucket that was his first car. \"Oh remember my Dad was always helping him trying to fix it up?\" Emma smiled. Nate looked at her like he was seeing her for the first time, \"â¦Yeahâ¦I remember.\" He said. Emma swallowed hard, \"Well I better get going.\" \"Get home safe, and call me later, I have to tell this story your Uncle was telling meâ¦\" Liv waved happily as Emma climbed into her car and pulled on her seat belt, all while being acutely aware that Nate's eyes never quite torn themselves away from her as she pulled off and started for home. A/N: Thanks so much for reading, I'm enjoying writing this, I'd love to know what you think :)[Chapter 4] Emma's phone rang from her pocket and it took a few seconds for her to root through her many layers of clothes to find out exactly which pocket it was in. The New York winter was hitting hard already. Even with her winter clothes on, and a hot chocolate in her hands, she could still see her breath. And it was only November. \"Finally! She picks up!\" Liv's exasperated sigh greeted Emma at the end of the phoneline. \"Hi Liv.\" Emma smiled to herself. \"Tell me you haven't been picking up your phone this morning because you overslept after having a hot date last nightâ¦\" Emma stifled a laugh, Liv would not be content until Emma found herself a husband. \"Well you were right about the sleeping in,\" Emma huffed as she picked up her pace upon juggling the hot chocolate and her phone to check her watch. She needed to catch the bus. Now. \"But not about the date part.\" \"What about the hot part?\" Emma could hear Liv smirking and kicked herself. With that tone of the voice, the I caught you out and I'm not letting this go one, Emma would be hearing about this for a long time. Just like Spring Break. Emma let the sounds of the early morning traffic fill the silence as she debated how to approach this new subject. \"But seriously what is with you and Nate? I mean please, is writing and correcting the new code word for sleeping together?\" Straight to the point, good old Liv, Emma blushed. \"Okay, what has brought this on?\" Emma asked, as she paid her fare and found an empty seat near the back of the bus. \"Because! You've been spending most of your free time with Nate all of a sudden and don't get me started on the rumours you two started, looking all cosy at Grammy's party.\" \"I've always spent time with Nate. He's my friend too remember?\" \"Yeah and I'm your best friend and his sister and neither of you will do your work anywhere near me.\" \"Well maybe that's something about you?\" Emma teased. \"No. You always get stressed out with your correcting and school work, just like when you used to have to do homework and assignments and Nate always gets ridiculously tetchy about anyone interrupting his flow of writing. And suddenly you two can just spend cosy nights in together?\" \"I don't know what explanation you want Liv, Nate and I can just work together.\" Even as she said it, Emma scrunched up her nose. That wasn't the right description. It never felt like work. Spending time in the evenings together, in her apartment or his, arguing over the choice of take out, while he wrote draft articles and she attacked the pile of uncorrected assignments and tests. It was work, but it didn't feel like it. He was the only person that she could listen to and not get annoyed at. She would read his work and he would help her organise her work better. It wasn't exactly the first time they had found such a good rhythm. Emma rubbed at her sore eyes. This assignment was killing her. And it was only her second one ever. She had done well on her first one but now she was afraid that it was a fluke and she would just end up messing everything up and drop out of college during her first semester of freshman year. Liv had told her she was being dramatic before she left for some party earlier that night. Emma stayed home, like she always did. She had looked forward to college for so long but it just felt like it wasn't fitting right. And she hated that fact. She used to love going out with Liv and laughing until she cried but now with all Liv's new friends and the new city and new environment, Emma just didn't have the need for it anymore. A knock came to the door of the dorm that she shared with Liv and Emma just presumed it was just some new friend of Liv's calling around. Emma had yet to make any real friends and nobody ever called around to see her. She ignored it as she went to make herself a fresh pot of coffee. But another knock came to the door and Emma just rolled her eyes. She just wanted a quiet night alone so she could try and salvage her education. She swung the door open quickly, ready to tell the person to go away. Liv wasn't home. But she lost all ability to breathe, never mind talk, when she was met by Nate Learner on the other side. Despite all her efforts, her lingering crush was still there. She thought college would be her fresh start. That she could finally get over him. That she could create a whole new life in this new place and put Nate firmly back in the 'friend' box. She shouldn't have high school crushes on her best friend's brother in college. But no such luck. He stood there, his hair damp from the rain, his familiar eyes and easy smile that still made her slightly weak at the knees. \" Hey Em.\" \" Hi Nate. Ehâ¦Liv's not here right nowâ¦\" She said. \" Good. I came to see you.\" He nodded over her shoulder, \"Can I come in?\" \" Sure, I guessâ¦\" She stood aside to let him. She cringed to herself, the table was a mess of haphazard notes and empty coffee mugs and she was in the only clean clothes she had left, her worn out leggings and an old band hoodie. She swallowed, the hoodie had been Nate's. Emma had been handed it by his Grandma one cold night when she was going to walk home to put over her t-shirt and well, she had kept it because she was seventeen and still in love with him. Now she was turning nineteen and found comfort in having him near her somehow. She hoped he wouldn't notice. Her other plan for college was to become so mature and irresistible to Nate that he would just fall head over heels in love with her. But with her lack of social life and bad study schedule and messy rooms, it didn't look like that was going to happen. She hated that she still hoped about the possibility every night. He took a seat at the table, not seeming fazed by the mess and her haggard looking appearance. \"I've missed you, you know.\" He said and she was pretty sure she was hallucinating from too much coffee because she was sure that he was blushing at his own admission. She missed him too. But she was also avoiding him too. Her life was a mess of stressing out that she wasn't doing good enough and being embarrassed by how much homesickness was affecting her. And she didn't want to be a liability for him. \" I thought you would be out tonight but Liv said you were staying in so I thought I'd call, is that okay?\" \" Of course it is. You don't need to ask.\" She said as she pretended to organise the notes all over the table. \" Soâ¦how it is going?\" He asked, \"You guys seem to be taking college by storm eh?\" He asked but the smile didn't meet his eyes. \" What?\" She asked, blindsided by the statement, as she got another mug down for him. \" Well Liv is always busy and taking extra classes and having dates and parties to go to and I hadn't heard from you in ages so I presumed you two were doing okay?\" Now he questioned his own statement, she could feel him looking at her. He could always read her like an open book. It was why she was avoiding him. She didn't want to admit it to anyone else apart from Liv that things weren't as brilliant as she pretended they were. She gave up making the coffee and leaned back against the counter. \"I mean Liv is doing great. Me?\" Emma shrugged hopelessly, mortified when her lip started shake. She would not cry. He stood up quickly and engulfed her in a hug. She gave up all pretences of being fine and leaned into his embrace, curling her own arms around him. He was always there for her. \" Is it bad that I'm slightly relieved? Liv is having this wonderful time and my freshman year sucked.\" He admitted with a soft laugh that she felt more than heard. \" I thought it would go better than this. I thought I was better than this.\" Emma admitted, not willing to let go just yet. \"I'm already drowning in study and I have this assignment due and I'm not getting anywhere with it and it feels like it's all pilling up on me andâ¦\" She breathed deeply, \"I'm a crap friend, sorry for not keeping in touch.\" \" Hey don't worry about that, we'll always be there for each other right?\" He asked, even if her own hold had slackened, Nate seemed quite contented in her arms. \" Right.\" She nodded. But she needed to move. Now. Or she would get far too attached to being his arms. He gave her a lopsided grin, \"And hey if there's one person who knows how to claw his grades back up in college, it's meâ¦want to take another look at that assignment, I may not know anything about teaching but I'm an expert at referencing.\" They seemed to effortlessly fall back into their old dynamic that happened whenever Liv wasn't around. They hadn't been alone together in so long and it somehow felt easier to breathe, to just be when it was just her and Nate. They could be themselves. He got her through the assignment and was there when she found out what grade she got. He helped her on the condition that she would visit him over in his campus for coffee the next time she was free. There she had poured over an article he was writing to submit to the college newspaper that would eventually land him a spot on the newspaper team. College life did get easier with Nate now with her. He would swing by after her lectures to catch up and she'd get up extra early to trek across the city to get her hands on the first copies of his newspaper just to read his finished articles and send copies home to her parents and his Grammy. \"Remember in freshman year in college? We had a good rhythm.\" Emma argued to Liv as the bus chugged along. \"Yeah but that was years ago. And we were in college and you had no life.\" \"Ouch. Thanks Liv.\" Emma said sternly. \"I'm sorry but it's true.\" Liv said, \"Oh my gosh remember that though?. I honestly thought you two were hooking up.\" \"Excuse me?\" Emma half laughed in panic, her cheeks flaring red. \"Oh come on, he'd hang around our place all night and you would dash over to his campus at a moment's notice. I just thought you two were being way too obvious.\" \"Okay just to clear up any doubt, Liv we were so not sleeping together.\" She enunciated her words just to be sure. \"Oh I know that now . You dropped Nate as soon as Fletcher came along and you were never a 'love them and leave them' kind of girl anyway.\" \"I did not drop Nate.\" She argued as she stood up for her stop. \"Yes, you did.\" \"No, I didn't.\" She remained adamant but was trying to remember how things went. It all got a bit blurry after she met Fletcher, she became love struck and everything had been a happy haze. \"Do you want to ask Nate because you totally did. Not that I minded, I didn't want my brother sleeping with my best friend.\" Emma swallowed hard, hearing Liv's opinion. That was why her stupid crush on Nate could never amount to anything now either. This was far too much for her early morning commute. She got off at her stop and started walking quicker thanks to the feeling akin to panic curing through her veins. \"Just please don't drop him this time.\" Liv said and suddenly it was clear to Emma why they were having this conversation. Liv was worried about Nate. \"Okay, why would I drop him and why are you so worried about him?\" Liv was quiet on the other side of the phone line. A sure sign that Emma had caught her out. It was the downfall of their life long friendship, it was hard to keep things from the other. \"Wait, what's that Kevin? An emergency? Sorry Em, gotta go.\" Her best friend cut her off. Emma glared at her phone as she kept walking. She debated calling her back or better yet ring Nate and clear all her sudden confusion up. But she had to get work. And maybe she had far too much to contemplate on now. Had she really just pushed Nate out of her life as soon as Fletcher arrived? Months later, after solidifying their comfortable routine and as Emma became happier in her new college environment, her life was changed. She had had a shower and was walking out to the living room to dry her hair when she heard the hushed tones of a Learner argument. Liv and Nate disagreeing over something, but both went silent when she appeared. \" Hey, what's up? You two okay?\" She asked. Liv looked between Nate and Emma, \"We're fine, right?\" She asked her older brother. He gave her a weird look, but it was one Emma knew. Like Liv was backing him into a corner. \" Sure.\" He said, as if he had no other options. \" Oh did you hear Nate and Laura broke up?\" Liv said in a peppy tone. Emma hadn't hear, and she couldn't say she wasn't slightly pleased. Laura was lovely really, but Emma knew her dislike for the other girl sprang out of jealously. She hated it. She didn't want to be petty and jealous. But she was. Laura took up some of Emma's Nate time and Laura was everything that Emma wasn't. Had striking curly red hair, curves in all the right places, she was top of her class and outgoing, and Nate liked her. Therefore, it solidified the fact in Emma's mind that Nate would never like her. \" Oh really? I'm sorry.\" Emma lied. \" Nate broke up with her, why was that again?\" Liv asked him. Nate couldn't have looked more uncomfortable. A far cry from when he would sit on the opposite side of her bed as they shared a pizza at night after they had finished studying and conversations about whatever came to mind, without a care in the world. He shrugged, \"She just wasn't what I was looking for I guess.\" \" Soâ¦I decided I'm dragging him to Jake's party tonight, and he can find what he is looking for. You're coming too Emma.\" Liv said sternly. \" How long do we have stay?\" Nate asked Emma, leaning down to whisper in her ear as they entered the party later that night. \" Liv will forget about us after a while.\" She reassured him as she watched her friend walk in ahead of them, seemingly stopping to talk to everyone in the hallway. \" Give it an hour and we can plan our escape then?\" He asked with a grin, placing a steadying hand on the small of her back as some guy barged down the hallway with too many beers in his hand and Emma stumbled for a split second in her high heels. \" Yes please.\" Emma grinned back. Emma was starting to like going to parties with Liv again, making some friends for herself. But if the other option was spending time with Nate then there really was no competition. \" Hey, you want to go for pizza afterwards?\" He asked, \"Just the two of us?\" He added as an afterthought. \" Sure, sounds great.\" She said, swallowing the disappointment that resurfaced every time it felt like they were solidifying their friendship and the chance of acting on her crush dissipated further. \" Cool. It's a date then.\" He said but she only half heard as another guy bumped into her. \" Sorry. You okay?\" The taller guy asked, with a beautiful smile and strong shoulders, as he put a hand on her arm. \" Yeah I'm fine.\" She said, butterflies suddenly sprouting in her stomach. \" My friend's an idiot.\" He nodded to the guy with too many beers who was falling over the place and knocking into everybody. \"Hey, can I get you a drink?\" She couldn't remember the last time such a good-looking guy had shown interest in her. \"Oh, sure.\" She blushed, pushing a stray hair behind her ear. \" I'm Fletcher, by the way.\" He said, shaking her hand, causing her become slightly breathless. \" I'm Emma.\" She responded and was rewarded with a huge smile. \"Oh and this isâ¦\" She turned around to introduce Nate because she always hated being forgotten about by Liv when a new guy came along but he wasn't behind her anymore. \"â¦sorry I thought my friend was thereâ¦\" \" Doesn't matter, stay there, I'll get you that drink.\" He leaned in to tell her above the noise of the party. She bit her lip as she watched him go. She caught sight of Nate standing against the door to the living room. \"Hey,\" She called above the noise, \"Are you okay?\" She worried suddenly because she had never seen such sadness on his face. She had seen him lost and upset after his parents' death, ecstatic and terrified when he had been accepted to college, devastated when their family dog had died and contented when they used to sit on the stairs at home. But this looked more than sadness, more like misery. \"â¦ Ohâ¦yeahâ¦\" He said but he wasn't convincing either of them. \"â¦Eh I just saw Lauraâ¦\" He said but his voice was off and he wasn't meeting her eyes. \"Heartbreak sucks.\" He sighed. Emma would know, she spent years wallowing in it when Nate would never look at her as anything different than his sister's friend. But she hated seeing him looking that upset. \" I'm sorry.\" She said. But Fletcher appeared by her side, \"There you are. Here you go.\" He handed her a drink. \"Hey man.\" He said to Nate and Emma was nearly sure he was sizing Nate up. \" Hey.\" Nate nodded back, \"I better go find Liv.\" He excused himself. \"See you later Emma.\" Giving her a reassuring smile, he disappeared into the crowd. Emma was on her break later than day when it hit her. She had always remembered that party as the first time she had met Fletcher. She had spent all night talking to him and left with Liv, staying up until morning as they dissected everything that had happened with Fletcher. It was only now, after the Fletcher haze had abated and Liv's warnings about Nate circled in her mind, that she remembered. She had promised Nate that she would hang out with him afterwards. But she never did. He must have left the party by himself. And after that, well Fletcher worked himself into her routine and Nate kind of fell out of it. She still saw him all the time of course, they were still practically family, or they would all hang out as a group but it was never as cosy and comfortable as it had been when it had been just the two of them. Emma now put it down to finally finding someone who could keep her undivided attention away from Nate Learner. It was probably for the best for the love sick nineteen year old girl who only wanted Nate. And Nate had never brought up their sudden lack of alone time. He had found another girlfriend soon enough, a blonde and ambitious girl, again, nothing like Emma had been. But Fletcher was there to soothe over the pain until she no longer got jealous of every one of Nate's girlfriends, until she moved from seeing him as her eventual happily ever after to seeing him as her friend's brother. Emma nibbled at her sandwich. But what happened now that Fletcher wasn't around to distract her anymore. Now her crush was flaring up again. What happened when she remembered that all her childhood, dreaming of the her wedding at the Plaza, she had always dreamed of Nate waiting for her at the end of the aisle?

Liv's POV I looked at Nate and were dancing together. Hey,I thought,Nate,that's my best friend. It was as if Daniel could read my mind,because he said at that moment. \"Why don't we let them go.\" \"Hmmm,\"said I.\"Why do I think that I married someone smarter than myself.\" And then we kissed. Emma's POV I was standing near a table,watching as Liv and Daniel make such a cute than me and Fletcher anyway.I now realized that me and Fletcher weren't...well,we weren't meant together,like Liv and Daniel. Just then,Nate came over me and asked. \"Do you want to dance?\" \"Yes.\"I said. It was as if he read my mind.I would have been dancing with Fletcher ,now I get to dance with somebody. We moved to the dance floor and started went on for a long time and then Nate finally said. \"I am sorry know,about you and Fletcher.\" Everybody's sorry Nate,I wanted to tell,But I had to correct my mistakes. \"No.\"I said.\"Don't be and me were not meant to be together.I should have realized that ,I wouldn't have been standing here wearing my mom's torn wedding dress ,and cat fighting with my best friend on mine and her's wedding is my fault.I was in a hurry to get married and start a family and do that happily ever after thing from the fairy tales that I never saw the reality.I was a real idiot.I should have realized what Fletcher wanted.\" I looked into Nate's eyes and saw something in was not sympathy or else.I also realized this is the first time I have talked to anyone other than Nate has got Liv's listening ability and the patience,which Liv dosen't have. We danced again for a couple of minutes and that's when the music ended and Liv and Daniel climbed on to the passed Daniel a held it to his mouth and began. Danile's POV I had the microphone in my hand.I held to my mouth and began. \"Ladies and ,that is to say,me and my beautiful wife,Liv,thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for all of you to be present in this is a very big day for the both of us and it has been made even more special by two that is not for me to Liv,will you?\" Liv's POV Daniel passed me the mike.I took it from him and smiled at him. \"Well\"I began.\"I am not usually good at these kind of ,I do presentation but not ,as I stand here with my husband,I feel that I have to speak about those two wonderful people whom I was fortunate enough to get in my first is my best friend,Emma Allan.\"I pointed at her.\"As many of you gathered around here probably know,we two had a fight over this whole wedding I am sure all of you witnessed the squabble we had earlier today.\"I felt my face grow hot. \"But we have been together for the last twenty years and had been dreaming of this over these days,when we were fighting,she made me realize a very important don't have to be always ahead of you Emma,for making me realize this little girls in us have always dreamed of our wedding day.I have got mine.I am sure that you'll get yours one you can be sure of me to be at your side on that day.\" I watched as Emma's eyes filled with tears,as everybody smiled at me and I smiled back.I realized I had tears in my eyes too.I wiped it away and continued. Nate's POV Liv wiped her .I had never seen her cry just then,I saw Emma crying ,why do women always cry. But Liv continued. \"Next,I want thank my dearest brother was,well,very supportive during this crazy is also a very great ,you have made me the luckiest and proudest sister today.I am proud of you bro.\" The crowd clapped and I felt my cheeks grow hot. \"Liv...\"I said. But she merely grinned at well,it is not everyday your younger sister get married.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer;I own nothing but the plot. A/N;Those who saw Bride Wars,it is just the continuation to the movie. Four months later Emma's POV I was just waking up when my phone rang.I was really tired after that extra class that I fell asleep just as I hit my bed.I looked at the clock at my mantle.7 p.m.I sat up the hell am I doing in bed at 7 p.m?I realized that my phone was still ringing.I picked it up. \"Hello?\"I voice was thick with sleep. \"Wake up sleepy out here.\" \"Nate?\"I said,sitting up straight. Ever since Liv's wedding,we were now,I am in love with him.I don't know about Nate. I quickly showered and walked out of my apartment to find Nate standing before his grinned as he saw me. He took my hand and kissed it before saying. \"Get in the are going somewhere.\" Nate's POV I totally loved to see Emma's confused did not know what was in store for drove for quite a long time and finally arrived at the place that I had lake side!Dad had once told me that he proposed to mom in this very place and it had seemed so magical to I have brought Emma to that very place.I plan to propose to her finally came to the lake side.I stopped the car and got out. \"Nate.\"called Emma.\"Where are we?\". \"You'll soon find out.\"I said,holding the door open for got of the car and turned to stand facing the lake. Emma's POV I turned to look at the was beautiful!I had never seen anything so beautiful before. I turned to look at Nate,only to see him standing right beside me.I was startled for a moment,but quickly gathered my composure. Nate grabbed my hands and dragged me to a mad me sit on ,he knelt near took out a box out of his pocket.I could see the brand name on the top of the box. Tiffany .I gasped. He took my hands and then said. \"Emma Jane Allan,would you do the honour of being my wife?\" This is something that I wanted him to do for the last four months. I took in a deep breath and then said. \"Yes,I would love to be your wife.\" Nate grinned at me and slipped the ring into my he learned forward and we kissed for a long time. Emma's POV Come on Liv,pick up the phone.I thought,as her phone rang. I have been trying to call Liv the whole night but she won't answer the freaking phone. \"Hello?\"Liv said\"Emma?\" \"Liv,I'm engaged.\"I screamed into the phone,before she could say anything to me. It was a full two minutes before she answered. \"What?Who?When?You have to tell me everything Emma.\" It was last night and we went to the lakeside and Nate just proposed to me and...\" \"Wait a sec, Nate proposed to you?\" I stopped for a ,Liv didn't know about me and knew we were dating but Nate never told her about proposing to me. \"Er,Yeah.\"I stammered. Liv did not speak for a few 's silence means there is something dangerous she spoke. \"Okay,meet in the Blue Boar in twenty excuse.\"and with that,the call ended. Oh brother,I thought,i was a pending disaster. Nate's POV. I don't know what is wrong with Liv.I was at work when I received a message in my mobile. Be in Blue Boar in 20 excuse,Liv. It was highly unusual of Liv to text like if I don't go,she may set my things on fire,like she did when I did not go for her third grade singing ,I had to go. Liv's POV. Nate and Emma sat before me now.I had a cup of coffee in my hands. \"So.\"I said.\"You guys are getting married?\" \"Yes\"said Nate. \"Are you sure you want to do this Emma?\"I asked again. Emma looked at me and then answer ed. \"Liv,when I agreed to marry Fletcher,I just wanted to get married.I did not realize that what Fletcher and I this time,it is real.I love Nate and want to live with him for the rest of my life.\" Okay, Emma has said her it is Nate's turn. \"Nate.\"I turned to him.\"Are you sure about marrying Emma?Because I don't want to see my best friend getting hurt again.\" Nate's POV. What is this,some kind of police station?I had my own because Liv was my sister and Emma's best friend,I had to answer her. \"Liv,I realized that I loved Emma only when she was going to get married to Fletcher.I couldn't tell her my when she broke the engagement,it took time for her to heal from that wound and for me to gather courage to ask now that I finally gathered courage to ask her and had done it,I feel it is the best thing I had ever done in my life.\" Liv leaned back on her for the verdict. Emma's POV Liv leaned back on her chair and was silent for a long she spoke. \"There is one condition\".she said I held my breath. \"As I totally messed up Emma's last wedding,I get to plan this one.\" I stared hard at her and then hugged her held me tightly and said. \"Remember the promise I made four months ago?About me being there for you when you need to keep that when you are joinging our welcome to the family Emma Allan.\" Ah,I love this girl... A/N-Second chapter is how about some reviews?I could do with some of guys...[Chapter 3] Here's my new feel free to review. I was again in Marion 's office. I stared around in wonder, yet again. I was fascinated by her the last time I was in her office, with all the pictures and other wedding stuff. \"So we meet again Liv.\"I heard a voice behind me. I turned to see Marion walking towards me. She came near me and we hugged. \"I never thought I would see you again.\" she said.\"Don't tell me you want to get married again.\" \"Er no, Daniel and I are really happy. I am here for Emma. She's getting married.\"I said. What I said surprised Marion. \"Emma, getting married?\"she said sharply.\"To whom may I ask?\" \"Well, she's getting married to my brother Nate. And I promised her that I would arrange her wedding for , here I am.\" Marion stared at me for a long time and then she smiled. \"You know Liv, I never thought I would see you and Emma together again. But I sure am glad.\" I smiled at her. She was so right. During those days, I never thought that we would be speaking , Nate's lucky that we are friends again. \"So Liv, have a seat. We can talk this over. I am sure Emma will love what you do for her.\" Emma's POV. I don't believe it. You went to Marion St Claire again for my wedding. I don't know what she is thinking of? I mean, of course I wanted my wedding to be arranged by Marion since I was 10,but...now, after the whole Fletcher and the video fiasco, I think a small function would be the best. I don't have the strength to suffer another disaster. Not that this wedding is going to be one. But still... Liv's POV Okay, I admit that Emma is really weird. Last night she was over at my house and when I told her about my meeting with Marion, she choked on her salad. \"What?\"she spluttered.\"You met Marion ?\" \"Yeah.\"I said, shrugging.\"What is wrong? I promised I would do this wedding for , I am and you and my dear brother are getting married at the Plaza.\" \"But Marion?\"she said again. I was getting annoyed by now. I mean come on, she wanted to get married in Plaza since we were now, and she wants to have a small ceremony? I swear I am gonna kill her. \"Emma, you want this. You know you do.\" \"Yes soon after the whole wedding fiasco, I am getting married again and ...What will people say Liv.I don't know what they will say, but I am sure they will be surprised. They may even think I am just showing off. But you know I am not, don't you? Of course you do. So silly of me to suggest that. But still...\" \"Emma, SHUT UP\" Emma was startled by my angry voice and immediately stopped in alarm. I leant back on my chair and grinned at startled face. \"That's better.\" Daniel's POV. Nate was supposed to meet me in exactly five minutes. We were having a man to man talk. You know, about the whole marriage stuff. Nate walked in and came near my table. \"Hey.\"he said, giving me a hand. I took it and said. \"Hey, sit down Nate.\" He sat down and looked at me. I took a deep breath and began. \"So congrats told me about your engagement with Emma.\" He looked up and smiled at me. Nate's POV Daniel and I talked for some time and then we walked out. Emma had asked me to pick her up from Liv's apartment. As we opened the door, we heard Emma's desperate voice saying. \"...will say, but I am sure they will be surprised. They may even think I am just showing off. But you know I am not, don't you? Of course you do. So silly of me to suggest that. But still...\" And then Liv's voice, slightly higher. \"Emma,SHUT UP.\" We walked in to see Emma and Liv seated opposite each other. Looks like they were discussing something. Maybe wedding plans. Liv turned to us and said. \"Nate, Daniel, you are .Nate, you can talk some sense into Emma.\" \"What is it?\"I said, taking a seat next to Emma. \"Well, we were just discussing the wedding plans. But Emma seems to be disagreeing with me.\" I noticed with amusement that Emma glared at Liv. I got up from the chair and said. \"Sorry Liv, but gotta go.\"Daniel, Liv and Emma too got up and Liv hugged Emma. Emma rolled her eyes, grinned at Liv and walked out with me through the door. We walked out of the apartment and into my climbed into the front seat with me and suddenly,she yawned.I looked at her with amusement. \"What?\"she asked me. 'Nothing,let's go home.\"I said and started the car. Okay,here it is.I need some more guys,I am also planning a bridal shower for do you think of that?I need your options.[Chapter 4] Another of the thing the bride is allowed to for again,with the help of the.I have the best brides maid in the whole ,that is to say,me and Liv,walked through the roads,with me protesting. \"Liv,you know I want to wear mom's dress for the wedding.\" Liv looked at me with that exasperated look of hers. \"Emma,have you forgotten that I have already torn your mom's dress?\" She said it with a sheepish grin. So we walked into the biggest boutique I have ever was full of wedding kinds of dresses. Ya,I have been to purchase Liv's wedding that was a different place. \"So Emma,what do you think?\"said Liv I turned to face Liv.I guessed my eyes were shining like the fourth of July because Liv grinned. \"Right.\"she said.\"Let us see.\" So for the next 4 hours,we spend our time in the boutique,during which we were joined by Deb. The first thing was Deb's bridesmaid ,that was the most easiest as Deb herself chose it,looking over just four dresses. She chose a black,strapless knee length dress with a white ribbon looked great on her as she lost lots of weight since the last wedding. Liv was more difficult to choose. Both of us liked a blue one and a lavender was very finally,we chose the blue one. Well,the only one left was me. Finally,finally after hours of trying out like hundreds of dresses,I selected , we selected looked so beautiful that both of us immediately fell in love with it. It was a beautiful dress,and I hate to admit it,but it was nicer looking than my mom's.I loved it very much and so did we bought that. We walked out of the boutique and suddenly I slapped my hands to my forehead. \"Liv.\"I said,as I snapped my mobile shut.\"I need to go home.I have got something really important to do. \"Why so urgent?\"said Liv. \"Liv,but I gotta is really important.\" \"Okay,I will drop the things later when I come with Daniel.\" So I grabbed a taxi and within fifteen minutes,I was in our apartment.I walked inside to find Nate standing in the balcony,a drinking from a bottle of empty bottles were piled together beside ,he had been drinking a lot. \"Nate?\"I called.\"Honey?What happened?\" Nate turned. \"Nate.\"I called.\"What happened?\" \"Emma,dad called today.\" Oh,so that is .Lerner and Nate did not go along well. \"And?\"I asked \"He apologized to congratulated me.\" \"Well,that is what is all this?\" \"I am happy called me.\" He hugged me.I hugged him was a long time since his dad called him. \"So what did you do today?\" I Know it is short,but I promise the next chapter will be long...And to see Liv's,Emma's and Deb's dresses,just see my profile.

AlwaysnKate, only Kate. \"Rick, this is impossible.\" Rick glanced at him for a second...nthen yelled at Kate.[Chapter 3] \"What are we doing? Why am I doingnthis?\" The words echoed in Jack's head as he stared at the box. Hadnit been Kate's dream or his greed that had brought them to this, to anroom with an empty box. \"That god damned glass box is emptynfor one reason. We can't find a go-to guy.\" Was that what Jack had become, thengo-to guy? A dream maker? Marie had been his only dream, the onenthing he had wanted above everything else. If only she were here now. From its shelf, the box mocked him.[Chapter 4] They had done it. Some how they hadngotten over the past and moved on. How she had flown. Flown sonbeautifully. The first time he had seen Kate skatenthere had been a tugging within him. Then there had been the phonencall from Jack and that tugging returned. The day he had seen a tape of Dougnthere had been a thump in his chest. When Doug said he would give itna try the thumping set up a steady beat. But now... Anton thought his heart might burstnfrom the joy of it. How she had flown.[Chapter 5] Over the loudspeaker Kate heard hernname being announced. Brian put his hand on her back and give her ansmall push. \"A dark rink,\" she thought, \"just a spotlight onnBrian and I, no one else in the world.\" And then they were skating. Think of the stroking, it's justncrossovers, simple. Brian's hands at her waist, pushing hernup into the press and then she was flying. But it was too high, toonfast. The world around Kate was always moving, forcing her along andnit was just too much. Why did they push her to fly higher?[Chapter 6] Doug looked at the letter, ran a fingernover the Red Wings logo. \"What are you gonna do? You gonnanfight me? Are you gonna fight the world?

I also know it's really short but it's only the opening, but I promise the next one will be longer. Disclaimer: I unfortunately do not own The Librarian or any of these characters. I'm just using them for my own means! Every corner he turned, he saw her. He saw her across the street or down the stairs, in the library or in a shop. He just saw her everywhere he went. For weeks he mourned her secretly, the fact no one else knew about Simone broke his heart as it meant he had no one to talk about his feelings to, although it was unlikely that he would even if he did have the chance. Sighing, he entered his flat and saw candles lit everywhere causing him to look around for someone to blame but finding no one. Walking over to his bedroom, he stared at the piece of paper on the bed and the rose beside it. Picking up the piece of paper, he stared at the familiar curly handwriting and took in the address and time written on it before smiling. Was it really her? Was she really alive? Was she really coming back to him? Sliding the letter into his jacket pocket, he sighed as he stared at all the candles and laughed, knowing it wouldn't be worth it blowing them all out as it just caused unnecessary effort and the thought that it might have been her that had gone to this effort made him less able to come to terms with the fact it was a fire hazard and if it got out of control it might end up killing him, the only thing he could really think about was how Simone might still be alive and out there waiting for him.[Chapter 2] Entering the old building, he sighed as he saw no one. No figures moving, no words echoing around the great room, leading him to believe that this was all a joke set up by someone who knew something. Somehow! Walking around the room slowly, he began to take in the magnificent building once more even though he'd visited it hundreds of times in his past but this time he wasn't taking in the monuments and the images, this time he was also searching, looking to see whether she was hidden there. \"Simone\" he whispered finally, knowing he was giving up on the one thing that had made him hopeful and this was probably a joke, set out by someone cruel and heartless who somehow knew how to hurt him in the worst way. \"Flynn\" a voice declared and he turned, almost gasping as the site of the woman before him. Her dark hair reflecting her pale skin and the red dress she was wearing enhancing the chillness of her skin. Running over, he pulled her into his arms and felt her head bury against his shoulder as he held her, desperately trying to hide the tears that were threatening to run down his cheeks. Looking up, she stared and slowly slipped her hand across his cheek, the familiarity of her cold skin no longer sending shivers down his spine but rather making him smile as she continued to look at him. \"Flynn\" she mumbled again, convincing herself that this was real. \"Simone\" he laughed as she nodded, her arms wrapping around his neck while his wrapped around her waist. \"You're alive\" he declared bluntly as she shrugged. \"Well sort of alive\" he whispered as she leant in, their foreheads touching as she smiled and sighed, the sigh causing him to relax slightly as she remained in his arms. \"I didn't know what to do Flynn, I just woke up here and I knew that it meant I was supposed to be with you\" she whispered, her accent clear and beautiful like it had been just a few weeks ago when they'd said goodbye. \"I didn't know how to tell you without you freaking out\". \"Simone, I love you, you've come back to me that's all that matters\" he whispered as she nodded and sighed, tears trickling down her cheeks as he sighed and rubbed them away slowly with his thumb. \"Although it would have probably given me a heart attack\" he laughed as she nodded and hugged him, the feel of him close to her causing her to smile. \"Where are you stayingâ¦\". \"Around\" she whispered as he pushed her face up gently with his thumb, their eyes looking into each other's, half checking that this was real and that they weren't dreaming, like they had both spent weeks doing. \"Different places each day, wherever you were I went\". \"Stalker\" he laughed as she smiled and moved closer, their lips practically together. \"I don't mind if you stalk me forever\". \"Forever is a long time Flynn\" she declared as he nodded and smiled. \"Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with me\". \"Of course I do woman, I love you and I'm not going to lose you again\" he whispered as she sighed and sat down, him quickly joining her. \"What's wrong\". \"You're not going to lose me again but one day I'm going to lose you\" she mumbled as he held onto her hand. \"And you'll never come back to me Flynn\" she whispered, his arms pulling her closer to him as she felt a tear run down her cheek, the emotions she felt killing her inside for the third time. \"You know there's a way to stop that\" he mumbled as she shook her head. \"I want to be with you forever Simone and if that's how to do it then I want it\" he whispered as she continued to shake her head, tears streaming down her cheeks but they were silent. \"Simoneâ¦\". \"I would never do that to you Flynn, I would never make you feel the pain I've felt all these years\" she whispered, the tears slowly stopping as she stared at him. \"Because I love you\" she mumbled as she leant up and kissed his cheek gently, him turning gently and moving his lips against hers, soft and gentle but explaining all the emotions they'd secretly shared over the past few weeks while separated. XOXOXO Walking out of the building, she wrapped her arm around his and sighed as she rested her head slowly against his shoulder, her eyes shutting briefly unknown to the fact that he was watching her, enjoying having her close to him again. Stopping, he smiled and pulled her into his arms, a giggle escaping from her lips as he slowly swayed her along to the imaginary music he had in his head, the dance similar to that of their first night together in New Orleans. No one said anything and the only noise was that of the cars driving past while they remained alone, a shocking thing for where they were. \"Where are you staying tonight\" he asked as she sighed and looked up at him, a smile appearing on her face while he continued to sway her around to the silent music. Her eyes told him that she didn't know and that the movement of his hand running down her back told her that he was thinking. \"Stay with me, I have enough space and I have a freezer for all your, you know\" he mumbled still not able to come to the terms with the word blood. \"You don't mind\" she whispered, a smile appearing across his face as she stared at him, the smile giving her some confidence in his statement as his hand remained at her hip. \"I don't want to get in your way, you have such a life Flynnâ¦\". \"Simone, my life is with you, I thought you'd seen that\" he declared as she bit her bottom lip gently. \"I thought you realised that I want to just be with you\". \"But I can't go out in the day, we'll never be able to go out together or enjoy things like others do, we'll never see each other\" she whispered, a tear running down her cheek causing him to sigh and wipe it away. \"I don't want to ruin what life you have\". \"Simone you're my life, anyway all the occasions I want to show you off at are in the evening so it'll be fine\" he laughed as she smiled. \"I don't care if we're confined to just going out at night and that I never sleep, as long as you're with me I don't care\" he whispered, a smile appearing on her face as she moved closer, her eyes closing before she pressed her lips gently against his, the movement of their lips together perfect and synchronised, the passion building up the longer they were together.[Chapter 3] Thank you for your comments, I really appreciate them. This is the last chapter for this story as I didn't know where to go with it, so I hope you enjoy. Opening his eyes, he rolled in his bed, a smile appearing on his face as he stared at the woman next to him. Although she was fast asleep, she was still the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. The blanket covering her body to save her modesty but the paleness of her shoulders reminded him of her cold beauty. The beauty he'd fallen so desperately in love with. Sitting up, he stared at the clock on the wall, informing him that he was already late for work causing him to groan and climb out of bed, pulling on his clothes quickly. \"Where's my shoes?\" he moaned, desperately trying to remember where he'd kicked them off last night in his desperation to touch her again, to have her once more. \"Shoes\" he declared, forgetting she was asleep for a moment, his voice waking her. Sitting up, she pulled the blanket around her and stared as he crawled on the floor in search of his shoes. \"Have you tried next to the front door?\" she asked causing him to stand up and kiss her, a smile on his face. \"Youâ¦brilliantâ¦gorgeousâ¦sexyâ¦cleverâ¦woman\" he announced between kisses before she laughed. \"Shoes\" she reminded causing him to nod and run off in search of them. Walking back in, he smiled as he watched her lie back down on the bed, biting her lip in silence. \"What are you thinking about?\" he asked causing her to look at him and giggle gently. \"Now I want to know\" he declared. \"I was just thinking about last night, about how brilliant it was\" she mumbled causing him to walk over and kiss her again, her hands slipping under his shirt. \"Your late\" she whispered. \"I don't care right now\" he mumbled onto her lips before kissing her once more. \"I'm enjoying this too much\". \"I'll be here when you get back\" she announced causing him to sigh and sit down on the bed, his back facing her as he began to tie his shoes up. Sitting behind him, she smiled as she ran her fingers up and down his back, her lips moving onto his neck. \"I'll be here forever if you want me to be\" she whispered, a mixture of her accent and what she was doing causing him to groan. \"Simone, I'm never going to get to work if you keep doing that\" he moaned, even though he wasn't upset over the fact. \"Doing what?\" she asked causing him to turn around to face her. \"Being so deviously perfect\" he whispered before kissing her again. \"Now, I've got to go or they'll send out a search party\" he announced causing her to nod as he climbed off the bed and walked towards the door frame. Standing there, he sighed before turning around and looking at her. Realising how much he wanted her to be there every time he woke up and went to bed. He wanted to make love to her forever and kiss her until there wasn't any possibility to do it anymore. \"Simone?\" he asked causing her to look up. \"You're never going to get to work\" she declared causing him to smile at her. \"What's the matter Flynn?\" she asked. \"Just wondering if you'd marry me\" he announced. XOXOXOXO Standing in front of the mirror, she let a giggle slip from her lips as she ran her finger across the ring that rested on her finger. She loved it. The simplicity of it and yet the beauty of it enchanted her and she was glad she got to wear it forever. Hearing a knock at the door, she turned as it opened to reveal Flynn, dressed in a suit, the smile on his face larger than she'd ever seen. \"Are you ready?\" he asked causing her to nod and walk towards him, the long white dress she was wearing complimented her to perfection he realised as he stared at her from the doorway, his arm wrapping around her when she reached him. \"You really are perfect Simone\". \"So are you\" she giggled before kissing him gently. \"Shouldn't we be going?\" she asked as he led her out of the room towards the registry office. They'd kept it small, just them and his mother and work colleagues. There was no need for anyone else. It was just about them now. Standing in front of the minister, Simone smiled as she stood beside the man she'd fallen so badly in love with, their hands still held together tightly. The ceremony was small and sweet, Flynn's mother bursting into tears as he whispered his vows, laughing half way through as he realised that he was finally marrying the woman of his dreams, his vows quickly changing half way through as well. \"I now pronounce you man and wife, you many now kiss your bride\" the minister declared as Flynn pulled her close, his lips connecting to hers before she had time to realise what was going on. Moving away slightly, he smiled as she stood there with her eyes shut for a moment. \"I love you Mrs Carsen\" he declared causing her to laugh gently. \"I love you too Mr Carsen\" she announced, her arms wrapping his neck as she kissed him once more, thanking whatever had brought her back to life and what had brought her back to him. ","Summary":" Okay this is the first time I've ever written something for The Librarian so I'm really sorry if it"},{"Movie":"Cutting Edge","Title":"Second Chances","Author":"WoCoBelle","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5942381","Passage":"[Chapter 1] CHAPTER ONE \"Mr. Harrisonâ¦.Mr. Harrisonâ¦ Mr. Harrison, your table is ready\" The hostess sounded more than just a little irritated with Alex, and who could blame her? The poor girl had scrambled to move him to a table where he wouldn't have to watch the TV, and now she couldn't get his attention away from it to try and seat him again. She finally was able to lead him to his table and put the menus down without a word, not even bothering to ask if he needed anything while he waited. When Zach was more than his usual couple of minutes late to dinner, Alex knew that he too had been watching the competition. He wondered if Zach had the same range of emotions watching it that he himself had. Alex had almost gotten used to it. He had the same feeling five years ago watching Jackie coach Zach and Alexandra to victory, Now, it was no longer Zach going for gold with Alexandra, and that had to effect him in some way. Alex waved Zach over to the table, as he took a Michelob Light out of the bucket for him. \"Long time, no see. How was Vegas?\" Zach accepted the beer as he proceeded to tell Alex about all the excitement the lights, casinos, and crowd brought. And how glad he was to be back home. Sure, he loved being behind the scenes of hot, new athletes, but after a couple of weeks of it, he needed a break. Especially when he remembers what it was like to be those guys. He probably wouldn't have been able to make it through his first few months of his job if Alex hadn't been such a great friend. Alex had lived the same story as Zach, if not more dramatic. At least Zach and Alexandra had realized they couldn't survive as a couple off the ice before there were vows involved. \"So, did you catch Nationals this weekend\" Zach figured he might as well go ahead and get the elephant in the room out there. \"Tried not to, but then I got mesmerized.\" \"Yeah, they were really something out there. I'm actually glad that Alexandra found someone to keep skating with. She deserves it\" \"I can't decide how I feel about Jackie getting success again. I just don't understand how she can get back out there for others, but she couldn't do it for us.\" \"I told you man, when I approached her years ago about coaching us, she didn't seem too keen on it. I think it may have helped her heal to see others doing what she felt she couldn't. I have no real answer for you, though. Sorry.\" Neither really wanted to continue talking about ice skating, so they ordered and turned the conversation to business. Both continued to think back on it, though. Thousands of miles away, Hannah threw open the apartment door and angrily marched to her closet. She started pulling out shoes, hair ribbons, and uniforms. How could she have been so stupid? Almost three years ago, Hannah had pushed her skates and glitter costumes to the back of her closet and made room for poms' and polyester skirts. Now, as she threw all of her cheerleading gear into a trash bag, she reached to pull her ice skating bag from its corner. She held it tight and let the tears fall. Just when Hannah had gotten the taste of success in skating, her world fell apart. Her father had passed away the week after she had earned her place at Nationals. She was placed in the care of Doug, Walter's younger brother, and his wife Kate. Unfortunately, soon after she went to live with them, their daughter suffered a major injury that soon started to destroy her marriage. It was all too much for the Dorsey family as a whole and Hannah had to escape. The week before Nationals, Hannah packed her bags and returned home, leaving only a note for her family. She enrolled at Minnesota State. She continued to ice skate in her spare time, but it hurt too much to be on the ice, knowing what she had missed out on. Instead, she immersed herself in college, joining a sorority and taking up cheerleading. Her aunt and uncle continued to try and talk her into returning to the rink until the day they died. She had gone skating at the family rink the weekend of her uncle's funeral and was surprised to discover that the pain skating had once brought was replaced with a longing to be part of it again. Unfortunately, she had taken too much time off as an individual to compete at that level again. After her cousin's divorce, she knew her heart couldn't take another disappointment from the ice and swore off couples. She has left with no choice but to continue thinking about what might have been and return to the world of cheerleading. And now, it, too, had broken her heart. Well, maybe not exactly cheerleading itself, but it is what led her to the source of this agony. The team and cheerleaders were out celebrating the end of season. Hannah had only been on the squad for a couple of years and wasn't as sentimental about it all being over as the rest of the seniors were. As the girls all sat around and discussed how different things had become since their freshman year, Hannah escaped to go get a glass of wine. When a male voice behind in told the bartender to put it on his tab, she turned around to give him a piece of her mind. Instead, she caught herself just staring in awe. She and Jackson spent the rest of the night talking and were inseparable the rest of the school year. They had even decided to stay in school an extra year together so that Jackson could play out his eligibility. Luckily, Hannah was able to cheer again, giving them even more time together. Hannah just knew he was going to propose during graduation. Well, she at least thought that until about an hour ago. She walked in to her cheer coach's office to drop off a thank you gift she had gotten her and say goodbye. She didn't expect her to be at graduation for the graduate students since Hannah was the only one on the squad. It was after hours, so she was not surprised when no one was there. She was just going to leave it on the desk and jot a quick note. She was just about to sign her name when Jackson exited the coach's storage closet, wearing only his boxers. Coach Talbot walked out wearing not much more. Hannah just starred and took of running, not listening as they both begged her to come back. Apparently heartbreak wasn't limited to the world of ice skating â it was everywhere you were willing to give your heart. So Hannah did the only thing she knew how to do â she packed and left, leaving only a note for her roommate with the remainder of the rent.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER TWO Jackie let herself into the house and dropped her bags. She was exhausted - mentally, physically, and emotionally. It was always exhilarating to see Alexandra and James win, but underneath all the excitement, Jackie always felt a little bit of heartbreak. The best part of winning to Alexandra and James was that they got to share it. Jackie had no one to share it with. She got to stand and cheer for her team, alone. She was so lost in thought and self pity that it took a couple of minutes to notice the shadow on her back porch. She grabbed the closest thing she could find and headed outside to see what it was. Hannah and Jackie both screamed when Jackie walked outside carrying an old trophy. \"What are you doing here?\" \"What do you plan on doing with that?\" The two continued to shout over each other until both broke into laughter and embraced. They then went inside and Jackie poured wine while Hannah explained why she was no longer in Minnesota. \"So, I packed and took a plane to the only place I could think of.\" \"Wow. I'm sorry sweetie. I never liked that Jackson guy, anyway. Seemed like he only cared about you as part of a \"we\", not as an individual.\" \"Yeah, thinking about it on the flight made me realize how much both of probably like the way people looked at our relationship more than we actually liked being IN the relationship. It still hurts, but more pisses me off now.\" \"Well, you're welcome to stay here as long as you need. And, if you really want to get back into skating, we'll talk about it over brunch tomorrow. Right now, I have a competition to recover from.\" Jackie kissed the top of her cousin's head and made her way to her bedroom, falling into a deep sleep and dreams of another heartbreaker. The next morning, the cousins went to have brunch and figure out what Hannah's next move should be. They had just ordered their mimosas when Zach Conroy walked up to say hi. \"Zach, so good to see you. This is my cousin Hannah. Hannah, this is Zach. He's the one that got me into coaching in the first place.\" \"And I see you're doing quite well at it yet again. Nice to meet you Hannah. Visiting from Minnesota?\" He could tell she was shocked that he knew that she lived there. \"Sorry, my business partner was just talking about you the other day and I remember him saying you were a cheerleader up there.\" She nodded in understanding as Jackie looked away. Zach mentally kicked himself for mentioning Alex in front of Jackie, and Hannah seemed to understand that. \"Maybe visiting, maybe for good; debating that right now.\" She said quickly to get the topic away from Alex. \"I've just finished getting my masters and now have to decide what to do with my life.\" Jackie's phone rang, and she excused herself, leaving Zach and Hannah to talk. \"I hope I didn't upset Jackie too much mentioning Alex.\" \"I love her, but if she still gets upset all this time later, then maybe she should do something about it.\" \"Funny, I kinda wanted to tell him that the other night, too.\" Hannah was just opening her mouth to ask Zach for more detail when Jackie frantically approached them. \"Hannah, were you serious about wanting to get back on the ice?\" \"I mean, I would love to, I just don't know if I can.\" \"Well, we need to go find that out NOW. Sorry Zach, good seeing you.\" Jackie said as she threw down some cash and pulled Hannah away. Hannah looked back at Zach, wishing they could continue their conversation. On the way to the rink, Jackie quickly explained to Hannah that she was going to need to find a replacement for Alexandra, SOON. She was hoping that Hannah's natural talent, plus her experience of partner stunting in cheerleading, would make her the perfect candidate. James was going to meet them at the rink soon to see if the plan would work. When Hannah had said she wanted to get back into skating, she hadn't really had immediately in mind. Surprises happened, though, and she hoped she could help out. She knew how hard it was to be so close to Nationals and walk away.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER THREE Alexandra sat on the back porch, just staring. She was still in shock. This had definitely not been in her long range plan. She was actually okay with not being able to skate for a while, but she hated it for James. She knew first hand what it felt like to lose a partner. It had briefly ended her career; she did not want the same thing to happen to James. She loved him too much for that. That's why she had gotten on the phone with Jackie; she wanted a solution before she even went to James with the problem. Yes, right now, it hurt him that she would talk to the coach before her partner and boyfriend. Hopefully, in the long run, he would thank her for it. Zach would have never thought to do that for her before walking away from the sport. Things might have ended a little more amicably then. She was no longer bitter about that, though. Things had worked out well for her, and she heard the same was true for Zach. Didn't mean she was going to let him be their agent anytime soon, though, even if his firm was the best. Something about her team using ConSon seemed a little too much like a CW show for her. James skated onto the rink to meet Jackie and the girl standing beside her. He was still not happy about the way Alexandra handled the situation, but he knew he loved both the sport and her enough to eventually get over it. Didn't mean he was gonna wipe the scowl off his face anytime soon, though. \"James, this is my cousin Hannah. I've asked her if she minded coming by to give this a try. I'm sure neither of us wants to go through the long process of finding someone, and, frankly, I don't think we have the time. Hannah, this is James McKinsey\" The two skaters shook hands and immediately began the routine. After the first half hour or so, Hannah was finally getting into the rhythm of things. Everyone was pleasantly surprised. It looked like the team may just be able to appear at Nationals after all. There was still a lot of work to be done, though. The three were going to have to sleep, eat, and skate around the clock, with very little of the first two getting a lot of time and attention. Zach was surprised to see James skating with Hannah when he walked in. He and Alex had just done a press conference and photo shoot the day before. They were the only ones at the event that were not ConSon clients, and he knew better than to try and change that anytime soon. Not with his ex on the team and his partners ex coaching. Just a little too incestuous for his liking. He hoped one day everything would smooth out enough for that to change; the best deserved the best. He didn't have high hopes, though. Nevertheless, he did have a slight business proposition to discuss with Jackie. He sat in the stands while she finished coaching what appeared to be her new team. As surprised as Zach was to see Hannah on the ice, Alexandra was even more surprised to see Zach in the stands. Luckily, no one knew she was there. She was in one of the press boxes that no one could see in to. She wasn't sure how James would feel about her being here to check out her replacement. Jackie and Hannah probably wouldn't like it to much, either. She wondered how they all felt about Zach being here. She knew he wasn't dumb enough to try and persuade Jackie to bring her team over to his firm. Whatever he was here for had to be a pretty big deal. She was fairly certain he hadn't so much as stepped onto the property since the day he walked out, stating that no matter how much he loved Alexandra, his heart just wasn't into skating anymore. Sure, they had tried to make it work after that. Alexandra was so bitter about him leaving her to fend for herself that she took everything out on him and completely shut him out. She was surprised when he said things were just too distant for repair in their relationship. Looking back, she had been a fool not to see it coming. Isn't that what she wanted the whole time anyway? To push him away before he had the chance to make the decision on his own? She knew that once they no longer shared skating, there would be nothing left to them. She hadn't even given him a chance to prove her wrong. When practice was over, James shook hands and immediately took off. He didn't even notice Zach in the stands. The girls on the ice did, though. Hannah was both intrigued and excited; she really wanted to continue their conversation from earlier. Jackie was baffled and hoping that he wasn't there to get some story about how a competing firm's team had to restructure. Their PR firm didn't even know yet! She knew Zach better than that, though, and shook her head at the thought. She walked over to him as Hannah skated off to change. \"To what do I owe this pleasure Mr. Conroy?\" \"Well, Jackie, it seems we are in a bit of a pickle.\" He noted her look of confusion and continued. \"It seems the event that my firm has tried so hard to put together to honor athletes who tend to take a backseat to the majors is pending on the one group of people we can't get.\" Jackie opened her mouth to object, but Zach just kept going. \"Now, I know asking if we can represent your team is out of the question, and that's not what I am trying to do at all. I was actually hoping to meet with your firm to work this out, but I wanted to speak to you first. The last thing I wanted to do was blindside you with this.\" \"That means a lot Zach, thanks. Most people don't actually give the people firms represent a chance to make any of their own decisions, and I really appreciate it. That being said, I am going to have to talk to my team and the PR firm first before I can give you any decision. As you can see, there have been some slight changes that you have found out before the big boys themselves have. I have a meeting with them this evening and will get back to you after that.\" \"Thanks Jackie. Get back to me as soon as you can, there's a lot riding on this.\" For some unknown reason, Zach hugged Jackie and walked out, still confused as to her teams change. Hannah through her stuff in her bag and ran out of the locker room as fast as she could. She tried not to show her disappointment in Zach's absence. No reason to get her aunt all suspicious. She would just have to figure out another way to see him. Mostly, she needed to find a hole in the crazy schedule her cousin had given her that day![Chapter 4] CHAPTER FOUR Hannah had planned to try and get in touch with Zach while Jackie was meeting with the team's PR firm. She passed out on the couch instead. Two hours later, she woke up to someone banging on the door. She looked to see her it was, then luckily caught a quick glance in the mirror before she opened the door. It was obvious she had just joined the living again. \"Just a minute\" she said into the intercom before dashing to the powder room in the foyer. Good thing she had dropped her purse there when they got back from practice! She did a quick touch up on her hair and make up and returned to let their guest in. Unfortunately, Jackie had already let him in by the time Hannah got back. It was beyond embarrassing that her cousin and Zach knew she had put off opening the door to primp! \"Hi guys. I didn't know you had gotten home yet Jackie.\" \"I actually just pulled up, to find poor Zach waiting at the door.\" \"Sorry about that, I had just gotten up from a nap and didn't want to scare anyone!\" \"Well, glad you're awake now. We need to have our first team meeting. James should be here any second.\" Right on cue, James walked in, still wearing his unpleasant look. He'd already had a rollercoaster of a day, and he was fairly certain being in a room with Alexandra's ex was not going to help it get any better. Comfortable in Jackie's home, he went straight to the fridge and got himself a beer before joining the others at the table. \"Thanks for coming guys. I know its very last minute, so I really appreciate you all being here. I met with the guys Profess today, and they are less than excited about the team change. With the various ups and downs professionally and personally regarding everyone involved, they say this is a PR nightmare.\" Jackie looked at the faces around the table and continued. \"That said, we will no longer be using their services. I refuse to work with people who don't stand behind us and trust out judgment. I would love to just say to hell with it and put all of our energy into Nationals, but unfortunately, we have commitments that we can't afford to back out of. From the get-go, it was team consensus to use anyone but ConSon,\" she paused to give Zach an apologetic look, \"but I'm not sure we have any other choice at this moment. They understand our sport and how much focus needs to go into last minute changes and can help us with the transition, along with all the mess that may come when the partner change is announced. I need to know that the team is okay with this, though. It's not going to be easy for any of us, but sacrifices have to be made.\" Hannah was all too quick to agree, but James had yet to look up from his beer. He stood and without looking at any of them, he agreed and walked out. Jackie turned to Zach. \"I am sure you know this is going to be very hard for me. I imagine it is for you, too. I would like for you and Hannah to handle as much of the communication between the firm in the team as possible. I am not sure anyone else is up to it, yet.\" She looked over for Hannah's approval. \"Good, I'll have Hannah come by between practices tomorrow for paperwork and to get the schedule set in stone. The rest, well, we'll just figure that out as we go.\" She rose to go get a glass of wine, leaving Hannah and Zach a few minutes alone. \"Wow. It's been quite a day for everyone.\" Hannah reflected. \"No kidding, it's been one shock after another with your team. I had just let it settle that you would be stepping in when I got the call from Jackie that you guys would be needing my services. And I still don't even know what provoked all of what happened today.\" \"Honestly, I don't either. I was just told that Alexandra had no choice but to back out. The only other detail I got was that she called Jackie before she even told James. Whatever it is, James is not taking it well.\" \"I'm sure that me coming into the picture is not making things any easier.\" \"Right, I sometimes forget that you were Alexandra's first partner.\" Zach was about to mention that he had also been her first in a few other things when Jackie walked back in with drinks for everyone. \"What a twenty-four hours this has been. First, I come home and try to attack my cousin with a juniors trophy. Then, just when I'm getting my head around that, all hell breaks loose on a team I thought was solid and a shoo-in for gold. We had a plan of action to smooth that when the firm goes all jack-ass on me! In a weird twist, I am thankful for you firm, Zach, and that you needed to get away from Minnesota, Hannah!\" Zach gave Hannah a questioning look over his beer. Alex has seemed surprised when Zach mentioned that he had met Hannah that morning. She was supposed to be at school for graduation ceremonies. Jackie's comment about her needing to get away made her appearance here both a blessing for the team and a mystery. Hannah could feel Zach's interest pique when Jackie mentioned her get away. There was no way she was ever going to fess up to him that she escaped Minnesota because of some guy! It was such a stupid reason to jump on the first flight out, but it also turned out to be a wonderful twist of fate. She was glad to be able to both help her cousin out and to jump right back in to competitive skating. The fact that James was in a relationship with Alexandra made the whole pairs skating a lot easier to swallow. Jackie, too, noticed Zach's looks at Hannah. The two had been quite something to watch during the day. While they would make quite a pair, she did not need another couple brought into the odd mix that was already surrounding the business partnership they had just formed. The ringing of Hannah's phone brought everyone out of their thoughts and into the moment. When Hannah looked down and saw that it was Jackson, she shut the phone off and downed the remainder of her glass before saying her goodnights and escaping to bed.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER FIVE Somewhere in the five hour morning practice, Hannah and James finally started to skate like a team. They would never be what James and Alexandra had been; there was no substitute for the emotional connection those two had. Nevertheless, this new pairing still had a lot of potential to really make a showing come Nationals. Jackie called practice to a close after the pair had an impressive run. It's always easier to start the next practice on a positive note when the previous had ended that way. She reminded the two to be back in four hours for evening practice and dismissed them. As Hannah took off to meet Zach at his office and James left to go take Alexandra to her appointment, Jackie walked off to her office. All the years spent in the rink, either practicing or coaching, it had never crossed Jackie's mind that one day it would all be hers. When she and Alex had gotten married, her parents informed them that they would soon be handing the rink over to them. A divorce and two funerals later, she was running it on her own. Alex would have been so much better at this, and knowing that is probably what made Jackie refuse to hire someone to handle to business end of the rink. It basically just served as a practice rink for her team and the local hockey group. She knew she should really get it up and running again, but she just didn't have it in her yet. Hannah had a few minutes before she was scheduled to meet Zach, so she bypassed his suite and headed straight to see Alex. The minute he saw her coming, he was quick to end his call. He hadn't seen her since Doug's funeral, and despite their constant emails, had really missed her. And he was very curious as to why she was no longer in Minnesota with that douche bag Jackson. He had met him when they had first started dating and he was near the campus for business. Seeing him at the funerals since had not made him like the guy any better. The last time he saw the couple, it had left such a bad impression that Alex had even considered calling Jackie to voice his concern. He couldn't muster up the courage, though, when he remembered how she treated him like any other random person that had shown up at her parents' funerals. Luckily, Alex and Hannah had stayed close after the divorce. She never mentioned it to Jackie, but she knew that it was known. It crushed her when the marriage started to fall apart. She had always thought of Jackie as a sister and Alex was like the brother she had never had. She couldn't comprehend how two people that had been so in love couldn't make it. Hannah had always hoped to grow up and find a love just like theirs. They just fit together. Thinking about it made Hannah's eyes sting a little when they hugged. Hannah kept trying to make small take, asking about the business, discussing getting back on the ice, anything to avoid the topic she knew Alex wanted to get to. Finally, she had to take a breath and Alex was able to ask why she had left Minnesota and shown up here. \"Things with Jackson just weren't what I thought they were, and I no longer had a reason to stay. I had just seen the competition and figured it would be nice for Jackie to have someone to celebrate with.\" The fact that Jackie normally had to celebrate alone or with strangers hurt Alex more than a little, which did not go unnoticed by Hannah. It was so frustrating to know that two people she cared so deeply about belonged back together and would never admit it! \"Hannah, I've known you long enough to decipher there's more to the story than that. But if that's what you're selling, I'll pretend to buy it.\" \"Well, it's so moot now that it's not even worth discussing. I probably need to go meet with Zach now, let's try and get together soon.\" She hugged Alex again and took off down the hall to see Zach. Across town, James was dropping Alexandra back off at their condo. The hardest part about what was going on was how distant Alexandra seemed to be becoming. If anything, he should be the one acting distant. She went to Jackie before him. Anything that affected her affected him, yet he wasn't the first to know what was going on. He understood that she was upset and confused, and he needed her to talk to him about it. Once she shut down, there was no getting her to have a conversation, though. He needed her to need him, to lean on him. They went through the motions like everything was the same, but he knew it wasn't. They didn't touch and talk like they had done until a couple of days ago. Alexandra accepted the tea that James brought her. He had been so sweet during all of this and she knew she needed to talk to him about everything. What if he didn't say the right things, though? Did she really want to push them to the end before it got here?[Chapter 6] CHAPTER SIX The two weeks of long grueling practice had finally paid off. James and Hannah were skating together effortlessly now. It was such a confidence boost to know things were coming together at a rapid pace. Which they desperately needed, being only a few hours from their first public appearance as a team. Hannah and Jackie rushed to get ready at the rink while James went home to freshen up and get Alexandra. Zach was sending a car to get them, but figured it best to just meet them there. The media was going to have a field day with everything going on, and he didn't want him and Alexandra arriving together to add fuel to the inevitable fire. James was glad Alexandra was going with them today. Other than her doctor's appointments, she rarely left the house. He hoped that her being able to wear a nice dress and fix up would perk her up a little bit. \"Wow\" was all he could muster up when she walked out of their bedroom. Alexandra looked amazing. She blushed at the comments and surprised her boyfriend by walking over and planting a kiss on his lips. He was even more pleased when she took his hand on the short walk to the car. The ride to the arena was very silent. Everyone was nervous about how the media would react to the change. Luckily, Alexandra would be by James' side to remind everyone that it was not a falling out on the team, but a decision Alexandra had to make for herself. They all hoped that the media would be more interested in getting to know Hannah than the oddity in the team's partnering with a firm owned by exes of two of the members. Luckily, Zach had arranged for the team to be brought in through the back entrance so that they could be properly seated before being attacked by reporters, photographers, and fans. He, himself, would remain out of the teams way and hidden from everyone else. He was simply in the wings in case anything went wrong. The new team of James and Hannah led way to the table, followed by Jackie and Alexandra, who then sat on either side. Jackie welcomed and thanked everyone, and then made the official announcement that James McKinsey and Hannah Dorsey would be skating together at Nationals in eight weeks. The official approval for Hannah to replace Alexandra had come through a little over a week ago. She then opened the floor for questions, which were fired at everyone on stage. Everyone wanted to know why Alexandra quit, to which the response was always that it was a personal decision that she had to make for herself, and no, it was not easy. And no, it did not mean that she and James were no longer a couple. And no, she had not had any interaction with Zach since her former team had signed with him. She herself had no reason to sign with him. Jackie was glad to be coaching her cousin and confident that the team still had a shot at the gold. No, she had not spoken to her ex-husband since signing with his company. If need be, she would work with him. She would always put her team's needs ahead of her own. Yes, James would miss skating with his girlfriend, but was looking forward to taking the ice with Hannah soon. No, he did not show up with Alexandra as a publicity stunt. He still loved her as much today as he did when they were still a team. The look he gave her when stating that left no doubt that it was true. Hannah reassured everyone that she was in as good of form, if not better, than she was when she made it to Nationals before. Yes, she regretted hanging up her skates years ago, but she, like Alexandra, felt it was something she needed to do and that's why she was glad to be able to help Alexandra out. So far, they had been prepared for everything asked. And then, a local social report stood. \"Hannah, you were recently spotted at The Wine Bar with Alex Harrison. Is it true that the fact you are now dating is what led to the partnership of his company and your team the day you took over for Alexandra?\" The team all just stared at each other, unsure of what to say. Finally, Hannah pulled the mike over to her. \"Yes, it is true that I was having a drink with Alex. His firm is now representing my team, and due to his past relationship with my coach, I handle all dealings with him. He is also a very good friend of mine, and I believe that's grounds to meet for an innocent drink as well. Alex is a great guy, but he's certainly not my guy. As for the fact that our partnership with his firm came on the heels on my joining the team, well, sometimes what was a good fit for one team is not always a good fit for another. We needed someone more in tune with our unique situation.\" By the time Hannah had finished her statement, Zach was at the edge of the stage. \"Thank you everybody for coming. At this time the floor is now closed. If we want these guys to bring home the gold, they need to get back to work. Any further questions may be directed to my firm.\" The team took a few more minutes to smile at the cameras as everyone was ushered out. Soon, it was just the five of them. Alexandra and James got up immediately, stating that Alexandra needed to go find a water fountain. \"Well, that last question was certainly a shock to everyone.\" Jackie said. \"I am so sorry,\" whispered Hannah, \"I never thought about how it would look when I met Alex the other night. Jackie, I would neverâ¦\" \"I know, trust me. You and Alex were always close. He was a big brother to you and I understand that y'all will remain friends. Unfortunately, people looking for a scoop don't.\" \"It's clear that people want more of a story than what we've given them. They will be hounding you guys. The closer it gets to competition time, the more they're going to dig. We just need to be careful not to give them anything to twist, and I'm probably going to have to stay close to you guys.\" Zach informed them. He set up a time to meet Hannah the next day and headed back to the office before he had to deal with seeing Alexandra and James again.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER SEVEN The next few weeks were pretty uneventful for the team, which was a huge relief. With Nationals getting closer, Zach was busy with a lot of other clients, and, thanks to Hannah's Masters in Sports Administration, he was able to trust her to handle a lot for her team. Her ability to step in for Alexandra and still make it possible for the team to make a showing at Nationals, along with the poise and grace she handled everything that came with the team amazed him. He was fairly certain that the group never would have gotten through this without her. Not only had she saved the team, but also the partnership. James probably didn't want to deal with Zach, and there was no way Alex and Jackie were going to work together. James, Jackie, and Hannah spent every moment they had practicing, reworking, and discussing. Every time they got a routine down, one of the three decided it wasn't good enough. When they weren't on the rink, they were sitting around thinking of something harder or more impressive to do. Hannah's philosophy was that if she nailed something the first time she tried it, it wasn't hard enough. James thought if it had been done before, it was boring. Jackie, well, she just wanted them to settle on a routine at this point. While everyone else prepared for Nationals, Alexandra was secretly making plans to go to her mother's until after Nationals. She didn't feel like going to Nationals with everyone staring and whispering about why she wasn't on the ice. She was tired of people speculating about why she had left the team, and she really needed to explain it to her family before the rest of the country found out. It was going to break her mother's heart enough already. James hung up the phone and walked to the condo. So far, the day had been great. They had finally settled on a routine and he was excited to show the world what they could do. As he unlocked the door, though, he knew it was all about to go to hell. Thanks to his phone call, he was not at all surprised to see Alexandra sitting on the couch with her suitcase by her feet, Even the heads up did not keep him from going ballistic, though. \"What the hell Alex? I understand you not skating with me, but not even coming to support me?\" \"I just can't handle it right now James, I though you would understand.\" \"Can't handle what? Watching me skate with another girl because you left me? Or having to travel with Zach because you're not over him?\" James immediately regretted that as soon as it came out of his mouth. \"Seriously, you think that? Because if you do, this relationship is not what I thought it was at all.\" \"No, I do not think that. I don't even know why I said it. I just don't understand why you are taking off like this. And once again, doing something without even talking to me about it. First you talk to Jackie about not skating first, and now you call your brother telling him you need to come home while I'm at Nationals. We used to talk about everything, and now you're just doing whatever you want, not worrying if and how it will affect me.\" \"I've got to go back to doing things on my own. Somebody's got to take care of me while you're off winning your medals.\" \"Oh no, you are not going to make me that guy. My continuing to skate was actually a decision you MADE for me. Just because things did not work out when you and your last partner split does not mean the same has to be true for us. I will not have you making me into Zach. Whatever happened with you two, it's not us.\" \"I don't know what I think right now. After Nationals, we'll figure out what to do about us and everything else involved. There was a honk signaling her taxi had arrived, Alexandra grabbed her bags, kissed him on the cheek, and headed to the door, walking fast and never looking back. She couldn't afford for him to see her cry. He didn't have as much pride, his tears had started falling the minute she grabbed her suitcase. There was no way he could stay in this condo and think about anything but Alexandra. Nationals were too close for that distraction. Without even calling to ask if it was okay, James packed up his bags and headed to Jackie's. At least there he would have some distraction from the ruins his life was becoming. \"Wow, you got here quick.\" Hannah couldn't imagine how fast James must have been driving. Jackie had just walked off to call him minutes ago. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Didn't Jackie just call you, like ten minutes ago?\" \"I don't know. My phone's off.\" \"Oh, well, then what are you doing here?\" \"Really don't want to talk about it. What does Jackie need?\" \"I'll go get her, she can explain it.\" As Hannah turned to go find her cousin, she noticed James' suitcase. Just what they needed, even more drama! \"James, glad you're here. Where's Alex? Need to talk to her, too.\" \"Well, that's going to be kind of tough. She's on a flight to her mom's right now.\" \"Oh, James, I'm so sorry.\" Jackie put her hand on his shoulder as she spoke. It hurt to see James so upset, and that made her next statement even harder to say. \"Without her here, there's a good chance we're sponsorless. And with no sponsors, we have no backing to send us to Nationals. \" \"But, the sponsors were behind us after we announced the change in partners. Why are they changing their minds now?\" Jackie walked to the living room and the other two followed in silence. She motioned for them to sit down as she went to grab a folder off her desk. \"Tomorrow morning, our team is going to be the most talked about group heading into Nationals. And not for our talent.\" She spread the contents of the folder on the table. The title of the article was \"When The Ice Thaws\". It all started when Jackie Dorsey followed in her parents' footsteps and began making a name for herself in the figure skating world. When an injury forced her to give up her dreams of winning gold as an individual, she continues to follow her parents' lead and went into pairs skating. Her parents were able to carry their brilliant partnership into something off the ice, so, of course, the younger Dorsey thought she could do the same. And for years, Jackie and Alex Harrison stole our hearts as a magnificent pairing both on and off the ice. Then, another injury forced the couple to walk away from the sport, and, shortly after, each other. Both were assumed to have disappeared from the public eye forever after the divorce was final. Then, Jackie Dorsey suddenly reappeared on the seen as a coach. Her new team consisted of Alexandra Delgado and Zach Conroy. Zach was no stranger to the ice, as he had once been a half of \"Conroy & Mercier: America's Sweethearts\". When they fell apart, Zach convinced Alexandra to trade in her hockey skates for figure skates and the two skated their way to gold under the direction of Dorsey. Having not learned from their coach or Zach's previous relationship, the two became a pair of the ice as well. That, too, ended with everyone hanging up their skates. Fast forward a couple of years later. Alexandra is once again pulled into the world of competitive skating; this time partnered with ex-speed skater James McKinsey. When they, too, decided to take their partnership off the ice, their original coach told them he wanted no part of it. Alexandra went to the one person she knew was up to tackling a team romantically involved, and Jackie Dorsey was once again involved in competitive skating. And, up until a few months ago, the team was unstoppable. Then, without warning, Alexandra was replaced by Hannah Dorsey, Jackie's cousin best known for hanging up her skates only months before she was to take the ice at Nationals. The same day, the team goes with a new PR firm, ConSon, owned by none other than Alex Harrison and Zach Conroy, two former skaters that individuals in this story are very familiar with. Reason for Alexandra's \"retirement\" and the change in PR firms has yet to be given. Only that both decisions were made with the best interest of everyone involved. Considering the past of everyone involved, there are numerous questions continuing to surround this team and its stability. Why did Hannah suddenly reappear just as Alexandra went off the radar? Will old flames reignite? Will Hannah and James take a cue for everyone else and try and take their romance out of the rink? And, if so, how long will this partnership last? James threw the article down in disgust. \"Well, now what?\" \"We have to do something that shows our team is not becoming a soap opera. The fact that Alex isn't here to show you two are still together is not going to help. And the three of us all staying under the same roof right now if definitely out of the question, despite how much it would help the team right now. I called Zach and he and Alex are on the way right now.\" Hannah looked up at Jackie with shock. \"Alex?\" \"Well, I've always said I would do whatever it takes to take my team to the top.\" Just thinking about being in the same room as Alex made Jackie nauseous. She went off to get everyone drinks. Just as she was finishing putting everything on the tray, the doorbell rang. Not thinking, Jackie went to answer and came face to face with Alex. They just starred at each other, neither knowing what to say. It had been two years since they had been face to face. Luckily, Zach walked up to ease the tension. \"All right, let's get to brainstorming.\" Zach said, helping himself to a beer as he walked by. Alex and Jackie gave each other one last look and followed.[Chapter 8] CHAPTER EIGHT \"Hannah, James, have you two been seen anywhere together or done anything that may lead anyone to believe you are a couple?\" asked Zach. \"Not at all; I've only seen James at practice and at PR events. We've never even been alone together. Jackie is always with us, and some of the times, Alexandra was even there.\" \"Well, at least they have nothing to back up that claim. As far as the others, well there's not much we can do. It would certainly help our case if Alexandra was going to Nationals with us. It would also help if she could give a statement as to why she quit.\" Zach looked directly at James as he spoke, as if anyone had control over Alexandra. \"Well, you can talk to her about that.\" James told Zach in a less than pleasant tone. \"I have a feeling whatever happened with you guys may have something to do with her departure. Or, maybe the article had it right. Maybe none of us were meant to last off the ice.\" James slammed down his beer bottle and went out to the porch. Being the only one he didn't directly offend with his comment, Hannah went out to check on him. \"She got mad at me for mentioning that she might not be over Zach, and I felt bad. But looking back, it makes sense. She never wanted to talk about their break up, even before we were a couple. And you wouldn't get mad about something unless it's true, right?\" James started talking the minute he saw it was just Hannah. \"We almost split before we even got really started because I overreacted to another guy. I've done nothing of the sort since then, so the way I'm feeling right now has to stem from something.\" \"I think everyone just has a full range of emotion right now with everything that's going on. This will be the first time you have ever skated without Alexandra and I am sure that whatever it is that made her quit is bothering you as well. Throw in a guy she has more than just a little history with, and yeah, it's going to bother you. It would be odd for you not to have crazy thoughts and feelings right now.\" \"I think what bothers me the most is that she never wants to talk about what happened. I would feel a little better if I knew there was more to it than them just not skating together. If she was completely over him and what they had had, she would be okay to talk about it.\" \"Not necessarily. I had what I thought was a pretty serious relationship in Minnesota that suddenly just ended and I'm okay with the fact it's over. Doesn't mean I want to talk about it, though. Sometimes, things in the past are better just left there.\" \" And sometimes they're not\" she thought, as she looked in the window at Alex and Jackie. \"Would you talk about it if you thought it would save a current relationship?\" \"I think I would. I can't honestly say because I haven't come to that, yet. If it bothers you that much, maybe you should talk to Zach. He's actually a good guy and I'm sure would talk, especially if it could save this team.\" \"Yeah, that thought had crossed my mind, but I didn't know when or how to approach it. Guess now's as good of time as any. Thanks Hannah.\" He hugged his teammate and went inside to have the dreaded conversation. While Hannah and James were outside, the other 3 were having their own conversation. \"Until they get some answers, people are just going to keep the speculation up. First they had Hannah paired with me, and now James. Eventually, it's going to have to come out why Alexandra left and why you guys are now with our firm.\" Alex looked straight into Jackie's eyes as he spoke, finding it hard to concentrate on the topic at hand. \"Alexandra's reasoning is hers to tell, if and when she's ready. I'm now ready to address anything else, though\" said Jackie, looking right back at Alex. And she meant it, she finally wanted to talk about what had happened between the two of them. It had only taken her six years! Alex and Jackie were looking right at each other, almost having their own conversation with their eyes. And Zach wanted nothing more than to give them privacy. Luckily, James walked in and motioned for Zach to follow him to the kitchen. James handed Zach one of the beers he had just grabbed out of the fridge and sat on the counter, not knowing how to start. Zach eyed James over the beer, wondering what he could possibly have to say to him. The two had made a point to avoid speaking the few times they had been in the same room. Not that Zach had any problems with the guy. He seemed to really love Alexandra and Zach was actually happy for them. The way James jaw always tensed around Zach made him nervous enough to stay away, though. He wasn't sure how much he trusted that James' once famous temper had cooled down since hooking up with Alexandra. \"I'm assuming you didn't bring me in here to simply have a beer?\" \"You really are a smart one.\" James took a gulp of his beer. \"Sorry, man, this just isn't easy for me. I'm going through hell right now and never in a million years would I have thought I'd come to you to help me get out of it.\" \"Look, for what it's worth man, I've got nothing but the upmost respect for you and Alexandra. We just weren't meant to be and I'm glad she found you. I still care about and would do anything for her, though.\" \"Thanks Zach. I'm just gonna come straight out. I need you to tell me what happened with you guys.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"I know it seems stupid, but it's the one thing Alexandra would never talk about and with all that's going on right now, I just need to know.\" \"All I can tell you is my perception of what happened. I don't know if it will help you anyâ¦\" \"Your story's better than no story.\" Zach grabbed them a couple of more beers, then told his side of the break-up. \"Everything was great while we were still skating together. It at least seemed that way at the time. I was ready to retire before I ever mentioned it to her, though. I knew she wasn't ready to give it up, and I knew she wouldn't go out and try to get a new partner, so I stayed six months, all the while hating it and probably becoming bitter towards her, even though she had no idea I didn't want to be competing anymore. I felt that she was tying me to a life I didn't want anymore and started getting mad at her about everything. I quit doing all the little things I used to do, figuring my skating was enough now. I finally couldn't take it anymore, told her I still loved her, and walked out of the rink. She came home a couple of days later and told me she understood and apologized for making me feel like I had to do something I didn't enjoy for her for so long. That, of course, made me feel even worse about the situation. So, for the next few weeks, she walked around depressed thinking that skating was over for her, but she wouldn't talk about it because she didn't want me to feel bad about it. At the same, time, I was already feeling bad about it, while trying to figure out what to do with my life. Eventually, we were almost avoiding each other in order to save the other from unnecessary guilt. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. We were sharing a home and nothing more. It wasn't fair to either of us. We talked it out and both agreed it wasn't working. We needed to be apart, at least for a while. We needed to think and let our emotions out without worrying about putting a guilt trip on the other. The day she packed up and moved to her apartment, we said goodbye and promised to get in touch when things were settled and we were where we wanted to be. That never happened, though. I think she wasn't where she wanted to be until she started skating with you again, and by that time, there was just no point, I guess.\" Zach noticed that both had finished their beer during the story and got up to go to the fridge. He was sure they both needed it. \"My best advice to you man,\" said Zach as he handed James a beer, \"is to not let the same thing happen to you. I'm not going to knock what she and I had, but you two, well, it's something more. I'd hate to see you guys end up like we did.\" James nodded his head, still thinking over what Zach had told him. He understood exactly what he meant by the avoidance to avoid guilt. Alexandra felt bad about not being able to skate with James and James felt bad about skating while he should be with her during everything. They both knew that one of them needed to make a living, though. There was so much James wanted to say to and ask her, but he was trying to avoid anything that would mess up the balance. It was too late for that, though. Just as Zach and James headed to the kitchen for their conversation, Hannah walked in before Jackie and Alex could start theirs. The minute she realized what she had just walked into, Hannah wished she had stayed outside for a few more minutes. Instead of having a much needed conversation, the two used Hannah's entrance as a reason to excuse themselves. \"I've got get some work done. Jackie, can I set up in one the guest rooms?\" \"Sure, I'll go order us all something to eat.\" As Hannah watched the two escape each other, her phone vibrated. She looked at the screen and shut it off. So what if she was the only one in the house not willing to talk things out and get answers?[Chapter 9] CHAPTER NINE Hannah was glad to see Zach sitting on the porch alone when she came in from her evening jog. Seeing Jackie and Alex together earlier had reminded her about the first time she met Zach. He had agreed with her when she had made the smart ass comment about Jackie and Alex. She had wanted to pick his brain about the situation ever since, but the \"quest for gold\" kinda got in the way! Zach was glad to see Hannah coming to join him on the porch. With all the craziness surrounding the group right now, he had a feeling she was going to be his rock until Nationals had come and gone. Tonight was the first night he'd actually taken time to look at her. The fact that her chestnut waves were pulled back in pigtails did not take away from how gorgeous she was. He must have been really stressed about handling the team professionally for her toned body and sparkling green eyes to go unnoticed. Hannah could feel Zach looking at her and suddenly regretted not taking her hair down and touching up her make-up before coming out. It would be totally inappropriate for anything to go on with the two of them, but a girl still liked to be admired. She self consciously took a sip of one as she sat across from him. \"It's been quit a day, huh?\" She asked him, hoping the conversation would distract him from continuing to stare at what a mess she was! \"Oh yeah. It's going to be an interesting couple of weeks.\" \"Well, maybe some good can come of all this. Ya never know.\" Zach almost choked on his beer. Was she actually flirting with him? She was usually over-professional. So much that he first thought her to be uptight. \"What are your thoughts on the Alex and Jackie situation?\" He couldn't believe the quick disappointment that hit him when Hannah asked him that. They would be stupid to even think about getting involved with all that was going on right now. \"I know that it still bothers him to hear about her or see her on TV. He gets uptight every time her name is mentioned. And six years without seriously seeing someone? That seems a little odd to me.\" \"Yeah, Jackie's the same way. She gets this far away, almost sad look sometimes when something reminds her of him. It used to upset me, but now it just pisses me off.\" \"I can tell. So, what should we do? It's clear our friends may need some very hard pushing. It seemed like they were actually going to talk about it today, and then nothing.\" \"Well, that may be my fault. I walked in and gave them an excuse to scatter. I say if they nothing's happened by Nationals, we lock them in a closet.\" \"And until then let's try and think of something better.\" Zach said as he raised his drink to hers, and was mesmerized once again when she smiled. The vibrating of her cell broke the silent staring between the two. Hannah was prepared to cut it off again, but was shocked to see that it was Mary-Ann, her former roommate. She excused herself and walked to the other end of the porch to take the call. When she walked back over, Zach could tell the phone call was not good news. She looked somewhere between livid and upset. Instead of pushing, Zach refilled her wine and leaned back, waiting to see if she wanted to talk about it or not. \"All this time, I thought he was calling to apologize. Guess he just wanted to be the first to tell me he was marrying to slut.\" Over the remainder of the Merlot bottle, Hannah told Zach the reason she had fled Minnesota and shown up at her cousin's house. She then told him how Jackson was marrying the \"other bitch\" and they were expecting their first child in about seven months. Not once did she cry, though. In fact, she didn't seem upset until she realized they were out of wine. She stood to get another one. \"I've got a better idea,\" Zach said, grabbing her arm to stop her. \"Go get all gussied up and meet me back here in thirty minutes.\" Against her better judgment, Hannah agreed. While he waited, Zach made calls and nursed another beer. A few sponsors showed promise of sticking with the Dorsey-McKinsey team. He had just finished leaving a message for his final, and most important, call when Hannah walked out. Zach tried hard to concentrate on finishing his beer to keep from dating. Whoever invented the sundress was a god! \"Wow, you look great.\" He said as he rose. He gave her a quick peck on the cheek and led her outside to where a car was waiting. Hannah could not believe all the trouble Zach had gone to just to put her in a better mood! The car at taken them to dinner at a small restaurant where they were sure to go unnoticed and had then dropped them off at a bar on the water. It was so nice to just be out having fun with a guy that she could just have a conversation with. It had been a while since she had been this relaxed around male company. The two spent hours sitting on the bar deck just drinking and laughing. They finally realized how drunk they probably were and had the car come get them. They laughed and sang along to the radio the entire way home. The driver was probably relieved to drop them off at the house and head home for the night. Instead of going to bed, the two decided to grab more drinks and head to the hot tub. \"Ya know,\" slurred Hannah as she was opening yet another bottle of wine, \"I totally get now why James was so worried Alexandra was still in love with you?\" \"Really? Well, you know what I don't get? How Jackson couldn't appreciate that he the most amazing girl in the world.\" Without thinking, Zach leaned over and kissed Hannah. Realizing what he was doing, he started to pull away, but when she started to respond, there was no hope. After about ten minutes, Zach finally managed to pull away. \"What if someone sees us? As much fun as I'm having we really can't afford for the press to get wind of this.\" As he spoke, Zach looked around to see if anyone was on the street or out in the yard. Hannah's face fell. \"Crap, you're right.\" Without saying another word, Zach picked up the bottle of wine and took Hanna's hound. He led her out of the hot tub and straight up to the guest room he was currently staying in.[Chapter 10] CHAPTER TEN Zach was surprised out how much he and Hannah did not freak out when they awoke the next morning. They simply looked at each other and started laughing. \"Well, that was an interesting night,\" said Zach, as he sat up to pull on a shirt. \"See, I told you this would all work out for everyone. Well, most everyone. \", replied Hannah, thinking of how everyone James was the only one in the house sleeping alone last night. \"Those two most have had some talk while we were out.\" \"Speaking of talk, that's probably something we need to do soon. Unfortunately, I am already running late to the rink.\" said Hannah, walking into the bathroom to get presentable. \"And I need to get to the office. Give you a ride to the rink and pick you up for lunch?\" \"Works for me.\" They spent the entire ride singing to the radio and discussing everything but what was going on between them. Alex and Jackie had, in fact, had quite a long and emotional conversation. Watching what was going on with Alexandra and James had made Jackie realize how shut down she had become when her career had ended. She was too selfish to consider that Alex, too, had lost his career. He blamed himself too much for the fall to get on the ice with anyone else. Plus, he had only started skating to win Jackie's attention, anyway. It just wouldn't have been the same without her. It was a time they should have leaned on each other, and instead, they pulled apart. It took them an hour for every year they had been apart to talk about everything that they should have done differently. In the end, they decided it didn't matter who was right and wrong and what they could have said or done. What mattered is that they had finally come to grips with it, and while it was going to take a lot of time and work, they belonged together. Jackie had forgotten just how much she enjoyed waking up next to Alex. It was one of those things she would not take for granted the second time around. When he rolled over and wrapped his arms around her, she cursed herself for scheduling a morning practice. After a few moments of bliss, she slipped out of bed to get ready, trying not to wake him. Apparently she wasn't very good at it, though. When she walked back in from brushing her teeth, he was already up and had managed to throw one a polo and jeans. Watching Jackie walk back in the room, Alex couldn't help but smile to himself. How long he had dreamed of being with her again. As soon as Nationals was over, he was taking her away for a week. They needed time to focus on each other and forget all about skating and everything else in their crazy lives. \"How about you give me a ride into the office and we rendezvous during your break?\" he asked, with a guilty grin on his face. \"Perfect,\" she replied, leaning up to kiss the love of her life. James had no idea what was keeping his coach and teammate, but he was glad to have the rink to himself for a bit. It gave him time to simply fly around the ice and think about everything that was going on. Before Alexandra's big announcement, James had purchased a diamond, hoping to propose when they won Nationals. Now, she would take the proposal as something he felt he had to do, not something he wanted to do. He had known since before the first time they competed together that she was the one for him. Things had been so great with them that he didn't want to throw them off balance with a proposal, though. Something in him felt that this year's competition would be the perfect time to ask her, though. He knew there would be no way of convincing her of that now. He just needed to see her right now, needed to see she was okay. They needed to talk about everything that was going on and for once, make a plan. He knew calling her would just push her away, but calling her brother seemed fair enough. After all, that was who had given him the heads up she was leaving last night. At least he had someone in his corner during all this. James had just finished leaving a message for Bobby when Hannah rushed in, followed by a tired, but giddy Jackie. Without discussing the new living situation or any other drama surrounding the team, the three took to the ice and began working on the finalized routine. Despite the fact that none of them had gotten a lot of sleep the previous night, the skating was amazing. Hannah's cheerleading background had really helped them step the game up a notch. The combination of Hannah's flexibility and tight moves made her new and refreshing to watch on the ice. Technically, the two weren't on the same level as James and Alexandra had been, but they were definitely exciting to watch! \"That was awesome guys,\" said Jackie, as she skated over to the pair with water. \"So awesome, in fact, that we're going to end on that for the day. Instead of practice tonight, we're going out, as a team. I'll have a car come pick us up at the house at six.\" She handed them water and skated off before anyone could protest. \"So, were we really that great today or would you just rather spend time with Alex than coach us?\" joked Hannah as she caught up with Jackie in the locker room. \"What? How you? Noâ¦\" Hannah knew the moment she opened her mouth she had made a mistake! She was hoping that Jackie wouldn't put two and two together and figure out where Hannah had slept last night. She should have known better. \"Wow, and I'd even made a point for us to go to his room last night so that you wouldn't know. Didn't want to get your hopes up in case things didn't go well.\" \"Obviously they did, so yayeeee!\" exclaimed Hannah, jumping up to hug her cousin. \"Well, nothing's certain yet, but it is something we both want to work really hard to make happen. In fact, I've got to go meet him right now. Don't think this means I don't still want to talk to you!\" shouted Jackie to her cousin as she grabbed her purse and ran out the door. Hannah was glad she hadn't had to talk about her and Zach just yet. She had no idea how to explain or describe. Guess while Jackie and Alex were figuring their relationship out, she and Zach would be figuring out if they even had one. Alexandra, too, was discussing the fate of her relationship. She just wasn't including the other party. \"You're taking the news much better than I though, Mom.\" \"You are a strong individual who never gives up. I have faith you can get through this better than most. You're going to have to rely on James and trust he will be there for you, though.\" \"It's not that I doubt he will be there, I just doubt his reasons. Will he be there because he wants to be or because he feels he has to?\" \"He does love you enough to stand by you, even if it's not what he wants. Only you can tell his true reasons. Have faith in him, sweetie. He's surprised you before; he just may do it again.\" Marcella held her daughter close; praying she would gives James the chance to prove just how much he loved her. \"Can you find me a flight to Bloomington Mama?\" Back in Connecticut, the team had finished packing for the next day's flight to Nationals and was out on the town to celebrate and show everyone who believed that morning's article how wrong everything in print was. They all laughed at how they had not planned to prove the article wrong in so many ways, but it was working out. As shocked as people were to see Zach and Hannah arrive arm and arm, they were even more amazed to see Jackie and Alex getting cozy. James tried to not let it bother him that he was the odd man out. He, along with the rest of the team, spent the night reassuring everyone that things with Alexandra were fine and she had gone to stay with her family so everyone else could concentrate on the upcoming competition. The more James tried to make himself believe that, the more he drank. Dinner wasn't as bad as when they all went dancing. As he watched the couples dance on the floor, he started ordering shots. Eventually he realized how ridiculous he was acting and decided to have fun instead of feeling sorry for himself. He took one last shot and took to the dance floor. And that's when the cameras started flashing.[Chapter 11] CHAPTER ELEVEN Hannah and Zach were so relieved to be able to dance without photographers and fans around them that they didn't even stop to question why they were suddenly being left alone. They were completely lost in their own world until Jackie and Alex appeared to tell them it was time to go if they were going to be awake for their flight tomorrow. They turned to get James and finally noticed what had taken everyone's interest. \"What the hell?\"â¦ \"When did this start\" â¦ \"Did anyone see this before now?\" The four were standing there shouting questions, none of them sure what to do next. \"We better all go over there and dance him out the door!\" shouted Jackie, taking off to get her skater. The other three followed, still unsure exactly what the plan was. Zach grabbed a beer off a random tray and walked up to James with it. \"Hey man, let's go shoot some pool \", he said, handing James the newly acquired beverage. The others all grabbed a drink and headed toward the pool tables as well. Alex or Zach must have grabbed a manager immediately, because the minute they walked into the table room, it was blocked off so that they could have some privacy. \"What the hell, man? People are already questioning you and Alexandra and you dancing with everyone in the bar is not helping matters!\" Zach shouted, getting in James' face. \"Well, it's not like I could hang out with anyone I came with. If I'd known team night was going to turn into date night, I would have just stayed home and saved us all the trouble!\" \"This is going to be all over the place tomorrow. James, you're going to have to call Alexandra and get her to come to Nationals if there's any hope of this team not becoming a media nightmare\", said Alex. Before James could agree or disagree, they were interrupted by a ringing. Hannah looked in her purse and saw it was Zach's Blackberry. \"Zach can tell her himself\", she said, throwing his phone at him and marching out the back door. \"Seriously, man? And I was just starting to trust your sorry ass!\" James shouted, taking off behind Hannah. \"Talk to her, then fix the rest of this,\" said Alex. He put his arm around Jackie and they headed out the back door to the car, too. Zach sat down to answer the phone, knowing his team would be gone and a different car waiting when he went outside. \"About time you called back. Please tell me you booked a flight to Minnesota for tomorrow?\" \"Yes, I should get to the hotel about the time you guys do.\" \"Well, at least there's some good news. I'll call you when we get to the hotel so I can brief you on everything that's been going on. There's going to be a lot of damage control to do tomorrow.\" \"You have no idea. I'll see you tomorrow.\" As Alexandra hung up with Zach, she thought about the damage control she had to do on a personal level, and cried herself to sleep. Zach, too, was thinking about his personal damage control. He knew he had to smooth things over with James. It felt weird trying to save his exes relationship, but it was something he knew he should do. And Hannah? Well, he didn't even know if there was a relationship to save. Or if what they had was worth saving. Maybe he just needed to stay away from dating skaters. It clearly wasn't an easy thing to do. It would be a lot easier to walk away from her if she wasn't so infectious. A gorgeous girl with brains and a heart? Yeah, good luck finding another one of those! When the other four got back to the house, Hannah and James both marched inside and straight up to their rooms, making it clear neither had a desire to talk to anyone. Jackie really wanted to talk to her cousin, but knew it was better to leave her alone. \"We were crazy to think we'd get out of town without another incident happening,\" she said to Alex as she walked in the room. \"Didn't see anything like this happening, though.\" \"I don't even know exactly what's going on. I mean, I know that James was dancing and that's going turn into something it wasn't. I'm used to the media making something out of nothing, but the way James and Hannah acted about a phone call? That's so out of character of Hannah, and even James.\" \"Under normal circumstance, yeah. But you put everything together, and I'm not surprised by the way either of them reacted. Hannah's last relationship ended up with her here and her ex engaged to the girl he was cheating on her with. James, he's got all kinds of reasons going on. He's skating without his girlfriend for the first time ever, which is weird enough for him. Add the fact that he's working with a guy Alexandra was with until he left her like she's left James. So yeah, he's a big ball of mess right now. Do you not remember how we were at that age? And we didn't even have half this going on?\" \"Yeah, you just had skanky fiancÃ©.\" \"And you were an uptight prude.\" \"Well, if we're keeping up the terrible traditions of love and drama on the ice, everyone will make up just fine before we hit the ice. At least that's what I'm crossing my fingers on. Oh, and counting on our PR firm to make happen.\" \"Pretty sure our fees for your team just went up,\" he joked, pulling Jackie into bed with him. Zach was not surprised that no one was up waiting for him when he got to the house. He'd really hoped to be able to talk to Alex, but knew he would be with Jackie or Hannah. On the way back, Zach had tried to call Hannah, but she was ignoring all his calls and texts. He knew better than to try and talk to James; that was going to be Alexandra's first job tomorrow. Hopefully Alexandra would still want to talk to James after the pictures taken only a few hours ago were posted on the internet and who knows where else. He hadn't told her about them at the bar in case anyone was close enough to hear him, and when he'd tried to call her from the car to tell her, her phone had already been cut off for the evening. And the chances of her actually checking her voicemail were slim to none. Zach had been through two serious relationships in the public eye, and quite a few flings. He knew that having the media involved made things so much harder. They wanted to turn nothing into a big something. And with Alexandra and James, they had more than nothing to work with. He had never once doubted that Alexandra loved him, but seeing her with James he understood that while she loved him, she was not madly in love with him. The way she looked at James, well, you just knew she had never and would never look at anyone the same again. It was the same way Alex and Jackie looked at each other, even after their divorce. Zach had always hoped to find someone to look at like that, and vice-versa. The fact that the other two couples involved in this bizarre partnership had so much trying to keep them apart made him realize that it was very likely Hannah would never be that girl for him. And that's the thought that cost him a peaceful night's sleep. He was still thinking about it when his alarm went off. He really wanted to hit snooze, but knew they all had a plane to catch. After convincing himself to roll out of bed, he double checked that everything was packed and headed downstairs. Seeing the team was not something he wanted to start his morning off with, but it had to be done. Everyone looked up when he walked in the kitchen, but no one said a word. Zach grabbed a juice and breakfast bar and headed to eat on the porch, away from the awkward silence he was sure he had caused. He was surprised when Hannah followed him. \"Look, Zach, I'm sorry. I overreacted last night. I have no right to question what you do or get mad because another girl is calling you. And you have every right to call Alexandra; she's part of the team you represent.\" \"You really don't need to apologize, Hannah, it was a natural reaction.\" \"Not for me, it's not. I guess with everything that happened with Jackson, I went overboard with my thoughts.\" \"That's totally understandable. Between your recent break-up and all that's going on with the team, maybe we were just fooling ourselves with thinking we could try and start a relationship right now.\" Hannah tried not to let the hurt show as she swallowed the lump that was forming in her throat. \"I could agree more; there's just too much going on for us to try and make it work right now.\" \"I'm glad you agree; I still want to hang out and be friend, though.\" \"Oh, totally. Well, glad we got that out of the way; I better go make sure my stuff's all packed,\" she said, trying to escape the patio as quick as possible. Watching her walk away, Zach was more than a little disappointed that she had been so quick to agree that they call things off before even starting.[Chapter 12] CHAPTER TWELVE James and Zach had still not spoken by the time group got to the plane. Once they boarded, James took his seat and popped in his head phones, hoping his iPod would give everyone the clue he didn't feel like talking. When Hannah noticed Zach was taking the seat next to hers, she did the same. Zach glanced over at Hannah as he took his seat. He could have sworn she'd been avoiding him since that morning on the patio, and totally didn't get it. If him calling things off had bothered her, why had she been so quick to agree? The more he looked back on it, the more he had wanted her to disagree and tell him that they could make it work. But she hadn't and it was time to focus on the next few days of competition, and the mess that would be following his newest clients there. While everyone else was trying to keep to themselves, Jackie and Alex were planning their \"make-up\" trip. If things went well in St. Thomas, Jackie was going to try and convince Hannah to stay and take over Alex's condo. Then she would have her favorite guy living with her, and her favorite girl in town! After a very silent flight to Minnesota, the team deboarded the plane, still not speaking. They all walked by reporters and fans trying to get their attention, waving and heading straight to the car. Once they all piled in, Alex. \"Alexandra should be waiting on us when we get to the hotel. Before anyone goes to their room to unwind, we need to all get together and get some things straight. I'm not going to be staying in the room booked under my name, so we will use that as our \"green room\". Drop off your bags and head straight there. Despite anything personal you've got going on with anyone else in this car, we've got to put up a united front. Eating together, going out together, everything. Got it?\" The whole team nodded in agreement, Hannah and James both looking out the window. At least the two taking the ice still got along, which was unusual for this group. At the end of the day, what they did on the ice mattered the most. They could put on a happy front and pretend to all be the best of friends, but if the team didn't make a positive showing in the rink, it was all a waste. Alexandra had been so tired and rushed that morning when she headed to catch her plane that she hadn't really paid attention to anything. Once she landed, articles in various papers and magazines began to catch her eye. She didn't need to read them to know they were bad news. Every single one of them was accompanied with a picture of her boyfriend dancing with every hussy in Connecticut. All this time she'd felt bad, thinking he was sitting at home catching up on TiVo and pondering their relationship. And her mother wondered why she had questioned his loyalty and dedication! She was still fuming by the time the team arrived and was less than thrilled when James was the first one to show up for the meeting. \"Thanks for letting me know you were going to be here,\" said James, finally breaking the icy silence. \"I'm sure you would have been too busy to care even if I'd tried,\" she snarled back, throwing one of the many papers with his previous nights actions on the front. \"Seriously, you're going to get mad over this? After shutting me out for the last three months and then up and leaving me with no notice? And then you're gonna come back in here, with no explanation, and start throwing pictures at me?\" \"It's not like you were pushing me to talk, or following me out the door. Maybe you wanted me to leave so you could get back to the old you, the James that got all the ladies and just had a good time, with no worries or responsibility.\" \"Do you remember our first fight? When I stood you up for dinner, all because I misunderstood something I saw with you? And it just kept escalating? We almost missed out on something great because of that. Don't let the same thing happen again. I was out with the team last night and after watching the rest of the group couple off, I started feeling sorry for myself and drank too much. All I did was dance like an idiot, nothing else happened, I swear. The whole time I thought about how I would have rather been with you then in any bar in the world. Even if it meant sitting at home, waiting on you to finally talk to me.\" \"I wanted to talk to you; I just didn't know what to say. I didn't want you to feel trapped by the situation; that's why I had to leave. I wanted you to take some time to think about it without worrying about me or my feelings.\" \"You didn't have to leave me for that; I've always known that I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" \"Do you mean that or are you just saying it because of everything that's going on?\" \"See, that's why I didn't ask you earlier, I knew you would think that! But I had been planning on asking you to marry me after we won Nationals for months. You can call the jewelry store and check,\" he said, putting his hand into his coat pocket. \"I bought this for you before any of this happened.\" As he pulled the ring out of his pocket, James got down on one knee and looked up at Alexandra, his heart racing faster than he had ever skated. She didn't respond, but simply fell into his arms, crying and nodding her head yes. And that was what the rest of the team walked in to find. \"Well,\" interrupted Alex, \"it looks like we can scratch the first item off the agenda. Glad to see you crazy kids are getting along. Now, since you appear to be all in love again, James, can you work with Zach now without trying to take his head off?\" Alexandra looked at the two as they nodded in agreement, confused as to what had happened between them. Then, she remembered that they had been together when she had called Zach the previous night. Surely James would now understand that it was strictly business. \"Good. Now that we can honestly show and announce that people are back together,\" Alex said, putting his arm around Jackie, \"hopefully the media will back off. If not, Alexandra, are you ready to come forth with why you left?\" \"Yes, if it comes to that, I will make my statement.\" \"Then that's it. Have fun tonight, and let's give everyone something besides our personal lives to talk about tomorrow!\" Jackie said, leaving to go grab a private dinner with Alex. \"I guess we should go make some calls before the engagement gets some press,\" said James, putting his arm around Alexandra to lead her out. \"See you guys tomorrow!\" That left just Zach and Hannah. \"Um, wanna go grab something to eat?\" asked Zach. True, she didn't want to be wasting time with a guy who didn't want her. On the other hand, though, she didn't want to spend the night with PPV and room service. So, she agreed to meet him downstairs in thirty minutes. Just as she'd done the night she thought they'd had a chance.[Chapter 13] CHAPTER THIRTEEN Out of spite, Hannah took a little bit longer than usual to get ready for dinner. She put on her most flattering jeans and lowest cut top, made sure to wear her hair down, and put on A-list event worthy make-up. By the look on Zach's face when she stepped off the elevator, it had been worth it. Hannah had suggested they go somewhere with entertainment for dinner so that they wouldn't have to have awkward conversation, so Zack led way to the hotel's sport's bar that happened to have karaoke that night. After a couple of drinks and dinner, Hannah decided to become part of the entertainment. Zack was beyond shocked when he saw her make her way to the stage to sing. Hannah got a smirk on her face when the opening chords to \"You're So Vain\" came across the speakers. Luckily, Zack was so blown away that he didn't even realize she was singing to him. Smart, athletic, gorgeous and talented? He was an idiot! And apparently not the only one who had noticed how amazing she was. There was a line of guys waiting to talk to and buy her a drink when she got off stage. Without even giving him a second glance, she headed off with her suitors. Zack decided that as her PR rep, he should stick close to make sure nothing got out of hand. He told himself that was the only reason he followed the crowd to the patio. Knowing she would be irritated that he was there, he hung back from the crowd, keeping an eye on things. He let her dance, laugh, and drink all she wanted. When he saw her leaving with a guy, he knew it was his duty to step in, though. And he knew it was as much for himself as for the team. Zach ran up just as the elevator door was closing and put his foot in to stop it. Hannah looked less than thrilled to see him joining her and her new friend. \"Hannah, don't forget we have a meeting in thirty minutes.\" \"I know of no such meeting. I've already got plans for the remainder of the evening, sorry,\" she replied without even looking at him. \"Considering you take the ice in about twelve hours, I think you can postpone your plans.\" \"Considering there's not even a real meeting, you can kiss my ass.\" \"Excuse me,\" said Zach, turning to the other guy in the elevator, \"I have no idea who you are, and personally don't care. I am sure that you do not want to be known as the guy who cost America there shot at gold, though.\" \"Look man, I was just going to grab an old magazine article for her to sign, forget it, though,\" he replied, hopping off as soon as the elevator stopped. \"What the hell?\" exploded Hannah as soon as they were shut in the elevator alone. \"It's my job to make sure your reputation stays in tact?\" \"And signing an autograph would really ruin my reputation? And what the hell do you know about a good reputation anyway?\" \"How was I supposed to know that's what you thought you were going to do? Not usually the first thought when you see two people leave a bar together\" \"Thought? That IS what I was going to do. It was for the guy's wife who was home on maternity orders!\" \"I apologize if I over reacted, I just didn't want you to do anything rash.\" \"You mean like the night we hooked up?\" \"That's not the same at all, and you know it.\" \"Yeah, well I also thought I knew you better.\" As soon as the door opened, Hannah bolted past him, never looking back to see Zach's look of bewilderment as she took off down the hall. Why couldn't he have just told her he was wrong? That he wanted to give them a shot? Instead, he had made a complete ass of himself and put an even bigger wedge between them. Not wanting to deal with thinking about it all, Zach got back in the elevator and headed back to the bar. Hannah threw herself on the bed as soon as she walked in. Maybe she should have just told him that she was only going up with the guy to make him jealous. That she hadn't really agreed with him when he said they wouldn't work. He had to still be interested in her to overreact that much, right? Knowing she would not get a good night's sleep without talking to him, Hannah headed towards Zach's room to clear the air. After what seemed like hours of knocking, the door to Zach's room finally opened. It was not Zach, however, on the other side. It took Hannah to a minute, but as soon as she figured out it was Celeste Mercier, she took off back to her room, not once stopping to respond to Celeste calling her back. It was like catching Jackson in the coach's office all over again.[Chapter 14] CHAPTER FOURTEEN The team knew that in order to have everyone's eyes on the team and their show, they were going to have to deal with the press first. So, at 8am, they met for a quick breakfast and headed off to their press conference. This time, every one walked in coupled off. While the couples ahead were very close, Hannah and Zach kept their distance and never looked at each other. \"Good morning, and thanks for coming. Due to the fact that Hannah and James will be taking the ice in a few hours, I would like to ask that you hold all questions until later today when we celebrate their win. We would, however, like to take this time to make a few announcements and clear the air on a couple of issues that some of you have touched on. I, for one, am happy to announce that yes, Jackie and I are in fact working on getting back together. We do ask for respect and privacy at this time while we work things out, and will be more than happy to talk to you all later when things have settled and decisions have been made.\" As Alex finished speaking, Jackie stepped up to the podium to join him and the two smiled together as the photographers went crazy. \"Thanks, we can use all the confidence and support we can get while we work on this reconciliation. Now, I would like to hand the spotlight over to James and Alexandra as they have an announcement of their own,\" said Jackie, as she took Alex's hand and moved to give James the floor. \"Throughout this whole ordeal, there has been a lot of speculation as to why I would be skating without Alexandra today. A lot of those speculations were dealing with our relationship off the ice. Well, we would like to finally address those.\" Alexandra took a deep breath and stepped close to James to make her announcement. \"I am excited to tell you that I will not be competing today because James and I will be welcoming our first child this October.\" \"And, \" interjected James, \"as far as our relationship, we will be getting you all together soon to announce our wedding date.\" As another round of photographers going crazy ensued, Zach and Hannah took a glance at each other. They knew the media expected to hear something about them, but they really didn't want to ruin all the good news. Instead, Zach simply stepped forward to thank everyone for coming and excuse the team to go get ready to compete. Hannah took off immediately to get ready, not wanting to watch everyone else kiss their significant others goodbye. Zach knew he should have apologized to her about his actions in the elevator. She was just acting even colder to him than he expected and he wasn't sure the right way to approach it. He was about to ask Alex for advice when his Blackberry started going off. Seeing that it was Celeste, Zach excused himself to find a private place to talk. \"You wanna talk about it?\" asked Jackie as she finished zipping Hannah into her seersucker skating dress. \"There's really nothing to talk about.\" \"If that were true, you'd be in a much better mood.\" \"It is what it is, ya know? Apparently I'm just built to fall for guys who like to sleep with other women.\" \"What are you talking about? I thought you quit brooding about Jackson about five minutes after it happened?\" \"I wasn't referring to Jackson. I meant Zach.\" \"Even more confused now.\" \"I went to go talk to Zach last night, thinking he'd given me the signs that he was maybe regretting saying it wouldn't work with us. So, I did something very unlike me. I sucked it up and went to his room to talk about it. Boy was I surprised when it was Celeste Mercier, not Zach, who opened the door. Talk about dÃ©jÃ  vu.\" \"Have you talked to him about it?\" \"Yeah, right. Sucking it up once was tough enough for me. No way in hell am I doing that again.\" \"Maybe it was a misunderstanding. I know that seems very rare, but in this group, there actually pretty common. Ask anyone who was up there with you this morning.\" \"Do you actually think that?\" \"I'm not sure, but I know you owe it to both you and Zach to find out what happened.\" Without responding, Hannah threw on her Uggs and took off running to find Zach. By the time she got to where they'd had the press conference, only Alex and Alexandra were left. \"Have y'all seen Zach?\" \"Yeah, I just saw him in the front lobby helping Celeste with her bags.\" Not even taking time to get upset that he was again with Celeste, Hannah sprinted to the lobby. She had just finished her mental pep talk when she spotted them, and stopped suddenly. Seeing them hold each other like they never wanted to let go was enough for Hannah to realize it had not been a misunderstanding. Before they could spot her she turned around and headed back to Jackie, determined not to let what she had just seen effect her performance.[Chapter 15] CHAPTER FIFTEEN Jackie was very impressed with the way Hannah was handling herself. It was obvious to her that things hadn't gone the way her cousin planned, but anyone who hadn't known Hannah her whole life would have no idea. Instead of being her typical drama queen self, Hannah appeared to have pushed whatever happened out of her mind in order to focus on the task at hand. Perhaps it was the irritation kicking up her adrenaline, but Hannah had never felt more confident in her life. Now that she knew Alexandra's reasoning for missing this, she really wanted to win for her and James. And she wanted to make Alex and Jackie proud. And a small part of her just wanted to prove to Zach what he'd missed out on. James wasn't sure why he still got nauseous after the number of times he'd done this, but it still happened. This win would be a great story for his unborn child in the stands, and he couldn't wait to tell it. He just needed to focus and get in the moment. They could do this routine in their sleep. Everyone's pacing and thinking was brought to a stop with the warning they were up next. They all just nodded and headed toward the rink entrance. They then waited for what felt like an eternity to Hannah and not long enough for James. When it was their turn, both took a huge breath and took center ice. The minute Kelly Clarkson's \"My Life Would Suck without You\" came over the speakers, James and Hannah blocked everything out and became poetry in motion. Jackie caught herself praying the two times Hannah did her once famous triples. She was still amazed that Hannah was still able to land them. So far everything had gone off spotless, but Jackie knew she wouldn't breathe until after they had done the triple axel throw jump. Hannah had decided to throw an around the world jump to it which was either brilliant or disastrous. The minute it went off brilliant, Jackie found herself crying and jumping into her Alex's arms. She caught Hannah's eye as the couple came to a finish and noticed she, too, had tears in her eyes. When Alex put Jackie down she was jumped by both Alexandra and Zach who had rushed down to congratulate the team that was sure to win the gold. Everyone was so caught up in the moment and then celebrating scores that Hannah hadn't noticed Zach was holding flowers. She figured they were for her or Jackie from the firm, so she wasn't surprised when Zach came to give them to her. \"I know it's not much considering they're congratulations, apology, and request for a second chance all in one, but I didn't have a lot to choose from.\" \"Wow, well, thanks and I accept the apology. Don't think so on the second chance, though.\" \"Hannah, I know I said it was bad idea, but I really think it's great. And maybe you're not ready for anything yet, but I'm willing to keep it casual until you are.\" \"It's not me, it's you. I came to your room last night and Celeste answered the door. I was even willing to hear you out on that one, but when I came to find you and saw you two together, I knew it didn't matter.\" \"It does matter. Yes, she stayed in my room last night, but I didn't. And yes, I did see her this morning and spend some time with her. But there's nothing there. She's going through a tough time in her marriage right now and I was just an old friend helping out. I even told her about you and she wished us the best.\" \"Wow, Jackie was right, nothing in this group is ever what it seems,\" she said, before grabbing him and kissing him just in time for the cameras to turn. The next day, right below the picture of James and Hannah accepting their gold was various pictures of all of the couples, old, new and reunited. They were all the feel good story of Nationals on so many levels. And they all had about two weeks to enjoy it before the training for the Olympics began.
