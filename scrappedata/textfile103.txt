I will also be making a devon version. so i hope you like it. Now back from the start. you kidnap my heart\" i finished singing. i looked at Devin and she still had her eyes closed, she slowly opened them and looked at me \"uh thanks\" she started to giggle out. but then something came over me i dont know what but the way she stared at me, it was like she actually believed in me and that i could over come stage fright. i started to lean towards her and before i knew what was going on her lips were on mine. There were fireworks it was an explosion but at the same time it was plain and simple. What suprised me the most was that she kissed me back until we heard \"Devin its all over the news\" we both pulled back and looked at the door where the noise was coming from and standing there was Lincoln and Gabby. what the weird thing was is they both looked really hurt and betrayed? \"oh my god,\" gabby said as she made a run out of the room. Devin of coarse got up and followed her. \"what the heck, man get your filthy lips off my peacock\" Lincoln said vancing toward me. Just to be followd by Devins cry \"gabby\" \"you've totally crossed the line now\" lincoln said with a raging voice. i droppped the guitar and stared at him. \"come on lets go\" he said a he basically threw me on the gound. I followed him out the door and he ordered me to get in the car. I thought we were just going for a ride even though i have to admit being in a car with him kind of scares me. As soon as Lincoln got back in the car he tied my hands up with a rope and pulled out of the driveway. . I saw Gabby and Devon arguing luckily Gabby saw the car and got Devons attention so i started banging on the windows with my tied up fist. about 20 mintures later i decided to speak seeing that this migh be the only chance i have to get out of this. \"Dude i just want you to know i really like her\" i said finally speaking the truth. There was just somethig about Devin. Lincoln started laughing and said \"no, no way man you just think you do\" he said clearly mad about what i just said. \"nah, there was just this moment\" i said thinking back to when i started singing and the way she wanted to help me but at the same time she wanted to make as comfortable as i could get. \"what moment\" lincoln asked I took a deep breath before saying this not wanting lincoln to blow up. \"she was gently washing the egg of me\" i said thinking back to the sweet moments we shared. where i kind of realized she wasent some crazed fan she actually believed in me and wanted to give me a chance. \"she washed the egg off of you or she just helped you with a few shells\" lincoln asked clearly intersted. \"she wipe the egg off of me with a big smudge\" i said trying to make him jealous because it was so obvious that he had a thing for Devin. \"no what you got is that stockorn syndrome ive been reading about that, thats it\" he said now making things up. \"stockhorn syndrome\" i asked. \"its when the hostage you, begins to identify the captor when theres any moments of kindness shown that can be misinterperted as specail treatment, for you to believe that your in some kind of love\" Lincoln respnded. \"i dont know about that\" i said. I mean where does he come up with the idea that i love Devon, like maybe but love. \" i just really dig Devin\" i kept going. \"i think you should shut up before i kill you\" lincoln said looking at me with a death glaze. \"guess i dont mind because technically i'd be dying for Devin\" i said thinking. \"no,no if anyones gonna be dying for devin its gonna be me i've earned it \" he was gonna keep going that much i could tell. \"put your hands on the wheel\" i interrupted him. \"dont tell me what to do\" he yelled back. After that once we stopped in the middle of the forest he pulled me out of the truck and grabbed a rope from the bed and led me to a tree i tried to protest but looked at his face and decided it wasent the best idea. after that he tied me up and basically just left me there he just drove off. After he left i was tied to a tree so i started to think. What was it about Devin that had me so hooked on her. was it the way she loved the band even after everything we put her through. Or the need she had to help people. I dont know but i knew she was a great person inside and thats all that counts i mean she went through all this trouble just to make us play a concet and after she knew my secret she didnt laugh at me and tell the whole world. She tried to help me. Just then i car pulled up and out came lincoln \"your so lucky Devins so pushy\" he said as he untied me. we got into the car and drove off and just as we went i thought. even when you least expect it something great can happen and that theres always room for more. ok well thats it it might sound kind of girly if it does im sorry. Ok look if you guys want me to make a Devin one i will just tell me and im thinking of even doing a Mason and Gabby one on their first kiss. yours, al ","Summary":" This is a one shot of what was goign through ritchies head when he kissed devon.

It's all that stupid pop stars fault, but he'd shown the kid exactly who was boss, successful in kidnapping him from his other kidnappers. Where Ritchie was, none of them would be able to find him, not to say some random person passing by won't discover the black haired male bound to a tree. Ritchie, Ritchie, Ritchie! It was always about that fake, why did Devon never choose him? He's the one that truly loved her, he's the one that's always been there for her, yet every time he'd attempted to make a move he was blown off. Well, not anymore, Devon was about to learn the hard way just how far she's pushed him, the blonde had unknowingly delivered Lincoln the best leverage to use against her. It's just like in those sappy movies, you want someone to pay then you go after the ones they love and cherish, in Devon's case that would be Ritchie and Lincoln already had the boy. Devon continued to push him out, demanding he go fetch Ritchie, that she wanted nothing to do with him till the Star was brought back. \"You know what, Devon?\" States a now chuckling Lincoln \"I'm sick and tired of never being enough for you, it's all about little Ritchie.\" \"What? No, it's-\" Devon stared at the change in the African American male, she'd never seen that calculated look in his eyes \"Look Lincoln, like it or not we need Ritchie if we want the band to perform at school tomorrow.\" \"And what if I don't care about the band?\" Retaliates Lincoln, dark gaze roaming Devon, Mason and Scooter \"I could care less if you and Gabby remain socially outcasted.\" \"Don't care? How can you not care? That was the whole point of the kidnapping in the first place!\" \"What's the matter? Worried for you precious not so secret lover?\" Mocks Lincoln Devon's mouth drops open as Lincoln takes hold of her hand \"Lincoln, this has gone too far, let Ritchie go.\" \"Nah, I don't think so.\" Lincoln smirks \"Little pop star is going to stay exactly where I left him, he crossed a major line.\" \"It was just one kiss!\" Exclaimed Devon \"I already apologized repeatedly for it, Gabby quit being my friend because of it, believe me if I could take it back, I would.\" Lincoln released the blondes hand, fingers twisting the knob on the front door \"No you wouldn't, you like Ritchie, Devon.\" Devon stares, blue eyes filling with tears but she can't deny the words, truth is she's crushed on the singer for years, but that kiss sparked something entirely knew \"Lincoln, I'm sorry I hurt you, I shouldn't have used you just to kidnap the band, but Ritchie didn't do anything wrong, he's innocent!\" Lincoln scoffs as he begins backing out the door, keeping careful watch of the two confused band mates \"He's not innocent, Devon. He's a fraud and a liar! Yet you're still choosing him over me?\" \"So that's what all this is about?\" Pipes in Mason \"You're jealous of Devon's feelings for Ritchie?\" \"Let the lady be with whoever she chooses man, it's not up to you.\" States Scooter Lincoln rolls his eyes \"Duh, I may not be able to control her, but I can decide his fate, don't worry about Ritchie, Devon. I'm planning on taking good care of him.\" \"No, no, Lincoln, don't hurt him!\" Screams Devon, the blonde attempted to cling to Lincoln's shirt but fails as the young man rushed towards his red Jeep, the female immediately following suit \"Lincoln! Where is he? Where's Ritchie?\" Lincoln ignores the girl, switching the car into reverse and giving a final parting wave as he backs out of the drive way, Devon trying to chase the car on foot as it descended down the road. Night vision goggles now on, Lincoln makes his way back to the secluded woods he'd left the teen, all thoughts of letting Ritchie go now disappeared from his mind. Maybe ransom? There's gotta be someone out there besides Devon who wants pretty boy back, no too much evidence that could lead back to him. Lincoln highly doubted Devon would go to the police, yet he'd also believed that he'd never find her kissing another guy, let alone one he'd helped the girl kidnap. Devon had used him to get what she wanted, the blonde never cared about him, Lincoln was but a means to an end, her real goal was Ritchie. Sure she can say all she wants how much she hates him, but Lincoln wasn't stupid, Pete had told him about the girls having to make the choice of which boy to leave behind between Ritchie, Scooter, Mason and KK. Said she'd been desperate to keep Ritchie as her captive, stating the obvious bull she'd spouted moments ago. Devon had enticed him with lies of humiliating the band, while the real plan was so much deeper, Devon had wanted Ritchie and Lincoln could get him for her. Lincoln should be furious, yet all he could do was smile and laugh, Devon thought she had him wrapped around her little finger, yet he'd outsmarted her and spirited away the only boy she cared about. Lincoln holds all the cards, no one knew of this area, or of the tree house he'd stow the singer in, Ritchie was in his hands and as long as he has him, he holds all the power. Hours passed before he finally drew close, he hadn't realized just how far out here he'd driven till now. \"Hey! Can anyone hear me?\" Echoed the young male voice he'd abandoned hours earlier \"Please! I've been kidnapped!\" The struggling and screaming figure now seen just up ahead took Lincoln's attention, Ritchie was right where he'd left him, bound by white ropes to a tree. Bright light shined directly in Ritchie's eyes, blinding the teen from seeing exactly who had hopefully come to his rescue \"Hello?\" The male smirked as he exits the still running Jeep, basking in the fear that had risen on his hostages face \"There's been a slight change of plan.\" Ritchie stares \"What change? Look dude, just let me go, alright?\" Lincoln shakes his head as he moves behind the tree, slowly undoing the series of knots \"I don't think so, man\" Ritchie struggles as the knots fall away, now would be his chance to escape \"Lincoln, seriously dude this whole kidnapping thing is getting old.\" Lincoln chuckles as the last knot is untied, knowing of the teen hostages plan, he quickly kicks Ritchie in the back of the knee, propelling the star to the harsh earth. Ritchie angrily spits out rocks and dirt, there's not much he can do with his hands tied and Lincoln now looping the fallen cords around is torso \"I've seriously had enough of this!\" \"And I seriously don't care.\" Mocks Lincoln in his best high pitched Ritchie voice \"This is your life now, so deal with it.\" Ritchie winced as the ropes are tightened, the white nylon making sure he can't reach his struggling wrists, Lincoln grasping the ropes end and pulling Ritchie along \"What exactly are you getting from this, huh?\" Lincoln ignores his captive, instead forcing the young man deeper into the woods using the makeshift leash \"Just shut up before I gag you.\" Now it's Ritchie's turn to scoff, head raising to look at the surroundings \"Right, right, cause I forgot your the man with a plan.\" \"Damn straight\" agrees Lincoln, the dark silhouette of the house now coming into view. \"What is that?\" Questions Ritchie upon sight of the rickety looking cabin before him, Lincoln pushing down a set of steps \"I'm so not going in there.\" \"Uh, yeah you are\" States Lincoln, the teen starting his climb, pulling on the rope in an attempt to force Ritchie along \"Either you climb up here or I drag you.\" Ritchie glares, the teen try's stopping himself from being dragged inside, only the vast amounts of rope tightening and restricting his limbs begins affecting his breathing \"Damn it!\" Lincoln chuckles as begrudgingly Ritchie starts to climb, his feet slipping at times, the only thing keeping the teen up was the hold on the ropes. \"Ow!\" Yells Ritchie in pain, fists clenched as he try's and fails to pull his arms \"Lincoln, stop!\" \"Then get your wussy butt up here\" berates the captor, giving another sharp tug on the rope suspending the captive. Ritchie scrambles to level his feet with the steps, slowly making his way upwards until he's finally inside \"Now what? You got me in here, what's next?\" Lincoln smiled, tugging the rope once more \"Nothings changed, you're still a prisoner, just got a new captor.\" \"And the change in scenery?\" Questions a disgruntled Ritchie \"Come on, dude. You don't actually think you're going to get away with this?\" \"I'm the best at what I do\" answers Lincoln, the captor winding the rope around a large hanging beam, forcing Ritchie to his feet \"And I never get caught.\" Ritchie shrugs, head raises to inspect his ropes, mouth opening to voice a comment, but falls short at the restricted feeing coming over his legs \"Dude, seriously?\" Lincoln looks up as his hands continued with tying Ritchie's ankles together and to a ring in the floor \"Just taking extra precautions that you can't get away.\" \"Is this what you do in your off time? Kidnap and tie people up in this shack in the middle of the woods?\" Berates Ritchie, if there's one thing the teen knew how to do, it was pissing people off. \"What I do in my spare time doesn't matter to you, wuss.\" Snaps Lincoln with a harsh pull of the rope, firm cuffs now surround each ankle \"Why aren't you more afraid? You've been kidnapped, twice now, I left you bound to a tree and now I've got you all roped up in my tree house.\" \"You think this is the first time I've had to deal with crazy fans?\" Speaks Ritchie \"I'm famous, dude. Girls hide out in my closet just to get close to me.\" Lincoln can't help but picture Devon hiding in his closet, the blonde waiting impatiently for him to get home, the want to ravish him taking over her entire being. \"Well there's one big difference this time.\" Clarified Lincoln, the teen ripping a strip of Ritchie's signature black jacket. \"Dude! This is my favorite jacket!\" Comes Ritchie's voice in anger and annoyance. Lincoln smirks as he rips another much longer strip, now balling up the first one \"The difference in your situation now? I don't care about you, I'm not some crazed fan wanting nothing but to go out on a date or whatever it is those girls are into.\" Ritchie reels back as Lincoln grabs hold of his chin, dark eyes blazing \"You're here as a means to an end, I could care less about the famous wussy pop star you think you are.\" \"What means?\" Questions a perplexed Ritchie, still fighting to free his chin from the sinister grip \"What are you talking about?\" Lincoln fake chuckles as he pinched Ritchie's jaw, forcing his mouth to open, quickly the balled up fabric is wrenched inside before being sealed using the long strip. \"Just like how she used me, now it's my turn to use you.\" Ritchie's head turns anyway possible to avoid the gag, but with the teen already being bound, there was no nowhere for him to go. Lincoln tied the knot being used tightly to confine Ritchie's mouth, basking in the muffled retorts his prisoner was now making \"You're leverage for me to use against Devon, she wants you, but I have you.\" Lincoln messes with the short black strands of Ritchie's hair \"She'll do whatever I say to get you back, it's like a fairytale, only you're the damsel in distress, princess.\" I'm on a roll today! Finished so many stories I've been working on what feels to be forever. This is from the underrated movie Taking 5.

So this is my first Taking 5 fic. The movie did not get that popular but, I flippin loved it so here we are! This fic is based off of the Click 5 song \"My girlfriend(forgot me this christmas)\". But I am writing it like 5leo rise sings it. okie dokie! And, this takes place a few years after the movie. I hope you all like it! ~Riah Disclaimer: none of its mine... \"Come on Mason, don't give me this guilt trip. You know I am going to spend Christmas with my family this year.\" Gabby said with an exhausted tone into the receiver of her cell phone, like she had given this explanation a million times already. Mason, in LA, sighed back to her into his phone \"I know Gabs, I know. But, it's not fair!\" The 23 year old man said sounding rather childish. \"All of the other guys get to see their significant others on Christmas. Even Dev is flying down to see Ritchie. On Christmas! Straight from her college. Now, that's dedication.\" He ended boldly. Gabby didn't even wait a beat before she retorted \"Are you suggesting that I am not dedicated to this relationship! That is not okay! Oh no! You know, I will have you know sir that I….\" She was cut off by the sound of her boyfriend laughing on the other end. \"Gabs! Calm down. I was kidding. I know the only reason Devon is coming is because her parentals are going to be gone to the Bahamas, man\" He added the last part in a Jamaican accent. \"And don't roll your eyes at me Gabriella Anne Davis!\" \"How did you know I…\" \"I know you Gabs.\" \"True\" She said smiling, and then it faded a little. \"I really am going to miss you Mason but, hey, at least we have New Year's right? She said with the enthusiasm coming back into her voice. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah but, you are still going to forget me on Christmas day.\" He said with a fake pout. Gabby rolled her eyes once again \"Ugh, Mason how many times do I have to tell you I am not going to forget you I am just…\" She was stopped by laughter again. \"Okay you really need to stop doing that Mason.\" \"I'm sorry but, it's just so fun….Hey babe, I gotta go, Hollis is motioning for me to get back to rehearsal.\"Mason said with a hint of annoyance in his voice. \"Okay. I love you Mason, and I will see you soon okay?\" \"Not soon enough.\" \"MASON!\" \"I'm sorry, it's like a reflex! Okay but, I really gotta go. Love you, bye!\" Mason said hanging up the phone and running into rehearsal. …. Hours after rehearsal had ended, Mason was lying upside down on the red couch in the house all the boys shared. He was bored. Everyone had gone somewhere and Gabby was already on a plane back to her folk's house. He was humming a random tune when he started thinking about Gabby. Then, the words came out with that tune. He softly sang \"My girlfriend forgot me….this Christmas day….she was all I wanted this Christmas...\" \"What's that you're singing Mas?\" Ritchie questioned as he came In with groceries full of Devon's favorite foods. ' Man, he is really going all out for her' Mason thought to himself but, pulled himself out of his thoughts when he realized Ritchie was still waiting for an answer. \"Oh, it's nothing really, just something I made up.\" Ritchie was still putting food away \"Well, I couldn't help but hear the words. Would this random, made up song be about a certain brunette who we all know and love as Gabby Davis?\" Ritchie said with a smirk. \"Shut up man.\" Mason threw a pillow at Ritchie's head. \"Besides, it's not like I really think she abandoned me or forgot me, I just loved saying it to her because its gets her all riled up and dude, she is freaking adorable when she is pissed at me.\" Mason stood up and sat at the kitchen island. \"Mason, you are a weird guy.\" Ritchie said leaning over the counter at his friend. Mason thought about this \"Maybe, but, at least I'm happy you know. I know I do things sometimes to make her pissed off at me, intentional and unintentional, but, dude, I would rather be fighting with Gabby then just be with anyone else. You know?\" He finished looking up at his best friend with questioning eyes. Ritchie's finger was on his chin as though he were in deep thought. \"Yeah I get it man, you actually make sense. So, listen, I was thinking, why don't we finish that song and make her really pissed at you, you sick freak.\" Ritchie said grinning. \"That….is a brilliant idea!\" Mason exclaimed jumping up from his chair, \"You are a genius, my friend. And, we could post it on YouTube! And she still gets the bands updates on her phone so she is sure to see it!\" Ritchie stood up straight \"Alright, let's go find the guys and do this thing!\" … \" I GOT A CELL PHONE, TRAMPOLINE, A YEARS WORTH OF MAGAZINES I EVEN GOT A NEW PAIR OF CHUCKS I GOT A SURFBOARD,SWIMMING POOL, A MUSTANG CONVERTABLE STILL DIDNT GET ENOUGH I GOT EVERYTHING I WANTED ON MY LIST..

Review? yeah, you wanna review :)[Chapter 2] Chapter 2...here we go! 5 days had passed since the band posted that video. It was a really big hit with the fans. Even Devon could not stop raving about it. But, there was one person they had not heard from, Gabby. Mason had not talked to her in 5 days. It was Christmas now and he did not know if she had seen it. Well, actually, Devon told him Gabby had seen it so he knows she saw it, she just hasn't called to talk about it and she won't answer any of his. He was starting to think maybe this was not such a good idea. \"Mason, stop worrying. Gabby loves you. She is not just going to drop off the face of the planet. It's not like she has never been fuming mad at you before. She will come around.\" Devon said handing him a cup of egg nog. Mason sighed \"Yeah, but she has never been so mad that she won't even acknowledge my existence. I think I really screwed up this time.\" He said placing his head in his hands. Devon rubbed his back comfortingly \"Don't worry, as far as I know she is still planning on coming in tomorrow, you guys can work it out then.\" … It was the day after Christmas and no one had heard from Gabby, except when she called Devon to wish her a Merry Christmas. Mason was pacing around the living room in front of everybody while they were all trying to watch a movie. \"Mason, man, your mom was no window maker so sit down dude.\" KK said throwing a pillow at him. \"Yeah Mas, stop pacing, you will create a hole in the floor.\" Devon added. Mason sat down on the arm of the couch \"I'm sorry I'm just freaking out! Dev, what time was her flight supposed to be at?\" Devon checked her watch \"Not for a few hours okay, so will you please just try and calm down until then?\" Mason was about to say something else when he heard the front door open and slam shut. \"Mason!\" A female voice called out his name, and he would know that voice anywhere. He stood up \"Gabby?\" Gabby walked into the living room but stopped so she was across the room from Mason. She folded her arms across her chest and just glared at him. The room was silent. Nobody dared to speak. Mason decided he needed to break the ice. \"Um, hey babe, how was your flight...which was apparently early…\" He said looking briefly at Devon who just shrugged. \"Oh no! Don't you 'babe' me. You don't get to 'babe' me after what you did. Mason, do you have any idea…..I can't even begin to….I don't even know why…..ugh!\" she ended her rant of half sentences with an exasperated sigh and sat down on the other arm of the couch, opposite of mason. \"That…was just not cool, man.\" Mason smiled a little. No matter how mad she was at him, she still used words and expressions that she picked up from him. \"Okay Gabs look.\" Mason began as he walked across the room and knelt down in front of her. \"I know it probably wasn't the smartest thing I have ever done in my life but…\" he thought for a moment \"How do you even know the song is about you?\" he questioned. \"Mason!\" \"Okay, let me try again.\" He grabbed her hands lightly. \"I know it probably wasn't the smartest thing I have ever done in my life but, I just missed you so much Gabs. All I wanted this Christmas was you, and so it just kinda came out in song form. And I know the reason why you are pissed so much is because I took some of the lyrics from our conversation but, I just wanted to show you and the world how I felt.\" He let what he said soak in for a few moments. Gabby was looking out the window. He shook her hands lightly \"Gabs? You still with me?\" Gabby turned her head to look down at him, Then, for the first time since she had arrived, she noticed all of the others in the room, who were all staring at her with 'please forgive him' looks. She sighed and looked at Mason's pleading eyes again \"Well, it was a, kinda, good song.\" She said with a little smile forming on her face. A huge smile formed on Mason face as he stood up and lifted Gabby up. He hugged her and swung her back and forth. \"Ha see, I knew you loved me!\" He said as he was releasing her. \"Oh whatever.\" She said back playfully \"Oh, come on, you know you do.\" She smiled \"Yeah I know\" She said as she pulled him down for a small but sweet kiss. The crowed in the room all started their \"aws\" or \"ews\". KK piped up \"Can we get back to the movie please?\" He said with frustration in his voice. Scooter hit him in the chest \"Shut up, dude.\" Mason sat down on love seat and pulled Gabby down next to him. The group sat in silence for a few minutes and just watched the movie until Mason spoke up again. \"So, Gabs, why did it take you so long to get here again?\" He questioned with a smile forming on his face. The group groaned. \"Oh my gosh!\" \"Mason, Really?\" \"Seriously dude, do you never learn?\" Ritchie asked throwing his hands up. Gabby just smiled and shook her head \"No he doesn't. Just let him be.\" She rolled her eyes at her boyfriend. \"Don't roll your eyes at me Gabby Anne Davis.\" Mason said without tearing his eyes away from the TV. \"How did you know I… you know what, nevermind.\" So, that's it! tell me what you think :) Thanks for reading!

I woke up in my room when the sun light hit my eye's. I remember when Danielle went with Scooter and the band. We still stay in contact but she rarely visits. I was in my room getting ready for school. \"What a sleepless night\" I said. I didn't sleep at all last night. I just felt wide awake when I went to bed. Well there's school today and it's my 3 year and school. I got out of bed and started to get ready. When I went down stairs I saw Gaby the eating breakfast there as usual. \" Hey\" I said. \" well how'd you been\" She said. \" fine\" I replied. I sat down and ate.\" well it's been like 2 years since the day we went with that crazy stunt right\" I froze. She was right. She saw me froze and said \"are you all right.\" \" yeah I'm fine\" I said. \" Well lets go before we miss the school bus. We left the house and walk to the bus stop. \" Hey, Dev\" She said. \" what\" I said. \" Well do you think they'll come back\" Gaby said.\" How should I know\" I said \"It's not like there come. There like a chance if Danielle comes and visit\" I said. \" Well do you think she'll come\" she said. \" I don't know\" I replied. Then the bus came. We went on and sat in the middle row. \" Hey\" a girls said to her friend. \" yeah whats up\" the friend said. \" I herd that the 5 Leo Rise is coming to town\". the girl said. Now that got my attention. \" I never herd that there coming to play for the concert.\" the friend said. I notice that Gaby was listening too. \" There not that's what surprise me. There here to visit someone.\" the girls said. Now then I froze so did Gaby.'Could it be possible, no it couldn't' I thought.\" They said that it was a surprise visit\" the girls said. \" I'll tell you every thing in homeroom were at school\" the girls said. We got off the bus. That conversation we eavesdropped on was still in my head going crazy. Then Gaby broke the silence.\" hey dev do you think it true that there coming\" gaby said. She sounded surprised. \" Well anyone could of made that up let not get are hopes up. We went inside the school. We went to our lockers witch are near each other. We grabbed out binder and fled to the meeting room were we do our meeting. Kira was still the president off the school. ( Is that what she is )\" well come everyone for Monday's meeting\" Kira said. She babbled on about something about decorating. My mind was some were else. ' Are they really coming' ' Is Danielle visiting or what '? I thought. \"Well what do you guys think the prom theme should be\" Kira said. ' were having a prom when \" I thought \" Hey gabs when is the prom\" I asked Gaby.\" You weren't listening right\" \" Thinking about what those girls said\" Gabs said.\" yeah\" I said \" so when is it \" I said \" In 2 weeks \" she said \" ok \" I said. We exit the meeting and went to our class room. When we got there the homeroom teacher was there already.'wow' I thought ' she's never this early' We still had like 10 before classes start. Great gym first block what a day. So I decided to talk to Gabs. \" hey gabs.\" I said \" hm\" she said. \" well why is the homeroom teacher here so early. She rarely comes to see if everyone is in the class or even in school. \" Well maybe she has something important to say.\" yeah\" I said. In about ten minutes every one was in the class.\" hey dev, gaby\" said Lincoln \" hey \" we both said at the same time \" I herd that they're come back but not to play isn't that suspicious\" he said \" Well we guess\" we said together again. Then the teacher got our attention by this big bang which almost broke by ear drum. \" Listen up \" she said \" I'm Mrs. Bunner\" she said \" I have an announcement and I will say this one. \" get it got it good\" said.

I think this class is Adventure section now. Yeah love that section. Gaby and I have all the same classes too. So lets got to gym. Everyones pov So we changed and entered the gym. After we did the warm up run and stretches the teacher or captain as i should say called us over. \" all right \" he said \" now we would have a little competition you all will do the competition that you draw. So we all draw our competition. I was shocked as hell. \" OMG I got climbing ropes\" Devin said. \" So do I \" Gaby said and also every one else. \" Well I thought we would all have a little competition of climbing rope.\" the captain said. \" As you can see you will have a number in the left corner. ' great round 1' I thought. I looked over at gabs and saw she's round 2. 'so were in different rounds' I thought. \" As you can see those are your rounds so let have round one. I walked up and there were like 20 ropes down and hanging right now. So 20 people were at each group. \" I can do this \" Devin said. \" You can do it \" I heard people say even my friends. We practice some couple of times. I climb to the middle of the rope a couple of time. I would say I was good and fast if I say so my self. \" Alright practice time is over\" the captain said. \" lets get into position. Oh did I mention we had to run to the ropes. I was scared or nervous as hell. \" ON YOUR MARKS GET SET GO!\" the teacher said. We all sprinted off. all the contestants can here people rutting for them. I also her my friend saying \"' You can do this DEVIN\"'. I grabbed onto the rope and started climbing. There was someone in front of me and not to in front. I pushed my self and was pacing my self to her pace. We were climbing and the same rate. ' Faster, Faster, Faster' I said. I went faster and rang the bell first. I got first place and slid down all the way. My friend were there to congregate me when I got down. I was really tired. \" Nice job dev\" said my friends. \" You did well\" Gabs said. Time skip No ones pov So school ended we were getting our things and heading towards the buses. \" Hey dev we have aof home don't we\" Gaby said \" Yeah. Are the teachs trying to kill us or what\" I said ( devin). \" Well you do have a point\" Gabs said. We got on the our bus. They were talking about them again. You know who I'm talking about right. You guessed it the 5 leo rise coming back her to visit. It's been bugging me all day. \" hey gabs lets listen what they have to say about the 5 leo rise coming into town.\" I said ( devin) \"yeah I was wondering what peoples been thinking about\" Gaby said.

I hope I would hope to see Ritchie again. Also I could tell by the face Gaby was showing she wanted to see Mason again. This was out stop so we went off the bus into the house.

I thought about it and im gonna try. If it sucks just tell me ok. Basically its about ritchie/devin and Mason/gabby also Danielle/scooter he deserves to get their girls. \"dad whats going on\" i asked. Here we were sitting in the living room the whole family well except for Danielle because she and scooter got married. I dint go because i had to go to europe on a class trip. I wish i could of gone 5 leo rise was gonne play for their wedding. \"sweetie look you and gabby need to get out of this place, im paying for you to go live with your sister and scooter for the summer and go to a year of the school in California\" my dad kept tellling me. My dad has this sick obsession to get me and gabby to become actresses. I dont know hes crazy. And yeah about a year ago Gabbys' parents got a divorce and she came and now lives with me. \"you want me to go and live with Danielle?\" i asked i mean me and her arent constantly fighting anymore but we aren't exactly close either. \"it will be a time for you to get to know eachother plus you and gabby need to grow up and realize those boys arent coming back for you live on the real world they're rockstars your just an average girl\" he said. he seemed to backtrack when he saw the tears starting to form in my eyes\". \"not that they never cared for you, sweetie but but you guys live thousands of milles away from them and they constantly have girls throw themselves at them. And maybe if you go there and sort things out you'll be able to get over them and be able to fall in love. I mean its not like your gonna get married to them like your sister did. She's always had the glamorous life you've always have the-\" my mom was saying. but i cut her off \"what the geeky life where i only had 1 best friend she's always beenthe popular one i get it thats what i've always liked about the guys they made me feel wanted and loved, fine me and gabby will go to California\" i said as i stormed off into my room. About an hour later gabby came into our room and said \"hey sorry i was running late me and chris were at the bleachers watching the football and cheerleaders practice\" she said plopping down on the bed next to me. Chris is her boyfriend. So she's grown up i just think she'll never really be over mason. \"Gabby something serious is about to happen and it will change both our lives\" i said as i saw her face go from happy and smiley to worried. \"what, is everyone ok?\" she asked. \"my dad and mom are making us move to California to go live with my sister and we have to spend a whole year, 365 days up there gabs\" i say letting everythng loose. \"what but im dating chris everything is going perfectly finally\" she said her shoulders slumping. \"i know but my dad says we need to grow up and in a big state like California he thinks we will\" i said explaning what my mom and dad told me. \"but with your sister that means Scooter, Ritchie, And Mason?\" \"Yep we leave tomorrow so lets get packing\" i said. After we got done packing we went to bed because we had to get up at 4:30 my sister being the idiot she was got a plane ride for 6:00 in the morning. \"Danielles Pov \"you kidnap my heart, take me with you, Kidnap my heart, make my dreams come true\" That was my ringtone but who would be calling me and 1 in the morning. I look at the color ID. It wa my dad. Probably forgot the time change again. \" you kidnap my heart\" \"turn that off will you\" scooter my husband said. \"its my dad again, sorry\" i said as i picked up my phone. \"hey Daddy\" i said i was about to speak again when i heard Scooter laughing he always giggled because what kind of married Woman still calls sher dad daddy. \"hey Danielle, look i want to send Gabby and Devin up to California to you know grow up we cant afford to move up there andsince your trying to get pregnant it would be good practice besides you and scooter both love them. They need to get out of this state\" \"whoa whoa dad\" i said trying to digest what he just said. Gabby and Devin living with scooter and me. I dont mind but i mean mason and ritchie are hee a lot and i thought they all agreed to get over eachother\" \"dad i would love to have them but are you sure they'll be ok with it i mean i thought that they were trying to get over Ritchie and Mason. But now your trying to get them togetherthis doesent make sense\" i said when i said Mason and Ritchie scooter sat up and looked at me curious. \" i know but i just have thi sfeeling that maybe if devin experiences the whole first love thing with Ritchie she'll get over him. And the same thing with gabby\" he said. \"ok i hope your righti dont want my little sis and well my ttwo litle sis's to get hurt, i'll buy the tickets tomorrow\" \"thanks Danielle\" my dad said before he hung up the phone. \"what going on\" scooter asked. \"do you feel lke having two teenage girls live with us\" i asked. he looked at me curiously. i just shook my head and told him that ill tellhimwith all the guys tommorow. The next day we were in the garage all the boys were sittig down and eating wings. \"guys listen up\" i said and all them snapped their eyes to look at me. \"i got a call from my dad asking a proposition and i accepted\". i took a deep breath before sayin the rel news that might break two band members hearts \"devin and gabby are coming to live with me and scoter for a while\" i said leting the news sink in. \"What\" Ritchie got up from his chair. \"theyre coming in a week and Mason and Ritchie if they ignore you the first few weeks its because theyre afraid to get their heart broken ok\" \"what do you mean\" mason asked. \" you guys are rock stars other girls will throw themselves at you and your more likely to cheat on them, and if you break their heart while their here then i will rip yours out got it\" i said. \"got it\" Mason and Ritchie muttered. \"ok see you later\" i said as i went back outside to go into the house and buy their tickets. the boys took it pretty well. for those of you who dont get it Danielles pov was set a week before Devins. Ok im gonna tell you know that Mason and Gabby's realtionship is going to progress quicker than devin and Ritchie's but i can assue you theres going to be a lot of more drama between the couples. Hope you liked it. And for those who did heres a little sneek peek of whats coming up! \"mason i've missed you to\" i said as i hugged my kneesin the cold weather and looked at mason. \"im just glad your back Gabby\" he said with a tender gaze at my face. of coarse right at the worst time i started shivering. \"hey are you cold\" he said as he started to take off his jacket he put it around my shoulders. \"thanks Mason\" i said i kind of backed up when he started to lean towards me . \"mason i have a have a-\" i was about to say i have a boyfriend but then his lips crashed on mine and i couldnt stop him. I missed that kiss there was always a spark unlike the kisses with Chris. \"wait Chris what am i doing im cheating on chris. Only did then i realize that i was kissing him back and at the precis moment he put his arms around my waist. Using all my force i pushed him back and ran back into the house. \"Dev\" i yelled and when i got to the room curled up on a pillow and cried. Im a horrible girlfriend. My first day in California and im already cheating on my boyfriend with a rockstar how movieish does that sound. i put my head on the pillow when Danielle came in aand sat on the bed and said \"gabby whats wrong\" \"danny i just did the most heart wrenching thing a person could do\" i told her. \"whats that?\" she asked. \"i kissed mason\" i said. Just then i broke a sob down and started crying with her holding me on her ;ap like a 5 year old.[Chapter 2] Gabbby pov. this is the chapter where the see the guys for the first time since they got back. Hows it going to go find out. \"where is the flight 227\" Dev asked a guy with a buz haircut. Why do they let all these people into one airport. come on i mean i can bearely breather with all these people crowding me. \"i told you before miss throught the gate\" he said. Pointing forward. \"which gate\" i asked because i knoe Devins about to lose her cool. \"i dont know gosh leave me alone you sassy priss\" he said and ran the other way. \"oh you little-\" dev was about to say when i interrupted her. \"dev look over there\". I said pointing to the gate marked 28 above the sign it said flight 227 leaving now. \"come on were gonna miss the flight\" i said and i started running. we were the last people to board the plane. Once we got into our seats we started talking and kind of planning what we were gonna do about Mason and Ritchie. We didn't know what to do the way we talked about the guys it sounded like we were still in love with them. I dont know what im gonna do about Mason. \"dev\" i said softly almost a whisper. \"yeah Gabs\" she said taking out her earphones. \"i think i still like Mason\" i whispered not sure how she would take it. \"thats ok Gabby your gonna need to at least be friends with him. i mean your gonna be next to him all summer\". \"yeah i guess, what about you and ritchie\" i said \"i guess we'll see where the summer takes us\" she said but i knew her face tone she was thinking that everything was gonna go bad. About an hour later the plane landedand we were in the LAX looking for Danielle or Scooter Luckily Danielle comes out at thet moment holding hands with scooter. \"devin, Gabby\" she yelled and let go of Scooters hand to come up and her sister and me. \"hey Danielle\" Devin says as soon as Danielle releases her. \"scooter get over here they'e not gonna bite\" Danny yells across the airport to where Scooter was standing.{danny a nick name} \"hey devin,gabby\" he said when he came over and stood next to Danny. \"hey Scooter\" we both said at the same time. \"um the guys are at the house waiting for you to get there\" scooter said uncomfortably knowing by the guys that meant including Ritchie and mason. \"then lets go\" i said as i put on a fake smile. We got the car packed and then we started driving unfortunatly the ride was only about like 15 minutes away. Once me and devin got out of the car we could hear Voices coming from inside laughing and screaming. \"come on guys do you want to say hi to the guys first or go find out where your sleeping\" dannny asked. \"the room first\" me and dev both shouted. While Danny and Scooter just laughed. They took us up the first flight of stairs and on the right there was two bedrooms. \"you guys can pick which room each of you want then me and danny will meet you in the garage\" Scooter said as Danny and he went down the hallway and back down the stairs. \" i want the room across from my sisters room\" devin said. \"ok\" i agreed. about an hour later we went down to the basement. \"oh guys there coming down, come on in Devin and Gabby\" Danny called. we went in and of coarse sitting righ in fron of us were Ritchie and Mason. \"hey\" mason said. \"hey\" i replied. we all said our little exchanges. then when Devin was talking to Danny i decided to go outside on the porc steps. I was about to go back in when i heard the door open i turned around and i saw Mason. \"hey Mason\" i said softly looking down embaressed. \"hey Gabby\" he said back as he came and sat next to me. \"so gabby how have you been\" he asked. \"good\" i replied. \"I've missed you Gabby\" he said looking me in the eye and moving closer. \"I've missed you to Mason\" i said as i hugged my knees the sudden wind came through. \"I'm just glad your back\" he said he said with a tender gaze at my face. And of coarse at the worst time i started to shiver. \"hey are you cold\" he said as he started to pull of his jacket and wrap it around my shoulders. \"thanks Mason\" i said as i started to back away from him when he started to lean towards me. \"mason i have a , have a -\" i was cut off by his lips crashing into mine. the thing that amazed me was that there was a spark unlike the kissses with chris.

I ran up the stairs while yelling \"Dev\" No one responded. i went into my bedroom put my head on the pillow and thought.

The two looked at each other silently andnthen burst into laughter. \"Oh yeah? So that'snhow it is, then?\" a third, unexpected voice inquired. \"Ritchie,\" Devonnbreathed. Gabby smiled at her friend's uncharacteristicnspeechlessness. \"Yeah, that's mynname,\" he laughed, sliding in next to Devon, who, in turn, glancednat Gabby suggestively. \"Okay, okay,\" Gabbynsurrendered. \"I know when I'm not wanted.\" She jumped up andnran quickly off of the stage. \"Listen, Devon,\"nRitchie began anxiously. \"I can't… I have to leave now. It'snnot up to me anymore… not how it used to be.\" \"I know, Ritchie,\"nshe whispered. \"I… I know.\" \"But I don't wannanlose touch with you. Text me?\" She smiled softly andnnodded. \"Promise.\" The couple traded cellnphones and numbers, but even as they did, a feeling of dread settlednover Devon. She couldn't help but feel that this was it. This wasnprobably the last time she would ever see her beloved pop star. Thenone who had become more than her idol. The one that got away. Ritchie accepted hisnphone back and stopped to stare into Devon's eyes. He cupped herncheek in his hand. He smoothed her hair. He kissed her cheek. And,nfinally, he kissed her lips. It was sensational, like nothing she hadnfelt before. Even better than the first one. And then, just likenthat, he was gone. Four Months Later Devon smilednnostalgically as her ring tone, 'Kidnap My Heart', soundednthrough the tiny bedroom. \"Answer that, willnyou?\" Danielle, Devon's controlling older sister, shouted. \"I'mntrying to wash my hair!\" \"No amount ofnscrubbing is going to get the ugly out of that,\" she mutterednquietly. \"Hello?\" \"DEVON!\" Gabby'snmousy voice shouted from the other line. Devon pulled the phone awaynfrom her ear. \"What is it, Gabby?\" \"Nothing,\" shensaid, quieter. \"I'm just hyped up. You know, lots of Coke. Goodnstuff.\" \"Aww, man, Gabs. Younknow you're not supposed to have Coke!\" Devon whined. \"Andnyou're coming over tonight. I bet we won't get any sleep at all.\" \"You know, Devon, younneed a boyfriend,\" Gabby piped up. \"What are you talkingnabout?\" \"You're starting tonsound like my Gramma.\" \"Ha ha,\" Devonnlaughed sarcastically. \"I don't want a relationship. I'm stillnnot over…\" \"Ritchie,\" Gabbynoffered. \"See? You can't even say his name!\" \"Whatever.\" \"Either move on, ornget in touch with him. You still have his number, don't you?\" \"Yeah but… I don'tneven know if it's the right one anymore. And Ryan would kill me…\"nDevon said. \"Ryan? As in yournpossessive EX boyfriend? Emphasis on the EX.\" \"You did putnemphasis on the ex,\" Devon argued, plopping down on her soft bed.nShe stared at the off-white walls of her room, still covered withnpictures of her high school obsession: 5 Leo Rise. \"Is he still talkingnto you? Are you still talking to him?\" Gabby demanded. \"I wouldn't call itntalking…\" Devon admitted. \"Devon, do you neednme to-\" \"I can handle him bynmyself, Gabs. I'm a big girl,\" Devon lied. \"She's in there,\"nDevon heard Danielle saying dismissively. She knew that voice. Shenknew those slow, deliberate steps. She knew who was inching closernand closer to her door. And she, Devon, was scared. \"I have to go Gabby,\"nshe said, and without waiting for a reply, hung up. \"'Sup, Dev?\" Ryannwaltzed into her room. \"Nothing much,\" shensaid, fighting to keep the edge of hysteria out of her voice. \"You?\" \"Well, I was just innthe neighborhood, and I figured I would stop by and ask if you werenready to take me back yet,\" he explained. \"So?\" \"Fat chance,\" shenanswered, as always. And, as always, he turned his back to her tonlock the door. \"That's not a goodnanswer,\" he said. \"Well it still is my answer,\" she fired back, losing control of her voice as henstepped closer to her. He lifted her off of the bed by her thinnshoulders. \"Well, then, you knownthe drill. No screaming, or I go in there and take care of yournstupid sister, too,\" he commanded. Devon just nodded sadly. Thisnwas the way it always went. Sometimes she thought about letting himn\"handle\" Danielle, too, but then she thought that that would benthe same as stooping down to her pathetic level. Ryan pressed her backnagainst the wall and slapped her hard across the face. She whimperednsoftly. He slapped her again, but this time she fell to the ground,nwrapping her arms around her knees. \"Get up,\" he ordered. Shendid. He kneed her swiftly innthe stomach, and she cried out. He clamped his hand over her mouth.n\"What are you doing? I said no screaming!\" And then he threw herninto the wall again. \"Get up,\" he said again, but this time Devonnwas too weak to oblige. \"Fine. I'll be back in a few days. I'mngoing on vacation with the fam. That will give you a little more timento consider my… proposition.\" He left then, slammingnthe door behind him. Devon could hear his jeering laughter echoing innher head for moments after he was gone. She regained her strengthneventually, but she stayed on the floor, wrapped in her fetalnposition, until her phone sounded again. \"Ugh, Gabby!\" shenshouted into the receiver. \"I told you I had to go!\" \"This isn't Gabby,\"nthe voice on the other end replied. \"Ritchie?\" Devonngasped. \"One and the same,\"nRitchie answered, and Devon swore she could hear the smile in hisnvoice. \"I haven't heardnfrom you in-\" \"I know,\" he cutnher off. \"And I'm sorry about that. Please believe me when I saynthat we have been extremely busy since the high school…\" \"I do,\" she said. \"Good. I just wantednto call and let you know that we're opening for some famous star ornanother in your town. And it would be awesome if-\" \"When?\" sheninterrupted. \"Umm… Thursday, Inthink.\" \"Perfect,\" shenagreed, remembering that Ryan said he would be gone for the nextn\"few\" days. \"See you there,nthen?\" \"Yeah. I'll benthere.\" \"And Devon?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Have you beenncrying?\" \"Yeah, Ritchie.\" \"Care to explain?\" \"Maybe some otherntime.\" \"Oh… all right.\" \"See you, Ritchie.\" \"See you, Devon.\" \"And Devon?\" \"What?\" shenlaughed. \"I missed you, too,nRitchie. More than you know.\" A/N: Okay, so reviewnif you liked it. Or if you didn't. I'm open to anything. Gracias.n( :[Chapter 2] A/N: Thanks for allnof the review… I really didn't expect that many. Here's thennext chapter. The following ones will hopefully be up quicker. (Sorrynabout the wait.) Chapter title borrowed from Mayday Parade. Inrecommend you listen to it. Like, now. ( : Two Miserable at Best Devon covered hernflawless face in concealor, foundation, and blush before wiping itnall off angrily to begin again. She had to be perfect. There was nonroom for flaws because she was going to see him tonight. Tonight, shenwas going to see Ritchie. Her heart flutterednnervously as she reapplied the makeup- this time slightly less. Shencouldn't help but think that this was a perfect time for Ryan to gonout of town. Maybe, just maybe, the world wasn't againstnher. She had curled her blonde hair to perfection, and now shenwatched herself in the vanity mirror as she pulled it back into annelegant twist. And then she thoughtnabout it. That wasn't her. She pulled the band out and let it fallnaround her shoulders. Perfect. \"Devon, are you doingnanyth- What is that?\" Danielle wondered, staring over her youngernsister's knee-length red dress. \"Where are you going in thatnthing?\" Devon half-smiled asnher eyes glanced down at the white sash around the middle,ncomplementing her white heels perfectly. \"Concert. Maroon 5.\" \"Sounds great. Mindnif I tag along?\" she asked. Devon just stared.n\"Seriously?\" Danielle laughed. \"No.nJust be back before curfew.\" \"You do know that younaren't really my mother, right?\" \"Whatever.\" Devon simply smiled.nNothing could bring her down from this natural high. She would seenhim, the one she had been waiting for, and all of her suffering wouldnbe worth it. Two Hours Later Ritchie's eyesnscanned the crowd anxiously. What if she wasn't there? What if shenhad been pulling his leg when she said that she had missed him? Butnhe had been serious; he hadn't stopped thinking about her. Finally his eyes landednon the familiar short, skinny blonde. She stood out like a sorenthumb, of course, but that was what he loved about her. Her dressnhugged every inch of her perfect body, and her smile was as radiantnas in his memories. She seemed to havenspotted him, too. Great, because he totally needed for her to catchnhim staring right at her and think that he had become some psychonfreak. She smiled brightly and waved. He returned the smile. \"And now, the momentnyou've all been waiting for: Give it up for Five Leo Rise!\" Ritchie and the othersnskipped onto the stage, carrying their various instruments. Holdingnhis gaze on Devon, Ritchie reached for the microphone. \"This one isnfor a very special girl,\" he said. The song that theynplayed that night was old. But that didn't mean that every girlnbetween the ages of twelve and nineteen didn't know all of thenwords by heart; they did. And so did Devon. After the Show \"Devon,\" Ritchienbreathed. \"It's really you.\" \"Yeah, of course it'snme,\" she grinned. \"Who else would I be?\" He laughed and threwnhis arms around her waist, picking her up to spin her in the air.n\"Ritchie!\" she whispered, giggling. \"People are staring!\" \"Let them stare,\"nhe challenged, putting his fist to his chest theatrically. \"I carenno longer!\" \"You haven'tnchanged at all,\" she noted. \"Neither have you,nDev,\" he said, returning to his normal voice. \"You have no idea,\"nshe disagreed, looking down at the white parking line beneath her. \"What do you mean?\" \"Nothing. I mean,nsomething, but I don't want to talk about it now.\" He shrugged. \"If itnmakes you happy.\" \"Yeah. So, are youngonna offer to take me out for ice cream or not?\" He chuckled. \"Devon,nwould you like to join me for some delectable frozen yogurt?\" She shook her head.n\"No.\" \"What?\" \"No. Frozen yogurt isndisgusting. I say we go for some ice cream.\" \"Ice cream, then,\"nhe offered. \"Yes,\" she beamed.nAnd for the first time in four months, Devon was happy. A/N: I'm reallynsorry you guys. I know that this chapter is very short, and trust me,nit won't happen again, but this is all I have to say at the moment.nThe next one will be the one where Ritchie finds out about Ryan, sonit's bound to be really long. Haha. For now, review! Thanks! ","Summary":" A/N: Okay, so Inrealize that Taking 5 wasn't the most popular movie, but I LOVE IT!nSo here's a fan"},{"Movie":"Taking 5","Title":"What Happens After","Author":"ShannonLee26","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5894459","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One: Seriously? It's been a few hours since the assembly and I already miss the boys. Mason and Scooter are like my brothers. I haven't known them long, but they are really good friends. Ritchie is a completely different story. I love him. I know, it's pathetic. How can I, a sixteen year old, love a guy after only knowing him a few days? Especially since we aren't even dating. \"Hey, Dev.\" His voice interrupted my thoughts. \"Hi, Ritchie.\" \"Sorry about just taking off. We had to go record some stuff. Hollis was being Hollis.\" \"It's fine.\" \"Well, the guys and I are going to Wingers with your sister. Do you wanna come?\" I grinned and nodded. He reached up to pull me off the stage, grabbing my hand in his. Much to my surprise, and pleasure, he didn't drop it once I was standing next to him. Once in the hallway, he abruptly stopped walking before turning to face me, an intense look on his chiseled face. \"I have a confession. I like you, Devon.\" \"I like you too, Ritchie.\" He smiled and kissed me. He then grabbed my hand again and took off running down the hallway, me trailing along behind him. There was a limo with the others in it out front. We hopped in and sat down. He put his arm around my waist and I put my head on his shoulder. Danielle and Scooter were practically making out. Gabby and Mason were also entangled in each other. Nikolai had Laney? When did that happen? KK was alone, but I don't know where Lincoln and Pete went. \"Hey, Danielle, where did Mom and Dad go? They still aren't happy about the boys staying over.\" She gave me an annoyed glare, but I could tell she didn't really hate me anymore. \"Home. They said the boys could stay tonight, since they don't want to go with Hollis, but they are staying in the basement.\" She rolled her eyes. \"They went to get everything set up.\" I nodded. \"They still don't know that we really did kidnap you,\" I added, grinning at my new boyfriend. \"You really were kidnapped?\" Laney asked. \"Yeah, but they didn't really tie us up or anything. Well, they did, but only for a few hours.\" Mason answered. \"I personally vote we don't tell them. Maybe someday they'll know the full story, but not now. They'll get mad.\" Danielle said. \"Um…Laney, why are you here?\" I asked hesitantly. \"Well, Nik was looking at me during the performance and I was kind of gushing about it. Kira was being Kira and yelled at me. So, I dumped her. Figuratively speaking.\" Who would've known Laney was actually cool? I leaned over to Ritchie. \"Are you gonna tell them?\" I whispered into his ear. \"I don't know.\" He knew what I was talking about. I didn't answer, just dropped it. I didn't want to push. We were soon at the restaurant anyway. I sat down next to Ritchie, linking my ankle with his. We ate quickly and headed back to my house. Mom and Dad were in the living room. \"Devon Lissette, explain now.\" \"Well, I burnt the labels and we went to see the band. They agreed to help us and so we brought Ritchie, Mason, and Scooter here. They stayed last night, in my room. I stayed downstairs with Gabby. Then, we went to school. Here we are. Oh, and Danielle is dating Scooter.\" \"Devon's with Ritchie!\" My sister yelled. I didn't get mad. I just laughed. Mom looked at me like I was crazy. \"And Mason and I.\" Gabs added. \"Okay, so this is how it's going to work. First, you introduce us. Second, the boys can sleep on sleeping bags in the basement. Girl I don't know can sleep with Devon. Third, you will stay where you were put.\" Mom said. We all nodded in agreement. \"Alright, Mom. This is Ritchie Tressiak,\" I said, taking his hand in mine. \"I'm Scooter Margiatta, Mrs. Thompson.\" He grabbed my sister's hand. \"I'm Mason Grey.\" \"KK McDermint.\" \"Nikolai Mickolav.\" \"My name is Laney Fox.\" She said with a smile. \"Nice to meet you all. Now, you may stay up as late as you want, but I expect you all to behave.\" We nodded again. We decided to watch a movie. I don't even remember which one. The boys were talking about their tour. \"You know, if you were allowed, you could come on tour with us.\" Scooter commented. I thought it was a good idea, but I doubt Mom and Dad will let me go. Danielle is eighteen, they can't stop her from going. \"I can go.\" Danielle said. \"They can't really stop me.\" Ritchie looked at me. \"I want to go. I just doubt Mom or Dad will let me.\" \"My parents won't care.\" So, Laney and Danielle were going. \"I'll probably be able to go if Dev does.\" The conversation stopped after that and I soon fell asleep with my head on Richie's chest, his arms wrapped around me. \"Devon!\" I heard my Mom's voice. \"Five more minutes.\" I snuggled back into my pillow. Wait, my pillow moved. Oh! Last night's events came rushing back to me. \"Sorry we stayed down here. We fell asleep.\" \"It's alright, Dev.\" \"Mom, can I talk to you?\" I asked as I gently detangled Ritchie's arms. \"Sure, honey. You can come to me with anything.\" \"Last night, the guys asked us to come on tour with them. Can we go? Please?\" \"I don't know, honey. Is Danielle going?\" \"She says you can't stop her.\" \"Then, I'm okay with it. But you need to keep your grades up, call weekly, and sleep in either a room with a lot of people, or without Ritchie.\" \"Deal.\" \"I'll talk to your father. Don't mention it to him. Now, go back to bed. I know, it's Tuesday, but you could use more sleep.\" I nodded and went back to my boyfriend. He looked at me, now awake. \"Go back to sleep. Mom says I can go, but she has to talk to Dad and I have to keep my grades up.\" \"There's a tutor.\" I nodded and cuddled back into his arms before going back to dreamland. I woke up at noon to Gabby's gentle shaking. \"Your parents didn't get mad that we stayed down here?\" \"No. I think they expected it.\" \"Are you going to ask them if you can go on tour?\" \"I asked Mom. She said I could as long as I kept my grades up and called every week.\" \"Your dad?\" \"She's going to ask him for me.\" Gabby nodded. \"I hope you can go. Because my parents will let me go if you do.\" \"Want to wake the guys up?\" \"What do you have in mind?\" \"Scream.\" \"On three.\" \"One, two, three…AHHHH!!!\" We said at the same time. Ritchie jumped, Mason screamed, Scooter barely looked up. KK and Nikolai slept through it. Danielle looked up and glared at me. \"What the hell, Dev?\" Mason asked. \"We were bored.\" I reached over to peck Ritchie on the lips, but he grabbed my waist and deepened the kiss. I pulled back with a smile before reaching over and taking his hand in mine. I took one of his two rings off and put it on my own finger. \"I'm stealing this. Hope you don't care. If you do, oh well.\" He smirked. \"I don't care.\" Mom walked in and smiled at us. \"Alright, I talked to your father.\" He came in behind her, his face impassive. \"We have a few questions.\" I nodded for them to continue. \"Is there a tutor?\" \"Yes. We have to study a certain number of hours each day.\" Mason answered. \"Sleeping arrangements?\" \"There are several couches on the bus, but we stay in hotels for the night.\" \"Parental supervision?\" \"We see our parents from time to time. They come visit. But Hollis is always there, along with our bodyguard.\" \"Okay, Devon. You can go, but we have a few conditions. First, you keep your grades up. Second, you need to call us weekly. Third, you can't stay in a room alone with Ritchie. You may sleep in the same room as him, but only with other people there.\" \"I accept!\" I said. \"You can leave Saturday, though. The band has a concert here that night, so you can finish the week at school and pack for the year and a half you will be gone.\" \"Thank you!\" I yelled as I hugged my parents. They laughed. \"It looks like everybody can go.\" The week passed quickly and soon it was time to leave. We packed all of our stuff and headed to tonight's concert. We had a surprise too. \"Alright, guys, tonight, we have a special thing for you! As you know, we played at Highland High earlier this week. So, I'd like you all to meet my girlfriend, Devon Thompson!\" I walked on stage. He handed me a microphone. \" I remember what you wore on our first date. You came into my life and I thought 'hey, You know this could be something.' Cuz everything you do and words you say. You know that it all takes my breath away And now I'm left with nothing.\" I sang on my cue and the song ended to applause. \"Now that our final concert in Highland is over we'd like to introduce a few people who are coming along with us on tour. Gabby Davis, would you come out?\" Gabs walked on stage and took Mason's hand. \"Gabby is my girlfriend.\" \"Danielle Thompson.\" Danielle wrapped her arms around Scooter's waist. \"Laney Fox.\" \"And many of you already know my girlfriend, Ava Williams.\" A girl I didn't know, but knew of walked on stage and stood next to KK. We walked back to the bus and found my parents. \"Oath time.\" I rolled my eyes, but raised my right hand anyway. The group did the same. \"I swear…\" \"I swear…\" \"to keep my grades up,\" \"to keep my grades up,\" \"call all the time,\" \"call all the time,\" \"And never stay alone with a member of the opposite sex.\" \"And never stay alone with a member of the opposite sex.\" \"Have fun!\" \"Bye, Mom.\" \"I love you, honey.\" I hugged my mother and then got into the van. I sat next to Ritchie on a couch. He gently ran his fingers through my hair. I fell asleep to the comforting feel of his fingers in my hair. \"Dev, wake up.\" Ritchie whispered in my ear. \"No.\" I moaned. \"Yes…\" \"Grr…\" He grabbed my hand and pulled me up. \"What time is it?\" \"Eight. We have to be at the studio now, but we are here.\" \"I'm not even dressed!\" \"Dev, they have a stylist.\" He wasn't dressed either. \"Alright. Let's go.\" He grabbed my hand and pulled me out the door. We headed into the studio. First, we got dressed. Ritchie was wearing his usual clothes, but I was dressed up. She put me in a blue strapless dress with a light pink sweater. My hair was pulled up and light makeup added. Pink flats were shoved onto my feet. Then we went to meet Carly. \"Hi! I'm Carly Jordan!\" \"Devon.\" \"Nice to meet you, Devon. And you are obviously Ritchie.\" The introductions went fast and it was soon show time. The boys went out first. \"Hello, everybody! And welcome to The Carly Jordan Show! Today, we have several very awesome guests! To start out with, I'd like to welcome 5 Leo Rise!\" She's cold and she's cruel, But she knows what she's doing. She pushed me in the pool At our last school reunion She laughs at my dreams But I dream about her laughter Strange as it seems, She's the one I'm after.\" They finished 'Just the Girl' and sat down. \"So, boys, I hear you all have girlfriends at this time.\" \"We do.\" Ritchie said with a smile. \"Are they here?\"She's cold and she's cruel But she knows what she's doin' She pushed me in the pool At our last school reunion She laughs at my dreams But I dream about her laughter Strange as it seems She's the one I'm afterShe's cold and she's cruel But she knows what she's doin' She pushed me in the pool At our last school reunion She laughs at my dreams But I dream about her laughter Strange as it seems She's the one I'm after \"They are.\" \"Well, do you want to bring them out so all your fans can meet them?\" \"Sure.\" \"Well then, ladies come on out!\" I walked on stage at my cue and sat down by Ritchie. He grabbed my hand and started playing with my fingers. \"Alright, Ritchie, you go first.\" \"Alright, this is my girlfriend, Devon Thompson.\" \"How long have you two known each other?\" \"A week and a few days.\" I answered. \"How did you meet?\" \"She went to Friday's signing and convinced us to play at her school.\" \"Now, you sung at their concert last night. Any plans to do it professionally?\" \"Not really. Ritchie wanted to do a duet and I agreed. It may happen again, but not too often.\" \"Any plans for the future?\" \"We've been dating for less than a week. We'll see what happens.\" \"Okay, now, do you in the crowd have any questions for Ritchie and Devon?\" Several people raised their hands. \"Is that Ritchie's ring on your hand?\" I laughed, embarrassed. \"Yeah. I kind of stole it. I'm not really planning on giving it back.\" \"Will you two sing for us?\" I looked at Ritchie. He shrugged. \"We didn't prepare anything, but we'll try our best.\" (AN : Ritchie , Devon , Both ) \" I saw her today at the reception A glass of wine in her hand Oh I knew she was gonna meet her connection At her feet was a footloose man No, you can't always get what you want (Oh no no you can't) You can't always get what you want (What you want) You can't always get what you want (You can't always get what you want) But if you try sometimes well you just might find You get what you need You get what you need And I went down to the demonstration To get my fair share of abuse Singing, \"We're gonna vent our frustration If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse\" Sing it to me now...

We have time for one last question.\" \"Have you kissed yet?\" We grinned slyly. \"Maybe.\" \"Why don't you kiss for us?\" Carly asked. I rolled my eyes and pressed my lips to Ritchie's for a few seconds. \"Alright, now for Mason.\" \"I'm Gabby!\" They asked the same basic questions for all of the others and they had to kiss as well. Soon, it was time for us to get back on the road.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: Touring With the Band It's day six for the tour and we are all really tired. I should sleep more. We've been staying on the bus, but tonight we are going to a hotel. The concert is usually the same, but I love their music, so I don't care. We've even met some ridiculous fans. \"Dev!\" \"What?\" \"We're here.\" I rolled my eyes, but went to meet Gabby anyway. The others were out there and I wrapped my arm around Ritchie's waist. He put his over my shoulder. We checked in, the boys had to sign autographs, and headed up to our rooms. We were separated tonight. The room was your basic hotel room, but was for Gabby and I. Danielle was sharing with Laney, Ava with KK, Ritchie and Mason, and Nikolai with Scooter. We dragged our suitcases to our rooms and found two boxes on the bed. They were traditional in the mail boxes, but a bit larger. I opened the one that said 'Devin.' There were several books and movies, along with a letter and another box. There were also several candy items. I opened the letter. Devin, We love you and miss you. The books are to entertain you for the ride. Send them back home once you are finished, we will keep them here for you. The other box is a cell phone. We decided you should have a new one. The credit card is to buy anything you need. Clothes, books, movies, food, anything. Feel free to use it. The boys will take care of you. For some reason, I trust them. I know that, in time, they will begin to feel like family to you girls. If you decide to take one of their unplanned vacations, just let me know, so I don't worry. I can tell that you and Ritchie will go places. You obviously love him. Just be careful, my daughter. Don't forget your oath. As long as nothing you aren't ready for doesn't happen, you can stay near the boys all the time. I trust you. And them. Continue to study when you should and call often. I love you, Mom I whipped out my new cell phone and called my house. \"Mom!\" \"Hello, Devin. I miss you, honey.\" \"I miss you too, Mom.\" \"How's it going?\" \"It's great. I love being around them all so much. It's tiring, though. We have stayed on the bus since we left and it's hard to sleep on there. Ritchie's helped though.\" \"You've been sleeping in his arms, haven't you?\" \"Um…maybe?\" \"It's okay, honey. I don't care. Now, I'm going to let you go. Your dad isn't home. You can sleep in Ritchie's room, but I'm sure he's sharing with Mason, so bring Gabby along.\" \"Okay, Mom. Thanks! I love you.\" \"Love you too, honey.\"I hung up the phone and looked at Gabs. She also had a box full of stuff for her to do. \"Come on, Gabs.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"To Ritchie and Mason's room.\" \"But…\" \"Mom said we could.\" She grinned and grabbed a pillow. We headed to the adjoining door and knocked. \"Hey, Danielle, let us in.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I called Mom.\" \"About?\" \"The box. And she said we could sleep in the same room as the guys, so we are going to their room.\" \"Come on, Lane. You probably should come too.\" Danielle followed us out their door, taking care to grab a key. We crossed the hall and knocked on separate doors. Mason answered. He stepped aside to let us in and closed the door behind me. I, of course, sat next to Ritchie and took his hand. \"You know, Dev, my finger feels kind of naked now.\" \"You aren't getting the ring back. You can buy a new one, I don't care, but you aren't getting this one back.\" He smirked and took it off my finger. \"Richard Thomas Tressiak, give it back.\" He flinched at the use of his full name and handed me back the ring. \"Is anyone else hungry?\" Mason asked. \"I am!\" Gabby said. Honestly, I think she pretty much agrees with everything he says. \"I could go for food.\" Ritchie just nodded. We walked downstairs through the hotel and screaming fans, met up with the others, and headed out for food. We decided on tacos and, surprisingly, KK was the only one who got one thrown at him. We headed back to the room. I could tell Ritchie was deep in thought. \"Can you guys all come to our room?\" He asked quietly. They agreed and we sat down. I linked my arm through his, sensing he needed the support. \"I think it's time everybody knew the full story. At least all of you.\" \"What about Hollis?\" \"Mase, go get him, please.\" When Hollis and Mason returned, Ritchie prepared to speak again. \"Devin, why don't you start?\" I nodded. \"Gabby and I had been collecting labels for weeks. We had roughly 520,000. Everything was fine and then I accidently set them on fire, along with Kira's hair. We were the losers of the school, or as Gabs put it, we had social cancer. We decided to see the band and try to convince them to play anyway. They were kind of sarcastic and mean about it, so we decided to kidnap them.\" \"So there really was a kidnapping?\" \"Hollis, shut up. Let us finish the story.\" Scooter interjected. \"The plan was working until we got there. Your bodyguard quickly disarmed us, and Gabby passed out. It was all Mason's fault. Anyway, we were discouraged and then we went to stop and Winger's and you got into our limo by mistake.\" \"You want me to take it from here?\" Ritchie asked. I nodded. \"They made us put on hats, said there was a bomb, and that the limo driver was dead. Then we switched cars and they left KK. We went to Dev's house and sat in the basement. That's when we realized that Nikolai wasn't there and we lost KK. The next morning, Mason and Scooter escaped. When they caught them, I had to say, that my name was 'Richard Tressiak' and I was a 'total loser wuss who needs his ass kicked.' The other two had to say similar things. Then, we found out who it was and Mason and Scooter agreed to sing, but I didn't. Lincoln, Pete, Mason, and Scooter threw eggs at me. Devin came down, dressed as the Velvet Raven and fed me banana cream pie. Then she wiped the egg off. I told her that I couldn't do the concert. She asked why. So I told her and Gabby that I couldn't sing in public.\" The band was shocked. Well, those that didn't already know. \"But you sang at the concert.\" \"I'm getting to that part! Everybody dressed up in costumes and I was trying, but something would happen every time. Then I went to the basement and grabbed a guitar, started playing Kidnap My Heart. Devin was coming to talk to me and heard. She convinced me to try again and it worked. I could sing. Then, Gabs and Lincoln came in. Lincoln took me away and tied me to a tree. I met you at school the next morning.\" \"I'll get the rest. Gabby was yelling at Dev for being pushy and she left. Scooter and I went to talk to Devin and Lincoln came back, without Ritchie. She yelled at him and he left again, to bring him back. We called Pete with the equipment and then went to bed. That's what really happened.\" \"You should've pressed charges.\" \"Shut it, Hollis. They helped us and didn't do anything to us. If anything, they deserve awesome points for being awesome. Ritchie can now sing. And besides, how would it look if Ritchie threw his own girlfriend in jail?\" Scooter added. \"Alright, well, go to bed. You have a signing tomorrow.\" The next morning, I threw on my purple skinny jeans and Converse along with a t-shirt. My hair was left down and we were ready to go. The fans were…hectic. It was pretty funny. Then, one girl struck a heartstring. \"Can you come sing for us? It was entirely my fault.\" A sweet girl asked. \"How was it your fault?\" \"I dumped food on the popular girl's clothes. She got mad and now everybody is being mean to me and my friends.\" \"We'd love to, but it's not possible.\" I could tell that it was really upsetting the band. It was really close to my story with Gabby. I put my hand on Ritchie's shoulder for support. \"It depends on when it is.\" \"Tuesday?\" \"We can't. We leave on Sunday, so we'll be gone.\" KK said. \"I have an idea. Can we go tomorrow instead?\" Gabby asked. \"That would be fantastic! Thank you so much! Oh, and can Devin and Ritchie do a song? You two are just so cute together!\" \"Thanks!\" We said at the same time. \"Just give us instructions on how to get there and we will meet you. Oh, by the way, Ritchie and Dev, that's really creepy.\" Mason concluded. She nodded and wrote them down, handing it to Ritchie. \"I'm Isabel.\" \"Nice to meet you, Isabel. You probably know who we all are.\" \"I do. Thank you!\" She walked out then. Our third duet went awesome before we headed back out to the hall to sign autographs. This time they wanted mine too. It was odd. Then, we were gone again. This pattern would keep for the next year and a half. Signings, concerts, and music. Ritchie and I were closer than ever and eventually madly in love.[Chapter 3] I have a few announcements to make. Please read, it's important. One- I would like to profusely apologize for not updating in a while. I've decided to go back and update some of my older stories that I haven't updated in forever. I'm actually currently working on Unexpected Occurrences. Two- I read an awesome book this weekend. It's called Hearts at Stake by Alyxandra Harvey. If you like vampires at all, read it. Then write Fanfiction because there are only two and that's depressing me. I like can't even express how much I love it. I've already convinced two people to read it, my sister Gummyworm3 and my new Fanfiction friend Romanceluver91. Because I'm such a nice person I'll even type up the summary on the back of the book. Nicholas smirked at me, easing languidly out of the shadows, totally invading my personal space. I hated that he was so handsome, with his tousled dark hair and his serious expression. There was something else in his expression suddenly, something slightly wicked. I took a step back, wondering why my stomach felt so funny. He advanced and I backed away, until I bumped into the log wall of the house. I remembered, too late, Solange's simplest warning about vampires: if you ran, they chased. It was just in their nature. Solange has always known she will become a vampire on her sixteenth birthday. And as the only female vampire born, not made, she is surrounded by danger. When she is kidnapped, it is up to her older brother Nicholas and her human best friend, Lucy, to save her. But can Lucy first save herself from Nicholas, who tempts her with every look? And what will Solange's own fate be if she surrenders her heart to the vampire hunter who has become her surprising ally against the bloodthirsty ruling class at the royal court? It's in the point of view of Solange and Lucy, so you can see what's happening in both locations. It's amazing. Seriously, read it. Three- I'm also writing one of those. It would be hypocritical to tell you guys to and not do it myself. But I may wait to have a few chapters before I post it, like I did with The Warren Line. Four- Feel free to vote on what stories you think I should update next. I'll put a poll on my profile or you can just review. I will try to listen, but I will also try to write as the inspiration comes to me. My life is currently swamped and I've had little time to concentrate on writing. Five- I'm also trying to work on my original story. I lost the first chapter, so I need to restart it entirely. I will post it on once I've gotten a few chapters written. Six- I've decided to start carrying a notebook around, to jot down things when they come to me. This should help with the updating process. ","Summary":" Chapter One: Seriously?

I stared up at the sun, my blood now staining the dusty ground beneath me. I should have never come to Sierra Leone; I should have never let Yuri rope me into this. I'd given up gun trading, I'd given up cocaine. All I'd wanted to do was get my life back on track. It was all Yuri's fault, with his glorified talk of riches, political security and 'brothers in arms'. No, it was my fault: I let myself get caught up in the idea. I had become way too carried away with the idea and (let's face it) I more than enjoyed taking a different girl home every night. I was nearly safe, nearly on the right path but then Yuri pulled out the old 'brother' card and I went running. The drugs were a mistake; I should have never started but that white powder was too tempting. It was just there... and besides, Yuri said they needed to celebrate. I could really do with a snort right now: the holes in his abdomen hurt like hell. No, I was clean. I hadn't touched any coke in ages. I didn't need it anymore. I would if Yuri hadn't stepped in and shipped me off to rehab. I had resisted, struggled against my brother to try and convince him to take me home instead of forcing me into that place. However, I was clean now so it was worth going through hell. Yuri was a good brother after all, even if he didn't always act like one. I blinked; the sun was harsh against my eyes. I would never get married, never have children. I feel like a failure compared to Yuri. My brother had a beautiful, supermodel wife, a son- the heir to his small fortune that bought them expensive cars and a large house in the city. All I had was a history of drug abuse, prostitutes who had probably contracted multiple STIs and no cooking talent whatsoever. Yuri had always said my borsht was a pile of shit. It hurt to know that I wouldn't ever see home again. I missed the greasy little cafe on the outskirts of town, even if business wasn't the best. Why did I become so infatuated with money when I could settle for a low income salary as a cook? I suppose that 'illegal gun runner' had a better ring to it than 'underpaid chef'. It was more exciting, never knowing when the authorities would catch up with them. There'd been near misses, like the incident with the 'Kristol' but the rush of nearly being caught filled me with adrenaline, a high that was nearly as good as drugs. But seeing that kid, that defenceless little child who was the same age as Nicky… it was too much for me. I had to step in, I had to put a stop to all the murder and rape and torment in these villages. Well, what do you know? Even if I was a gun-trading druggie I actually had a moral compass after all. I knew I was being reckless when I walked over to the merchandise. I knew it, I wasn't thinking straight. I'd picked up a hand-grenade, contemplating my next move and I realised that I was being watched. I sensed that his gun was on me and my heart rate quickened. I was perfectly aware that I was breaking the cardinal rule of gun-running: never pick up a gun and join the customers. \"What are you doing?\" he said. \"Something for Yuri\" I had reassured him, knowing full well that if Yuri knew what I was doing he would object. \"Step away, slow\" replied the man and I did as I was told, knowing that if I refused I would die. I realise now it was kind of pointless worrying about that. I turned around and struck him with the crowbar in my hand, my heart now racing faster than ever. As I threw one of the grenades I had grabbed into the cargo truck, I knew I was being foolish but the genocide had to stop. I had ran as fast as I could, trying to get away and a few seconds later I'd heard the explosion behind me. \"Yes!\" I thought \"One to go…\" I heard Yuri yelling after me. \"No, Vi!\" he shouted. I felt sorry for him in a way. He'd always had to look out for me, keeping an eye on my next move. \"Sorry brother\" I had thought \"I have to do this otherwise I couldn't live with myself.\" The terrain felt hard beneath my feet as I raced to the next truck, my breath catching a little in my throat. I had panicked as I heard the all too familiar sound of a gun being prepared for use behind me. I wasn't going to make it. The soldier opened fire on me and in a split second, his bullets pierced my flesh. It was agony, even worse than going through withdrawal symptoms in rehab. I realised when I was crawling in the dirt that I had been reduced to the dog I was so scared of becoming. I collapsed onto my back, now determined to end the tyranny of this country. With shaking hands, I pulled the pin on the grenade, not caring that I would end my life. To me, I had died a long time ago. I wasn't living… I was leading a pathetic existence as the fuck-up I always was. As long as I died as a martyr I would be happy. Yuri stood over me, looking down on me as he always did. He forced the grenade out from between my fingers and put the pin back in its rightful place, stopping it from blowing the place up. I could have punched him, or at least swore at him but I couldn't muster up the strength. Even my last attempt at turning my life around failed. Fucking Yuri was always ruining everything. I remember when we were kids back in Ukraine and he used to always pick me up when I was down. I wish we could go back to that, but now it was too late. I was dying; I knew it. The African sun shone down on me, feeling hot against my skin and burning my eyes. \"Just let me go\" I thought \"There's no use for me anymore. I'm pathetic.\" Goodbye, Yuri… ","Summary":" Vitaly Reflects. I stared up at the sun, my blood now staining the dusty ground beneath me.

For some reason, they had to look good on the outside. Don't even ask me why. They certainly weren't going to be used for display purposes in the coming days. \"I'll take them,\" he says. Like I was gonna let him say no. You don't bust through every arms embargo like washi paper just so the guy at the other end can turn you around. You just don't. Like I always say about the trade: Always have a fool-proof way to get paid. Otherwise you're no better than the corner-street merchant trying to sell bootleg videos. The pedestrians can say no, you shrug it off and go back to business. It doesn't work that way with gun-running. He sets the gun down and signals to one of his men in a language I didn't understand. Most of these jobs can go over with me just nodding my head to whatever they say. It's not something I suggest, but when you're in a hurry… A man from outside the room brings in a briefcase full of money. I go over it and make sure it's the agreed amount. It is, so I carefully lock the suitcase up and start heading towards the door. With the exchange rate the way it was, I'd be getting a healthy profit for ten-thousand rifles that'd be wasting away in some other country's back-yard. In the end, most of the money that came out of my pocket was shipping and handling. \"Meester Orlov,\" said the man, standing up from his desk. I've seen that look before. He thinks he's just got a good deal. He nods his head and makes some kind of salute with his hand. I nod back to him out of respect. \"Thank you,\" I say and I head towards the door again. Suddenly I'm on the ground. I feel this immense heat pressing up against my back and rubble and dust begins to envelope me while I'm on the floor wondering what the hell happened. I pick my head up and turn back towards the man's desk—briefcase still in my hand, by the way—and the whole room is gone. Nothing there. Where he and his desk used to be was just a point in the sky above the other floors of the building. When the ringing in my ears died down, I heard the screeching of tires from down below. Someone had reason to get away rather quickly. They were more than likely the people who just blew up my customer. Must have been an RPG, shot from the roof across the street. Thinking back, my customer had a lot of enemies, most were all talk and no action. Only one particular group who would have the balls to try something like this. Normally, they'd be all talk too, unless they had the necessary tools that I may or may not have sold for five-thousand a piece. It figures. I have this thing about selling to two large groups in the same country. I really try not to, but if the price is right, I'm willing to make exceptions. Now I'm thinking I should take that thought more seriously. Now, of all times, when I nearly get killed by a weapon that I just sold less than a day ago. No good, I thought to myself as I stood up in the cloud of dust and gazed at the smoldering rubble that at one point housed my client. No good at all. I know, I know. I could sit here and point out the facts and laugh all day about the irony of the situation too. But, seriously, this really made me think about things. Never since that power-tripping drug lord have I been injured or even been close to being injured by my own stuff. That's the most important rule of gun-running: Never get shot with your own merchandise. Otherwise, it kinda makes business a tad monotonous and, not to mention, painful. Takes all the fun out of it really… But in all honesty, I couldn't help but smile at the whole affair. Just as a man in the spray paint industry must look at graffiti and wonder if the vandals had used his brand, I was feeling pretty giddy about my guns getting around. Not that I approve of graffiti… ","Summary":" Lord of War \"The Most Important Rule of Gun-Running\" The guy shifted the M-16 assault rifle—a gas"},{"Movie":"Lord of War","Title":"War's A Business","Author":"EternalKnight219","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4787553","Passage":"[Chapter 1] War's a Buisness \"In the world, therenare over 100 million firearms in circulation.

It doesn't particularly feature any of the major or minor characters from \"Lord of War\" but is set within the fictional universe of that film. The main character here is actually an OC from another film, \"Good Bye, Lenin!\". I made up a twin brother for its protagonist, Alex Kerner, and had enough fun doing it that I decided to write a story about them both in the universe of \"Lord of War\". Hans Kerner stared out at the beach in front of him and the sea beyond, watching the tide come in. He was not alone out here. Behind tall grass and sand dunes, from key points at the grand, expansive house about one hundred yards away, elite private security kept watch. Behind scopes and cutting-edge optics, trained marksmen and bodyguards surveyed their boss, and the entire surrounding area. Not a single car, boat, plane, swimmer or lost tourist could come anywhere near this beach without being noticed. If a threat was detected, the boss would be immediately surrounded by his protectors and moved to safety, and the threat would be dealt with as needed. Additionally, if Hans indicated he needed them, his guards would be there immediately. But for now, when all was well, Hans could pretend he was alone. The illusion could be maintained. The guards were well-paid, and Hans knew every single one of them by name and by face, as did his chief of security. Shifts were constantly being switched around, ensuring that even if anyone managed to get to and corrupt a handful of guards, no plot could be carried out because the participants would by then be working different shifts. And there wasn't a single man among those armed with a sniper rifle that Hans did not personally know and trust. But that was subject to constant revision- Hans made sure he had guards he could respect, but he never let himself like them so much that he assumed anything about them. Ever the commando, Hans was always watching, always ready. It was getting late in the afternoon, but summertime and clear skies promised it would be a while before the sun's light faded out completely. Behind a pair of Brooks Brothers sunglasses, Hans watched the waves advancing and receding, and his son, Martin, cheerful and naïve- as you'd expect him to be at six years old- playing with some shells. Well, that and trying to bother the mole crabs again. The little burrowing creatures fascinated Martin, and while he never harmed them- Hans expressly forbade violence without a point- he was always eager to find them, catch them and examine them, and then observe them as they swiftly burrowed back into the wet sand after he put them down. Living on- owning- Scrub Island, part of the Republic of Anguilla- Hans had all the scenic shores he'd ever wanted. Martin and his nine-year-old brother Lukas- who was behind Hans, taking some time off from watching Martin to do a series of pushups and situps- loved the island, and the mansion their father had built on it. It was beautiful, fitting any number of artists' and novelists' depictions of paradise. The house, worth so many millions but utterly beyond financial terms when you looked at the art, literature, and sheer beauty that had been built and assembled there, was Hans' pride and joy. And why not? He had earned all the money that went into it, and a best friend and comrade in arms of his had designed it. Once a soldier of socialism, a paratrooper and air assault specialist in the vanished country the Americans called \"East Germany\", Hans now was his own boss in the best possible way. He owned four boats, several planes on his own airstrip here on Scrub Island, and a mansion that was the envy of the Caribbean. Hans owned twenty cars, among them some of the finest and most expensive cars in the world- a far cry from his old life, where his family had needed to wait ten years just to order a single Trabant, the DDR's only working-class automobile. Hans cherished the memory of his homeland, as he did the memory of his mother. But he also cherished the wonderful joys and privileges he had come to know- and, more important, that he had been able to provide for his sons. From the day they had been born, the boys had known nothing but the very finest of what life could offer them, bowing respectfully as it did so. Hans would tolerate nothing less. \"Das beste oder nichts,\" the automotive genius Gottlieb Daimler had said, in the beautiful language which Hans had taught the boys all by himself, even as he taught them English and perfected his own. It meant \"The best or nothing\" and Hans behaved as if life owed nothing short of that to himself, or his sons. They would not know the deprived and modest life their father had known growing up, and as a soldier. They did not need to. Their father had sacrificed and labored, watched, worked and built, all on their behalf. They would have doors opening to them wherever they turned. But the grandeur of his life, the one he had been building ever since his career in the Land Forces of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic had ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany in 1990, had not softened Hans Kerner. Not at all. Having once passed through a military selection course which some eight-to-ten-percent of hundreds of annual applicants survived, having spent years keeping his body in peak physical condition to be ready to fight as a warrior of his country, Hans had never forgotten the habits and the lifestyle he had learned. He still awoke early in the morning, long before the sun rose. He still went to bed early in the night. And he still looked like one of the old Greek statues, every muscle chiseled to perfection. Hans had a rifle range out here on Scrub Island, where he practiced multiple times a week and was already training the boys. He continued to practice judo and karate, as he had in the Land Forces, and was teaching the boys those things as well. While he looked and even acted more like a corporate CEO these days than a soldier, Hans still maintained the strenuous and active physical life of one. It would never leave him, no matter what he did. And that was exactly how Hans wanted it. Go into the world of business after having his army career and his mother taken? Sure. Make a stunning success of that business and continue to run it with flawless military precision and constant, never-ceasing vigilance? Absolutely. But get fat, lazy and sloppy, get careless and un-alert, just because he was a success? Never. XX There was no question that Hans had made a success of himself; not in his mind, or in anyone's. Whether his actions were entirely legal, ethical- there some people disagreed. But Hans had made his way in the world. Fate had seen fit to take Hans' army, his country and his mother from him. It had revealed to him that his mother had lied for years- Robert Kerner had not abandoned his family, but fled to the West anticipating that his wife and children would follow. Fate had conspired to put Hans together with his twin brother Alex and their older sister Ariane, as the three of them fought to hide Germany's coming reunification from their mother, to spare her the shock. They'd done it, but Christiane Kerner had passed away just two days before official reunification in 1990. It was a bittersweet experience for Hans, getting to pretend the DDR was alive and well and that he was serving in a strong military force at peace, with reunification and the dissolution of the NVA so close at hand. There had been no chance of staying in the new German Army. Reunification, it was called, but the reality was the West came in and took over the East. The German Democratic Republic and all its institutions was swiftly disbanded, and in his final days in the service, Hans, a proud and skilled warrior, was reduced to assisting a bunch of common West German soldiers as they counted and inventoried all the weapons and equipment of the Luftsturmregiment 40 \"Willi Sänger\". That had been the greatest infantry unit in the DDR, and its members spent their last days in the military counting their own gear before the West Germans gave it away or just blew it up. That had been the Wessies' plan, anyway. In the last days before their discharge, Oberstleutnant Kurt Steiner, the brilliant and greatly admired commander of Hans' battalion, approached a handful of his men with a plan. With his enthusiastic help and encouragement, Hans and the three men he led as an Unteroffizier, equivalent to a corporal- Wilhelm Forst, Dietrich Schäfer, Martin Kranz and Günther Vollmer- gathered about twenty-six other men, almost all of their platoon, including Oberleutnant Neumann. The deal was simple. The paratroopers would take a few 'borrowed' trucks marked up as Polish Army, drive to the armory that a whole lot of East German firearms and gear were still being counted at, and make off with as much as they could under the guise of 'picking up' a shipment intended for donation to Poland. The West Germans were visibly eager to get rid of anything 'tainted' by the Reds, the dirty communists. They would be glad to have someone show up and take a load of the stuff off their hands. Added to that was the bonus of a heavy rain that came down on the night of the heist. The guards at the gate were so disgruntled about even being there, guarding warehouses full of East German \"junk\", that they barely even glanced at the false papers that Hans had worked with Oberleutnant Neumann to create. The men were waved through, loaded up the trucks with steady efficiency, and drove off into the night in record time. All in all, they took over a thousand small arms, most of which were the world-famous Kalashnikov 47s and 74s. Also taken were grenades, gas masks, land mines and rocket-propelled grenades and launchers, bayonets and magazines. but most of all, they stole Kalashnikovs, the best kind of rifle in the world. Upon driving to Poland, the thirty men of the 40th sold their cargo to a buyer who had been reached through a few friends of Oberst Steiner. They sold it all and landed a handsome profit in American dollars. Oberst Steiner had insisted on that currency, knowing full well that East German marks were about to be worthless and the other Eastern currencies were no better. His prudence in ensuring the men all got a fair deal meant they would all reap the benefits they deserved. It was his final thank-you to his men, Steiner's way of both showing his appreciation for their years of hard work under his command and getting back at the West for sending a bunch of clerks to take away everything he had worked for decades to maintain. With that, the men had scattered. Hans, Wilhelm, Dietrich, and Martin had taken their neatly typed up discharge papers, generously handed to them in advance of the actual discharge date, and headed west. After stopping in Switzerland so each man could deposit his money in a numbered bank account, the young commandos had made their way to Paris, and enlisted with the French Foreign Legion. They swiftly passed through training and were assigned to the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment. In 1991 they saw their first deployment, evacuating French citizens and certain other foreign nationals in Rwanda, Gabon and Zaire. In 1992 they went to Somalia, seeing action on the sidelines of the civil war there as they protected French citizens and interests. In 1993 the four troopers were shipped to Sarajevo, and in 1994 they went to Rwanda again. The genocide there, which was estimated to have resulted in the deaths of between 500,000 and 1.3 million Tutsi Rwandans and moderate Hutus at the hands of Hutu extremists, was the most horrific and infuriating thing Hans and his fellow ex-NVA troopers had ever witnessed. Heavily armed, ready and willing to fight against any odds, Hans and the other paratroopers found themselves forbidden to engage. Unless the extremists attacked the French evacuation columns, the soldiers had strict orders to do nothing. The citizens they were evacuating were their concern, the orders said- anyone else was on their own. As he rode and marched through that shattered country, Hans had done what little he was able to. He gave away food, left behind water. He and his men allowed small numbers of refugees to travel under their protection, or to hide out at the edge of the Legion's perimeter, knowing full well that the Hutus would not attack people so close to a powerful neutral force. Whenever the chance came, Hans helped the victims of the massacres unfolding in front of him. But it was all drops in the bucket compared to what was needed. Never, ever would a few small acts by one man and a few who agreed with him be enough. After years of training and preparing to fight, and after getting to in a select few engagements during the interventions he was sent to be involved in, Hans found himself bound and unable to act when his skills were needed most. That massacre had been preventable. The Legion alone could have stopped it. But the government of France had passed on the opportunity. Having gotten to taste the thrill of combat enough times to know there'd be more if he stayed, Hans nonetheless was disillusioned enough that he left when his five years were up. He was let out as a Caporal-Chef, a senior corporal, and once again took his friends from East Germany as they headed onward. Hans briefly debated going home, but realized once again that there was nothing there that much interested him. He disliked the West Germans and did not much want to see them continue to take over what had been his country. He did not want to come back, apply for a job in the military or police, and find himself distrusted and disrespected because he was former East German Army, because he had a record of being a good communist. After years of being distrusted by the East Berlin government because he was the son of a defector, Hans had no desire to put up with being distrusted by the idiots from Bonn. Besides, the travel and excitement associated with life in the Legion, the chance to regularly see far-off and exotic lands, to fuck beautiful women of every skin color, and to be as independent as you could be in government service, was coming to have a lure all of its own. Having grown tired of serving masters he did not trust or respect under a socialist and a capitalist flag, Hans had made a risky, scary, and intoxicatingly exciting decision. He had chosen to go into business for himself. His ex-squadmates became his partners, and Hans set about this new venture with fierce determination. Over the past ten years, Hans had taken that half a million Marks he'd landed from the arms sale in Germany and multiplied it a thousand-fold. He had gone from a newcomer to one of the most lucrative underground trade businesses in the world to one of its foremost innovators and entrepreneurs. Hans and four other ex-paratroopers had designed what was still the best damn private-market diesel-electric submarine out there and improved on it several times. That was the core of his success, the place where he continued to generate most of the fortune he had coming in every single month of every single year. In the 1980s, the drug smuggling business was centered around go-fast boats. Whoever had the fastest boat was the winner. Easy enough, but as radar coverage of the waters between Columbia and the United States and Mexico got better, and government agents caught on to the trade of chasing down these boats, the game changed. The cartel bosses soon began to realize that the future of moving cocaine lay under the waves, not on them. As they were starting to develop what were now called narco-submarines, Hans and his team had come along and made an offer to some of them. Hans had pitched a business proposal, one that was simple and straightforward. In exchange for thirty percent of the profits yielded by every shipment, Hans would provide them with the means to build a true diesel-electric cargo submarine, able to move ten tons of product and run almost totally silent when it went all-electric. The boat promised to run faster, deeper, and quieter than anything else out there. It promised a vast profit and remarkably little risk. In a time when the average narco-sub was not even close to fully submersible yet, this was a damned good deal. More than one of the bosses had taken Hans' offer. He had also gotten something else he'd wanted in return for his submarine design- partner status in their operation. Hans proved an adept strategist, able to help devise better ways to evade government forces and officials. He and his team continued to improve their submarine design, and survived a few run-ins with men sent by rivals, and escaped capture by police or some navy more than once. Hans also made damn sure he counted his money every time, and that no one was skimming off the top. But he was too smart to just go get the money himself, or to have it delivered here. Instead, Hans used a dead-drop and agents. The cartel would come by the specified location and leave the money, and later, one of Hans' men picked it up while others made certain no one- cartel or government- was watching or waiting for them. Additionally, the agents were delivery men- they did not know Hans or much of anything about him, making them next to useless if they had ever tried to turn state's evidence or been swayed by an unfriendly cartel. The past ten years had seen Hans find and lose what might have been true love. Ilse, a German model and photographer whose intellect had been as stunning as her beauty, had fallen for Hans as hard as he'd fallen for her when they'd met on a cruise ship plying the Caribbean years ago. She had bought all of Hans' lies about what he did for a living, which was no small feat. Had they been any less skillfully-constructed, any less authentic in how they sounded and appeared, she would not have believed him. She certainly wouldn't have let Hans father their first child in 1996, and then their second in 1999, if she hadn't believed him. But Hans had wondered at times if she didn't at least suspect he wasn't the legitimate business magnate he claimed to be. Had she really looked into it, had she really dug and dug until she found the truth, Ilse might have learned of a time when her husband was called Hans Kerner and was a soldier in the National People's Army of East Germany. She might have learned of a time when he was known as Henry Kelman, and then a time when he began to be called Donovan Hock. In 1996, when Hans had only been in the business for a year, he'd been lying even more than he was later on. He was far less wealthy than he pretended at that time, and in fact was still on very shaky ground. But over time, as Hans first started to master one trade in an expensive white powder and expanded to include gunpowder and its associated hardware, his wealth caught up to his lies about his wealth. It even surpassed his lies. Hans fought his battles where he had to, acted ruthlessly when he needed to, and stayed vigilant, daring and alert. He rose from simple paratrooper, sterling, honest, dependable, brave and true, to become one of the premier figures in his business and very probably one of the wealthiest men in the world. This success drew the attention of the authorities in certain places, of course. This was why Hans developed substantial political savvy as well as business sense, and became adept at bribery and blackmail to equal extents. By the time any governments of note were interested in bringing him in, Hans had gathered enough political dynamite to destroy several important careers and damage many more. He dealt with some of the few politicians with enough business sense to see things his way, and made sure that he kept as much distance between himself and the day-to-day operations of his business as possible. This didn't mean that the various authorities didn't try to make trouble for him, however- it was a massive game of chess, with Hans on one side and various officials and authority figures on the other. Even with all the people that he bribed and befriended, Hans couldn't stop naval patrol aircraft from trying to hunt his submarines down. He couldn't stop some of the boats from getting seized while still under construction, or from having to be scuttled to avoid capture at sea. But as long as most of the submarines were built, loaded up with their cargo, and made it to return for another trip, Hans made money and the game went on. The same went with the boats, ships and trucks that moved firearms that customers had requested. Hans lost now and then, but not often. These days, it was surprisingly difficult to prove Hans had anything to do with much of the business he oversaw. His stock market investments, his founding-partner status within the Argus Private Military Corporation- that was all out there, and anybody who cared to could learn about it. And the fact that Hans had not filed any form of income tax in years- that was entirely legitimate, since the Republic of Anguilla required no such tax. And the small government of Anguilla had plenty of reason to treat Hans well and keep him around. With all his surplus wealth, Hans had the ability to be quite generous. He voluntarily helped fund all of Anguilla's public services and utilities, including its small self-defense force, and its police. Hans donated money every year to the island's school system, and made sure to keep key figures, like the prime minister and the chief of police, on good terms with their wealthiest resident. Hans kept his money close, and paid his informants, politicians, and bankers well. In his dealings with his former comrades-in-arms- Dieter, Martin and Wilhelm- Hans was unfailingly honest and fair. When Dieter was killed in a gunfight at a meeting gone bad in 1998, Hans had hidden the truth from his family and seen to it that the money his partner possessed was given to them in the form of a \"life insurance policy\" and then a \"lottery ticket\" a year later. Ilse was lost just a few years ago. No one had killed her; she'd just been struck by a car in New York City, shopping with her husband. Hans had made sure that the man driving the car was held responsible for his actions and then some. He might have forgiven a personal slight, might have allowed someone criticizing him or his reputation. But not taking Ilse. Not even if it really was an accident. There could be no forgiveness for that. Hans had wanted to withdraw from everything for a while afterward, but had not allowed himself the privilege. He needed to provide for himself, for his sons. He could not neglect his business affairs out of grief. And above all, Hans knew he could show no weakness. People who dealt in arms and cocaine did not have much tolerance for that. It wasn't a side of the world known for its compassion. Since then, Hans had taken plenty of chances for physical intimacy- women he met, high-priced whores he hired, beauties the cartel sent him- but had not tried to find love again. He had found that and lost it and did not care to try to look another time. Keeping himself active in bed, enjoying himself whenever he needed it, was enough for him. As for making sure he had a legacy- well, he was already seeing to that. Lukas and Martin would be more than ready to take control of the business when the time came. All the while, Hans had continued to oversee his business and lie to his brother and sister on the sporadic occasions that he spoke to them over the phone or exchanged letters. Alex and Ariane thought that Hans was a legitimate businessman but had a vague sense of just what kind he was, apart from the notion that he was involved in \"shipping\" and \"transportation.\" It was actually pretty close to the truth, which, in Hans' experience, made it easier to remember and stick with. XX \"Daddy!\" Martin exclaimed, startling his father, who had begun to doze off as he reminisced. The little boy, surprisingly muscular for his age and size, had caught a couple of mole crabs and was proudly holding them up in his hands. Hans shifted on his long white deck chair, lifting his sunglasses and pushing them onto his short-cut brown hair. \"Yes,\" he said in perfect English, \"those are mole crabs. Got four this time, huh? Bring me five and I'll play you the new piano piece I wrote once we get back to the house.\" \"Okay!\" Martin agreed immediately, and he raced back to where the waves were lapping at the sand. He stopped and looked around, realizing he needed a bucket. \"Lukas,\" he said, \"kommt her! Ich brauch hilfe!\" \"Was ist es?\" Lukas replied. \"Loooo-kassss,\" Martin said, drawing out his brother's name. \"Bitte, bitte!\" The red, yellow, green and blue plastic toys that Hans had brought for the boys to play with included a red plastic bucket. Martin liked to fill it with sea-water and put enough sand at the bottom for mole crabs to have some room to burrow. He'd forgotten it, and now needed it filled and readied for use- but he didn't want to lose the mole crabs he'd captured. The young soldier encounters a difficult situation, Hans thought, so he turns to one he knows he can depend on absolutely: his brother. \"Ja, ja,\" Lukas agreed, finishing the last of his situps and coming over with the bucket. He took a moment to flex his well-developed chest, arm and shoulder muscles impressively as he stopped in front of Martin, who promptly made a face at his brother. The boys playfully bickered in German as Lukas prepared the bucket, Martin dropped the mole crabs in once it was ready, and together they worked to dig through the sand. Hans thought about telling them that they had a schedule to keep, that an armored black Bentley Arnage was set to be coming across the concrete-and-steel bascule bridge that provided a land route from Scrub Island to the rest of mainland Anguilla inside of half an hour. The staff were busy preparing dinner, and then later on Hans was set to have another guest paying a visit. First family, then business, and Hans intended to keep it that way. Even as he smiled, looking on with pride and happiness as his boys worked together to accomplish a goal, Hans was sobered by the realization that while he had done well to make this day possible- making the calls and buying the round-trip ticket needed for his twin brother Alex to come to see him- it was the first time he had really even tried it. Today was to be the first time Alex and Hans saw each other in fifteen years. It was also sobering to realize how fast age had caught up with him. Hans had served in two different armies, gone into business, found and lost the most beautiful woman in the world, and had two wonderful, wonderful sons. He was thirty-six years old, just a couple years shy of forty. And even though his vigorous and active lifestyle ensured he easily and routinely passed for twenty-six, his real age was still there, and Hans could feel himself beginning to slow down. He was not old, but neither was he young anymore. It was strange. There had certainly been moments, in the Legion and in his lucrative and dangerous business career, where it looked like Hans would never see age thirty-six or even come very close. But he'd made it. Yes. Owner of an island, a vast and beautiful Caribbean mansion, collector of cars, planes, boats, art and literature, Hans had most definitely made it. XX Over the course of the next twenty minutes, Martin and Lukas found the required one more mole crab and then some. They in fact located nearly twenty in all, and Hans was proud of the teamwork they displayed. When the one bucket began to grow too full for all the mole crabs to have room to burrow into the sand, the boys got another. Then they turned one of the sand castle molds upside down, fixed it in place in the sand, and used it as well. Across the water, a gleaming black car, big and elegant-looking, approached the bridge to Scrub Island. Guarded on both ends by Argus Private Military Corporation security agents, the bridge was not only able to be raised in the middle to allow the passage of boats- or to deny passage to unauthorized vehicles- but it was also equipped with weather-proof, flawlessly-hidden explosive charges. In the event that the house came under assault, the bridge to the main island could be blown and the reinforced platoon guarding the estate mobilized to defend it. Machine guns, land mines, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, STA and STS missiles, and a SORA 122mm truck-mounted artillery piece were all ready for battle at just 120 seconds' notice. But as artfully camouflaged as they were, none of it could be seen by the casual observer. The mines didn't even work unless they were turned on. To the casual viewer, this was just a grand house with an impressive-looking, stone-laid driveway and black-painted steel front gate. And that was, of course, what The car halted at the checkpoint on the far side of the bridge. The guards checked the identity of the driver and passenger, then waved the vehicle through. The men on the other side of the bridge also checked it. Each time, as the guards made idle banter and asked polite but formal questions of the driver, hidden cameras and mirrors aided them in searching for anything hidden underneath the car. Scanners and detectors searched it for anything that should not have been there. Once again satisfied that the car and its occupants were safe, the Argus men opened the gates and the Bentley drove through. Seeing all that, Hans knew that someone would not be long in coming out here. Just a minute or two later, Hans noticed movement off to his left, and sure enough, there came Wilhelm, who was still serving as Hans' head of security. He had relinquished a direct role in the business after Martin was killed at the controls of his own sea-plane, but Hans never failed to ask for his advice or include him in a transaction if he felt he needed his best man on hand at a meeting. Dressed in a fine black suit that concealed at all times a pistol, submachine gun, combat knife and body armor, Wilhelm seemed to have no trouble walking along the beach and somehow keeping himself clean, right down to the shoes. \"Your guest is here, Mr. Hock,\" Wilhelm said. \"We're running a little behind schedule on this end.\" Hans suppressed a smile. Solemn and duty-minded, Wilhelm Forst had long since accustomed himself to calling Hans by his adopted last name. It was formal and respectful, but Hans called Wilhelm \"Willi\" most of the time anyway, and had more than once said that Wilhelm could call him \"Donovan\" at the very least. Still, habits were hard to get rid of. \"Yes, I suppose we are,\" Hans said, nodding. He glanced at the boys. \"Make sure our guest is comfortable, and check on the food. I want it all ready when the boys and I are prepared to make our appearance. And- stall a bit if you need to. Make sure our guest does not feel he's being kept waiting.\" \"Certainly,\" Wilhelm said, nodding. With that he turned and headed back towards the house, erect and vigilant. With him managing the security on this island, Hans had never once felt unsafe. His comrade and old friend had never failed, and never would. The boys had noticed the exchange between the two men, but been careful not to intrude on it. They knew to stay out of the affairs of men in the household. They would be receiving steady introductions into the way things worked as they got older, and one day- when each one was a teenager- they would be told of the true nature of Hans' business. But for now, they were boys, and Hans wanted them to have a proper life as children. They did not need to worry about the running of the household right now. So Hans turned to the boys, made a show of examining the mole crabs and being suitably impressed, and then spoke to them in the plain, honest way he had gotten them accustomed to. \"Boys, someone very special is coming to see us today. He just arrived and he'll be waiting for us in the main dining room. When we get there, I want you to behave like I taught you. Be respectful, and polite, but be friendly. Make sure he knows he's welcome here.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Martin and Lukas said together. \"He's a good friend, so we have nothing to fear from him. There'll be no need to be nervous.\" \"Dad,\" Lukas said, hints of amusement in his voice, \"does anyone make you nervous?\" \"No,\" Hans said, smiling. \"But don't be arrogant. Always be ready.\" \"Always,\" the boys chorused. They knew what their father meant. Despite their age, both were already becoming capable fighters. They would be experts in judo and karate before they even turned eighteen, and would be just as skilled with firearms and survival techniques. They might not have known what their father really did for a living, but they knew that the world was dangerous and one needed to be ready for anything. \"Okay,\" Hans said. \"I want you to let all the mole crabs go. Empty out the buckets and let's get back to the house.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Martin and Lukas said. They quickly removed the mole crabs, released them back into the wet sand just beneath the shallow water, and emptied the sand and salt water from the containers they'd used. Then they accompanied their father as he strode back along the beach towards the house, looking now and then out at the beautiful, clear blue water and the late afternoon sun off to their right and the tall grass waving in the wind to their left. Ahead, the mansion waited. It drew inspiration from Spanish and French as well as English and German architecture, each carefully blended into the design as a whole. The house was so vast and clearly cost so much that Alex, who ran an electronics store in former East Berlin, might not know quite how to be impressed… but Hans walked back to his home assured that his twin most certainly would be. XX Alex Kerner looked out of the Learjet's window, past its white port wing to the blue waters of the Caribbean beneath him. It was amazing how clear and bright the water was, how easy it was to see straight through it. Quite a contrast to the dark and brooding water of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, the only bodies of water that Germans were well-acquainted with. His store, his wife, son and two daughters were all in Buena Vista, Florida. Thanks to his brother's generosity, the family was getting to see the famed American resort and theme park \"Disneyworld\" for the first time. And not in the least-expensive accommodations, either- the only ones Alex knew he could have paid for. After flying first-class across the Atlantic, Alex and his family had been picked up and driven to Disneyworld and checked into one of the finest suites offered among the resort's hotels. It was a show of generosity, and one that Lara and the kids most definitely appreciated, from this twin brother whom only Lara had met. There was no doubt that Hans was being generous. But Alex wondered what the reason was for it. Was this really the way that Hans was accustomed to, and thus the way he insisted his kin be introduced to as well? Was he trying to impress Alex's family as well as Alex himself? Prove, perhaps, that he really was a success in the world of business? Well, maybe there was no motive like that. Maybe Hans was just being nice and spending a lot of money to offer his brother and his brother's family a good time. It would certainly keep them pleasantly occupied while Alex flew south briefly to see his brother for the first time in a decade and a half. Fifteen years. Had it really been that long? Alex had to admit, it was hard to believe. The two brothers, after so many years of sharing the same home and much of the same life in addition to the same face, had drifted apart after Robert Kerner, Dad, had fled to the West in 1978. Alex had eventually become a pro-democratic activist, while Hans, angry and bitter over being abandoned by his father, followed his mother into being a devout socialist, loyal to the state. Even after learning that his mother had lied, that Robert had not abandoned his family, but had instead fled according to a plan in which he would go first and his wife would follow with the children soon after, Hans had not changed his approach. Like Ariane, the notion that he had been abandoned had too firmly taken root. Hans, socialist and soldier, had made it clear he wanted nothing to do with his father. Robert was in contact with Alex, and on occasion with Ariane, but he had not seen or spoken to Hans since the Wall fell. Alex still held out hope there would one day be some reconciliation, but Hans appeared to have shifted his focus elsewhere, moved on. He just was not interested anymore. So what was he interested in? A lot of things that did not mesh well with the young man he had been when he and his twin last saw each other. The old Hans was solemn, devoted to socialism and a simplistic, warrior-scholar way of life. He had neither access to nor interest in the glamorous, flashy life so idolized in the West. Hans had not wanted a Mercedes-Benz, an expensive suit, or a big, beautiful house. He had not wanted money, was not interested in chasing fame or power. He just wanted to be a soldier and safeguard the working peoples of Germany and the world. But the things he talked about and seemed interested in now… it was so different. Hans was still a solemn and thoughtful man, but he definitely talked about money more than he had in the past. He was genuinely interested in acquiring a great deal of it, and from the sound of things, he had done that and then some. Alex glanced at the magazine in his hands. It was from last year, a TIME magazine on which his own damn face was on the front cover. It depicted a brown-haired man, relaxed yet still alert, sitting with one arm resting atop the back of his leather chair. In this photocopy of a no-doubt highly-expensive painting, the white suit the man was wearing was flawlessly clean and superbly made. Here on the front cover, it said: DONOVAN HOCK: THE PIRATE KING OF ANGUILLA It talked about what a successful and powerful man this \"Donovan Hock\" had become, how obscure his origins were, and how he had nerves of steel, expensive tastes, and the hardened, eternally-vigilant eyes of the elite infantry soldier. How he was one of the most powerful 'businessmen' in the world. \" Donovan Hock. There's a name that is synonymous with terror, betrayal and violence. A living example of the ends justifying the means. The hero of the small island republic of Anguilla. King of the universe he has relentlessly worked to build around himself. A savage barbarian who never let anything or anyone get in his way. And yet, he is charming, erudite and intelligent. When you're in his presence you feel that he's really listening to you, that your opinions matter, that you're someone important if you agree with him. It's amazing. I have often wondered if men like Hock don't carry around their own reality-warping bubbles, and all who fall in are suddenly transported to another dimension where the hellish things he says and does suddenly make sense. At least, that's the effect he always had on me .\" That was the opening article of the piece on this man, by the American journalist Michael Liberty. The name was different, the actions, the personality were in many ways different. But it was Hans. His eyes still held that same determined look they always had, that powerful desire to overcome the shame left hanging over him by Robert Kerner's betrayal. Years after leaving the military, he still carried himself like a soldier. Alex knew beyond a doubt. It was Hans. Apparently, his brother had, at some point, opened up his private, carefully-guarded life and home and allowed a journalist to interview him. Given the fact that the piece essentially said this Donovan Hock was a drug-running kingpin and arms dealer, one of the very best at his trade and certainly the only one who'd managed to force some of the cartels to step back and a few others to make him a partner and equal, Alex very much doubted that this Michael Liberty was welcome around Hans' estate anymore. \"The Pirate King of Anguilla.\" It had grandeur to it, but not the honorable image that Hans had probably been hoping to convey about himself. The thing was, a year ago this had come out, and nothing appeared to have happened to Hans. No one had arrested him, no American senator had gone out on a crusade, determined to bring the patron and benefactor of Anguilla down. And the 'business' he was said to be involved in went right on turning him a handsome and generous profit. Cocaine. Hans had gone from being a stoic, committed and highly skilled soldier to a big-time dealer in fucking cocaine. Not cars, not speedboats. Cocaine. And guns. Can't forget those. And somehow, he'd made sure no one could touch him, or that no one dared to. The Pirate King of Anguilla was secure in his kingdom. Alex wasn't sure how he felt about it. As the plane came in on its landing approach and touched down, he didn't know whether to be proud of how well his brother seemed to have done since leaving his native country, or ashamed of how he had chosen to do it. XX The Learjet came to a smooth stop not far from what looked like the main terminal building. This was a small airport on a small island republic, with not much to it. Off to one side, a couple hangars and buildings, all fenced in with some olive-drab vehicles and camouflaged helicopters and jet fighters around, showed that Anguilla did indeed have an air force. Not a big one, but a tourism-based republic like this one arguably didn't need an air force at all. It was just as well that the Learjet was not meant to connect with jetways, because there weren't any at this airport. You just walked down the steps of the plane and onto the concrete and got wherever you needed to go. There were probably some shuttle buses around, but Alex, looking at the big black car waiting near where the plane came to a stop, had the feeling that he wouldn't need one. Alex got up, took his bag down from the overhead bin, and thanked the pilots as he got off the plane. It was late in the afternoon, and the sun was turning sky amber as it began to set. The air was warm, humid, and had the distinctive scent of the sea. It was pleasant, relaxing. Not at all hard to imagine why so many tourists came here. Why Alex's brother had built his home here. As Alex disembarked, an alert-looking, well-dressed young man approached him. He had jet-black hair, cut short with military precision, and though he wore an expensive-looking suit with a red tie, Alex couldn't help but notice that this man, for all his civilian dress, carried himself like a soldier. Upright, orderly, focused. Just the type of employee Hans would want around, the type he would most approve of. Hans had always despised sloppiness, and upheld military virtues as the highest virtues. Small wonder that he'd used them so well to make something of himself in a new and different world. \"Welcome to Anguilla, sir!\" the man in the suit said, holding out a hand. He spoke fluently in English, probably having been told in advance that Alex did as well. Though his eyes were hidden behind a pair of sunglasses, he had a disarming smile on his clean-shaven face. \"My name is Victor. I am your driver. My employer regrets that he cannot be here to greet you in person. He is waiting to receive you at his estate on Scrub Island.\" \"Your employer?\" Alex asked with a slight smile as he shook hands with the man. He knew who it was, knew perfectly well. But he still couldn't believe it. Hans was an employer- for this man and many others. The big man, the boss. It was hard to believe. \"Mr. Donovan Hock, sir,\" Victor replied with a smile. \"I believe you are familiar with him? His name you may not know, but his face…\" Victor shrugged slightly. \"If I had not seen him at the house just an hour and a half ago, I would have thought you were him.\" Alex's smile grew a little, and he laughed, liking this alert, polite man. He was probably in his twenties, and was clearly loyal to his boss- something else Alex knew Hans prized highly. If Alex's brother was anything like he'd been years ago, he would want no one around him, no one on his team, if he could not trust them absolutely. It was, as much as simple warrior spirit, why he had joined East Germany's paratroopers. Hans, despite being an East German, would certainly have agreed with Gottlieb Daimler's maxim \"The best or nothing\". Looking at the gleaming black Bentley sitting on the near-white of the runway, Alex considered those words again. British, but a fine automobile nonetheless, and one of the best in the world beyond doubt. Of course Hans would send nothing less than a Bentley to retrieve his brother from the airport. He would have doubtless commented that his twin deserved no less. It was a grand gesture, all of what Hans had done to get Alex here, but also a touching one. Hans had always had a thing for going out of his way to give gifts to his family. Though he'd never forgiven Robert Kerner for defecting to the West, Hans had always loved his siblings and his mother. \"A 2003 Bentley Arnage, sir,\" Victor commented, noticing Alex looking at the car. \"Mr. Hock has expensive tastes.\" \"He certainly does,\" Alex said. \"Would you like to get going, sir?\" Victor asked. \"Mr. Hock is looking forward to seeing you.\" \"Yes, I'm sure he is,\" Alex replied. \"Let's not keep him waiting.\" \"My thoughts exactly, sir,\" Victor agreed, moving to open the rear left door for him. Alex got in, and Victor shut the door behind him and in moments had secured Alex's luggage. Efficient, duty-minded, and sharp as a blade. That was exactly the type of person Hans would want working for him, especially in a position of trust, as Victor clearly was. XX Anguilla was a beautiful island, and that was putting it mildly. Blue waters so clear you could easily see straight to the bottom even fifty yards from shore, and so light in color that the sky was the darker blue for once. The sand on the beaches was almost white. The main island of the small republic was about twelve or fifteen miles long, and had nothing but largely flat terrain, making for easygoing driving. There were no hills or mountains here, and there were no forests… at least, not anything like what was known as a forest in Germany. They had trees in Anguilla, but they were a range of generally shorter and less substantial tropical trees. Nothing like the mighty oaks that dominated the wooded areas of central Europe. Hans had always loved the forest despite growing up in East Berlin, and Alex wondered briefly if his twin ever missed the German woods he had known as a child and as a soldier. As the Bentley drove out of the small town that functioned as Anguilla's capital, Alex took note of the newly-paved two-lane roads. He couldn't help but wonder if his brother, with all that money he now had, had decided to throw some of it at the Republic's coffers and get the roads paved so he could have a better time driving around in his expensive cars on the island. That sounded like something Hans would do. Or, at least, something Hans would do now. Alex thought of the magazine, of the things that journalist had said about his twin. Not to mention the things he'd heard himself, and the occasional odd interaction when someone had mistaken him for a friend or business partner with the same face. Hans had left the Land Forces of the National People's Army determined to survive in the world, and he had most certainly achieved that. But somewhere along the way Hans had changed. There was no doubt about that. He had once been a soldier of socialism, devoted to a simple, straightforward life in which he neither had nor wanted anything in the way of luxuries. Hans had been a warrior. Now, he was a businessman, if you wanted to call the things he allegedly dealt with business. Cocaine, guns, and bullets. If the story was true, Hans simply played the mercenary, selling to whoever was willing to buy. And he'd become good at it, so good that he owned an island. Alex was silent as he rode in the stiff but comfortable rear seat of the Bentley, mostly just listening to Victor as he talked about the island nation and the good work that \"Mr. Hock\" had done supporting its educational system and infrastructure. Riding in an expensive car, with his wife and kids staying at a first-class resort suite in America, on a trip all paid for as if the cost was irrelevant, Alex didn't know whether to be proud of his brother for making such a success of himself, or bothered, even ashamed, by what Hans might well have done to achieve so much. It wasn't much fun to contemplate the possibility that the man who shared your face had changed greatly and, for all it mattered, was now someone else. XX They pulled to a stop after a fifteen-minute drive to one end of the island, as they neared a bridge that linked Scrub Island and the main island of Anguilla. The guards manning the posts at either end of the bridge checked Victor's credentials, and Alex's, making sure they were both who they claimed to be. The powerful motor of the Bentley idled like it belonged to some big cat all the while, and the car's air conditioning kept the interior cool even with the heat coming in through the two open windows. The guards themselves interested Alex. They were well-armed, carrying automatic rifles as well as a hip-holstered sidearm. They were probably wearing body armor, and the pale uniforms they wore proclaimed them to be members of ARGUS PMC. Alex had heard of them. They were none-too-popular with the modern German government, thanks mostly to their tendency to evade paying corporate income taxes and suspicion on the government's part that Argus was taking contracts from just about anybody with enough money to hire them. But they were slick bastards, and officially the company was in good legal standing anywhere it operated. Nobody had yet been able to prove otherwise. Once they were cleared at the second checkpoint, Victor drove the Bentley up the stone front drive of the massive, elegant, imposing house. It was something that a novelist might have dreamed up. Alex was no expert on architecture, but Hans must have hired one, because this house looked like a blend of a couple styles and designs. Some might have disliked that approach, even sneered at it, but they weren't looking at this place. It was more than a Caribbean estate. It was a monument to riches, to the very idea of success. And standing on the long, sloping front steps, wearing a white suit that had to cost thousands in any currency, was someone who Alex knew well. He hadn't seen him in a decade and a half and he still knew him instantly. And in spite of anything he might have done, in spite of whoever he had chosen to become, Alex knew in that moment that he still loved his brother. Alex felt his throat closing up, but fought to keep himself under control. He needed to be direct with Hans, to not let emotions get the better of him. The Bentley stopped, and while Alex, who was not at all used to being driven around, was tempted to get out, he waited for Victor to open the door. \"Thank you,\" he said, nodding appreciatively to Victor. \"You are welcome, sir,\" Victor replied. Sir. That was something else that Alex wasn't especially used to, and most definitely not in the \"Lord of the Manor\" type of \"sir\" that was applied to wealthy, powerful men and their associates. \"Hey, uh, you don't have to call me that,\" Alex said. \"It's really-\" \"Alex!\" Hans called out, and Alex turned to see his twin coming around the back of the car, apparently unwilling to wait. Hans had his hand held out, and Alex shook it. His twin's grip was strong and confident, much like he was, and he met Alex's gaze steadily. \"Good to see you. Donovan Hock.\" \"Is that what they call you now?\" Hans laughed. \"Your English is excellent, Alex. And your sense of humor.\" He glanced over at Victor, as well as two other men who had come out of the house. \"Take our guest's luggage inside, gentlemen. Please check everything again, and ensure the room is properly ready.\" \"Yes, sir, Mr. Hock,\" Victor answered, and he and the other three men removed Alex's bags from the car and headed inside. Hans watched them go, then turned back to his brother. \"It's been a long time, Alex,\" he said in German. \"Fifteen years,\" Alex said. Hans smiled, setting a hand on Alex's shoulder. \"Look at you. My brother. You look well, Alex.\" He paused. \"It's wonderful to see you again.\" \"Likewise,\" Alex answered. In spite of the distance that had developed between them, Alex was still glad to see his twin. \"Shall we go inside?\" Hans said, gesturing towards the front doors of the mansion. \"I don't see why not,\" Alex answered with a shrug. Hans laughed. \"All right. Then we will.\" XX If Alex was impressed by the outside of Hans' island home, he was amazed at the inside of it. Tastefully designed and decorated, stealing liberally from German, British, Italian and French designs and ideas, the house's interior was a monument to a classy model of success. Elegant statues and expensive paintings lined the halls. Many of them, Alex noticed, were related to the outdoors, or to martial prowess and bravery. One statue was of Mars; another was of Alexander the Great. Another was of Napoleon Bonaparte, and a fourth was of Frederick the Great. He might wear a suit that cost thousands and live in a mansion worth millions, but Hans was still a soldier at heart, still a warrior. It showed in how he carried himself, too; in the way Hans squared his shoulders and still wore his hair short and trim. And beneath that expensive suit, Hans was still in superb physical condition, a fighter of powerful gifts. Alex found himself respecting this observation about his brother, admiring the fact that success had clearly not softened Hans any. He might have adopted a startlingly worldly and sophisticated lifestyle, but he remained tough and sharp as ever. Then there were the boys. Lukas, age nine, looked remarkably like his grandfather, Robert, a man he had never met. He was vigilant, intelligent, and mature, regarding Alex with polite curiosity and a certain wariness. The younger boy, Martin, had gray eyes and silvery-blond hair. Six years old, and even he looked ready to fight Alex if he had to. Both of the boys did; like their father, they had every appearance of being physically active and were no doubt receiving early lessons in martial arts. But they were also energetic and courteous, and Alex found himself enjoying this first meeting with his nephews more than he had expected to. It made complete sense that Lukas and Martin were dignified and well-mannered; Hans had never been able to abide rudeness. It was startling to see just how much the boys knew. Through talking with them, Alex found they were well-informed and ready to talk about basic geography, politics and military matters. They had an air of readiness about them, a confidence, that Alex was not at all used to seeing in boys their age. They were equally ready to talk and to fight. And from the way they talked in such detail about the Soviet-bloc weapons displayed behind a glass case along one of the halls, they were definitely ready to fight using firearms. They also knew each other quite well, and Alex noticed a genuine closeness and sense of affection between Lukas and Martin. Their bond was no trivial one, and they lived and played as they would fight if they ever had to. In a vast room that looked out on the ocean and appeared ready to host as many as a hundred guests, there was displayed the greatest collection of art Alex had seen yet in this house. This grand room was large enough to be a house all by itself. Two reading rooms with hundreds of books and a fireplace, a dining area that looked fit to be a five-star restaurant, a fountain at the center of the room that easily topped ten feet in height… it was intoxicating to even imagine having access to the kind of wealth required to build and acquire all this. Seated comfortably in the dining area, Alex spent two hours speaking with Hans, Lukas and Martin while finely-dressed staff waited on them, serving food that Alex could not have taken Lara and the kids out to eat if he'd saved relentlessly for a year. Alex asked polite questions about what Hans had been doing since he'd left Germany in 1990, and Hans gave polite answers. Not all of them were entirely informative, however, and Alex noticed that Hans seemed to be telling a rehearsed tale about becoming a \"businessman.\" According to Hans, he owned a variety of transportation and shipping companies and firms, and was also heavily invested in certain private business ventures- like Argus PMC. \"Being a founding partner,\" Hans remarked, \"I get quite an excellent price to have them protect my property.\" He smiled, gesturing with a glass of port to the tan-clad men who stood to either side of the sturdy-looking door to his personal wing of the house, the set of rooms where Hans and his sons slept. \"You really believe they-\" \"They'll do their job if they need to, I guarantee that.\" \"I meant, do you need a private army guarding your house?\" Hans shrugged. \"Success like this can make people jealous. You can make enemies no matter how hard you try to stay polite. It is much better for me to be ready and not need these private soldiers than to have something happen and not have them.\" And so it went through the dinner. Hans was genuinely eager to hear about how his brother and sister were doing, and talked animatedly of bringing Alex to Anguilla again, this time with Lara and the kids. Talking of family matters was easy and pleasant enough, and Alex enjoyed catching up with Hans. But Hans did not much want to talk about his parents. He still missed his mother, and had not forgiven his father. Even though he knew that Robert had not deserted his family as had long been the story, years of bitterness towards his father had left Hans with little desire to reconnect. Alex privately wondered if the breach would ever be healed. Given that Hans had moved halfway across the world and now owned an island from which he commanded a small empire, Alex didn't think it likely. Hans was far beyond any need for his father at this point. He was a father himself, and appeared quite content. He had everything he wanted. Once the dinner was over, Hans brought the group over to a priceless grand piano, and after playing a few pieces himself, had Lukas play a few more. Both father and son played like experts, and watching them, Alex thought of his own life, of his electronics store, of the modestly successful life he had steadily and carefully built for himself, Lara, and the children. It seemed as nothing next to what Hans had achieved. Seeming to sense his brother's mixed feelings and thoughts, Hans reached over while Lukas began playing Beethoven's \"Piano Sonata No. 14.\" He said quietly, \"You've done fine, Alex. Don't feel like you've failed somehow because you don't have all this. You don't have to be me.\" XX As the sun began to dip below the horizon, Hans invited Alex to join him in his personal study, waving him past the armed guards watching the entrance to the residential wing. Lukas and Martin shook hands with Alex, bowed to him and their father, and headed off to their personal exercise room before going to bed for the night. \"Those boys are polite,\" Alex remarked, and Hans laughed. \"Yes. They are. I couldn't stand the idea of them ever being rude. They know how to get tough, but good manners are important.\" \"Wasn't it Mister Churchill who said \"If you're going to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite?\" Hans laughed again. \"Yes. That was him. Quite smart for an Englander.\" As they walked along the well-lit hallway, Alex said, \"You seem to like their cars.\" \"The Arnage is one of my favorites. It's quite an excellent car. Sporty and luxurious. But I have to take you for a ride in the 62 Landaulet before you go back.\" \"Landaulet?\" \"The Maybach 62 I own. It's a masterpiece, Alex. I wanted to send it to get you today, but Victor felt like the Bentley would do. Save the best for last.\" \"How many cars do you even have, Hans?\" \"Enough.\" Hans chuckled. \"German, British, Italian- only the best. Nothing but the best. I'll show you the garage tomorrow. And if there's one you want to drive, tell me and we'll take it out on the track.\" \"You have a track?\" \"Of course. Built it to run a circuit around the island a few years ago. It's a blast, Alex. We'll find a car for you.\" \"That's all right,\" Alex said, embarrassed. Hans stopped at a door and entered a combination, opened his eyes for a scan, and then opened it, letting Alex in ahead of him. Yet again Alex was impressed. There was a million marks in here alone. Paneled in dark-colored hardwood, the room was a combination of old and new. A heavy-looking and elegantly-carved desk and cabinets formed the core of Hans' work center, as did two computers and a set of neatly-arranged documents. It was rigidly organized and neat, looking more like a luxuriously-appointed general's office than that of a corporate chief. Or maybe it was a blend of those two things. With this new style that Hans had, the way of doing things that he'd adopted since leaving Germany, it was hard to know. \"Tell you what, Alex,\" Hans said, setting a hand on his brother's shoulder. \"I'll show you the garage tomorrow and you can look or drive as you like. I'm not trying to embarrass you.\" \"All right,\" Alex said. He hesitated, then added, \"How'd you guess what I was thinking, Hans?\" \"I might not have seen you for fifteen years, Alex, but I still know how you work.\" Hans laughed as he crossed around the side of his desk and sat down in an expensive and luxurious-looking leather executive-style swivel chair. A little surprised at how casually Hans made that remark, Alex took one of the leather armchairs positioned in front of the desk. He wondered if there wasn't a threat in that statement, or at least a hint of one. But if there was, Alex was sure it wasn't intentional. Hans was probably so used to casually and politely threatening people that it wasn't unrealistic for him to do it without thinking once in a while. But thoughts about that were interrupted as Alex noticed something else; one of the framed items hanging on the wall to his right was not a work of art. It was a case of medals and some insignia. Alex recognized the decorations as French, and happened to know one or two. There was a War Cross for Foreign Operational Theaters, a Combatant's Cross, and several others. \"From the French Foreign Legion,\" Hans commented. \"For someone who served just a single five-year contract, they certainly appreciated my work.\" \"I can see that,\" Alex said, nodding. It was a bit ironic that a former East German soldier had wound up finding employment in the French military, but then, Germans had made up a substantial amount of the Legion's numbers for years. Ever since World War II at least, many Legionnaires had been German-born. It was not surprising to Alex that the decorations he did recognize in that case were for combat service and for bravery. Alex would have expected no less. The number of medals Hans had taken with him upon being discharged from the Legion testified to how well he had performed as a soldier when given the chance to really do so outside of training and garrison service. \"So, Alex,\" Hans said. \"How is your family liking America?\" \"They're having a great time,\" Alex said, smiling. Hans smiled, too. \"I'm glad. You might think I'm showing off, trying to impress-\" \"You mean you're not?\" The man who shared Alex's face laughed heartily, clearly enjoying himself. \"Alex, I've missed you. More than words can say, I have missed you. I'd forgotten how funny you can be.\" \"You could have come back to visit. You certainly have the money.\" \"Yes, I could,\" Hans admitted. \"But raising Lukas and Martin and running my business ventures is very time-consuming. It isn't easy staying on top of everything.\" He sighed. \"And… for a long time now anyway, it hasn't been a very attractive idea to go home. Too many memories.\" Then he brightened, and added, \"Besides, much as I loved Germany… you can't beat the scenery here.\" \"How do the boys like it?\" Hans smiled, warming to the subject. \"Oh, they couldn't be happier! It suits them well, growing up here. And thanks to how successful and fortunate I have been, I can provide them with everything they could want. I'm truly lucky to be able to give them so much.\" \"I didn't know transportation and shipping could make you this kind of money.\" \"I didn't think so either, but- as we see, it can.\" Alex hesitated, then asked, \"Is that why Time magazine put you on the front cover once? Why that Mister Liberty wrote a feature piece on you?\" That got a new reaction. The urbane, sophisticated Hans, who spoke English with what almost sounded like a South African accent and collected art and built a home worth millions, fell away and Hans' face went white. Suddenly Alex got a look at a different Hans, still a warrior, still a soldier, but the uglier side of one. \"A savage barbarian who never let anyone or anything get in his way.\" Wasn't that what the article had said? Hans' eyes burned with anger… perhaps at a journalist he had allowed himself to trust, and who had turned around and betrayed that trust. Those eyes held wrath and damnation and no forgiveness for anyone who crossed him. That look of unbridled fury was on Hans' face, in his eyes, for not even two seconds. He swiftly recovered and hid that initial reaction. But it was still shocking for Alex to see. He had known this man for what was still most of their lives, had grown up with him and shared his basic looks. But Alex had not anticipated the hard, merciless side that Hans had apparently developed, the Hans that was capable of anything if he deemed it necessary. That was something Alex had never expected to see in his brother. \"Alex,\" Hans said easily, his relaxed, nothing-ever-bothers-me manner coming back to him, \"you are my brother and I love you. I know how smart you are. So I know you know better than to just believe any old thing you see in the papers.\" \"Magazines, Hans.\" \"Magazines, too.\" Hans looked earnestly at his brother from behind the desk, sitting upright, his posture still lean and military. \"Alex, the world is not as simple as some people would have you believe. There is more to it than just what some book of laws says or what is allegedly good and bad. I am a businessman. I oversee a lot of shipping, some agriculture, some sales. But these things those Americans wrote about me…\" Hans laughed and put up his palms, as if to say, 'What can you do?' \"So you're not a…\" \"A cocaine baron? A gun runner? A mobster? A killer? They say so many nasty things about me, Alex, because they want me to fit within their narrow confines of what is right and wrong. They envy my success and are angry that I don't adhere to their naïve definitions of what is acceptable and honorable.\" Hans paused. \"I don't know how to address everything they say about me. Where would I even start? Alex, some of it is so ridiculous that all I can do is laugh. That, and ignore them.\" \"So what are you, then?\" Alex asked, and he found he very much wanted to know the answer. \"What are you actually? I'm here. Tell me what you actually are, Hans.\" Hans met his brother's gaze steadily. He spoke calmly, confidently. \"I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the world.\" \"You own an island and live in this palace and you call yourself a simple man?\" \"Yes. I have been fortunate to do this well. But I just work hard and provide for my sons and try to raise them well. I'm no different from any other father, Alex. Money only makes so much difference.\" Alex wondered again how Hans had changed so much in fifteen years. How the stoic, confident soldier of socialism had turned into this worldly, urbane billionaire. How a man who had once wanted nothing more than to be a paratrooper in his native land's army had left home and become one of the most powerful men in the world. Maybe not as famous as some of them, but you did not fuck with a man that owned an island. A damned island. How had Hans done it? How had he embraced capitalism so totally and made it work so much to his benefit? \"I know what you're thinking.\" Hans said it easily, and he almost sounded amused. \"You're thinking about who I was back in the DDR and how I went from there to here.\" \"That's right,\" Alex admitted. \"I still have all the old books. Marx, Engels, everybody. I still miss the East and I've managed to rescue a lot that was discarded when it went away. But… Alex, the dream is over. The DDR will always be in my memory and I cherish its place there. But my memory is where it will stay. The DDR is gone for good. The socialist dream is lost. I couldn't stay in Germany, so I found a way to live in the new world the West created.\" \"Just a simple man, trying to make his way in the world.\" Alex wondered if Hans actually did believe that. He sure sounded like he believed it. \"That's right,\" Hans nodded. \"And remember that, my brother, the next time someone tells you lies about me. Remember that when they try to tell you something about me or what I do is wrong or evil. I am just making my way in the world, and some people don't approve of how.\" \"So nothing they said in that magazine was true?\" \"None of it,\" Hans assured him. \"It's overexaggerated at best. I'm just a businessman, Alex. Making my way in the world. That's all it is, I promise you.\" Hans spoke so eloquently in making his replies and denials, Alex found himself more than impressed; he was awestruck. His brother had always been intelligent and driven, but now, he was a self-made gentleman. Were Michael Liberty around, Alex would have told him he'd been right about how charming and charismatic \"Donovan Hock\" was. He was magnetic enough that even a skeptic like Alex found himself wanting to believe Hans, wanting to agree with everything he was saying. The way Hans explained it all, it made perfect sense. No wonder he'd gotten away with so much and come so far. Alex was going to say something else, like ask how anybody could possibly make up something so specific as \"Rich guy who owns an island in the Caribbean made his money by making it big in the cocaine trade and selling guns on the side.\" Alex also considered asking why Hans had become so briefly but intensely furious over being reminded of that magazine edition that featured him on the front cover. After all, why would it bother him for even a second if it was all made up? But Alex didn't get the chance, as there was a knock at the door. \"Enter!\" Hans called out. Victor opened the door and stepped in. \"Second guest of the day's here to see you, sir.\" \"Excellent. Send him in.\" Victor stepped back out into the hall, and Alex looked at his brother curiously just as Hans was standing up. \"An acquaintance and I had plans to meet and discuss some business today. Since I have a lot going on next week, I had to put him and you on the same schedule. I apologize.\" He went to the door, just as a tall, well-dressed man with dark hair was coming in. Even at a glance, Alex knew him to be of the same cut as Hans was- a billionaire, probably, and no doubt one who'd made a fortune in \"shipping and transportation\". Hans smiled and held out his hand, and the two men shook hands. \"Mr. Orlov,\" he said warmly, \"thank you for coming.\" Hans glanced at Alex. \"Would you excuse me, please?\" A/N: 10-24-2017. After 13 months, I finally completed this story. It was well worth the time and effort. Not that I was working on it that entire time; rather, I am glad I returned to work on it from time to time, finally managing to complete it. I first got the idea for this story in September 2016. My OC for the movie \"Good Bye, Lenin!\", Hans Kerner, twin brother of Alex, the main character, was originally featured in my story \"The Bridge\", set in the Tom Clancy fandom, specifically the book \"Red Storm Rising.\" I then began to connect the character with a possible idea for \"Lord of War\". I wanted to write something for LOW, but decided early on that the main characters' stories had been told well enough. Sometimes that's how it is, and I do not feel I have anything to add or change about the story. But I like the movie and its themes enough that I decided to find a way to write something for it. A disillusioned Hans Kerner, forced out of the East German military at the end of the Cold War as West Germany absorbs the East, emerged as candidate to write a story about. So I developed an idea about Hans- once steadfast and loyal in his commitment to service as an East German soldier- abandoning his old country's ideals and embracing the capitalist system as a way of surviving the new, post-Soviet world. Hans' transformation, going from soldier of socialism to war dog, is remarkable for me to think about. Once a devout socialist, Hans changes his ways out of necessity and devises a new way to earn a living for himself. Like Yuri Orlov, he went into an illegal business determined to aim high. He took on the established players of the market and became one himself, earning his position the hard way. Over time Hans has become hardened and is capable of acting ruthlessly without a second thought. But he is still himself, and has not become a sadist. Nor is he mad with power, or lazy. Hans remains strong and vigilant, and is aware that he is not guaranteed his extremely privileged position. He will only remain where he is if he retains the traits and behavior that brought him to power to begin with. Hans Kerner's first adopted name is in keeping with a practice of the French Foreign Legion. One can enlist under their real name, but assumed names are common. When the latter is used, the Foreign Legion creates a name based on the first letters of the first and last name. So HK, in this case. And his second name, Donovan Hock, is a reference to the 2010 video game \"Mass Effect 2\", specifically the successful and powerful arms dealer by that name who appears in one of the game's DLC storylines. Hans, to be clear, has made his fortune first and foremost in one business: the cocaine trade. Cocaine is an extremely valuable drug, one that Americans are estimated to buy 100 tons of every year. While the price of it varies, cocaine, based on one estimate I ran, can be valued around $60,000,000 per ton (2,000 pounds). So based on that number, a narcotics submarine or narco-submarine able to carry 10 tons would be moving a cargo worth as much as $600,000,000. Given that Hans has established himself as a major player in that trade by 2005, owning both some of the diesel submarines used to do the shipping from Venezuela and Columbia to the coast of Mexico and at least a single plantation where the cocaine is grown, he is going to be quite a wealthy person- probably enough so that he could rival the fortune Yuri Orlov has built for himself by the end of \"Lord of War\". Hans is also an arms dealer, but cocaine remains his main trade. When Yuri Orlov arrives at the end of the story, it is because Hans has arranged to meet with him so they can discuss setting up a partnership. Hans, in all likelihood, wants to increase his involvement in illegal arms dealing. He may want to reduce his involvement in the cocaine trade, or simply expand the other side of his business. There's some references to StarCraft in here; Michael Liberty is a famous reporter in the Koprulu Sector in the StarCraft universe, and he is referenced by that name in this story. I adapted a piece that Liberty once wrote about the founder and first Emperor of the Terran Dominion, Arcturus Mengsk, making it instead about Hans Kerner- or Donovan Hock, as he is known to most by 2005 in this story. War Dog, the title, refers to \"a derogatory term sometimes used to describe non-military individuals who make money off the periphery of war. Often used to describe civilian contractors, private arms dealers, black marketeers and/or shoddy journalists\", according to Urban Dictionary. ","Summary":" War Dog A/N: Like the description says, this is a OC-focused story. It doesn't particularly feature"},{"Movie":"Lord of War","Title":"How to Shoot Somebody Who Outdrew You","Author":"Sandrine Shaw","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7040799","Passage":"[Chapter 1] How to Shoot Somebody Who Outdrew You by Sandrine Shaw Reaching the state where you'd lost everything in your life that you ever held dear had its advantages, the biggest of them being that you did not care anymore. You could focus on the important things, because it didn't make a difference to you what people thought of you, or whether you were gonna live or die. Of course, there weren't all that many important things left to focus on either. But the point was, it didn't matter whether someone held a gun to your head, because you didn't give a shit. The steel was cold and hard and almost comfortable. It wasn't one of my own. A standard M9. Sleek, black, powerful. A good weapon for an execution. I tilted my head slightly to ease the pressure of the muzzle on my temple and looked up to meet the hard gray eyes of Jack Valentine. He had changed since our last encounter. He was hardly the same guy who sat across from me in the interrogation room five months ago. The single-minded desire to bring me down was still there, burning perhaps stronger than ever now, but there was also a disgust at the world at large. He'd been robbed of the belief that deep down, everything was how it should be, that there was justice, and good always triumphed against evil. I had done this, I realized; it was me who had changed him – and for a moment, I felt a stab of regret. \"What are you going to do now, huh? You gonna kill me?\" My tone implied that I was sure this wasn't going to happen. But I didn't know that. The Jack who pushed a gun into my face in the Ukraine, back in 1992, wouldn't have pulled the trigger. The Jack who found me with an empty plane in Sierra Leone in 2000 stopped one of his men from taking my head off with a machete, even though no one would ever have known. The Jack who arrested me earlier this year wouldn't have overstepped his moral boundaries either. But this was not the same man; and who knew if his moral boundaries hadn't shifted the same way his view of justice had. I had no way of knowing whether he'd pull the trigger or not. I thought that perhaps this should worry me, but it didn't. Everyone had to die some time, and today was as good as any other day. And, while I didn't really have any preferences regarding the identity of the man who was going to put a bullet through my brain, it seemed oddly fitting that it should be Jack Valentine. There was a kind of poetic justice to it: that through my death, I'd have corrupted the incorruptible. I held his gaze, unblinking, and waited for him to make up his mind. His hand was trembling. He pushed the gun harder against my face. I winced, but I didn't give him the satisfaction of craning my neck any further to get away from it. \"Do you know how many people have been killed with your weapons? Do you even care ?\" He sounded frustrated and angry. He was stalling for time, and I knew it, but I indulged him. I wasn't in a particular hurry to die. I wasn't in a hurry to resume my life either. I had all the time in the world. \"You think you're innocent because after all it's not you who kills those people. It's always the bullet, or the missile, or the tank, but never you. Well, newsflash, Orlov – you are the bullet. You are the fucking weapon.\" I concentrated on the extra pressure he put on the gun at those last few words, focusing my attention on the pain instead of on what he said. It was all I could do not to roll my eyes at his little speech. He had always been too fucking dramatic. I'd never been under the illusion that I was innocent . I was tempted to tell him that, but in the end, I couldn't be bothered. After a while, the gun eased off, and I was almost disappointed. But then Jack trailed it down my cheek, and I felt the muzzle nudging against my lips. I wondered if I was supposed to open them, if Jack wanted me to eat the gun and shoot me into my mouth, making it look like suicide. If he did, he'd better tell me. But the gun didn't push inside, just trailed my lips in an almost lazy, dreamy manner that lacked the aggressiveness of Jack's previous conduct. The frown on his face didn't ease, and neither did the open repulsion reflecting in his eyes, but when he spoke again, his tone was almost conversational. \"Are you turned on by weapons, Orlov?\" \"No,\" I said against the steel, without contemplating the question. Then, with a smirk: \"Are you, Jack? Do you get off on this?\" He looked straight at me for a long moment, and I silently counted to eight until he lost it. Instead of the shot I expected, I felt the impact of the gun handle crashing against my right temple. It was white-hot pain – the kind that made your vision go black and your body curl itself together like a fetus in your mother's stomach. I thought I heard him curse at me, a litany of 'fuck you's I barely understood because the pain was all-consuming and numbed my senses until there was nothing but it and me. When I woke up, I was lying on the floor, dried blood coating the right half of my face. A quick glance at the clock told me that nearly fourteen hours had passed. It was afternoon, and it was raining. Other than my battered face, there was no indication that Jack had ever been there to begin with. My head ached worse than the hangover I had after the party for Vitaly's eighteenth birthday. The rest of my body didn't feel much better. I thought Jack was a fucking sadist for letting me live. But it hadn't been the end, just a fucking interlude; and after that, life went on. Nothing changed – or if it did, it didn't affect me. I was still the best private weapon dealer, and Agent Valentine was still my shadow – ever-present, always one step behind, and always waiting for a chance to bring me down. If that failed (and it always did), he settled for delaying me. It got tiresome – not to mention dangerous, because who wanted to make business with a man who was hardly ever on time because some hotshot agent was exercising his right to hold him for 24 hours without charging every other fucking week? I mentioned this to my friend Colonel Southern, and – in the mysterious ways the chain of command works – Jack got a reprimand and the order to stop bothering the innocent citizen Yuri Orlov unless he had definite proof of criminal activity. Which, of course, he hadn't. I wished I'd seen his face when they gave him that particular order. But Jack was nothing if not persistent. It was late 2001, and the world was in turmoil. I was busier than ever, commuting between the war zones in Congo and Afghanistan on a weekly basis. In Congo, Léon Braco, the right-hand man of the right-hand man of the second-in-command of a rebel leader who preferred to remain anonymous, had a room in a small hotel in Kisangani reserved for me on stand-by. It wasn't exactly the Hilton, but at least the danger of getting your throat slit in the middle of the night, while sleeping the sleep of the not-quite-righteous, was only half as likely as in most other establishments in the area. One afternoon – I had just arrived from the airport in a shiny black limousine that looked great from a thirty foot distance and proved to be close to falling apart at closer inspection – I walked in to find a woman sitting on the bed. There was no mistaking her for a chamber maid, with her endless legs and satin skin and dark, promising eyes. Of course, the fact that there wasn't a fiber of cloth covering her perfect body was a bit of a give-away, too. I'd been in business with Braco and his sponsors for seven months now, and their generosity had long since stopped astonishing me. Their surprisingly good taste with their pick, however, did. - Not that I was going to question it. My own personal Miss Latin Beauty introduced herself in bad English as Roselyn. That was pretty much all she said. She was a devoted advocate of the Elvis philosophy: a little less conversation, a little more action. It wasn't like I had any objections to that. Her hands were soft and warm, with a hint of danger as long fingernails danced over my skin, and they definitely knew what they were doing. She tasted of heat and spices; and if the alarm in my cell phone hadn't set off, it might have been enough to take away my senses and lure me into her web of seduction. As it was, though, I untangled myself from her with great difficulty, collecting all my willpower to step away when her hands reached for me. Life was terribly unfair sometimes. While I was busy refastening my pants and resisting the urge to follow her siren's call, I tried to find a compromise. \"Look, I need to go and meet someone. The man who arranged this little get-together.\" I tried my most winsome smile on her. \"Maybe when I come back, we could finish what we started?\" I had expected feeble protests, some sexy pouting, bedroom eyes that said, \"Are you sure you want to leave me like this?\" and \"I really don't want you to go.\" The naked panic that struck her when she realized that I was serious about leaving took me by surprise. She didn't even try to make her begging sound wanton or sensuous, she went straight to desperate. I generally have no objections to beautiful women throwing themselves at me, but when she tried to hold on to my hand for dear life, crying that I shouldn't, couldn't, mustn't leave, it wasn't as appealing as it should have been. The more I tried to reason with her, the more upset she became. \"You can't leave,\" she flat-out told me at some point. \"You leave, I get no money.\" For some reason, that piece of information settled uncomfortably in the pit of my stomach, like Vitaly's Borscht. Something was off, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it. If she wasn't paid if I left, and I definitely wasn't paid if I didn't leave and missed the appointment, either Braco was trying to frame me, or whoever paid her didn't have the same interests as the ones who paid me. The latter option seemed the more likable one by far, so I asked her who was paying for her services. Well, maybe I didn't so much ask as yell. I rarely lose my cool. Hot-headed anger hardly ever gets you anywhere, but I felt out of the loop and my inability to make myself heard over her hysterical wailing didn't do much good for my composure. It was a vicious circle: I shouted, she cried, I got louder, so did she. Maybe the hotel staff would've sent someone eventually to see what was going on. Then again, probably not. In any case, it wasn't a member of the hotel staff who turned up. I cannot say that I was entirely surprised to see Jack Valentine. Roselyn shut up when she saw him, but only for a moment before she let out a stream of apologies and pleas. She really had been a lot more attractive when she'd shut up. My head started to ache, and only the notion that Jack didn't look too happy either cheered me up, if only to some extent. Finally, he got rid off her by shoving a bunch of dollars at her and gently, but firmly pushing her well-formed body out of the door. I was still more than a little pissed, but the urge to yell my anger out had passed. \"So, Agent Valentine, does Interpol nowadays consider hiring prostitutes a legitimate means to compromise a suspect?\" Jack shot me a withering look that he apparently deemed answer enough. I didn't really think it was, but it had been a rhetorical question anyway. \"Look, Jack, this isn't going to work. Sure, it's a lot more pleasant than being left in handcuffs in the middle of a field in West Africa, but if I wanted a whore, I'd buy myself one. It's not like I couldn't afford it. If you want to keep me from doing my job, you have to do a lot better. How about you get me something I cannot buy myself? Put Ava in my bed, or Jennifer Lopez, or at least have the decency to offer yourself – some random whore, pretty as she was, will hardly stop me.\" Jack's forehead furrowed while he listened to me, but other than that, he didn't react. There was no smart-ass comeback, and none of his usual righteous bullshit. In fact, he didn't say a fucking word, just stared at me. I didn't have time for this, or him, so I grabbed my jacket and turned to go. But before I could get anywhere near the door, Jack suddenly reached out to block me. I looked down at the hand that had taken a hold of my upper arm, then back up at Jack's face. \"What is it now? I thought we'd established that you can't stop me.\" My tone was somewhere between amusement and annoyance; I was well past the former and had not quite reached the state of the latter. \"Shut up!\" Jack said; then he was pushing me backwards into the room. I let him, bemused by the blank expression on his face and the lack of his usual ranting. Later, I'd wonder if I should have seen it coming, but then, it wasn't exactly a turn of events I could have expected. It was only when the back of my knees hit the bed and another gentle push flung me down in a sitting position that I realized Jack's intent. It took me another moment to process this information and to regain my wits, and by the time I had, Jack had already loosened his tie and thrown it over my shoulder on the bed. \"Whoa, wait. You realize that I was joking, right?\" The protest was half-hearted at best – something that I wasn't quite aware of then, but which evidently wasn't lost on Jack. Still not saying a single word, as if he hadn't heard me at all – which made the whole situation a hell of a lot more surreal than it already was – he sunk to his knees in front of me. There was nothing graceful about the motion, it was awkward and tense; but it gave me a certain kind of satisfaction to see Jack's light grey suit wrinkling against the dirty floor. Before I could rouse myself to react – other than the involuntary, instinctive physical reaction I had neither expected nor noticed up to this point - Jack's hands were on my belt. When I reached down to stop him, he looked up, gray eyes meeting mine. \"This offer has an expiry date. You know that.\" A matter-of-fact statement, belied only by the faint tremor of his hands I'd have missed if it weren't for the fact that my fingers were still clamped around them. I thought of Léon Braco, who was expecting me in fifteen minutes, and the ten-million deal, which was going to go straight to hell if I didn't get my ass out of this room and on the way to the rendezvous within the next two minutes. I thought of Jack Valentine, the most righteous, straight-laced man I'd ever met, on his knees with his lips wrapped around my cock; and I decided that Léon Braco could go to hell. The moment I released Jack's wrists and let him continue, an expression of triumph crossed his face, his eyes glinting with a gleeful 'See, I won.' I wanted to remind him that he might have won this battle, but he'd lost the war a long time ago, before he'd even started it, and I wanted to tell him that the victory he was obviously rejoicing in was a pyrrhic one; but I didn't say anything. There was a time for words, for all those little battle of wits and insults and the bullshitting, and then there was a time when none of it really mattered. Jack's mouth was hot and tight and wet, and I was pretty sure that he'd never given anyone a blowjob before. There was too much suction and too little finesse; but it didn't really matter, because it was Jack fucking Valentine, and that alone was almost enough to bring me off. Maybe, with some more experience, Jack could have drawn out this encounter a lot longer. As it was, it was over quickly, leaving me spent and sated and generous enough to consider it a matter of fair play not to hurry off to my appointment, even though I might still have made it with only a minor delay. I remained where I were, sitting in front of him with my pants pooled around my ankles and his palms heavy and clam on my thighs. It was Jack who moved first (another contest I won, almost without realizing it), pushing himself up and disappearing into the bathroom without a backward look. I wondered if he was going to puke or to jack off. Probably both, I thought when he returned, taking in the haunted, guilty look and the pale face. It was almost enough to feel sorry for him, but then, it had been his idea in the first place and if he regretted it, he wasn't letting it on. \"So… it seems you missed your appointment,\" he said. \"Apparently.\" We almost smiled at each other. Like the good bloodhound that he was, once Jack had his teeth in something, he didn't let go. Fortunately for me, this only applied in a metaphorical way. But Jack had finally found a way to get to me, to distract me enough that I was willing to forget about my business – no matter how temporarily – and he wasn't about to let go. I've never had a more intense orgasm than when I fucked Jack Valentine against a dirty brick wall outside a shady bar in Cuba. It was messy and awkward and bruising, and I loved every second of it. The only thing I loved more was the knowledge that Jack had been too late and I had already completed my deal. I never asked Jack whether he knew, I just assumed that he didn't, because anything else would have complicated things infinitely. As long as he was doing what he was doing with the single-minded fixation to stop me, I didn't need to question his motives. I never really stopped to question my own motives either. He messed up some good deals for me, but I justified to myself that it only happened because I let him, and that I was smart enough to sidestep him when missing out the deal would have been potentially dangerous or unwise or just monumentally stupid. I sometimes wondered if Jack could still face himself in the mirror, but he never gave any indication that he was any more bothered by our arrangement than I was. Nothing really changed, other than that we occasionally made each other come. He still never missed a chance to let me know how much he despised me with every word, every look, every touch. Even the way he shrugged off his jacket and folded his pants spoke of scorn. Or maybe I only thought it did because that's what I expected from him. In my line of work, it paid to be paranoid. There was no way of misreading the taunts and digs he threw at me, though. The way the corners of his lips curled up when he asked, almost casual, \"How's Nicolai?\" I pretended it didn't hurt. \"At least I had a family. You've been too busy hunting me down to ever have a life. And look where that got you!\" \"I wouldn't want to raise a child in this world.\" Good old Jack, self-righteous to the core. \"Well, that sucks,\" I told him, \"because there is no other world but this one.\" He didn't have an answer for that. I didn't expect him to. Jack was never good at verbal sparring with me – if the idealist goes to war with the cynic, the cynic will always have the better arguments on his side. And no matter how hardened Jack had become, he was still an idealist at heart. Of course, it wasn't all fun and games. Jack followed me to Pakistan in late summer 2003. As I was dealing with a new client, I couldn't afford the distraction and struggled to avoid Jack. I'd sent him off on a wild goose-chase following a trail of false evidence of my whereabouts I'd carefully planted. I believed I'd succeeded in shaking him off. Then he turned up, just when I was about to follow my driver into the rented limo that was to bring me to my client. I hadn't seen Jack so angry in a while – it was almost like our old confrontations, all finger-pointing and righteous accusations. I told him he acted like a teenager who had been ditched at a first date. His fist flew at me, and next I knew I was flat on my ass. The driver was moving in, his fingers edging menacingly towards his gun. I knew it wouldn't have taken more than the wink of an eye from me to make him shoot Jack. In fact, he probably would've shot him even without a sign from me, if I hadn't held him back. I assured him I had the situation under control (which I didn't) and told him to start the car already. The poor sod reluctantly followed me orders. About forty seconds later, there was heat and noise and car parts scattered around me like falling snow. It was the third time I'd seen a car blown in the air right under my nose. I was rooted to the spot, staring at the burning wreck in shocked fascination. My shoulder ached, my ears felt numb, my eyes were stinging. There was a sudden, unrelenting pressure on my arm. When I turned to see what it was, I realized that Jack was trying to pull me up. He had his gun drawn, waving it around in a hazardous manner. His mouth was forming words, but I couldn't hear anything. Deaf and dumbstruck and still frozen in motionlessness, I stared up at him for what seemed like minutes. When my hearing finally returned, his voice seemed faint and like an echo, telling me to get up. I nodded vaguely and allowed him to pull me to my feet. I knew it should have been me in the car. As much as I wanted to push that thought away, to bury it somewhere in the depths of my mind and ignore it as I had ignored any other danger and threat in the past, I couldn't. Jack's hands moved over my body, briskly and almost businesslike, as he was padding me for injuries. – Jack Valentine, my personal bodyguard and Nurse Nightingale all in one. In any other situation, I might have appreciated the irony. When he was assured that I was okay, he pulled my weapon from the ankle holster and pushed it in my hand. It felt cold and foreign. \"Listen, we need to get away from here,\" he told me. I said that my plane was just outside the town. By nightfall, we were in Ankara. My shoulder, which had been hit by a part of the car suspension that became loose during the explosion, was bandaged, and I'd stopped shaking. Jack's face was tighter and harder than usual, but the familiar edge of anger was, if not missing altogether, at least dulled. We got drunk on cheap alcohol that night. It left a stale, bitter burn all the way down my throat and a pleasant fuzziness in my mind. Before that day, I wouldn't have dreamed of getting pissed in front of an Interpol agent; but then, I had never shared an almost-death experience with one before, and Jack Valentine wasn't just any agent to begin with. I might never admit it, but I'd come to think of him as 'my' agent. I didn't necessarily like him. I certainly wasn't in love with him. I sure as hell didn't trust the bastard. And yet, there we were, the two of us; and in a way, he might have been the best friend I ever had. And if you couldn't get shit-faced in front of your friends, then who the hell could you get shit-faced with? \"Do you ever get used to this?\" my best almost-friend, quasi-enemy and sometimes-lover wanted to know after the first five or six rounds of drinks. \"It's not like people try to blow me up regularly. I don't even get shot at much. In fact,\" I stabbed my finger in his general direction at that point, \"I can count the number of times someone held a gun to my head on one hand. And one of those is on your account.\" Jack chuckled dryly. \"I remember that. You claimed it didn't turn you on.\" \"Yeah.\" I paused and refilled both our glasses. Then, deadpan: \"That was a lie.\" He laughed at that and I joined in and then, suddenly – heaven knows what possessed me to say this – I told him: \"I killed a man.\" The admission didn't seem to impress him. His only reaction was to reach for the bottle and refill both our glasses. \"What's one more or less?\" \"No.\" For some reason, his none-too-favorable appraisal of my character and the weight of a dead man on my conscience seemed funny to me, so I laughed. I couldn't stop laughing until I was out of breath, my hand shaking, spilling the drink in my hand all over the desk. \"No, man. I really killed him. Shot him, myself.\" At that, at last, his interest seemed piqued. He drowned another shot and gave me a look that said, 'Tell me more'. So I did. Even as drunk as I already was and with my level of intoxication rising by the minute, I knew that I should keep my big fucking mouth shut. My instincts had never let me down before – I always knew what to say and how, talking my way out of every kind of shit. And here I was, completely hammered, words spilling from my lips that I knew would eventually fuck me up. \"Guy named Simeon Weisz, you know him? Knew, I mean, because he's dead. Fuck, 'course you knew him. After all he was best buddies with the CIA and all that shit. Anyway, so I come to my hotel room and André fucking Baptiste is waiting for me, holding Weisz at gunpoint, telling me that I've got to take my revenge for what Weisz did to my uncle. He hands me the gun, and I don't want to do this and I tell him, so he says, okay, buddy, we do it together. Called it a bonding experience, the fucker! Ain't that a riot? Bonding experience.\" By that time, I was shaking with laughter and hysterics, remembering the mad look in André's eyes, and the fear in Weisz's. The feel of the gun in my hand, heavier than it should have been and so different from any other time I've ever held a weapon. I reached for a refill, and I almost couldn't hold the bottle because my hand was shaking so badly. \"So?\" Jack asked, understandably keen to hear the rest of the story. It was a fucking out-of-body experience: I saw myself sitting there, listened to myself telling Jack this stuff, and I thought, 'Shut up, man, before it's too late.' Somewhere in the short-circuiting synapses of my brain, that warning must have gotten lost. \"So we're both holding the gun, and he says I only gotta tell him to stop. And I do. But Weisz's fucking brain was already splattered all over the fucking place by then.\" I paused to drink, feeling sick but unable to tell whether it was the alcohol or the memories. \"So there's a gun out there which has been used in Weisz's murderer, and it has my fingerprints all over it. I'm pretty sure Andy didn't give it away. You don't waste blackmail material like his. This fucking thing gets into the wrong hands, and – bang – I go down!\" I don't remember much from that night, but I do remember noticing that right then, Jack's expression seemed almost carefully neutral. \"You ever ask Baptiste about the gun?\" he wanted to know. \"We don't talk much these days,\" I said, vaguely. I remembered Vitaly, his body shaking with the impact of the bullets and then lying in the dirt, staring at me with those big, accusing eyes before they clouded over and he was gone, and I remembered André Jr.'s burnt body, and I blindly reached for the bottle. The next morning, I awoke with a pounding headache and the stale, ugly taste of puke in my mouth. I remembered last night's conversation, even if I didn't remember much else. Somehow, the two of us must have made it back to his hotel room and to bed, and considering our level of intoxication, the facts that the sheets were stuck to my lower body and that my ass was on fire were almost a physical miracle. I carefully removed the sheets and made my way to the bathroom, meeting a pair of bloodshot eyes in the mirror. When I returned to the bedroom fifteen minutes later, cleaned, shaved and vaguely resembling a human being again, Jack was awake, if barely. \"How did we get back here?\" he asked, in lieu of a 'good morning'. I shrugged. \"No idea. I can't remember anything after the first vodka. Or was that tequila? Well, whatever came after the whiskey.\" It was a lie, because I did remember what I told him, and I couldn't believe I'd been so stupid. Instinctively, I knew that it was going to nip me in the butt eventually. I'd used up too many 'get out of jail free' tickets already. No one was that lucky. But if he remembered about the gun and the murder I confessed, he didn't mention it. \"Yeah, well. I think my memories get rather fuzzy even before that,\" he said; and I didn't know if it was the truth or if he was lying through his teeth like I had been. Either way, that was the last time either of us mentioned that night. Then again, it wasn't long before it all went to hell, anyway. The problem with sleeping with the enemy was not that you forgot he was the enemy, but rather that you were lulled into a treacherous feeling of safety by the assumption that you knew him well enough to predict his next move. Ultimately, the destructive factor wasn't necessarily trust – it was routine. Of course, I had known that. Everyone knows that. But knowing something and acting accordingly are two different kinds of beasts. The deal that led me to Iraq was a precarious one, more so than usually, as General Southern's insistence to accompany me to the initial approach suggested. I had made sure that there would be no interruption. As far as Jack knew, the meeting between me and my client wouldn't happen for another twenty-hours, the rendezvous two hundred miles from where it actually was. Jack would have received this information from one of his usual sources, a man he trusted – as much as anyone trusts anyone else in this business – because he'd provided him with valid intel in the past. The bread crumbs I'd laid out for Jack were fool-proof enough to guarantee me a smooth ride. In fact, as there actually was another, if minor, deal tomorrow, which Jack was probably going to mess up, he would never even know that I had lead him on. It was a good plan. It was a solid plan. To this date, I still don't know what went wrong. Maybe Jack knew that his source was on my pay roll. Maybe one of my people was on his pay roll. Maybe someone in the military had been talking to the wrong people. Shit, maybe I had been talking in my sleep. The why and how didn't really matter, because suddenly, right after Southern and me had sat down with my client to discuss the bare bones of the deal, the ground was swarming with SWAT guys who poked at us with M16's and yelled for us to lie down on the ground. On of my client's bodyguards failed to comply. It wasn't pretty. So, there we were, two dozen Iraqis, a handful US soldiers, Southern and me, lying in the dirt while Jack fucking Valentine strode past us as if he owned the world. I hated him a bit, back then. I hated him even more after he snapped Southern in handcuffs and read him his rights and then failed to do the same to me. Instead, he gave me a mock salute and – as if that weren't enough – a cheerful, \"Thanks, mate,\" which earned me a glare from my client that said 'You're dead' and a no less threatening look from Southern. Within ten minutes, Jack had managed to destroy two decades of trust I'd built up with the caution of a game of jackstraws. Of course, that alone had been the point of the exercise. Jack knew as well as I did that men like Southern would never see the inside of a court room. He would most likely never even see the inside of an interrogation room. If he continued to believe, however, that I'd sold him out or even that the botched up deal was somehow my fault, I was so deep in shit that I might as well buy myself diving equipment. After trying (more or less successfully – after all, I was still alive) to reason with my client that I definitely had no hand in the harsh interruption of our deal, I was in a hurry to get out of the country. I wasn't sure whether to admire Jack's courage or to abhor his insolence when he walked up to me in a crowded bar, just as I was about to call in a favor with an old friend, and offered to give me a ride home. In a less public place, I might have punched him. Or maybe not. There's no way of knowing how you'd react in the spur of the moment. When we finally were in a less public place, my thirst for physical violence had dulled enough that instead of throwing a punch, I pushed him with his back against the door and tore off his shirt. It was the only time we ever had angry sex, all bruises and frustration and resentment. Who we were and what we did had always played into the reasons why we were doing this, but that night, it was all it was about: a brutal display of our mutual antipathy, just another level of fighting our private little war. But then, I was on lost ground. It was easy for him to graciously let me have the upper hand and allow me to fuck him into the wall when he had already won. And of course, he knew that. It was in every smirk, hiding behind every mocking gesture of submission. I emptied my lust inside of him, but the anger remained, strong as ever. He laughed in my face when I accused him of sabotaging me, as if I had told a particularly saucy joke. \"You know what's going to happen? They're going to blast my ass from here to Africa. I can't be trusted anymore, so I've fucking lost my use. You want me dead? Is it that?\" He was oddly calm in the face of my rage. \"I don't want you dead. I just want you to fucking stop running guns!\" There was a world of meaning between the words, which I chose to ignore and refused to interpret. \"And then what? I'm gone, someone else takes my place. You can't stop them all.\" \"No, maybe not. But as you like to say – you're fucking good at what you do. I'll just hope that whoever takes your place won't be as good.\" It was a fucking backhanded compliment, even though I didn't recognize it as such, back then. I think maybe Jack didn't either. \"You want me to stop? You should have let your man take my head off in Sierra Leone.\" I heard him call, \"Maybe I should have\" after me when I left, slamming the door behind myself. And that was how we left things between us. I used to be mad at Ava for the quiet, wordless way she left me, blaming her for never giving me a chance to talk it over or explain myself, but after the confrontation with Jack, I realized that maybe I should consider the silent nature of Ava's goodbye a small mercy. For the next seven months, I didn't get to see Jack at all. I didn't miss him, exactly, but at the same time I couldn't stop mentally replaying that last fight. If any good came out of it, it was that Jack stopped bothering me. He let me do my job – a job that, thanks to him, had become a hell of a lot more difficult, because while I could avoid the worst and talk myself out of all immediate suspicion, people were suddenly wary about trusting me. After all, even if it hadn't been part of my plan, if I hadn't been able to stop an Interpol agent from trailing me once, who could give any sort of guarantee that it wouldn't happen again? Ironically enough, it was in West Africa that we met again. In the light of the recent development, I'd renewed my contact with Baptiste. There was a certain wariness between us, too, which hadn't been there before, but it had nothing to do with Jack's little stunt in Iraq. The loss of his son had changed Andy as, I imagine, the loss of Vitaly had changed me. Doing business with him went as smoothly as it always had, though. When I returned to my hotel room, the curtains were drawn. I found Jack sitting at the table, staring at me intently across the room. There was some shift in his eyes, some kind of restlessness darkening the gray. Otherwise, he didn't acknowledge my presence. \"Jack, old buddy. What gives me the pleasure of your company tonight?\" I joked as I slipped off my shoes and shrugged off the jacket. I felt tired and filthy, but even though a scorching shower and a good night's sleep sounded heavenly right then, I doubted I'd get either of them for a while, judging from the expression on Jack's face. Something was wrong, and I was torn between the desire to know and the desire not to. I stopped stripping and sat down across from him, the table a strong, physical barrier between us. Jack still hadn't moved, or spoken; and it was just starting to creep me out a bit. \"So?\" From up close, I could see that his lower lip was colored in an angry shade of red. There was a trace of almost dried blood in the middle. I got the impression he'd been chewing on it for a while. Who knows how long he'd been sitting here, in the dark. Finally, he spoke. \"Do you think it's wrong, morally, to take the confession of a drunken man and use it against them?\" My first instinct was to ridicule the fact that he was asking me of all people about a matter of morals. I was hardly an authority on that. Then the impact of his words hit home, and I felt myself freezing from the inside, cold dread heavy like a stone on my chest. If my life had been a movie, the camera would have zoomed in now. There might have been a long close-up sequence, and some angsty emo-ballad playing in the background. Maybe they'd even give me a flashback or one of those insightful voice-overs I disliked so much, because I couldn't conceive how anyone would come up with meaningful ramblings in situations when all I could think was, 'Holy fuck.' I swallowed, realizing that this was the point I knew would come, and I'd be damned if I took this blow with anything but the serenity I'd reserved for it. \"That depends… I guess. If you just filled the guy up to get him to reveal his secrets, yes. If you got shit-faced together and he was dumb enough to tell you stuff he shouldn't have told you… then I'd say it's his own fucking fault.\" \"Nothing wrong with it, then?\" He looked up to me with haunted eyes, the guilt in them almost palpable. I shrugged, giving Jack the answer I thought he wanted to hear: \"Not from where I stand.\" Jack nodded, quietly, unnerving me with his silence. \"Fuck, Jack, what's your problem? You want absolution? You got it! Shit, I'll even congratulate you. You should be fucking cheering . You got what you wanted – the ultimate proof to bring me down, and this time I'll hang for it. Literally, probably.\" There was no mirth in my laughter, even though I thought that the irony of the situation was rather funny. Jack, on the other hand, didn't seem to appreciate it. The man looked like a fucking statue, sitting rigidly in his chair with a dead serious expression, instead of celebrating his victory like he should. \"So, why are you looking like someone just killed your firstborn?\" He looked away, averting his eyes like a man who couldn't face up what he was about to do – or maybe what he'd already done - and suddenly, I understood. \"You think I'm going to tell on you… is it that? Are you afraid that I'll spill the beans that Interpol Agent Jack Valentine let an illegal arms dealer and murderer fuck him through the mattress on a regular base? Don't worry. I won't tell a soul! This has always been private. For me, anyway. Nothing to do with anything.\" Jack laughed sharply. \"You're guarding my secrets, huh? That's funny.\" \"And why is that?\" I asked, suddenly tired. I didn't understand what was so funny when I've just handed him the perfect parting gift – absolution and lack of consequence – on a silver plate. \"Because I'm guarding yours.\" For the first time since I'd entered the room, he looked me in the eye, while his hands produced a small plastic bag he slid over the table to me. There was a gun inside. \"You'd better get rid off it.\" When I ran my hand across my face, it was shaking. I might have muttered a string of Ukrainian curses under my breath. I might have seen my life flashing in front of my eyes. I might even have fought down tears. Or maybe not. I cannot remember either way. Those long moments after he handed me the gun are blanks in my mind. I do remember looking up to him and holding his gaze, though; and in that second, I realized that, for once, Jack wasn't making any demands. He could have held this over my head and used it to make me do anything – turn myself in, stop running guns, go legal – and he didn't. He had my freedom… shit, he had my fucking life in his hands and he handed it back to me freely, nothing asked in return. I continue to stare at him, trying to decipher what exactly this means. He calmly holds my gaze. I think that maybe it's time I gave him what he wants. End.

He said the guns were going to get to the people who wanted them one way or another, and why not be through him? I got that much. That part was the easy part. Money held a certain sway over Yuri just as it did me, but I never went looking for the most dangerous way to earn a dishonest buck. I cooked for my dad, for Christ's sake, though he complained about it not being \"kosher\" enough for him. We're not even Jewish, and he's complaining about shellfish. Yuri, though. He went searching for the trouble. I always thought the violence around our house would have scared him as much as it did me, but it just got him thinking about a change in careers. \"Restaurants exist because people need to eat,\" he told me once, \"Why not fill another human need: the need to die?\" The honest curiosity he had with the weapons trade was just a little disturbing. Like I said, he went looking for trouble, and he dragged me along with him. I mean, come on, he's my big brother. He'd been looking out for me since I was too little to remember. That's what big brothers do. When you grow up in a family like ours, you never think your brother could lead you down the wrong path. But he did. Somehow he did. I still don't know why I didn't just fly home after the first incident with those kids, but I stuck around with him. Saved his ass a few times, if I do say so myself. I though he needed me, and I was right on occasion. Plus he never thought to pick up a Neatherlands flag. He took care of me, even after I screwed up my life even more than before with the \"gift\" from that drug lord. I guess I was just looking to try it, though I'm not sure why I wanted to. Just something new, I guess. He made sure I could get by, no matter the circumstances surrounding my troubles. He had a habit of chasing my girlfriends off through. Still don't get that one. After all, Angel and Candy never did anything to him, did they? I didn't want to help him anymore, but he asked me to go with him to Africa again. I hadn't been there in years and wasn't the most eager to go back. I had no reason to, but Yuri's my brother. If he needed my help, I would help him even if I hated it. Bad idea. That village... Those people.... I felt bad betraying my brother like that. The grenade was the first thing I managed to get my hand on, and it worked. I guess I should have learned to run faster. I was no track star, especially that day. You know, I don't think I can ever forget that feeling at the end even now. That doesn't bother me that bad. It's my brother's face that I keep remembering. I don't know what happened to him after that, but I hope he was alright.

It follows Sam on his life after and the internal struggle he faces with feeling as if he was the reason Frodo is dead. This is my first fan fiction so go easy on me XD. Disclaimer: none of these character are mine, don't sue me please. \"There it is Mr. Frodo, the opening to mount Doom.\" Sam says with an exhausted excitement. 6 months of travel had finally lead them to their destination, atop the only thing that could destroy the ring of power forever, the fires of mount Doom. It had been a long adventure, Frodo and Sam were as far from the shire as they had ever been, but the task was still not yet complete. Both were beyond exhausted, but they trekked the final steps to the Door of Mount Doom together, how they started this journey. \"Here we are, the rest is up to you.\" Samwise said. Frodo approached the edge of the cliff, and looked into the fire. He stood for many moments just holding the ring, looking at it. Had the ring taken too much of a toll on Frodo? Had it spoiled his mind? Sam could sense Frodo's hesitation. \"What are you waiting for? Throw it in the fire!\" With the deepest look of darkness Sam had ever witnessed on the face of Frodo he exclaimed, \"No.\" Ripping the ring from the chain neckless he had been using to hold it, Frodo took it and put it on, causing him to disappear into thin air. Just as that happened Smeagol entered the passage to the Mountain, sneaking up behind Samwise he knocked him down with a rock he was holding. With Sam out of the way, Smeagol surveyed the area. In the dirt he could see the footsteps of Frodo, without a second thought Smeagol ran and leaped on top of Frodo. The two scuffled, until Smeagol caught the hand of Frodo. In his pure thirst for the ring, Smeagol bit the finger of Frodo off along with the ring. Frodo reappeared bleeding profusely from his finger, while Smeagol dance with joy as he was finally reunited with his precious. Frodo wasn't done though, he grabbed at the ring. Again the too fought for the ring pulling, scratching, doing whatever it takes to reobtain the ring that had grown on both of them. In the struggle the too fell from the cliff. Frodo grabbed onto a protruding rock, saving himself from eminent death. Smeagol was less lucky falling into the pit of fire, but he died with his precious in his hand, the only way he'd want to go out. Samwise still a bit out of it from the head shot he had taken rushed to Frodo's aid. \"Grab my hand Mr. Frodo.\" Frodo reached but Sam's hand was just out of reach. \"Don't let go Frodo.\" Samwise wasn't ready to lose his best friend. Frodo's eyes seemed empty, hopeless. But he had traveled this far, given so much to this journey he couldn't give up like this. With everything he had left he swung his bloody hand up and interlocked it with Sam's. \"I knew I hadn't lost you Frodo.\" Samwise said. But as Samwise tried to pull Frodo up their grip seemed to loosen. The blood had made their hands slippery and connection weak. As their hands slipped more and more from each other, the hopelessness resurfaced in Frodo's eyes. \"I've got you Frodo! Hold on!\" Sam said, but did not fully believe his own words. The long journey had been too much, even with every ounce of will and determination they had, it was not enough. Their hands slipped from each other. With all his weight being supported by one hand, Frodo couldn't hold on any longer. He fell back into the fire. \"FRODOOOOO!\" Samwise couldn't believe what he saw. Frodo was gone, but he had been gone from the moment he came in contact with the ring. From the very first moment the ring had taken part of him, so maybe it was right that Frodo would go with the ring. This was not how Samwise felt though. He had gone on this adventure to protect Frodo, and he failed. Sam wanted to sit and cry, but with the Mountain beginning to erupt due to the destruction of the ring he hadn't a moment to grieve. Running from the entrance he found high ground immediately, a large rock that towered a bit above the rest. The lava began to surround him though, he feared this would be the end of him too. Then like and angel I the sky, Gandalf spotted him. Soaring above on his Griffin he swooped down and scooped Sam. \"Where is Frodo?\" Gandalf asked, but Sam's expression said it all. Without another word they escaped Mordor. Weeks later Samwise woke from his long rest, which was well earned after a physically and emotionally hard journey. \"Sam! You're awake\" Pippen said, he hadn't been able to talk to his friend since they're separation at the great river after being attacked by Uruk-Hai. Once Sam became fully aware of his surroundings, he noticed he was accompanied by all his friends, Pippen, Mary, Gandalf, Legolas, and even Aragon. But the room seemed empty without the most important friend of his, Frodo. Nothing in Sam's life seemed important anymore. After the war there was nothing left for him in middle earth. For month he didn't even leave his home. Many rumors started to swarm around the shire about Samwise, like that he had gone insane, that he left to live with humans, and even that he let Frodo die on purpose because he was jealous of the attention that Frodo had received from the ring. The children would play, seeing who would dare to step the closest to his door. But what was happening inside was between Sam and himself, well in his head between him and Frodo. Because in Sam's insanity Frodo hadn't died that day at mount Doom, he was still alive and thriving. \"Good morning Mr. Frodo, what would you like for breakfast?\" Sam said speaking to an empty chair at his dinner table. \"Eggs and Caragor meat again? Ok you're choice Mr. Frodo but I don't know how you eat this everyday\" Sam took care of \"Frodo\" for months catering his every need, until one day an old friend stopped by to check on Sam. A knock on the door caught Sam's attention. With the highest amount of security Sam checked out the window to see who was at his door, to his surprise it was Gandalf. \"Gandalf, what a kind surprise to see you, Frodo will be ecstatic when he sees you!\" \"Frodo?\" Gandalf was aware Sam had lost himself a bit, but to this extent? He was not sure how to handle this \"Yes, he's sleeping right now, but we can wake him.\" \"Hmm, I would love to see Frodo.\" Sam took him to his guest room, an empty room with a bed placed in the corner. \"Sorry, to wake you Mr. Frodo, but look who's here to visit.\" Curiously Gandalf inspected Sam's actions. He decided to take a direct approach to this situation. \"Lets let him sleep Samwise, come sit, I'd love some honey cake after my venture here.\" Sam and Gandalf make their way to the kitchen and sit. \"So, Sam, how long has Frodo been staying with you?\" \"Oh, about 3 months now, he's had a tough time adapting to a normal life after the war.\" \"Apparently so have you Sam.\" \"What does that mean….\" \"Sam. I don't know how else to say this. Frodo has been dead for 4 months now, he died that day on mount Doom.\" \"That can't be true… Frodo isn't dead, why he's in my guest bed right now.\" \"No Sam, he isn't you saw him fall into the Lava.\" \"No you're wrong, leave now! Leave me!\" \"I didn't want to do this Sam, but you leave me no choice.\" With a swift move of his staff Gandalf hit Sam in the head, enchanting him with a cognitive spell. In a moment the events of the Journey ran through Sam's mind. From the moment the Fellowship of the Ring was formed to Frodo's death. \"Wow…he really is gone, I can't believe this.\" \"Sam, I'm taking Bilbo with me to the undying land, I think it is best you come with us, there's nothing here for you but mourning.\" \"okay, whatever you think is best Gandalf….\" \"Pack you're things, I'll be here in the morning to take you with me.\" But that would be the last time Gandalf, or anyone for that matter saw Samwise. When Gandalf came the next day, Sam's things were untouched. It was practically like he vanished. Some say he went to jump into mount Doom to be with Frodo, some say he's still wondering middle earth convinced Frodo is out there still. But truth is no one knows what happened to him. It's just another mystery of middle earth.

Please Read and Review! Devin's POV Chapter 1 \"Gabby?\" I said. \"Yeah?\" She said \"What if they aren't coming back and all we get is a 'Thanks'?\" \"Then we will have to except their choice of forgetting us and move on.\" \"When did you get so wise and deep?\" \"Since I learned how to say NO.\" \"Well all the more power to you. Will you miss them?\" \"I'll miss them all, especially Mason.\" She got a weird dreamy look on her face. \"Hey! What happened to all the mystical crap of having to 'accept their choice of forgetting us' and all that other nonsense?\" \"Hey just because I said that we have to let them go doesn't mean I don't get to miss them.\" She snapped at me. \"Sorry I'm just lashing out at you because I'm pissed that all they said was 'Thanks' who just says thanks? I kind of want to go to the studio and yell at them.\" \"Me too but it wouldn't be right it's their decision and it's not like they met us under their own free will, eight it doesn't mean they have to like us.\" \"I guess. But then what was that kiss?\" \"Honestly? I don't know.\" She sounded defeated \"Maybe he just kissed me in hopes of using his charming abilities to get me to untie him and you know what?\" \"What?\" Gabby looked a little afraid of what was going to come out of my mouth next. She probably knew I was going to say something I was going to regret and that thought was going to worm itself into my brain and make me paranoid forever but really I didn't care because I was getting into full on rampage mode. \"He probably could sing without lip singing but he made up a big lie just so he could get out without having to sing for us and when that didn't work he finally gave up and sung for us!\" \"But then why was his record company so surprised to hear him sing?\" \"Because he probably already called them on the way over here with Lincoln and told them to act surprised!\" \"Stop thinking like that! You're talking crazy talk. I'm sorry I let this conversation go on this long.\" After that conversation we didn't talk about 5 Leo Rise any more. They didn't call and we didn't try to call them. Though I suspected that Gabby tried to get a hold of Mason a couple times because after she went to do a phone call at my house sometimes she would come back crying. And when I asked her what she was crying about she would just change the subject. I really couldn't blame her. She missed Mason. He stole her heart. At least the guy who stomped on mine had the decency to say 'thanks' and then leave. Though it's not much better, all she got was a head wave. Now I know dads and moms say this all the time about who their children date if they don't come up to their standards but I have to say this about Mason he was good enough for her but now that he's gone and has left a trail of Gabby broken heart in his wake he is never to come near her without him at least apologizing first. In a very large way A/N Now the next chapter will be in Ritchie's POV Don't forget to review! You don't have to and I will keep posting even if you don't![Chapter 2] Ritchie's POV \"Come on its only been two weeks since we left. Stop mopping Mason.\" I said. He shouldn't be mopping he chose to walk out and never come back. It's not like he didn't have a choice. We gave him the option-Keep going to the hotel or Go back and say goodbye. \"She hasn't even tried to call!\" \"Um, I'm pretty sure she did try and get a hold of you. She had called everyday for the past week. You never wanted to pick up her calls.\" \"Well I was afraid that I was going to sound stupid and not apologize to her properly.\" \"Well you could just text her that sentence, you know.\" \"Maybe I will. So how come you're not sad that she hasn't called\" \"Because I know if I try to call Devin that I'll get my eardrums blown out by her rampage of screaming.\" \"That doesn't explain why you're not sad that she hasn't called or even texted you.\" \"Whatever. I'm going to go talk to Scooter.\" I said and then I started walking out the door. \"You can't keep hiding your feelings for Devin and when she moves on because you didn't at least talk to her DON'T COME CRYING TO ME!\" That was the last thing I heard from Mason before I walked out the door to go find Scooter and Danielle. \"Hey, Ritchie.\" Scooter and Danielle said in unison. They are always doing that, like they can't speak without the other one. \"So Danielle have you heard anything about Devin?\" I asked hopefully she can get me the inside scoop into what Devin's doing without me hiring a private detective. \"Yeah you broke her heart. So now she thinks you made up the whole 'I can't sing in front of crowds thing' just so you can get out of being kidnapped and not having to do the show. Is that what you wanted to know about my sister?\" \"Well I was hoping for a more positive outlook but beggars can't be choosers. Oh and one more question?\" \"What\" she asked suspicacly \"When are you and Scooter getting married?\" \"Next month in Italy. Why?\" \"No reason, no reason at all.\"[Chapter 3] Devin's POV My phone was ringing but it was like six in the morning and I really didn't want to get out of bed and pick it up. But I knew who was calling because only one person calls me at this hour. I didn't really want to get up and talk to her but I knew if I didn't she'll call the house and then I'll get the lecture of a lifetime. Because dad needs his eight hours of beauty sleep. And he can't be bothered of getting up at six to take my sisters phone calls. So I begrudgingly got up to get the phone. \"What?\" I practically growled. \"Is that any way to talk to your sister who took time out of her day to call you?\" \"Yes because you purposely called me at six in the morning. You do understand the concept of time change right?\" \"Whatever. I need to talk to you quickly.\" \"Why?\" \"Because Ritchie will be up soon.\" \"And why is that a problem?\" \"Because I don't want him to hear this convo and get excited.\" \"Okay so get on with it\" \"I don't want to admit this to mom and dad but I need help with the wedding. I just can't seem to get anything right and since it's in Italy I don't want to get the customs wrong. And I know if I say anything to mom and dad then they'll try and talk me into a backyard wedding in America.\" \"Okay get to the point.\" \"Since you're my Maid Of Honor and Gabby's one of my Bridesmaids I was hoping that you could fly out here and live with us for the rest of the month. And before you say schools in the way I know for a fact that school let out yesterday.\" \"Do you live with Ritchie and everyone else?\" \"Yes but we have a guest room for you and Gabby and you can totally avoid him.\" \"First you have to talk to dad.\" \"I will I will I'm soooo excited! And with that she hung up. She didn't bother to say goodbye. I heard the phone ringing in the other room and I heard dad groan. Wow she wastes no time with that phone call. A/NOkay so I know the chapters are short but the next one is in Ritchie's POV it'll be longer I promise![Chapter 4] Ritchie's POV \"Who were you talking to?\" I ask groggily. I know it's early because Danielle never gets up before me. But she does get up early to call Devin because she knows I'll be asleep. \"For your information I'm talking to my father is that such a crime?\" She looks at me like she is about to have a major freak-out. I give her an 'I didn't know' look. She storms out of the house. I hope Scooter can calm her down before breakfast because if she's upset during breakfast we all have to fend for ourselves. And five guys in the kitchen at once is not a good idea. I decide to warn Scooter than go take a shower. \"Hey Scooter!\" \"Go away it's like eight in the morning!\" He yelled from under the sheets. \"So what? Get dressed your girlfriend is upset. She looked like she was about to cry when I saw her. What did you forget your sixth week anniversary?\" I guessed jokingly He looked at me seriously for like two seconds and the proceeds to say \"Crap did I?\" \"Just go talk to her.\" After I'm done with my shower and getting dressed I can smell bacon. Well Danielle must be in a good mode because she only makes us bacon when she's super happy. I walk down the hallway. When I get to the dining room I see Nickoli, KK, Mason, and Scooter all sitting and looking at Danielle, who's at the head of the table. \"Good now that all of you are here. I would like to announce something very important.\" We all shake our heads at her encouraging her to go on. \"Well Devin and Gabby are staying here until the wedding.\" KK, Nickoli and Scooter shrug, Mason screams WHOO-HOO, and I say well at least I don't have to ruin the wedding. \"Well the thing is Ritchie I kind of told them that there was a guest room.\" \"What? There isn't a single room of space here.\" \"Well I was thinking that I would give up my office and you and Devin move in to that.\" \"But ME and Mason share\" \"Do you want to get back together with Devin or not?\" \"Fine, Fine\" When are they coming?\" \"Friday.\" Okay Skip to two weeks later. Devin's POV When we step into Danielle's house, all pandemonium breaks loose. Nickoli and KK are in the front room playing video games. Scooter is waiting in a recliner for us. In addition, he just happens to yell, \"The girls are home!\" Yes, this place I will be calling home for the next couple of months or if Danielle gets creative with dad, we might just stay in the Danielle Vortex forever. I still do not know how Danielle managed to talk our overly protective father into letting me stay here. Nevertheless, she always was the favorite. Mason and Ritchie come running down the stairs but when they see us, they slow down hoping they can look casual. Of course, since we have seen hem running we know they are eager to see us. They look like they want to kneel on the ground and beg for forgiveness. I will not say that I do not want them to but of course, I will not make them. They know they deserve to be yelled and screamed at and I cannot say that I will not but I know I will not do it in this house and will not do it in front of other people. I can say that Gabby will not yell or scream at Mason. She looks like she wants to jump into his arms and make-out. Now I will not be prejudice and say I do not want to do that to but I will make Ritchie wait it out for 3-5 days. You know Standard procedure with your boyfriend. Nevertheless, Ritchie is not my boyfriend but that is an unimportant detail, for now. Ritchie's POV in this scenario Mason and I were just getting settled in my 'room'. Of course, Danielle held off until the last minute to move all of her stuff out of the office. When we heard the door open we just a summoned Scooter had gotten back from doing whatever he does when he's not with Danielle making wedding plans. But when he screamed out 'The girls are home!' me and Mason went running down the stairs in a flash but when we saw the girls were already inside not in the car we slowed our pace. We tried to assume being casual but we all knew that they had seen our eager paces. Mason and I were whipped and we knew it. My face felt like a dogs face when it knew it was being scolded. Moreover, Masons face looked like it. When he saw Gabby, his face got a dreamy look on it and Gabby got dreamy too. Devin however, her eyes got fiery and I knew either I would get the silent treatment or I would get the yelling of a lifetime. I think I preferred the yelling because then it would be over quicker and she would at least be talking to me. I knew I needed to apologize and soon.[Chapter 5] Ritchie's POV I tried to talk to her. I did truly. She did not want to hear it. Gabby ran to mason he apologized and she forgave him really wasn't really that big of a deal even though she only kissed mason once and that was just to spite Devin he still fell in love her. I kind of wonder when he is going to say 'I love you'. Nevertheless, Gabby and Devin and are opposites. If Gabby runs to mason, Devin stays far away from me. \"Come on you can't ignore me forever.\" \"Uh, yes I can.\" \"No.\" \"Yes\" \"No\" \"Yes\" \"NEVER!\" \"I'm super sorry. If it helps I wanted to go back and I tried to call but your dad said never to call again.\" \"My dad would never say that.\" \"He did next time you call him ask him.\" \"Come on don't make me doubt him because I know your lying.\" \"Ask Danielle she was in the room when I called because I used her cell phone. You have to believe me. When have I ever lied to you?\" \"I don't know. I have to ask Danielle.\" She started to head in Danielle's direction I silently followed. \"'When' Ritchie tried to call me did dad say never to call again?\" Danielle replied with \"Yeah he was crushed for like a three weeks. I think Scooter has pictures. Ritchie wouldn't sing for a week in till they forced him or did they threaten to kick him out of the band? Yeah they did both.\" Danielle started to tug at my shirt. \"I want this shirt for the laundry in thirty-seconds\" I stuttered \"but-but-but\" \"Shut up its like seven a clock at night go change in to your pajamas.\" \"Fine\" I peeled my shirt off and gave it to her. I didn't realize Devin was still there and I didn't really realize she had never seen me with my shirt off. Devin's POV When Ritchie took off his shirt, my mouth dropped. I mean he had a six-pack for god's sake. I guess he didn't realize I was still here because when he turned around he looked kind of guilty, like it was a sin to take your shirt off in front of me. Well it might be if I was religious but thankfully, I'm not. Then before Danielle left the room, \"Devin you'll be sharing a room with Ritchie because Mason and Gabby want to stay together\" and then she left the room. Ritchie put up his hands as if I accused him of arranging this arrangement. \"It wasn't my idea I swear. But I would totally understand if you wanted me to move in with Mason and you with Gabby\" I had already decided I was going to forgive him but I was going to withhold this information for right now. \"No its fine just show me where it is.\" \"Well if it's any consolation we get the biggest room next to the master bedroom.\" \"Sure\" I said sarcastically He led me up the stairs and three rooms past the stairs we came to a stop in front of I guess was going to be 'my room'. \"Here go in first. The bathroom is a couple doors down.\" \"That's cool\" It was a basic room but it had flare I had to say it had a deep blue paint on the wall with a deep purple trimming. I liked. There was a bunk bed in the room. \"It was either this or a queen sized bed. I did not think anyone would appreciate you sleeping in the same bed as me. Plus it was already here before.\" \"That's cool. Do you want top or bottom?\" I was secretly hoping for the top because whenever me and had to use a bunk bed she would always get the top. \"Well you could have the top if you want but I'm good with either.\" I smiled somewhat shyly. \"I'll take the top.\" \"Okay I'll go get your stuff from the front room.\" Yeah I forgot that I left my all my stuff in the front room. While he was gone, I climbed up to the top bunk. I like it up here. It was cozy. Ritchie came back. I then realized that he never put a shirt back on. I then voiced this concern. \"Maybe you should put a shirt on.\" He looked at me sheepishly and then put a shirt on. He said, \"The top two drawers in the dresser and the left side of the closet is your space. I will let you unpack. If you're hungry just come down and someone can make you something.\" He left the room. Wow, he was thoughtful. We had a closet that lined the left wall facing the bunk bed. The north wall had a whole window for the wall. The closet was huge and I still had to fill in the two dresser draws. My stuff barely filled up the closet. Well it might be time for a shopping trip. It was three hours after I finished in my room. I just stared out the window a lot. I went down stairs I am sure Gabby was already asleep because it is like one in the morning my old time. I told them I was going to bed. Ritchie was about to head off because he was going to baby sit the neighbor kid tomorrow very early. That was sweet. When we got upstairs, I got my pajamas and was going to change in the bathroom. Ritchie was going to change in the room. When I got back, Ritchie was in bed staring in to space. I went and lay down next to him. \"What are you thinking about?\" \"I was thinking about what I would have to do to get you to accept my apology.\" \"But I already have.\" \"Why?\" \"Because at least you tried to contact all I really wanted.\" \"Well you could have told me earlier. But I don't blame you that you didn't.\" He kissed the top of my head. I Liked that. I soon fell asleep in his arms. His chuckle was the last thing I heard.

We see them beat him in Battleships, Clue, the vibrating Electric Football and Twister. Did you know they tried a few other games as well in between? For purposes of this story the Grim Reaper is abbreviated \"GR\". Game On Growling, the Grim Reaper (\"GR\") swiped the football player figures off the vibrating field. \"Best of seven?\" asked Bill S. Preston, Esq. GR had already welshed on his offer twice to release them from death; there was no reason to believe he wouldn't do it again. \"Damn right!\" death's representative shouted, angry at being beaten again by the two. ... The two faced each other in the dimly lit room, a single overhead light illuminating their struggle. GR and Ted \"Theodore\" Logan looked not at their opponent, but at the multi-colored cubes in their hands as they twisted and turned, pausing to think before resuming in sporadic bursts of effort. \"Come on Ted, first one to finish wins\" Bill encouraged. \"I got the blue side and the white side, but I keep messing up with the yellow\" he said. \"I've got four sides\" GR laughed, holding up his cube for a moment to boast. \"You missed one in the middle, dude\" Ted pointed out. GR examined his cube, found the square out of place and gave out an anguished \"Arrrgh!\" before returning to the challenge. An hour later neither had made much progress. \"So Death, call it a draw?\" Ted offered. \"We draw and I count the game as a loss for you\" GR grinned. \"No way! You said we stay here forever if we lose . No one loses in a draw\" Bill argued. \"It's almost like a tie.\" \"A technicality; you didn't win.\" \"Shall we take it up with...Him?\" Ted asked, looking upward. GR hesitated. \"Errr, no...only because I don't want to take too long\" he explained. Bill leaned over and whispered \"It's eternity down here and he's worried about time? Sounds like he's scared of the boss\" to Ted. Both snickered. \"Shut up! What do we play next?\" GR complained. ... \"Is there...a 'G'?\" Bill asked. \"No 'G' in it\" GR grinned. He drew a leg on the stick figure below the gallows. He looked at his notes: _ E _ H _ R before continuing with his guess. \"Is there...a 'T'?\" he asked confidently. Bill and Ted both grinned. \"No 'T' dude\" Bill said as he added an arm to the stick figure he was drawing. \"One more arm to go!\" He looked at his notes: _ E A T _ \"Is there an 'H'?\" he asked. \"There...is an 'H'\" GR sighed. Ted gave Bill a high five before he wrote down the letter. \"Playing Hangman with the Grim Reaper; whoa!\" GR looked at the partial word in front of him again. \"Is there...no wait, I already guessed that one...what goes with an 'H'...is there a 'P'?\" Bill and Ted exchanged a solemn look, then broke into laughter. \"No 'P'! You're hung, man\" Bill announced as he drew the last arm. \"Wait, you still have to put fingers on the end of the arms...\" \"No way, you lost again! By the way, was your word 'Death'? Gotta say, kind of a giveaway\" Ted taunted. \"We are most victorious again!\" \"What was your word? No vowels except an 'E', it can't be a word.\" \"Zephyr, dude.\" \"There is no such word.\" \"Sure, it's a wind thing. And a Mercury too I think, my aunt had one\" Bill said smugly. \"Best five out of nine, right?\" Ted asked. \"Since you insist\" GR mumbled. ... \"What do you mean forfeit?\" GR asked. \"Your most heinous act of cutting the tetherball rope with your scythe ended the game after the ball rolled into those flames\" Ted scolded. \"Equipment abuse means forfeit.\" \"It wasn't my fault, it just sticks up so far and when the ball came around...\" \"We totally understand,\" Bill added \"you totally rock the look with it; you just have to lay it down sometimes.\" \"Lay it down? Lay it down? You don't know what type of people are down here...it would disappear just like that!\" GR bemoaned, snapping his fingers to accentuate his plea. \"How do you know so much about tetherball anyway?\" \"San Dimas Elementary 5th grade champion!\" Ted did an air guitar riff and Bill joined in. \"Get a locker next time dude. Up for another go?\" \"Bring it on.\" ... All three sat on the floor in a circle facing each other, separated by several feet. \"You lose.\" \"No I don't. Look at the floor; do you see any left?\" GR demanded. \"Doesn't matter,\" Bill countered \"you know the rules. Me and Ted got to fivesies, you didn't so you lose.\" \"But I picked them all up! Do you see any jacks on the floor?\" \"Check you hand\" Ted said flatly. Death opened his hand to reveal four jacks and a rubber ball. There was no fifth jack. \"I...I...don't understand it. I'm not cheating!\" \"Now check your sleeve\" Ted suggested. GR shook the right sleeve to his robe and a jack fell out. \"You swept it into your sleeve by mistake. It could happen to anyone...who wears death robes!\" Bill chortled. Their opponent growled. \"Know any other games?\" ... GR looked at the upturned card Bill had just played. A red five stared back at him from the table as he switched his gaze to his hand of three cards. His choice of a green five, a red seven and a yellow draw two lay before him. He tried to play the yellow draw two. \"Illegal card, death. Use another or draw\" Ted admonished. \"Sorry, my mistake\" GR covered as he took back the offending card; the ploy didn't work. He considered again. \"Any time you're ready\" Bill prodded. \"Don't rush me!\" He started to play the red seven, then switched and played the green five instead. Ted played a green reverse, a blue reverse, a blue skip while calling \"Uno!\" and then a draw four to finish the game. \"You're toast, dude!\" \"Now I remember why I hate card games!\" GR anguished as he threw down the two left in his hand. \"Give up yet?\" Bill asked as he leaned over. \"Not as long as I draw breath.\" \"Ted,\" Bill whispered \"does he even breathe?\" \"Sure he does, just take a whiff when he gets close.\" Bill inhaled deeply and held it for a moment before choking. \"Bogus\" he managed to croak out. \"Good thing there isn't a halitosis game, he'd win for sure\" Ted whispered back. \"Come on, get on with the next game\" Death said impatiently. \"How about a spin around 'The Game of Life' board?\" Bill leered. \"The Game of Life ? Now you're mocking me. Any game but that.\" \"Got a Twister game?\" The End A/N: Just an idea for a few more games they might have played before moving on to the final game of Twister.

They both could agree to that. While he had no idea at the time that their first meeting would ever amount to anything more than a chance encounter, he'd be hard pressed to say it hadn't left an impression, even if he didn't know he'd be seeing her again and again. Lori, the one he was supposed to have come for, was sitting on an air mattress, choking on a fruit snack that was, ironically, shaped as a coffin. At first, he'd hardly noticed the redhead sitting next to the choking brunette. After all, he often would arrive to complete his job with friends and family members surrounding the soon to be corpse. It was supposed to have been an easy job. In, choke to death, out. No problems, no worries. He'd done it thousands of times before. But then again, she had never been there to stop him, until now. \"Um, excuse you!\" the redhead cried, almost as soon as he'd entered the small apartment bedroom. \"She's not dying! Go away!\" He gestured to the brunette vaguely, as she continued to choke on the snack, fist on her stomach in an attempt to administer a self-heimlich. Why the redhead hadn't tried the heimlich maneuver on the other was none of his business. \"How did you get in here, anyway? The doors are all locked.\" \"I'm the grim reaper.\" Obviously. This redhead was an idiot. \"A mere locked door will not stop me from collecting her-\" He never got to finish his sentence \"Well, I already told you,\" the redhead was standing up now, hands on her hips defiantly \"she's not dying. So skedaddle.\" Lori, meanwhile,was still trying to get the gummy out of her tummy. At this point, neither Grim or the redhead were paying much attention. \"How about this,\" he smirked, \"I'll let her live, if, you can beat me at a game of Rock, Scissors, Paper.\" After all, he already determined she was an idiot. He'd be able to best her, and then make off with the corpse of brunette as if the confrontation had never happened. With a roll of her eyes and a sigh, the redhead replied \"Fine.\" His hand flew down as a fist. She'd bested him, her palm flat, as she moved it to cover his rock with her paper. He'd noticed, almost immediately, an unusual coldness to her touch. Warm enough to not be dead, mind you. But still...every other living thing he touched was much warmer; so warm that the contact made him uncomfortable. The temperature of the redhead's touch didn't make him want to recoil immediately. It was a nice warmth, one he could get used to, if he had any interest in touching her hand any longer. Which, of course, he did not. \"Paper beats rock.\" she stated boredly. \"Now let Lori live.\" Yanking his hand out from under hers, he frowned \"Best two out of three.\" Eyeing him impatiently, she responded \"That wasn't the deal.\" \"Fine.\" he groaned, his annoyance practically seeping through every pore. Lori coughed twice more, before the fruit snack dislodged from her throat. \"Thank fuck.\" she gasped, finally able to breath again. \"Don't thank 'fuck', thank me!\" Death cried \"I'm the one who spared you!\" \"Technically,\" the redhead spoke again. \"She should be thanking me for being good at Rock, Paper, Scissors.\" \"Rock Scissors Paper.\" Death corrected. Lori had had just about enough of it all \"Tomato, potato, either way, I'm not choking so it's all good!\" With a grimace, Death stated \"I suppose I should see myself out.\" \"Remember to lock the door behind you!\" both girls sang out in unison, causing a tingling sensation to run down his spine. He may have been the Grim Reaper, but some that didn't make him immune from being creeped out. It was only a week later when he saw her again. Once again, she was with the brunette, but this time, he was supposed to have come for both of them. One had started drowning in a theme park wave pool, and when the other tried to help, they'd both been pulled under. Both girls were unconscious, and both girls only came to in the cold stone walls of hell. As they were still wet from the wave pool, and only wearing bathing suits, he wasn't surprised that they were both shivering. \"I suspect you know why you're here.\" \"Here as in dead or here as in hell?\" the redhead, who his boss had identified as Mariah, asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Dead.\" he responded plainly. Lori's head whipped around as she cried \"Because someone just had to go in the wave pool, even though I told her that bad things happen in there!\" \"It's not my fault you don't like to have fun.\" Mariah snipped. Eyes widening, Lori yelled \"AND IT'S NOT MY FAULT WE'RE DEAD!\" Mariah rolled her eyes, turning her attention away from the brunette and back to Death himself. \"Look, I don't want to spend eternity shivering in a bikini. When Lori was choking last week, you let us play rock paper scissors-\" \"Rock scissors paper.\" he interrupted. Why couldn't she get it right? \"-whatever.\" the redhead's eyes rolled once more. He was starting to notice that she did that a lot. \"So what do you say? Another match for our lives?\" He was going to argue against her, but he also remembered the outcome of the previous week's game. She'd picked Paper as her first instinct, so all he needed to do was pick scissors. \"Deal.\" He held out two fingers to symbolize scissors. Unfortunately for him, Mariah's hand had formed a fist. Her hand, now even colder as she was actually deceased, unlike last week, came crashing down on top of his. \"Rock beats scissors! Now bring us back.\" Releasing his hand out from under hers once more, his eyes narrowed. \"You were the only one who beat me. The little one must win her way out.\" \"Does it have to be rock paper scissors?\" Lori questioned with a slight whine. Death was about to lose his mind \"ROCK SCISSORS PAPER!\" he cried, not unlike a child throwing a tantrum. As his eyes landed back on the girls, he immediately paused. Lori's mouth was agape, a look of confusion etched over her entire being. Mariah, meanwhile, had crossed her arms across her chest, one of her eyebrows lowered while the other was quirked up skeptically. Uh oh. He had done goofed. Clearing his throat, he responded \"But any game is fair game.\" \"Oh good!\" Lori beamed \"Cause I'm really good at Connect Four.\" Death nodded solemnly. \"On one condition.\" Lori nodded, waiting as he pointed towards Mariah \"she doesn't get to help.\" \"The heck am I supposed to do, then?\" Mariah questioned. \"Sit there and provide commentary?\" \"That's all you ever do, anyway…\" Lori retorted in a sing-song voice. Rolling her eyes again (that was the third time now, not that he was counting) she let out a dejected \"Fiiiiiine…\" In an instant, the table was set with the Connect Four board. Death stood at one end of the table, Lori at the other. Mariah, meanwhile, straddled a chair backwards with a sideview between the two. Lori had the yellow chips, Death had the red. Lori leaned over first, the satisfying clunk of the yellow plastic fixating itself in the lower left corner. Death leaned over fully intending on placing his red piece in the other corner, until he heard a very loud \"DAMN!\" The noise startled him so much that his hand shook, his chip sliding into the bottom slot one left of the right corner. \"What?!\" he cried, shaking with impatience Both players turned to Mariah, who shrugged innocently \"I just noticed your ass, is all.\" \"My what?!\" \"His what?!\" \"It's an A+ ass!\" Mariah cried, throwing her hands over her head \"Do you expect me to not say something when I see an ass that fine?!\" Arms bracing the table, as if in anger, Lori then cried \"Mariah NEVER freaks out about asses, so this I gotta see.\" \"What is wrong with you two?!\" Mariah was happy to give the Grim Reaper an explanation, though it wasn't one he was expecting at all \"We're two twenty-something-year-old virgins. Can't help but look at nice butts.\" With an exasperated sigh, Death asked \"Are you being serious right now?\" A wicked smirked crossed Mariah's features, as she replied \"Deadly.\" While this exchange was going on, Lori had quickly plopped her yellow chip on top of her previous. \"Hellooo?\" she called, gesturing towards the Grim Reaper, \"I haven't got all day. I mean, I'm dead, so I sorta do, but ya know…\" His eyes flickered from the redhead back to the brunette with a distasteful glare and a slight grimace. As his hand reached to drop the next chip, Lori's eyes widened as she cried \"I still haven't seen your butt!\" The startling proclamation caused him to drop his new chip next to his other in the middle, rather than blocking anything Lori had played. Clenched fists in the air, he let out an irritated \"Damn!\" Lori happily skipped over, bending over to examine the Reaper's kaboose. \"Enh. I'd give it like a 9/10. Nice, but there's definitely room for improvement.\" Mariah shook her head, water droplets from her still wet red hair falling onto the table \"Nah, that's definitely a 10/10 butt. Would definitely touch if given the chance.\" If blood could have rushed to his face, it would have. Though, he wasn't entirely sure whether it was from anger or embarrassment. He assumed it was probably a bit of both. \"Well you're not going to get the chance.\" he snapped. With a nod, the redhead replied \"That's cool bro. You do you, it's your creepy isolation kingdom. I just hope someone is touching it, cause it is a butt that deserves to be touched.\" Having already made her way back over to her side of the table, Lori asked \"What about my butt? Does it not deserve to be touched?\" \"I've got a better butt than you.\" Mariah retorted with a roll of her eyes. Lori scrunched her nose up \"I don't think so.\" plopping down her 3rd yellow chip in a neat little row, she asked \"Hey, Death, who's got the better butt?\" \"WHAT?!\" his fists banged on the table \"You can not possibly be serious!\" Mariah stood up, and spun around before bending down, bikini-clad bum in the air \"MINE IS BETTER THAN YOURS, LORI!\" The absolute last thing Death wanted in that moment was to be caught staring at one of their asses. And yet, there he was. She did have an insanely good ass. Fuck. Lori wasn't having it. She spun around, bouncing from side to side in order to show off her butt. And it was...fine. It was a nice butt! Nothing wrong with it. But for the Reaper, there was something about Mariah's butt, he figured that it was perhaps the fact that she was bending over, and his mind was travelling to some very imaginative territory with her still in that position. He was so caught up in ogling the butt, that he failed to notice Lori turning back around. \"Well,\" she crossed her arms across her chest, bitter tone like a venom on her tongue that she had to spit out \"I suppose that answers that question.\" Standing upright once more, Mariah cried cheerfully \"I told you I have the better butt!\" The Reaper, who was about to block Lori's win, let the chip slip out of his hand. As the plastic made a clink on the table, his eyes narrowed as he strode towards the redhead \"I see what's going on here. You're trying to distract me so that your friend can live.\" \"Honestly,\" Mariah replied, blue eyes widening with each step he took towards her \"I wish I had thought of that.\" \"And what?\" he questioned, now towering over the girl who was once again straddling the seat. \"You expect me to believe that you're honestly that attracted to my behind?\" \"I don't know what you want me to tell you. You have a sexy butt.\" Mariah's tone was straightforward, cutting away any sense of humor that may have lead him to believe she was still joking. What was she trying to pull? Of course he had a sexy butt. After all, he was in the habit of working out all the time, and reaping kills a lot of calories...but no one ever noticed. \"Can we just finish the game, please?!\" Lori cried impatiently. His gaze breaking from the redhead and back to the game, he muttered some obscenities under his breath and tossed in a chip at random, still in a haze of trying to understand what was going on. Unfortunately for him, he had forgotten how close the brunette was to winning. Brown eyes shining with amusement, Lori simply plopped her 4th chip in a row down. \"Ta da!\" \"Oh for fuck's sake!\" Death cried, pushing over the game board in anger. Lori merely smiled \"You have to take us both back now.\" And he did, albeit begrudgingly. The girl's corpses came to at call of a defibrillator, souls returning to their very wet bodies. That time, he definitely remembered both of them, though at this point, he was still of the mind that they would not be seeing much of each other. This changed again, after only two weeks. Apparently, Mariah's knee had gone out and she'd fallen down a long, metal staircase. She'd grabbed onto Lori's arm, trying to steady herself. Unfortunately, this only caused her to drag Lori down with her. Once again, the girls were unconscious. And once again, they only regained consciousness in the cold confines of hell. \"God damn it!\" the Reaper cried as they finally came to. \"This is the third time this month. Do you have a death wish, or something?!\" Mariah cooed \"Aww, and here I was thinking you missed us.\" \"Well this time, you are staying dead.\" he snapped. Lori pouted \"Well that's hardly fair. This wasn't even my fault!\" \"I don't care who's fault it was!\" the Reaper cried. \"You're dead now. You're in hell.\" Leaning over, Lori whispered into Mariah's ear \"Does this mean we don't get to play Connect 4 again?\" \"Absolutely not!\" Death snapped. \"Last time you were here you kept distracting me with talks about butts. You cheated.\" \"We did no such thing!\" Mariah argued. \"Just because we were appreciating your butt doesn't mean we cheated! It just means you were also appreciating our butts!\" \"Or just your butt…\" Lori mumbled under her breath. Mariah hadn't heard Lori's mumble, but the Grim Reaper definitely did. He immediately shot her the most pointed look she'd ever received. \"Enough!\" he snarled. \"It's not about who was looking at who's butt…\" \"So if it's not about butts,\" Mariah interrupted \"Then we didn't cheat. And therefore there's nothing logically stopping you from letting us play for our lives again.\" Death clenched his teeth together so roughly that he was sure the squeak that came from grinding them together was audible to the two girls in front of him. \"You don't make the deals here. I do.\" \"So then make this deal with us.\" Mariah bantered, hands on her hips as she stepped towards him in a move that might have been seen as intimidating if she wasn't a good half foot shorter than he was. The redhead was dangerously close to him now. Her body was in his personal bubble, and he was not obsessed with that feeling. \"Fine. One last time. Only because I'm getting tired of arguing with you.\" \"So what's the game?\" Lori asked, now suddenly seeming a lot happier. Almost as though she'd come all this way just to play a board game. Like the death was a rouse. The Grim Reaper knew better, of course, but he couldn't quite shake the impression he got from her startling change of tone. He was so caught up in the baffling implications the brunette's sudden change in demeanor had given him that he would of forgotten to answer the question at all, had Mariah not still been in his bubble, clearing her throat in an attempt to get an answer out of him. They were asking him? This had never happened before. He always let the damned pick their own game, which he typically would best them in. But with these girls...Mariah had already bested him twice at Rock, Scissors, Paper, and Lori's triumph - and the route to it - made him swear off Connect Four for good. \"How about a game of chess?\" The two girls looked at each other, and then shrugged. Extending her hand, with the intention of him shaking it, Mariah offered \"You have yourself a deal.\" Death eyed her hand suspiciously. He'd temporarily forgotten about their first meeting - about the starting revelation of how much he'd enjoyed her touch while she was living. Of course, she was dead now, she'd feel just as cold as any other dead person. But the oddly comforting feeling of her hand atop his back in Lori's apartment was something he'd attempted to forget about. Unfortunately, he'd failed to repress it, only ignore it temporarily. But, by god, now that he was thinking about it, he wanted to experience it again. Not because he liked it, mind you, but to ensure he wasn't hyperbolizing it all in his head. He took her hand, giving it a halfhearted shake. He needed to get his head out of his ass. The game was set, the girls, of course being given the black pieces. If he was going to win, he was going to have to go first. The game continued silently, mostly because both Lori and Mariah were trying to remember the exact rules of the game, neither having played it in a good few years. The Grim Reaper was winning, he realized that only a few short moments in. He didn't want to get too cocky, for fear of having a come-from-behind win from the girls, but he also was sure that they were not as skilled in the game as he was, so he let himself relax. That was, until, suddenly, an odd thought struck him: If he was to win, Mariah would be dead. He'd never be able to retest the whole hand touching thing on her if she was dead. Shit. Now he had to lose, just to make sure he wasn't sensationalizing a moment that had happened a month ago. Fucking fantastic. Lori hummed and hawed before taking one of the pawns that hadn't moved yet and sliding it forward one space. Death looked up from the game and shot the girls what felt like an awkward smile, but most definitely came off more as a grimace. \"Was that not okay?\" Lori asked, her voice slow and tentative. \"No, no, every move is totally fine.\" he waved a hand dismissively, as he started the path towards his own self-destruction, gamewise. Mariah and Lori both eyed him suspiciously. Mariah shook her head, however, as she continued with her next move. Lori wasn't budging though. And it wasn't the sentence that through her off, it was the very stupid next move he played; exposing both his queen and a bishop. Death could feel the brunette's eyes on him, but he wasn't quite sure she knew his motives. Hell, even he really didn't understand his motives. So what the fuck was Lori so suspicious about? The fact that he was losing on purpose. Lori couldn't quite figure out why. At first, she thought that maybe they weren't supposed to have died at all. That Mariah's accident on the staircase should have hospitalized them, sure, but not killed them, because Lori had seen the way the Reaper had looked at her best friend's ass. But if that was the case, why was he losing? Surely he'd want to keep Mariah dead so he could have her ass at his disposal? As the game went on, Lori noticed more and more moments where it would have been very easy for him to have captured their pieces, but he hadn't. And she could not, for the life of her, figure out why. Mariah, meanwhile, was really just trying to remember how chess was played. The horsey was the one that could only move diagonally, right? Trying to play super sleuth, Lori waited for Death to make another very bad move on the board before asking \"So, the seventh seal. What came first, chicken or the egg? Was the filmmaker basing it on a real near death experience, or did you pick up this habit only after the movie came out?\" The Reaper was startled. After all, the game had happened in near silence up until this point. And also because...well...no one had ever really asked him about himself before. Usually the dead were all ' Blah blah I'm dead I don't wanna be dead bring me back blah blah blah'. As he still floundered from the answer, he realized that not only was Lori awaiting an answer, but Mariah had also looked up in interest, even giving him a small nod as if alerting him that it was, in fact, alright to disclose the information. \"It was before, much much earlier.\" \"So, did Bergman have a near death experience?\" Mariah questioned, raising an eyebrow as she moved the next piece on the chess board. \"Or was he like, really good at guessing?\" \"That's the strange thing,\" Death found himself relaying, though he wasn't sure why. He guessed, perhaps, it was because no one had ever asked him before \"I don't remember seeing him before the movie was made. And I never saw him again until 2007, but by then he was very old looking. And he looked at me and said the makeup team had done a good job.\" \"That's ominous as fuck, bro.\" Mariah's voice was barely above a whisper. With a shrug and a dismissive wave of his hand, the Reaper replied \"Enh, not really. I've heard much, much stranger things from much, much stranger people.\" Smirk on her pale lips, Lori turned to Mariah as she chirped \"Like this one saying you have a cute butt?\" At this, the Reaper tensed up. Although, he wasn't quite sure why. For all intents and purposes, Lori was correct. Mariah's assertion that she thought this rear end was attractive was certainly something he'd yet to hear. He moved another piece across the chessboard, as if on autopilot. Eyes focused on the board in front of him, he managed to choke out a very forced \"Yes, I suppose that would be up there.\" Eyes lowering in an attempt to catch his - a movement that made him feel very uncomfortable - Mariah asked \"Did it like, you know, actually bother you? Cause we can stop bringing it up if it's making you uncomfortable.\" \"The only thing making me uncomfortable,\" he snapped \"Is how often you two keep reappearing. The only reason I even offer these games is for a near death experience, usually only once in a person's lifetime. And yet here you are, your third time this month, alone.\" \"Do you think we were trying to die?\" Mariah asked, her voice still quiet, but now with a little more edge to it. She was absolutely doing her best to remain calm, but she'd be lying if she said the accusation hadn't angered her a little bit. Death clenched his teeth together, before barking \"It wouldn't surprise me.\" \"Listen, I've tried to die before.\" Mariah snapped, suddenly. \"And believe me when I say that anyone who's actually trying would never get this far three times in such a short period of time.\" \"You...what?\" Death's expression softened, albeit only a bit. Mariah ran a hand through her long, red hair before reiterating \"I've tried to die it didn't work out. But now that I'm not trying it's happened twice, plus the time Lori was choking on a fruit snack. Nobody could actually successfully kill themselves this often in this short of a period. Too many people would be watching their every move to make sure they didn't do it again.\" Lori then spoke up again \"Seriously dude, every time really was an accident.\" \"So I see.\" The Reaper inhaled sharply. \"I suppose being on this side of it has muddled my perception of the living a bit.\" \"Do you ever get to go to other side? Other than to collect dead people?\" Mariah asked, as Lori moved another pawn by only one space. He nodded, before explaining \"I was part of a band once. You may have heard of them. Wyld Stallyns. The band that is destined to save the world. Bill and Ted, they let me hang out sometimes.\" \"They let you hang out?\" Lori questioned. \"Like, you need their permission? Don't you feel like a third wheel?\" \"No no, it's not like that!\" Death found himself defending. After all, Bill and Ted were the only friends he really had. \"I mean, I'm glad you're able to get out every now and again.\" Mariah interjected \"But like, you're more than welcome to hang out with us if you want. Just so long as we're not at work or whatever.\" The Reaper moved another piece, careful to not only take a pawn of the girls, rather than the queen, which was very obviously available for capture. \"If you win, that is.\" \"And I think we will.\" Lori stated, moving the girls' queen to capture one of his rooks. \"Seeing as how you only have pawns and your king left.\" \"Hmm.\" He tried to feign disappointment, but Lori could definitely see the smirk that threatened to twitch up at the sides of his mouth. The brunette eyed him curiously, as he simply moved a pawn forward, foolishly exposing his king. Seeing the mistake as nothing more than a foolish mistake, Mariah cried \"Checkmate!\" happily as she made the final move. The redhead was oblivious to the small smile the crept onto the Grim Reaper's face, but Lori was not. Death, meanwhile, was oblivious to Lori's notice. So Lori opted to not say anything, for now. She still needed to piece some things together before bringing it to his attention. He purposefully lost - of that much she was certain - but for what reason? That was what she still needed to figure out. As of right now, she had nothing. But with how often she'd been seeing him recently, she figured that she'd likely have much more time to observe and come to a conclusion. In fact, she soon realized, she could push her test subject into providing information much sooner. \"So, now that you're taking us back…\" Lori tried to make the conversation seem as non-chalant as possible \"And we've established a potential friendship, and you seem to like board games, why not pop over next Sunday night? We'll play scrabble or skipbo, have some wine…\" \"You can't be serious.\" The Reaper mumbled with a shake of his head. Mariah responded \"Dixie Chicks serious.\" \"Are the Dixie Chicks usually serious?\" Grim asked, suddenly very confused \"Sometimes they're Not Ready To Make Nice and sometimes they're Goodbye Earl. I'm not sure whether or not you're being sincere.\" \"It's sincere!\" Lori clarified. Death nodded, before awkwardly readjusting his robes. \"Ah. Well then. Perhaps, we could, see what next Sunday brings.\" \"Will we have to like...offer a sacrifice?\" Mariah questioned tentatively. \"Or can you just show up?\" \"Oh for fuck's sake,\" The Reaper groaned, rolling his eyes \"I'll just show up! Don't kill anyone! You can't just fuck with death!\" With a cheeky grin and wink, Mariah retorted \"Well, not until you buy me dinner first.\" The Reaper froze in that moment, though he felt his blood boiling. How dare she?! Where did she get off?! Well, apparently she was insinuating using him to get off, as it were. His muscles tensed at the mere thought of engaging in such an act. All of his muscles. Which only served to make him even more uncomfortable. Thank goodness the robes he donned billowed over his figure, as she already spent enough time ogling his behind, heaven knows what she'd do if she saw this. \"I will be doing no such thing.\" he snapped. He only got a shrug and a giggle out of her. He wasn't at all paying attention to Lori, who was still trying to piece together what seemed to her like some very strange motivations. In fact, he didn't think of Lori much at all in the days leading up to the following Sunday. But Mariah? Oh, he thought about her a lot. Mainly while trying to ease the increasing number of stiffies that were occurring. It's not as though he hadn't be aroused before, what with the dancers and sexy cosplayers the Wyld Stallyns seemed to be forever attracting. But he'd be hard-pressed to remember another instance where a mere mental image had gotten the flag to full salute, as it were. And the more he remedied this little problem (not that he'd ever be so foolish to refer to it as little) the more often the problem seemed to spring up. So he continued to straighten it out, head filling with foolish notions of what it might be like if it were the redhead causing this sensation, rather than his own hand. Her touch was still undeniably bearable, and would likely be warmer than his own. Which, for this situation, would be quite lovely. And it's not like she was exactly unpleasant looking either. After all, she did have that ass, and the bikini she'd been in during Connect Four served to put a very lovely rack on display as well. And….aw, fuck. There it was. The release he so desperately needed. Moving to wash his hands, he shook his head at his own ludacrisy. He still had to go meet them for board games, after all.

Sweat made his bare chest shiny and slick. Bill's breathing slowed as he carded a hand through his hair. \"Yeah,\" Ted agreed, staring up at the ceiling with a newfound respect for all the weird columns and frilly marble loops that decorated the edge of the room. He'd never look at peacocks carved into a ceiling quite the same again. Unless of course they came back here and he happened to be sleeping in the same spot. Even so, he definitely had a new appreciation for Greek rooms. Really, had a new appreciation for anything Greek. Greeks were cool. Greeks invented a lot of cool things. \"That was...\" He paused for a moment, trying to think of an appropriately monumental word for the monumental event that had just taken place. That had totally just rocked his world. \"...Olympic.\" He nodded to himself, liking the way the word fit how very Greek that had been. Bill glanced over at him with a smile, rapidly nodding his agreement. \"Yeah! Totally, dude! That was totally Olympic!\" \"That was so Olympic they should make it a sport, dude!\" Ted's overactive imagination supplied images of beds stationed around a track while two guys moved around under the sheets of each one, thousands of onlookers watching from the stands. Both boys looked at each other, rumbled bed sheets and naked flesh filling their vision before shaking their head as one. \"Nah!\" Bill's hand idly brushed against Ted's side in a move that Ted couldn't decide if it was accidental or intentional. \"Hey, do you think this means we're gay?\" Ted stared at the columns for a long minute as his mind pondered the question. They were two guys. They'd had sex. Olympic sex, without gold medals or judging, but still sex. The most bodacious and totally rad sex he'd ever had. Back in California, that would have meant they were gay, but they weren't in California. He knew he wasn't gay. He would have notice if he was gay. He would have felt... different. He just felt comfortable and relaxed and maybe a bit hungry. He wanted to do it again. \"Nah,\" he drawled out slowly. \"It's... Dude, what did Socrates call it?\" Bill's face twisted as he tried to think. \"It's paidara... pedaera... pygze...\" He gave up with a shrug. \"I don't remember, dude.\" Ted wracked his brain, trying to remember what Socrates had been talking about earlier in the day, and came up empty. \"Yeah, I totally don't remember either, dude.\" He counted the birds on the ceiling as he pondered the... thing that had happened with him and Bill. \"Nah, dude,\" Ted spoke slowly as his mind sluggishly worked out an answer. \"We're not gay, we're...\" Staring at the columns, the answer came to him. \"We're Greek!\" Bill glanced over at him, mouth hanging slightly open as he thought it over. \"Yeah, dude,\" Bill smiled, nodding rapidly. \"We're Greek!\" \"Yeah,\" he agreed. \"And when we get back, I wanna totally go hit some Greek restaurants.

But I wanted them to kiss SO badly. And they didn't, so I have to fill that void. But thanks to futureboy (PokeRowan) for the inspiration! Ted \"Theodore\" Logan tapped twice on his best bud's door and shifted anxiously foot to foot as Bill S. Preston, Esquire swung it open. \"Ted! Thanks for coming, bro,\" Bill reached up and swept him into a high-armed hug, patting twice on the shoulder and stepping back into the room. \"You wanted me to come by, dude,\" Ted smiled softly at his friend. \"I thought I'd stop over before we go pick up the girls for the party.\" \"Right on, Ted. I wanted to give you something before tonight's festivities on this most auspicious day!\" Ted and Bill both swung their arms wide, arcing into a simultaneous air guitar stroke. Ted shook the fringe out of his face as Bill dashed over to his desk and reached for a wrapped package. \"Whoa, Bill!\" Ted breathed reverently. \"You didn't have to get me anything, dude.\" \"No man, it's your birthday. That's special, right?\" \"Right on,\" Ted nodded, smiling. \"Open it up, bro!\" Bill said, settling on the side of his bed. He perched anxiously as Ted plopped down next to him and tore through the brightly colored wrappings on what turned out to be a Fruit Loops box. \"Nice,\" Ted said tilting his head and holding up the box. \"It's not cereal dude, I just needed a box.\" \"Ohhh! Fair enough, my dude.\" Ted ripped through the tape on top and reached in to find his present, wrapped in reused tissue paper from some other occasion. His fingers fumbled a little to unravel the thing, and when he revealed it at last he gasped. Ted sat transfixed, looking at the gift. His chin might have wobbled a bit, but Bill, staring intently at his friend, did not give a sign that he noticed. Ted ran his thumb over a light tan leather guitar strap and gasped again, \" whoa …\" Bill had taken the time to hand tool the leather, burning in the Wyld Stallyns logo, Ted's name, and a dark, thick maned horse. Ted's eyes stung a bit, and he blinked quickly. He heard Bill sniff and looked back at his friend. Ted swallowed thickly, amazed at the time and care Bill must have put into his gift. \"Bill,\" he said hoarsely. \"I don't know what to say dude.\" \"I mean, if you don't like it, bro…\" Bill began, raising a hand as if to take it back. \"No, man! No!\" Ted choked out, grabbing his hand. They sat for a moment, hands clasped as Ted struggled for words. The emotions swarming between them left the air tense and thick. The boys stared into each other's eyes for a moment, Bill's worried ones meeting Ted's soft, watery gaze. And suddenly Bill understood. But when his tongue darted out to lick his lip, Ted's gaze dropped. And lingered for just long enough that Bill's breath caught. Did he just…? Bill wondered, scarcely daring to finish the thought. Ted realized he was staring at Bill's mouth a moment too late and glanced back up at Bill's eyes, which had darkened with something tense and almost…hopeful it seemed. Bill had tilted his head to the side as if wondering what Ted was looking at, and Ted leaned forward just a scant inch or so, watching Bill watching him. No one knew who closed the distance. They were a hair's breadth away from each other one moment, and their lips brushed against each other the next. Bill's firm mouth nipped a little at Ted's soft lower lip and one of them moaned slightly. Ted's tongue dipped between his friend's teeth and sipped the taste of him, exploring and lapping gently as their lips rubbed. For one gentle second their eyes closed and they savored. Then, all too soon, Ted drew back and swallowed slowly. \"Whooa…\" full on boner , he thought. \"Are we?\" \"Dude…maybe?\" replied Bill, reading Ted's thoughts as he always did. \"But the princesses? I don't know how they're going to take this.\" A muffled giggle from the door had them snapping apart, Ted rose shakily as they realized the two girls stood framed in the door, watching the display. They both broke into gales of laughter as the boys stuttered a mixture of apologies and explanations. \"Good show,\" Elizabeth replied, stifling their protests. Princess Joanna laughed heartily next to her sister. \"Next time, invite us.\" ","Summary":" A/N: So I went traipsing off looking for Bill & Ted slash, and I found this wonderful little fic wh"},{"Movie":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure B...","Title":"This Will Probably End Badly","Author":"Evil Little Dog","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11484395","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Title: This Will Probably End Badly Author: Evil_Little_Dog Rating: K+ Disclaimer: This is a derivative work, and, as such, I make absolutely no money writing this.

Preston, Esquire (commonly known as 'Bill') asked. \"We should promote peace and stuff.\" Tod nodded, warming to the idea. It was a totally radical idea, evident by the way his hands windmilled. \"You know. If we took all the amazing guys we learned about in history and put them together in one room, maybe we could solve all the wars!\" Bill considered. \"Is that building an army?\" Ted frowned a thoughtful frown. \"Is it an army if they're all leaders?\" \"Don't you need people to fight?\" Bill asked. He might have been the brains of the outfit. Ted did that miniscule shake of his head, where just his hair moved. \"If they're all fighters, wouldn't they fight?\" \"They might fight each other, dude. I mean, some of those really great leaders weren't really friendly.\" Bill was pretty sure that Indian dude, Geronimo, wouldn't want to fight along some white dudes. Ted pouted. \"But we should do something. Rufus said we're supposed to herald in a new age of peace and enlightenment.\" He did remember that. Perhaps not exactly the way Rufus said it, because he'd been mentally humming along with Van Halen at the time. \"Maybe instead of military guys, we should look for peaceful dudes. I mean, your dad,\" Bill pointed at Ted, who made a face, \"would probably be happy if a war broke out.\" \"Yeah, bummer.\" Ted sighed. His father's military background was always a problem. But Ted brightened instantly. \"Okay, so let's go after the peaceful guys! Like Ghandi and Martin Luther King, Jr.!\" Bill considered again, nodding slowly, a smile brightening his face. \"I think that's it!\" They air-guitared their delight. \"Wait. Uh. How do we know if they're really peaceful or not?\" Ted asked. \"I mean, some of them could secretly be giant robots or something.\" \"I guess we'll just have to do some history reading.\" Bill realized as soon as he said it how tedious that would be.

They hadn't been visions. They hadn't been voices in her head, whispers from the shadows of Michael and Catherine. She'd touched them, with her own hands, felt the fabric of their cloth on her fingers. She'd ridden in their silver door, the one that glowed like the corneal edges of the moon and the sun. The others, too- she'd touched them, as well- but none of them had touched her back in the way those two young men had. They'd reached out to her, spirited her away from the roaring smoke of Orleans, away from the trial and the judgement of man. She'd learned that she wasn't alone, not completely, that there were other women like herself; leaders and teachers and commanders. And for a moment, too short and too vivid, she'd lead them as well. Even as the men took her from her parapet, she could feel the hopeful and trusting eyes of other women on her, and knew that she could belong there. Then into the cage with the others, and then out of it to the platform lit by giant stars, the shouting voices of hundreds of followers calling her name in the dark. They'd known her, they'd respected her. They even allowed her a demonstration of her swordsmanship while the masses cheered her on. Their time was too short and too vivid, and then she was back- in that dusty church hall, sword and helmet sitting where they'd been left. She did not want to pick them back up. But she did. And it happened, just as she felt it would: the trial, the declaration of guilt, and the stake. She'd heard whispers from the others, during her short and vivid time with them. They were words she didn't want to listen to, ones she could barely understand, and she had cast them aside then. The wood felt strangely cold underneath her hands, and she knew it wouldn't be that way for much longer. Perhaps, she thought, they would come back for her. That the silver door would appear once more and that gentle hand would reach for her again. Perhaps, she thought, this was a dream, another vision, and it would pass. Perhaps, she thought, she could pray, and be spirited from the smoke and flames that began to spread at her feet. No. The heat came, and the pain shortly afterward. In all of her nineteen years, in all of the battles she had fought and won, the people she'd bled for and the country she'd killed for, she had never experienced such pain. It didn't take long before she began to fade, and she knew it was over. What had they said? Be excellent to each other. Short and vivid. And then it was over.

Expression, dazed and shocked. Ted ruffled and emerged from the pile of blankets, nodding his head and rolling out of the cuccoon. And standing abruptly hair fallen sheltering his face. Both turned to ascent the stairs not saying other than mumbles of 'righteous' and 'radical'. Reaching the depth of the blackened basement, again their heads were shooken simultaneously and the lights flickered on with the motion of Bill, Ted reaching to his equipment, at the back of the cellar-like basement, took out a camera, poorly decorated in tribute stickers in bad condition. \"dude...\" \"triumphant...\" \"Ted, do you think it'll work.\" His head cocked in question. \"it's gotta dude!\" They set it to the wall, switching a small trigger at the top, a small screen beamed to the wall opposing them. \"Excellent!\" They exclaimed staring at the projection smiling. The screen was blank, they weren't sure what they were doing. They had merely found a note under the sheets instructing them to 'like totally get up at nine!' And went into some greater detail about how 'super awesome dudes' it is once they do this. Ted reconized the writing to be his, and assumed from their previous time travel experience , it was somehow related to that. Of course he worded it more like 'those totally excellent time dudes, ' And some gradual recalling of that night, followed by their heads bobbing in agreement \"yeah...\" They soon dropped their smiles however, when the video was that of them having left them out of sight. Both leaned in, anticipating something. But nothing but a flash of black left them a dead image. Completely vanished from the wall as the tape ended. \"bogus!\" Their voices united. Ted turned to Bill, facing his side \"We have to find out what it was dude\" \"but how...\" At that exact moment, the room lit up causing both teenagers to dumbly stumble back, pressing their shoulders together against a wall, the room dimmed. Both blinking rapidly trying to recover from the beam, Bill suceeded first, and managed to gawk out \"Duddee...\" Ted joined his gaze to the corner of the vault like room. Medival armour. \"Most excellent!\" they dove towards the objects that lay pooled into the deepest, darkest section of the confined area. \"Wait, Bill... the tape must have something to do with this\" Bill nodded \"most excellent observation Ted, but what?\" \"Well... maybe we should test the armour\" They agreed on this and continued to the metal mass. \"ready?\" \"ready!\" it was a mix of them assisting eachother into the suits. But they had finally manuvoured themselves into the apparell \"dude, check\" Ted signalled his sword to Bills chest \"no dude, your supposed to say engard\" \"right dude... that\" \"now what?\" Bill questioned, motioning his silver outfit to his friend. \"maybe we need to duel in them?\" \"right, but this most definately is not a place worthy of a duel...\" Bill inquired, \"1200's!\" Ted's voice emerged from the suit with a considerable enthusiasm. \"what?\" \"dude, this was most excellent in that time\" this brought a smile, (though he couldn't see it through the armour) to Bills face \"righteous dude...\" With that they headed to their travelling , convient time booth. The ride was mainly them crashing into eachother and pulling away on the playful shout of 'gay!' before reaching a sudden halt, Bill clashing into Teds open arms in the corner of the booth, neither move for a moment. \"woah dude!\" Ted said, lunging from beneath his fallen friend, scrabling to a large field. Bill hated to admit it, but he liked the ride due to the fact he had an excuse to hug the taller man for more than a second- he liked to pretend that it was a bromance thing though. He followed from the red and transparent capsile, following onto the platter of green. Their eyes met, hazel to blue- \"Excellent!\" They didn't waste time, swinging wildly at eachother, until Bill managed to force Ted onto the ground in an accidental tackle- knocking off Ted's helmet. For a brilliant second there Bill gazed hungrily into Ted's brown abyss, piercing through the armour. His face singed a pretty pink. \"dude not fair!\" Ted muttered from beneath, taking away the concealing silver from Bill, (to make the playing feild even of course) but something intoxicating hidden. A quite flustered Bill, eyeing overtop Ted's face with great interest and grabbed hold of Bill cheeks, pulling him against him, into a deep meaningful kiss. Penetrating the (at first) not reactant mouth with his tounge, the desperate kiss aching along his jaw, so utterly wanting something against it, plunging and pleading to his mouth. Bill felt a moan into the back of his throat and melted into the invading kiss enthusiastically returning the struggling tounge. sloppily and wetly wrestling down the brunette's tongue. \"definately not bogus...\" Bill whispered, eyes shut as Ted pulled away slightly, still firmly gripping his face in a cradle like motion. \"Most triumphant...\" Ted remarked bring his hands back to his sides, nodding and casting his gaze down words, as though in thought. Bill peered at the same section of floor, he felt more dimmed than usual. Neither sure of what to do. The first move had to happen however, and it happened to be Bill this time who brought both figures together. He slipped in between Ted and the ground and was looking affentionatly at him, waiting to see what comes next, slightly pulling him down with his collar, \"dude...\" \"yeah.\" Bill and Ted were only centemeters apart at this point, Bills eyes were half lidded and his mouth obviously puckered. Ted was a little more awkwardly gawking at the sight at his flustered companion \"your a total babe.\" Bill stopped his gradual approach foward and looked up \"But I'm a dude...\" \"a most outstanding dude.\" Still confused by the concept of him being a babe, Bill hadn't relized a creeping hand on his abdomen, just resting there \"Ted?\" \"Yeah dude.\" \"Your hand is most excellent.\" Both smiled querkily, a moments hesitation was broken quite violently with Bills hands reaching over the taller 'dude's' shoulders, forcing him into eye level. His hand that had found it's way to his hip, and tugged him into his pelvis, and grabbing hold of the other side, circling with his thumb over the frail bone. \"That is most triumphant..\" Bill began, using words at this point at a quite pitiful attempt of hiding the obvious embarassment blooming in red across his face. Ted breath warming the already heated face, Bills belly shirt was heightened from both reaching up to his taller companion, and the fact that said companion's hand was exploring the surface quite rapidly, and desperately. Finally, Ted engulfed Bills mouth in his own, dragging out any sort of groan he could acheive. They were mainly 'most excellent's which were cut out by a small whimper, which in time was silenced but the wrestling tounges. It didn't take much time before Ted found himself forcing Bill's arching back into the floor of green, kissing along his neck. \"dude.. bodacious\" A sharp gasp from Bill brought Ted to eye contact, both giving a knowing look \"fag!\" they exclaimed in sync. Ted smiled broadly and did his idiot nod, before diving back to Bills more exposed chest. Bill was still smirking from the previous comment before Ted reached a nipple, toying with it Bill winced and weakly brought his arms to motion a guitar. Such a win everyone.

Eric had been a cab driver for thirteen years and even though he's in the late forties, he is still working hard like youngsters. When they're done, Gabby just came out barging to the cab with her luggage, a backpack and her purse. \"Just in time,\" I whispered to myself. She shoved her stuffs at the trunk and sit right next to me. \"You're late, Gabs. Unusual scene,\" even Eric says so. \"Tell me about it. She was partying with her neighbor-\" \"My hot neighbor,\" \"Whatever. As I was saying. She partied all night with her neighbor,\" She was wearing a white top matched with a black miniskirt, black vest and a rhinestone belt. Simple but cute. I had my skinny jeans and my usual long-sleeved shirt and black gladiators. I put on black eyeliner and black eye shadow for the smoky eyes effect. For a college girl, I look like Avril Lavigne when she's like, fourteen. But I couldn't care less, though. For four years I've been hiding behind those mini dress, tube tops and peplum blouses but if I'm going to meet my family, I'm meeting them as who I am. Even if I dress as a geeky teen instead of a funky college girl. \"We're finally here. Thanks Eric. Tell Greta I said hi,\" \"Bye Gabs, bye Dev. Have a safe flight,\" We barge in the airport, send our luggage to cargo and find our gate. Good thing I already check us in online. \"Fifteen minutes till boarding. Whew!\" \"Can't believe we made it,\" \"Good thing we made it,\" After a little bit awhile we board our plane. The trip to Italy took half a day. I was really tired and jet lagging. When we got to Venice Airport, I saw my father waiting for us while holding this goofy white card that reads 'My lovely daughter and her cute friend' with this toothy grin. \"Dad, I miss you!\" \"Miss you too, munchkin,\" He hugged Gabby and me for a while. \"Nice to see you again, Mr. Thompson,\" I sit next to my dad while Gabby sit at the back. \"Four years and you haven't change a bit,\" \"I do. A little. I get more punctual. Didn't I, Gabs?\" \"Indeed. And to be honest, she's the one who woke me up for our flight today,\" Dad seems impressed. Am I that one procrastinator? \"Well, Danielle would be so happy to see you guys,\" \"I'm not really sure about it, dad,\" \"I'm not kidding. She wants you to be her maid of honor,\" \"Her maid of what?\" Okay this is crazy. I thought she hates me. Why would she want me to be her maid of honor? \"I'm serious. She can't stop talking about how cute you will look inside the dress that she got for the bridesmaids,\" My dad and I chat the whole way to Scooter's family house or as he call it, Margiatta Mansion. \"Hey, we're almost here,\" \"Yeay,\" I said, sarcastically. Gabby was asleep at the back. I guess she was really tired. She never really had such long trips before. When we arrived the place we're staying, I was speechless. It's really pretty. \"It's nice Scooter's family let them have this house. They didn't really use this house unless there's any occasion,\" \"It's wonderful,\" \"Devon!\" I turn around and saw Danielle practically running and tackled me on the ground. \"Dani! I missed you,\" \"Awwh, little sis. I miss you too,\" Scooter came behind my sister and pull Gabby and me into a side hug. \"How dare you guys didn't come in contact with us,\" \"We're too busy being famous,\" \"Yeah right. Where's the boys?\" Crap. Thanks a lot, Gabs. \" They're at the back. Rehearsing and stuff,\" \"What for?\" \"They're performing for our wedding. Isn't that great?\" Totally.\"[Chapter 4] \"Hey, I'll take you to your rooms. You guys will be sharing,\" I don't mind sharing with Gabby. When we got to the hallway with many doors, Danielle grabbed Gabby's hand. \"Hey, I thought Gabby's staying with me,\" \"No, she has her own room,\" \"What? And why do I have to share?\" I said, unsatisfied. \"Honey, Gabby here is a guest. You're much more of a special case. You'll have to share with someone else,\" I can't believe this. I just got here and she's annoying me again? \"With one of your friends I suppose?\" \"You can say that. Now, your new roommate for the next three weeks were already there a few days ago so just bring your stuffs inside your room, and don't mess with theirs. The last one on the right,\" She's going to get back for this. I swear. She still treats me like a baby or a nuisance. Worse, nuisance baby. \"Hello,\" I guess my roommate's not here. This room is nice. It got bathroom and all. Really big too. I got the point why I need to share. Oh. Queen-sized bed. I guess we'll be close from day one. Yeay. I change into a baggy tank top and took my pants off. Feeling comfy, I threw myself on the bed. I wish my bed at New York is as comfy as this one. Talk about New York, I gotta convince Gabby to move in with me at my apartment. My neighborhood had been really scary and juvenile nowadays. I'm so tired. I guess a little nap won't hurt after all. **after a while** God for how long I've been asleep? I hear someone in the shower. Probably she's taking a shower. Guess I'll just wait over here. I retrieve my phone from my bag and check it. Five missed calls. And it's already midnight. \" Love at the first sight, never thought it could happen to me. But you made me believe…\" No. Not him, no. When the bathroom door opened and he saw me on the bed, both of us were speechless. Okay, this is a totally awkward situation. With me, on the bed, bottomless and him, topless. But he's smoking hot, I must say. I mean, those abs are to die for. Focus, Devon. Focus. \"I… um..\" His face was burning red I can see it clearly. And it's so cute. God, focus. This is the guy who kissed you out of nowhere and didn't even try to connect to you. \"You might wanna put up some tops first,\" you might wanna put on some tops first? It's my first time meeting him since the last four years and that's the best I can come up with? Oh, come one Devon.\"And you might wanna put on some pants,\" Gosh, I was too comfortable to put on a pair of shorts. \"I'm okay,\" \"Then so do I,\" Okay that's it. \"You might wanna explain what are you doing here?\" I pretty much know the answer but there's always a chance he's just using the shower for a while. \"My room,\" Face palms. \"Wait, don't tell me… You're the one who's sharing this room with me?\" I might be crazy but I think I saw him smile a bit. Well, my eyes just lied I guess. \"So…\" \"So…\" \"You can take the bed,\" he said while putting on his shirt. \"Wait, what about you?\" He just gives me that cute half-smirk. \"I'll just… sleep on the couch,\" Great. Now I feel bad. \"Umm, are you sure?\" \"Yeah, you don't want me sleeping beside you, won't you?\" Yes. Yes I would. Oh come on, Devon Thompson, man up. Or in this case, girl power? Whatever. \"Okay. If that's what you want,\" I said, releasing my hair from the messy bun. I'm still tired. I guess I'll just get back to sleep. \"Night,\" Wow. We haven't met for four years. And that's it? A stupid conversation about bed? Thank god I managed to go through it without puking.[Chapter 5] Ritchie's POV I got up real early that morning to see Devon still sleeping like a baby. \"You're my angel… I wish you just know how I feel…\" This is good. With her, I could make a song out of the blue. She's a real inspiration. Well, I should've get going, before she wakes up. After bathing, I go out to the garden only to find Scooter lying on the grass. \"Hey Scooter,\" \"Hey Ritchie. So, how's your night? Get a good sleep?\" \"Yeah. The couch had been, wait a second. Did you guys-\" \"Yes,\" \"And you were-\" \"Um-hm,\" \"So she will-\" \"Pretty much,\" I should've discover this. They planned it all along. They planned that Devon and I will share a room. Like together. \"Why?\" Scooter turns his head to me. \"What?\" \"Why did you guys, I don't know, do this?\" \"Because we thought that you would need help,\" Danielle said, coming out of nowhere. \"Help? What makes you think I need help?\" I'm pretty pissed right now. \"I didn't really help you, when you were begging for her number. And now, I did decided to help you. But even if I did though, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't call her either. You were scared,\" She is right. I was scared. I mean, I have never felt anything like that before. You know, like, feeling so calm around someone you could've told them anything. As if they were made for us. And I was afraid she wouldn't feel the same about me and well, I couldn't take any more failures. Not in things like… this. \"Hey we're going inside, it's almost breakfast time. Care to join us?\" \"You guys go ahead,\" I said, as they make their way inside. God, they seem very happy. I want a relationship like theirs too but I guess that wouldn't work well on me anyway. \"Ritchie,\" \"Devon?\" \"Um, Danielle told me to um, get you? Breakfast,\" I watch her face intensely. What kind of feelings do I have for her? Does she feel the same? \"Um… Ritchie?\" Crap. She must've thought I'm a creep. \"Uh, yeah. Sorry. I mean, sure, yeah,\" I mentally face palmed myself. Last night's conversation was better. Even though it leads nowhere. I guess she took it better than me. That's because she didn't feel the same. She never did. I got up and walk inside to see everyone were already on their seats. Without really thinking where should I sit cause I already figured it out, I walk next to Devon. And there's my name. See? God, they and their plans. It will never work. How could it work if I'm the only one to feel the love. Is it even love? \"Morning, guys,\" Scrambled eggs. And banana cream pie? \"Why are we having pies for breakfast?\" \"This is Italy. We have ice cream cakes for breakfast,\" Yeah right, Scooter. From the corner of my eye I can see Devon tensed up a bit. I can't believe she remember it. The moment that I had with her. You know, when she feed me the pie, and smear it all over my face. And when she wiped it off. She's too cute to be true. God, I have to stop before I hurt myself. I wouldn't have a chance with her. \"Please excuse me for a while,\" \"Devon,\" I took a grip of her wrist. \"Please,\" I had to let go. \"Devon!\" Danielle cried and ran after her. \"Excuse me but I have to go,\" I said, standing up to leave. \"Ritchie wait,\" \"I'm just not hungry, man,\" Lies. I'm starving. \"I'm okay. I just need more rest. Kind of exhausted,\" More lies. I walk to my room, some part of me hoping she's not there while the other part is dying to meet her. When I look at the garden, I saw her sitting against the trees while her sister is in front of her, trying to talk to her. When I got to my room, I lay on the bed, and caught a whiff of her scent. She always smells so good. Like jasmine and green tea. It's always soothing. \"I think it's love,\" I finally said to myself. I have been fighting over myself to make sure, if I do love her. I mean, I've only met her for like, a couple days, and had one kiss with her and that was like, four years ago. And of course after her, I wasn't into any relationships. Even a one-night stand or anything. I just felt like, I have to wait for her. Cheesy, I know but that's the truth. I was sure I like her but I never thought of love.[Chapter 6] Authors Note. So this story has a lot of chapters even though it barely reaches 3k but I'm trying to make a point here, in this fic. Well, my last fic, Confusion is not complete yet but I'm sure I will end it no time soon. Well, I just need a little inspiration and I'll start again. Or else, I'll update new stories and probably forget about it. Just pray for me so I wouldn't do that. Cheerios. ","Summary":" \"Give it up to Five Leo Rise! Yeah!\" \"Thanks a lot, you guys are such a crowd, whoo!\" \"Hey jus"},{"Movie":"Taking 5","Title":"What Happened After","Author":"goodgirl21","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197612","Passage":"[Chapter 1] What Happened After (Danielle's point of view) \" Not far from the start, kidnap my heart.\" The band finished the last note of the song in the sound booth, while I dialed my mom's number. I was going to talk to her about coming back for the week, because the guys, (Mostly Ritchie and Mason) wanted to visit Devon and Gabby. I finally agreed to ask my mom just to get them to shut up. Key word ask , meaning it wasn't my fault if she said no. \"Hey Mom.\" I said when she picked up. \"Hey honey, How are you and the band doing?\" She asked. \"Good. Can I ask you something?\" I asked apprehensively, biting a finger nail. Something I always did when I was nervous. \"Of course Danni.\"\"Can the guys and I come visit for a week? The guys and I really miss Devon and Gabby.\" I explained. At that same moment the guys came out. \"What did she say?\" Ritchie and Mason mouthed to me. I held up a finger signaling them to be quiet. \"I'll have to talk to your father first. Can I call you back with an answer?\" Mom asked. \"Yea, Sure. Talk to you later.\" I said, hanging up. \"What did she say?\" Mason and Ritchie took that as the time to pounce. \"She said she'd have to talk to dad, then she'll call me back with an answer.\" I explained. They nodded with hopeful looks on their faces. \"Who wants to go get something to eat?\" KK asked. We all nodded then turned to walk out of the studio to the parking lot. After we came back from 'Dairy Queen' our stomachs full, my phone rang. \"Hello?\" I asked, after I had picked up. \"Danni, I've talked to your father, and he said yes. The only problem is that we'll be on another one of those 'Who did it?' crimes conventions.\" She explained. \"I'll be there, so what's the problem?\" I asked. \"Well okay then I guess it's settled. When will you and the band be here?\" She asked. \"Probably sometime tomorrow around twelve.\" I explained, as Ritchie and Mason looked hopeful. \"Okay see you then.\" Then she hung up. \"Guys, we're taking a trip…\" Meanwhile… (Gabby's point of view) \" You say you always keep your word, show me what your just a little faster!\" The ending of 'Just a Little Faster' blasted though the ear buds of my iPod as I was walking home from school. They're probably fighting again, my mind nagged me. My parents have been fighting a lot lately. They think I don't know, but I can hear them screaming at each other, though the walls of my bed room at night. They think I'm some little kid, not know what they fight about, but I do. They fight about my father coming home late at night and sometimes not at all. They think I don't feel the tension in the room when we're all in a room together, but I do. They think I don't know about them, thinking about getting a divorce, but I do. I know everything… I sigh as I turn in to the driveway of my house. As I open the door I turn my ipod off, and close the front door I heard them yelling. This was one of the few afternoons my dad was off and home. Oh joy… \"You're coming home late and sometimes not at all , you're cheating!\" My mother spat at my farther. \"Just because I stay the night at work, Does not mean I am cheating , Kate!\" My farther snapped back. I tiptoed over to the archway of the living room to where they were and peered in. They were to busy screaming at each other to notice me. It's strange the room looks so cozy and yet, the tension could be cut with a knife at the rate it was building. With a sigh under my breath, I made my way up to my room. You know you'd think I'd be happy considering it's spring break, but you can never be happy in this house anymore. And I'm sick of it! What kind of person can't be happy in their own house? Their house is supposed their one place of escape! Once in my room, I grabbed a duffle bag out of my closet, and packed clothes for a week, and other things like: hairbrush, make-up, deodorant, and phone. Then I headed down the steps, and into the kitchen I wrote my parents a note saying where I would be spending my spring break, and why. Heading out the door I grabbed an apple, turning my iPod up all the way and then headed to my escape, Devon's… Devon's mom answered the door when I got there. \"Hi Momma T.\" I faked enthusiasm, only Devon knew what was going on with my parents. \"Hi Gabby.\" She said, smiling a motherly smile at me while letting me in. \"Is Dev home yet?\" I asked her. \"She's upstairs doing some homework.\" Mrs. T replied, moving aside to let me in. I forced a smile as my thanks, as I started making my way up the stairs. \"Oh Gabby I'm glad you're here. I have a surprise for you and Devon that'll be here tomorrow.\" She called after me. I nodded to so I heard her then continued my way up the stairs. So remember this is a repost. What do you think? Good, Bad, Okay, or down right horrible?[Chapter 2] (Gabby's point of view) \"What do you think your mom's surprise is for us?\" I asked Devon the next day, around the time her mom told us it should be arriving. \"I don't know, but I want to why she got us the surprise in the first place.\" Devon said skeptically, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. \"Come on Devon, can't your mom just do something nice for us. Why does she always have to up to something?\" I asked my blonde best friend, from where I was sitting on her bed. \"Because she keeps getting on to me about my grades, so why would she get me a surprise?\" Devon asked just as skeptic. I shrugged, \"Incentive?\" \"Then why would she give it to me before?\" She asked. She had me there, so I just shrugged again. \"But, Anyways enough about the 'surprise'. How are your parents doing?\" She changed the subject. I looked down at the pale yellow carpet. I came over here not to think about my parents, let alone talk about them. \"Same as ever. Family portrait.\" I said thinking how well that song resembled my home. \"I'm sorry Gabs.\" She put her arm around my shoulder. I shook my head. It wasn't her fault going up in my house was like World War III. \"I'm gonna go get dressed.\" I said, standing up while grabbing my duffel off the floor, and heading for the bathroom. When I got to the bathroom I took a quick shower. Then blow dried and brushed my hair. Then put on my 'There For Tomorrow: Just a Little Faster' black t-shirt, my favorite jeans, and my favorite black converses. \"Girls, your surprise is here!\" I heard Devon's mom yell from down stairs. I opened the door to see Devon coming out of her room and together down the steps. As we stepped onto the stone floor of Devon's downstairs, we heard voices. \"I'm so glad you're here!\" Devon's mom. \"Me too Mom. Me too.\" Danielle… Devon and I exchanged looks. \"You don't think…\" I trailed off. \"No…\" Devon said, slowly shaking her head. Then I heard the one voice that made me think otherwise, \"Thank you for letting us come Mrs. Thompson.\" Mason said. I could almost hear the smile in his voice… It sounded so happy, carefree, and kind. Devon and I exchanged looks again. This time though I was starting to feel this warm feeling erupt in my body and my head, just by the sound of his voice. \" What's going on? You're over Mason so why are you feeling this way?\" My inner voice asked. How am I supposed to know? I shook my head then turned to grin-a true Gabby Davis grin- at her. I then made my way through the kitchen and into the living room, with Devon following right behind me. Once we are there, Devon and I cry together, \"Danni!\" While we race over to hug her. Even though Devon won't admit it out loud, she really misses her big sister. \"Can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I missed you two.\" Danielle sighed, returning the hug. \"We don't get hugs?\" Mason, Ritchie, and Scooter asked teasingly, from the other couch. Devon and I turned around, \"I'm sorry do I know you? Oh wait you're that boy band right?\" Devon asked in a playful tone, as the phone rang in the kitchen. \"Are you sure they're that boy band Dev?\" I played along, as Mrs. T rose to get the phone. \"And to think we came all the way for you two. Well we know when we're not wanted, come on guys.\" Ritchie said in a serious way, then all five of '5 Leo Rise' got up and started to make their way to the front door. No, I like this warm feeling! Don't go! I ran up to Mason and hugged from behind, \"Don't go yet.\" I muttered my plea into his back. (Danielle's point of view) I watched with wide eyes as Mason (His eyes were wide also.) turned in Gabby's grasp then wrap his own arms around her, whispering comforting words in her. I turned to look at my baby sister straight dead in the eye, with a look that clearly read the thought that was also going through my mind, What just happened? Devon nodded her head out of the room, and then started walking out, I trailed behind her. \"What's going on?\" I demanded as soon as we were out of ear shot. \"Gabby's feelings are very… fragile right now.\" Devon said gently. \"Why?\" I asked my baby sister. Devon explained her whole situation to me about her parents, and that nobody, but her I and I knew. She also said that the only reason she was telling me because, Gabby is practically my little sister. \"For the first time in months, I saw her smile, a real genuine smile on her face when she heard Mason.\" She concluded her story. \"I can't imagine what that must be like for her,\" I finally said in response. \"You can't tell anyone though,\" My blonde headed sister said seriously, \"Only you and I know about it.\" I sighed, \"I wish we could help her.\" \"You and me both.\" She said going back into the living room. (Gabby's point of view) Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Devon and Danielle come back into the living. I didn't even notice them walk out. What were they doing? Does Danni- \"Gabby your mother is on the phone for you.\" Devon's mom said, coming back with the phone in her hand, breaking my line of thoughts. I pull away from Mason, \"Thank you.\" I say, taking the phone from Mrs. T, walking out of the living room. \"Hi Mom,\" I said once I was out of ear shot. \"Hi Gabby, Your farther and I have some news. Can you come home for a little while? Then you can at Devon's for the rest of spring break.\" She explained, sounding nervous. What? \"Uh sure,\" I said. \"Okay bye honey, love you.\" She said, then she hung up, and I heard the dial tone. I rolled my eyes, putting the phone back on the receiver. I went back into the living room, pulling Devon to the side. \"I have to go home for a while.\" I explained to her. \"Why?\" \"My Mom and Dad have some news.\" I said, my voice quivering a bit. \"You don't think…\" She didn't have to finish the question for me to know what she was getting at. \"I think so…\" I said thoughtfully. My parents were finally getting a divorce… \"No matter what I'm here for you,\" She said, pulling me into a hug. \"I know. Thank you.\" I said, pulling out of the hug. Turning to face '5 Leo Rise' who went back to their original position on the couch. \"I have to go home for a while,\" I announced, \"But don't worry I'll be back!\" I said in a hurry, at their faces dropping. \"At least let us drive you.\" Scooter said \"Nah, Don't worry about it I got my skate board, plus I only live a couple doors down the street.\" I said, waving him off. I then headed to the kitchen, though the back door, and jumped over the fence. \"Hi sweetie,\" My mother said with a soft smile, when I entered the living room to see my Mom and Dad sitting on the couch, with my Dad's arm around her waist. \"Uh Hi,\" I said cautiously, sitting down on the arm of a chair, \"So, What's this news?\" I asked my voice getting tight. \"Do you want to tell her Steve?\" My mother asked, while looking over to my farther. \"No you should.\" \"Tell me what?\" I asked, raising an eyebrow. \"I'm pregnant. You're going to be a big sister.\" I literally felt my mouth drop… How had they gone from screaming with each other to this? Didn't except that did you? Anyways sorry for not updating sooner, I got this new computer with a different word processor and I'm still learning how to use it. Oh yea I'm on tumblr. (Same username as fanfic) So follow me for special previews and spoilers. And I have a new poll on my account. So check that out. Updates will be faster. You're probably tired of me rambling so peace![Chapter 3] (Gabby's point of view) Pregnant… That word echoed in my mind as I walked slowly back down the sidewalk to Devon's. My converses making a scratching noise every time they hit the gray un-evened pavement. I stared down at them as if they were the most interesting pair of shoes, (Like a pair of beat up black converses would be interesting) letting them guide me back to my best friend's house. How can she be pregnant? It wasn't that I didn't want to be a big sister, because I've always wanted to have a brother or sister, but I thought by now it would be too late. I mean my mom is thirty-eight about to be thirty-nine, and my dad… he's pushing into his forties. I mean yesterday… they were fighting, how could they go from that to this? Those two questions were permently burned into my mind, (Even when I tried not to think about it) but it was no use. I was so deep into my thoughts I didn't even notice I was in Devon's front yard till she screamed, \"GABBY!\" I shook my head then looked up at her. \"So? Are they getting a divorce?\" I shook my head slowly. \"Then what was the news?\" She asked, with a confused expression. \"My mom's pregnant…\" I mumbled. \"What?\" She sounded just as shocked as I felt. I just shrugged, not wanting to think about it anymore. I moved past her into the house, just wanting to escape. I was almost to the stairs when Mason and Ritchie walked out of the kitchen, with the rest of the guys behind them. That's when I remembered that '5 Leo Rise' was there. I muttered something about having to use the bathroom, and then darted up the steps and locked myself in Devon's room. (Danielle point of view) From the kitchen I heard the door open, then slam shut, and Gabby came into view, looking like she had seen ghost. Her eyes were dull prior from the usual vibrant brown. Her mouth was pulling into a frown and it seemed to be getting deeper. (If that was even possible) She even looked a little pale. (Which is hard for Gabby to do) I looked around to see I wasn't the only one that noticed. Ritchie and Mason took jumped the gun though. They went to see if she was okay. She stopped from a moment and then she darted up the steps. Then Mason turned to Ritchie, he said something I couldn't hear. He then went up the stairs himself. (Gabby's point of view) I sat down on Devon's bed, bringing my knees close to my chest. I heard footsteps coming down the hallway. It's probably just Dev; the guys must have told her that I ran upstairs . Her mind nagged, as she tightened her hold on her knees. A minute later, a small soft knock sounded on the door. \"Dev, I really don't wanna talk to you right now.\" She called, although it didn't help, because Devon continued to knock. With a sigh she got up and crossed the room, \"Devon I said I did-\", but I stopped short at the sight of Mason standing there. \"What are you doing up here?\" I ask after a beat of silence \"Coming to check on you.\" He states simply. \"Why?\" I ask in a quiet tone. \"Because I'm worried about you,\" He says it again like it's simple. \"How can you be worried about? You barely know me.\" I let out in a bitter sombered laugh. From that point the silence engulfs us. I can't really decide if it's the good kind or the bad kind as I walk back to Devon's bed, but I think it's the bad kind because it's starting to feel like it does at my house, when my parents and I are all in a room together. \"Great.\" I said in a sarcastic bitter tone. \"What?\" Mason asks with a concerned expression. \" It's starting to feel like I'm at my house.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mason asked in a tone that was clearly concerned. It was like moving in slow motion. I didn't mean to say that out loud. I turn to face Mason. \"Nothing, It's nothing.\" I said in a firm tone lying though my teeth, and turning away from Mason, sitting back on the bed. \"Yeah right,\" Mason snapped stepping into the room, closing the door behind him. \"And I'm not leaving till you tell me, what's wrong.\" He said in firm, determined tone. I pushed myself back against the wall, pulling my knees to me like before this time I rested my head on my knees, looking anywhere but Mason. What was I going to do? Yay! Another chapter done, if you haven't checked out my poll, check it out. Was it good, bad, okay, or horrible? - Goodgirl21[Chapter 4] (Again Gabby's point of view) \"It's a long story.\" I told Mason as he came to sit beside me. He sighed grabbing my hand and squeezing it reassuringly, \"We got time.\" Running a hand through my hair, I told him the story. (Leaving out the part about how he made my body feel all warm in side) \"And now,\" I concluded, \"My mom is pregnant.\" \"Do you not want a little sibling?\" He asked. I shook my head, a sigh escaping my lips, \"No I wanted one. But I kinda thought it'd be too late by now, I mean I'm sixteen!\" \"Do they know you know they're fighting a lot?\" \"No, they seem to have the thought that if they act like everything is okay, I'll think everything is okay. Which it clearly isn't.\" I balled up my fist tightly. \"What did you want to happen?\" \"Honestly,\" I asked and he nodded, \"That they were going to get a divorce. I don't think having a baby will affect anything between them. If anything it'll only make the fighting worse. And that stress isn't good for the baby.\" Rubbing my eyes, I lean my head to rest on his shoulder. At first I was afraid he would tense up, but to Mason's credit he didn't. Probably because he felt bad for me. \"So why did you guys decide to come back?\" I changed the subject, picking my head off his shoulder. \"Well, you see we had these insanely awesome fans,\" He explained with a slight grin forming on his face, \"You might know them.\" \"I think I do,\" I told him trying to look thoughtful, \"Are you sure they weren't just insane?\" \"Hey guys,\" There's a knock on the door and KK voice floated though, \"We're watching a movie, if you wanna join.\" \"Yeah,\" Mason called, \"We'll be down in a minute.\" Once the sound of KK's footsteps disappear; Mason turned to me, \"If you wanna talk I'll listen, but its KK you should be talking to.\" \"Really?\" He nodded, \"His parents divorced when he was thirteen.\" \"I'll keep that in mind.\" I said getting off the bed. Truth be told, I was actually thinking about talk to KK. I mean it'll be nice to talk to someone who understands; rather than someone who just gives a sympathetic smile. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I asked KK while everyone was getting stuff ready for the movie. He looked taken back, but nodded anyways. We walked into the kitchen, \"Mason said I should talk to you.\" \"Why?\" He asked looking shocked. \"My parents seemed to be on the verge of a divorced.\" \"What do you mean 'seemed to be'?\" He asked with eyebrows raised, pulling out a chair and gesturing for me to sit. I sit down rubbing my eyes with my hands, \"I mean they fight all the time. Day and night, I hardly ever get to sleep at night.\" \"That's rough, sounds like they are breaking up.\" KK sighed with a grim frown on her face. He put a comforting hand on my shoulder. For a moment I sat there staring at my hands. Then I uttered, \"It's worse.\" \"How can it be any worse than your parents divorcing each other?\" He asked squeezing her shoulder a little. \"My mom is pregnant.\" I mumbled laying my head in my arms. \"Dude…\" He sounded like he seemed to be at a loss for words. \"I know I should be happy,\" I started, looking at him, \"But I just have a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, like the baby is going to make everything a lot worse.\" His hand moved to my back rubbing it soothingly. It helped a little, but not much. I was very grateful for KK right now. \"You don't have to answer this if it's too personal.\" I said looking up to stare at him. \"But…\" \"But how did your parents get divorced?\" I asked quietly. He thought for a minute before saying, \"I was twelve. My birthday was three days away. My parents sat me down and asked what I wanted. I told them I wanted the fighting to stop. That night my dad packed his things and left.\" \"Was it hard?\" He nodded a solemn sad smile on his face, \"It was at first, but I found time can heal almost every wound.\" I tried to stifle a giggle as I told him, \"You're poetic.\" \"And you're feeling better,\" He grinned, \"At least a little.\" I nodded and echoed, \"A little.\" \"Thank you.\" I told him as I grabbed his hand and squeezed, \"This really helped.\" He nodded a smile lighting his face, \"Glad I could help. Here give me your phone.\" \"Why?\" I question handing him my phone. \"So that way you have my number in case you wanna talk again.\" He told me putting his number in. Then he put my number in his phone… I know! I know! I waited way too long to update, but I thought people weren't reading! And I don't know about you, but I don't wanna waste my time and effort if nobody gonna read it. Anyways next chapter will be longer. Don't forget to review! Q: Who was more helpful to you? Mason or KK?[Chapter 5] (Mason's point of view) I smiled again, watching Gabby giggle at the joke Nickoli was telling her. It was nice seeing her smile and laugh. We just finished the movie and were trying to decide where to eat for dinner. \"I say we go to that new place that opened up on Oakland Street.\" Danielle said. Gabby looked up from her conversation with Scooter, \"Thrash said that place was really good.\" Danielle's head snapped up, \"Who's Thrash?\" (1) Devon laughed from where she was sitting with Ritchie, (practically on his lap) \"A senior from school who looks out for us. He calls us his adopted little sisters.\" Gabby nodded in agreement, a small smile on her face. I felt my stomach twist into a knot. Why am I feeling like this? I thought to myself, staring at the brunette. \"We have a problem.\" Scooter announced as we were walking to the car. \"Which is?\" Nickoli asked, opening the door to the car. Scooter turned looking at the girls, \"We can't fit the girls.\" \"What're we going to do?\" Devon asked looking into our BMW. Danielle smirked looking up, \"You two will just have to sit on Ritchie and Mason's laps.\" We turned to each other with wide eyes. (Gabby's point of view) I could feel his breath against the back of my neck; his warm fresh minty breath. Leaning back against his chest, I tried to control the rapid beating of my heart. But it doesn't help, if anything it only makes my heart quicker. I find my body ridged against his. \"Are you okay?\" He whispered, making me shiver. I nodded, not trusting my voice for anything, but a squeak. \"You sure? You don't seem fine.\" He whispered again. I nodded, placing my hands on top of his squeezing them in reassurance. Mason let it drop, but I could tell he was still on the fence. We didn't talk for the rest of the car ride. For the record even before I got out of the car, I knew something was wrong. Maybe it was the shift in the wind when we got out of the car. Or the fact that the whole restraunt went silent the second we walked through the door (But I think that was because we were with 5 Leo Rise) \"I'm gonna go to bathroom.\" Mason said when we walked through the door. But I didn't hear him; I was too busy staring at the man across the room. He had the same hair color as me and eye color to. It was my Dad. And he wasn't alone, either… \"Gabs? Are you okay?\" Devon asked. I didn't answer instead, I pointed. Following my line of vision, her eyes widened to the point they were saucers. My dad, who was laughing looked up and immediately saw me. His face dropped into a deep frown and a guilt stricken expression over took his eyes. Before I knew what I was doing, I had already started to march over there. \"What the hell is this?\" I asked in a fit of rage. My blood was boiling and I could feel an adrenaline rush being sent through my body. \"Look Gabby, I know this looks bad, but-\" Dad started to say while standing. \"No, it looks fricking fantastic,\" I told him sarcasm clear in my voice, \"Of course it looks bad! Who the hell is she?\" \"Okay look, why don't we all just-\" The woman at the table had begun to say, standing as well. \" SHUT THE HELL UP!\" I shriek at her, curling my hands in to fists. Clearing her throat she shot me a glare, \"And you are to tell me to shut up? And frankly I don't like the way you are speaking to my date.\" \"Um, I'm his sixteen year old daughter !\" I spat at her venom in my every word; some more than others. The woman turned to the person I called my father, \"You have a daughter?\" \"And a baby on the way did he tell you he's also married?\" I asked crossing my arms over my arms trying to shield myself from what was happening at the moment. \"You have a girlfriend and yet you're married, you have a daughter, and you have a baby on the way?\" She cried, \"What kind of sick person are you?\" Not wait waiting to his reply, she grabbed her purse and stormed out; all the while with Dad yelling, \"Charlotte! Charlotte, come back!\" When she didn't, he turned to me his eyes now a stormy grey color. Complete with lightning and all. He grabbed my arm a little too tightly and dragged me over by the kitchen… (Devon's point of view) Watching that scene, I knew my best friend was about to break. Gabby Davis could only take so much. No matter how hard she tried to act tough and bottle up all her emotions. I glanced at Danielle I could tell we were thinking the same thing. Now all we had to do was wait for the perfect chance to intervene. After I saw Mr. Davis raise his hands to the height of Gabby's cheek, I grabbed Ritchie's arm tightly. \"He's about to hit her!\" I said in an urgent tone, pointing frantically. We started to move, but KK got to them first. \"Don't you dare hit her.\" He told the man that use to be like my second father, in a low dangerous tone. Steve Davis rolled his eyes, \"I wasn't going to hit her, and I was just giving her a taste of what would happen if she dares to mention a word of this to her mother.\" Then he pushed past us heading for the door. But Danielle grabbed his arm, stopping him. \"If you ever raise a hand to her again,\" she told using him 'Only I can mess with my baby sisters' voice, \" You won't have to only worry about Mrs. Davis, but also me .\" \"Is he always like that? Has he ever hit you before like when your mom isn't around?\" Ritchie asked putting a hand on Gabby's shoulder. She jumped turning around. Before she answered, she shook her head. \"No only when he's drunk. And it's usually just verbal.\" She said, but there was a quiver in her voice. \"Gabby,\" Nickoli verbalized; his accent thick, \"That isn't very healthy.\" \"Look,\" Gabby stated looking around; finally noticing all the sea of face looking right at her, \"People are staring. Can we just go?\" (1)I'm talking about Thrash from The Amazing Spiderman. He just strikes me as a kind of softie that doesn't so it much[Chapter 6] (Mason's point of view) When I walked out of the bathroom the room was silent. Now normally this wouldn't have bothered me since I was part of a very popular boy band, but I could tell something was…off about this type of silence. I scanned my eyes across the room, trying to spot my friends. I finally spotted them. Gabby, whose head was inclined, was charging her way through dining room while the rest of my friends followed. I made my way over to them, grabbing Scooter's arm. He glanced back, but kept walking. \" We'll explain later,\" he mouthed, trying to keep up the pace and I followed wondering what happened to make Gabby so upset… My heart almost broke on the way back to Devon and Danielle's house. Gabby buried her head in my chest and bawled. Her sobs were so bad they shook my body while they wracked hers. I didn't say anything, just wrapped my arms around her tightly and held her. Occasionally I would whisper in her ear that I was there. While KK leaned over and rubbed her back trying to console her. My eyes, I knew were searching his for some kind of answer, but he just shook his head. Clearly stating that know was not the right time and that they would explain later. (Devon's point of view) I watched mortified as Gabby bawled into Mason's chest, but I was also keeping an eye on Mason. I was genuinely surprised. I mean Mason's a nice guy and everything, but he was letting a girl he barely knew sob into his chest, while he held her tightly and whispering soothing things in her ear. \"She'll be fine,\" Ritchie whispered, \"Mason has her in his grasp and I don't think he plans to let go anytime soon…\" \"But he barley knows her,\" I lean my head on his chest so only he can hear me. \"Devon,\" He questions quietly in my ear, \"Why do you think we came back in the first place?\" (Gabby's point of view) I sat crying in Mason's lap, while my thoughts raced. Dad was cheating on Mom and I caught him in the act. What will happen when Mom finds out? Will I be able to tell her? Will I have to tell her? Crying harder than before, I nuzzled my head deeper in to his chest. I found myself wanting to dig a hole and escape. \"Shh, Gabby I'm here.\" Mason whispered. That was the other thing bothering me. I was sobbing in Mason's chest…and he was holding me, telling me everything was going to be okay and that he was there. Without even asking questions… (Mason's point of view) After we arrived home, Gabby pulled her face from my shirt (Which was now damp with salt filled tears) \"I'm sorry,\" she told me in a small, wobbly, voice, \"I ruined your shirt.\" \"I didn't like it anyways,\" I told her shrugging my shoulders. She nodded, but didn't say anything as she got out of the car. Whatever had happened had taken a lot out of her. She didn't even wait for us to walk up the driveway with her. She ran all the way in the house then bolted up the stairs. At first I started to go after her, but Devon held me back. \"Give her some time to cool off,\" she told me, \"Then in a little while one of us will go check on her.\" Sighing, I nodded reluctantly. I didn't want to leave her alone, but at the same time I wanted some answers as to what happened. \"Fine,\" I sighed sitting on the couch, \"But what happened?\" They began their explanation… (Devon's point of view) After we told Mason what happened back at the restraunt, I took out my phone. \"Is pizza okay?\" They nodded with smiles of approval on their faces telling me what kind they wanted. \"But I thought Gabs hated pizza?\" Danni asked with a raised brow. I nodded, \"She does, but Thrash works there and he knows what to bring if Gabby is here.\" I gave a wide grin, \"Plus he gives us a twenty off discount.\" And with that I started to dial Pizza Plaza . \"Thank you for calling Pizza Plaza . May I take you order?\" Thrash's voice floated through the phone in a dull tone. I smiled laughing a little, \"It's me. I need a four flavor cheese, a superstar supreme, and Gabby's usual and bring her something desert-y too.\" \"Something happen with her parents?\" I sighed, \"You could say that…\" (Mason's point of view) I stared in shock as the guys told me what had happened at the restraunt; while Devon ordered the pizza. A pit of fury filled my body when they told me about her dad threating her. \"Wait,\" I stopped them, \"Does Gabby's mom know about her dad verbally abusing her.\" They shook their head in response. \"Are we going to tell her then?\" Danielle shrugged her shoulders looking defeated. \"I'm waiting to see how Gabby's handles all this then I'll plot my next move from there. But one thing that's for sure it that we're not leaving her alone with that man ever again …\" Waiting for Devon to give me the okay to go check on Gabby was torture. A few times I had tried to sneak up the stairs without Devon noticing, but that girl had eyes in the back of her head. \"Look Mason,\" She told me with a sigh and a sympathetic face, \"I know you're worried. I'm worried to, but we need to give her time to process all that's happened.\" I sat down with a glum expression on my face. \"I know, but I've never been good at being patient.\" The blonde patted my knee with a sad smile as the doorbell rang. Devon got up to answer it. (Devon's point of view) \"How is she?\" Thrash asked after I opened the door. I helped him carry the pizza boxes into the kitchen. \"How is she usually?\" I asked setting the boxes on the kitchen island. Thrashed cursed then he too sighed, \"That bad?\" Turning around, I shook my head. \"Worse, much worse .\" \"Damn it,\" he cursed again. He shook head and made his way to the fridge. Opening the door he set something in there. He shut the door as he sighed, \"Look, I got to get back to work or my boss will kill me. But call me after my shift is over and tell me the details.\" After handing him the money, he leaned down to kiss my cheek. \"Bye Dev.\" Then he was gone. \"Pizza's here,\" I announced walking out of the kitchen, then I turned to look directly at Mason, \"And Mason, now you can go check on Gabby.\" He got up from the step he was sitting on, and went up the steps… (Mason's point of view) After hesitating a few moments, I finally knocked tentivley on Devon's door. When she mumbled for me to come in, I opened the door. \"You okay?\" I asked shutting the door quietly. Gabby looked up and nodded, rubbing her eyes. \"I'm assuming they told you what happened?\" She asked, grabbing a tissue and rubbing away the smudged makeup. But every time she wiped away some makeup, more tears would come, and the process would start all over again. I walked over and grabbed the tissue from her, \"Here, let me help.\" Then I used my left hand to wipe her tears, while my right hand wiped the smudged makeup on her face. Gabby gave what sounded like a short bitter laugh, \"Great, just what every girl dreams of to not only cry into her celebrity crush's chest, but to have him wipe her makeup and tears off her face, as well.\" Sighing, I tucked a stray hair, behind her ear. \"I really don't mind Gabby, any of it.\" \"Why,\" she asked as she leaned into my touch ever so slightly, \"Why are you being so nice to me?\" I chuckled grinning at her, \"Remember how I was telling you about those insanely awesome fans?\" She nodded with a raised eyebrow. \"Well you see,\" I wrapped my arms around her waist while sitting down on the bed, \"One of these fans kidnapped my heart .\" After burying her head into my shoulder, she laughed. \"I know you did not say that.\" \"Oh, but I did.\" I told her. Thud. Thud. Thud. I got up and offered her my hand. When she placed her hand into mine, I pulled her up. She gave me a small smile. \"So you never finished telling what happened between you and that fan of yours.\" My grin widened as I sighed in a dramatic fashion, \"Well you see I don't know yet. I guess you'll find out when I do, but right now we have a dinner to go eat.\" Interlacing our fingers, I leaned in to kiss her cheek and led her down stairs. Hopefully my fan and I would finally become what I had to become since we performed for her school. Questions: How sweet was Mason in this chapter? Even though it's clearly not to mention painfully obvious, who do you think Mason's fan is? What do you think will happen with Mason and his fan? Do you think Gabby will tell her mom about her dad? What do you think will happen between Devon and Ritchie? For spoilers on my writing or for what's going to come next in the works follow me on Tumblr and Twitter. Links on my profile.

THIS STORY HAS FLYING GUTS AND BODY'S FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE, THE BEST BATTLE EVER KNOWN... One day as all the other days normal, peaceful but suddenly a gangster group from the one eyed tower. All the people were looking at them not knowing that it is their last day of survival. The gangsters took out all their weapons and stared to kill people. only one kid survived the gangster attack. This kid's name was Conrat. Conrat's 5 years old he lived by his parents hiding him and also getting them killed to let Conrat live. Conrat was on his own tor 7 hours with no one with him. One day a grandma heard him crying so she went and picked him up and brought him to her house and gave him a bath and said\"I am going to keep you and also when you grow up you will kill all the gangsters I promise\"... 20 years past Conrat is now 15 years old he was very strong and handsome but sad there was no girls. Conrat's mom the old lady who told him he will kill all the gangsters is now her mom. Her name was Inta... Inta have been taking care of Conrat for 20 year and has never told him what happen to his parents or that she told him that he would one day he would kill all the gangster because if she does then he would try to do it and suddenly dies that is why she never told that. When Conrat was out practice throwing his spear a gangster saw him and tried to kill him but Conrat had a fast reflects and killed him before he could even touch his spear. Conrat got scared so he brought him to Inta see if she can hide the body. When he got to Inta she was shocked, she said \"what have you done you put us both in great danger now they are going to look for us and when they find us they will cut off our head When it was 12:00 o'clock Conrat woke up and got the dead gangster to buried him far far away. Conrat brought him so far that thy reached the place were the group of gangsters were, Conrat got shocked because the tower was so high, it was so high that it reached the clouds. Conrat started digging a hole to put the dead guy in. The smell was so stinky that it made him dizzy... When he was dizzy it was like he was drunk, he didn't know what was going on so he dig a really deep. He was digging till it was dawn. One of the guards went out to pea but he saw him so he told everyone... When Conrat got he got to his house he saw Inta laying on the ground with a knife on her neck. Conrat was so so sad and also very very mad. Conrat got his knife , his spear, and also the gangster' armor, Conrat saw some foot steps so he followed it. The foot steps led him to the tower. when Conrat saw the buff guards it didn't scare him he just ran to the guards and started to fight them. the buff guards died not even trying to touch Conrat with spears. When he got in all the gangster stared at him then started to attack him but he still didn't run away he also attacked them. Conrat was doing back flip kicks, and throwing them, and killing them. He was surrounded but none of them could even hurt him or scratch him. Conrat was thinking about Inta that's why he was so strong and also vey brave. Some of the gangster started to run away because they were loosing the fight against Conrat. When Conrat got to the stairs he was surrounded from the front, back, and sides but that didn't scare him he just screamed saying \" you will all die for killing my mother \"! This time Conrat had cuts Conrat was starting to get week but that didn't stop him he just kept thinking about Inta. Conrat killed most of the gangsters so they don't have many gangsters left so most of the gangster ran away. When Conrat got to the vey top of the tower the king wasn't there, that really made him angry. Conrat went back home with cuts and pieces of brains and fingers all over his body. He took his towel and wiped his body, when he finished he took a shower but there was no water so he just pea on a bucket and used it to wash him. When Conrat went out to get wood for the fire he saw a man he thought it was a gangster but he realized that he had ropes on his hands so he said to himself \"maybe he was a gangster then he did somthing to the king\" so Conrat slowly went to the prisoner and freed him. Conrat brought him to his house and said \"who are you, what is your name,\" the guy said \"my name is Carter, I am from the southern tower, Conrat said \"were is the southern tower\" i need to get there\" Carter asked him \"Why do you need to go there\" Conrat said it's none of your business\" Carter said \"I know why it's because you want revenge on the king\". Carter said \"i can help you find the king\" Conrat agreed with Carter. Carter asked Conrat why do you need to kill the king\" Conrat said \"because he killed my mom\". Conrat asked Carter \"why were you a prisoner even though you were in the same group\" Conrat said \"the northern tower and southern tower are big enemies\" Conrat asked \"why\" he said \"because one you see long time ago the northern and the southern towers were like best friends till they choose Faboo for king, it was like a giant killing ants when they attacked us\". Conrat felt sorry for Carter so he gave him his word that they would kill the king together and also that they would be like brothers... One day Conrat and Carter were planing to make a underground training and meeting place. Conrat thought they could do it but Carter said \"we don't have the right tolls to make even a hole. Conrat said \"yes we do we just aren't looking good and by looking good i mean go to the northern tower\" Carter wasn't scared to go he was happy because he always wanted revenge. Conrat and Carter got all there weapons and armors and were ready to go on there way. When they got there there were no gangster any were they king of confused, Carter saw all the tools on a bucket. Conrat was confused he said to him self why are there no people and also why is all the tools just laying there\" When they got to the tools they fell down on a hole and both were knocked out... When they both woke up they were tide up with a very strong rope. Conrat asked Carter if he had something sharp but he said they took our weapons while we were knocked out. Conrat's leg was bleeding so bad that he couldn't feel it, he asked carter if they were being watched Carter said \"yes we are but it is just one guy but really buff and he has a'lot of weapons with him\". When the guy went to use the bathroom Conrat took a rock and started to use it to cut it. The rope was strong but he still continued cutting the rope. When he finished cutting the rope the guy came back and saw them trying to escape so he shouted saying \"his lose his lose\"![Chapter 2] Hey guys i am back. Ready to see more action with Conrat and Carter and also if you hate blood and guts then i think it is the best time to go back. and also please like it i worked my butt up for this story because trying to name a character is hard for me. the story begins. They couldn't escape so they knew they had to fight all of them. Conrat and Carter were on back to back taking them all like as if they were kids 11 year old kids. When they killed most of them they started to run away. Conrat saw an open spot to run in to with out anyone knowing them leafing. When they got to the house it was all burn down and destroyed. Conrat was sad because the house was the only memory for Inta. Carter felt sorry for Conrat so he went out to find the one who burn down and destroyed the house. Heard someone say something about the house being burned down so he jumped them and shouted to them asking \"are you the one who burned down and destroyed the house\" they said \"no it wasn't us it was the Trolls\". Carter was shocked he went to Conrat and told him that trolls are the one that did all this you know the big harry disgusting guys but Conrat didn't care he just washed the tears from his eyes and took his knife without armor or a spear or a sword he just brought a knife. Conrat went looking for trolls in the forest. He looked for them till night. When he found the trolls there were only two of them so he attacked them even though they knew he was coming. He jumped on one of the trolls back and started to stab him a'lot of times the other troll tried to help help the troll by hitting Conrat but he still didn't let go he just kept stabbing the troll on the back till he died. The other troll got angry so he gave Conrat his best shot but conrat kept on blocking and stabbing the troll till he also died. Conrat went back to Carter with blood all over him and also tiny guts. Carter tried to helped him take off the blood and guts on his body but Conrat refuse him not to even touch him. It really made Carter sad so he went and sat next to a tree but he felt the tree moving so Carter got up to see if it was really moving. When he got up he could see the top shaking so he thought that there was a person up there but then he started to think if \"if there is a person up there then how did he make the tree to move. When he sat back down the tree moved again so he got up climbed up the tree to see what is making the tree move. When he got to the top of the tree he saw something that will never jump of his head. What he saw was a Ents . Ents are trees thet can see, talk, and move. Carter was so shocked and also so happy because if they team up they can defeat all the gangsters and most important the king. Carter introduced him to the ent saying \"hi my name is Carter i am from the southern tower whats your name\" the ent said \" my name is Novle\". Carter asked him if he was the only one there Novle said \" yes all the other ents left because of the mean king\" Carter felt sorry so he took some seeds and said \"see i can make new ents\" but Novle said \" it wont work\" Carter asked him why Novle said \"because we are not made from seeds we were made from a wizard named Melfot. Melfort had a really great power till the king defeated him\". Carter asked if Mefort was still alive Novel said\"what does the word defeat mean to you\" Carter said \"it means you loose i think\" Novle stopted talking and asked Carter \"were is your friend? Carter saked \"you mean Conrat yea he is just right behind me\". Novle said \"no he is not\" Carter turned back to see if he was there but he wasn't. Carter and Novel went out looking for him everywhere but they couldn't find him they thought he went to get food or water or to kill more trolls. While they were walking they saw big foot steps so they followed it. the foot steps let them to a big tunnel made by trolls. when they got in they saw Conrat on a cage made out of iron. Carter couldn't reach for the cage but Novel could so he got the cage and took a relly big rock and started smashing the iron cage. While he was smashing the cage 10 trolls heard it and went to checked it out. when they saw what was happening they called all the other trolls. there were more then 30 trolls there. Carter told Novel that he would give him time to brake the iron cage while he was trying to fight the trolls. Carter was running all over the tunnel screaming because the trolls were chasing him. When Novel broke the iron cage they saw Carter running for his live. Conrat told Novel to go right while he go to the left. Conrat told Carter to go to the front but he said \"wont that be really bad i mean do you see what they are trying to do to me yea they are trying to kill me and eat me so if you have a better idea it would be really grate to hear it right freaking now! Conrat said \"just trust me dummy\" Carter agreed with the plan but he also said you owe me an apology if this plan works\" When Carter went to the front he shouted to all the trolls saying \"stop, stop, stop, stop! All the trolls stop and looked at each other confused Carter said \"my name is Carter i am from the southern tower so if you dont want all your heads to fall of your neck or in other words DEAD stop chasing me got it! Conrat and Novel looked at each other confused. Conrat and Novel started to do there trap. Conrat told Carter that the trap was done so he said \"look two intruders are behind you when the trolls looked back they saw Conrat and Novel making fun of them so they ran towards them but suddenly they all fell to their own iron Cage. When the three guys were on there way to find a new place to stay in Carter told Conrat \"still waiting\" Conrat asked \"waiting for what? Carter said \"remember you o me an apology\" so Conrat said \"okay i am so sorry for telling you to go to the front but i didn't tell you to say what you were saying\" Carter told Novel \"this is all your fault\" Novel asked \" what did i do? While they were walking Carter found a cave and said \"look that is were we should stay i mean look at it it is so beautiful am i right Novel\" Conrat replied \"you mean we act like cave mans and start drawing on the wall no we are not going in there\" Carter asked Conrat \"was i talking to you\" Conrat said \"do you want to go back to were i found you\" Carter said \"no\" when Conrat looked away he silently said \"so serious\" Novel said \" there is a house north from here \" Conrat asked \"how do you know\" he said \" i can see it by the roots on the ground from all trees \" Carter said \"wait a minute your saying you see things through the root under the ground y.. y.. you could of used it to find Conrat when he was captured dummy\" When they got to the house Novel saw someone outside watering his flowers. Novel said to Conrat and Carter \" the person watering the flowers is MELFORT...[Chapter 3] This is pretty shocking ha i mean Melfort could have stop the king instead he waters his plants!

Novel was shocked he ran straight to Melfort and gave him a really bid was also very mad he told him \" where were you when we needed you,you were alive all this time and never killed the king ! Carter was confused he asked Conrat \"how is he mad and happy at the same time don't you think that is weird i mean look at that he is hugging him and also staring at him as if he is going to kill him\" Conrat told Carter \"remember he is a really strong wizard remember\".When Conrat and Carter went in the house all they saw was flowers and little trees. When they asked Melfort were they are going to sleep he said \"out side\" Carter said \"out side were we just came\" Melfort said \"why you scared of the dark\" Carter said \"no im just scared of WHAT IS OUT SIDE! Melfort said \"i'm just joking you sleep in my room i'll sleep out side\" Carter and Conarat felt sorry for him so they told him they would sleep out side. when they got outside Melfort started to laugh saying \"that works all the time\" Carter also herd it but he did nothing Conrat was surprised he said \"how come you are not mad i mean every time someone does something bad to you,you do revenge back as quick as possible\" Carter was already asleep. When Conrat woke up Carter was not there he saw Melfort coming out of the house opened the door suddenly a big splash of mud on his enter bodyConrat saw Carter laughing in the woods when he looked away and turned back but Carter was gone. Conrat called Novel and Melfort to go help him look for Cater. They searched every where but couldn't find him. Conrat was so sad he said \"i am not loosing anyone else any more. Novel said \" i will try to find him by the roots\",when he finished he said \"he is not captured he is just sitting on a rock crying. Novel brought them to him, Conrat asked him \"why are you crying? he said \"because i really miss my family\" Conrat asked him \"were are they\" he said they were killed by the king\" Conrat asked do you want to talk about it\" he said \"it happened long ago i was still 9 it was raining my friends and i were playing in the rain suddenly we heard a'lot of horses walking in from the shadow,are moms called us in to be safe,our solders went and waited for them, 4 minuets later the shadow went away all the people saw the king and a view other men's on horses are men's started to laugh at the king suddenly they saw a whole army behind them,our men's stand there scared but they didn't retreat we all could hear our men's saying \" we fight for our family and our country \" over and over all the dad's got out to help them even my dad he told me something i will never forget he said \" son if i die take care of your mother for me and also be strong if they come for you and mom you guys start running okay\" all our men's died even my dad all the kings solders's got in houses and killed family's i told mom \"mom lets go we are going to be killed if we don't go\" mom said \"you go they would catch us if i don't give you time to run\" i asked her what do you mean me\" while we were talking we heard a guy shouting \"open\" mom said \"they are hear run now\" i got out of the back door and looked at mom she was crying suddenly the solders got in she stop them for a couple of seconds but it gave me a'lot time to run far way from them till i found the northern tower that's where i grew up from till i was 21 then i was captured in the war then you found me thank you for everything you did for me\" Conrat saw Novel and Melfort crying also so he took Carter's hand and picked him up he said \"Carter your parents died as hero's and everyone will remember them in there heart. Novel and Melfort said \"you know what Carter i wish i had that kind of parents\" Conrat told all the guy's \"you know what we should make a group let's have Carter to give us our names\" Carter was very happy he said \"i never get to give the group name in my live\" He said \"i got the best group name ever the animals\" they all shouted \"nnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooooooo! He said what about \"non give upers\" they all said \"please no\" He said what about the monkeys\" Conrat said \"i shouldn't have picked him to give us the name\" Carter said \"now i got it the shadow clan because when we kill someone we go and hide or we just wait in the shadows till someone comes then we kill him . They were shocked because it sounded so cool. They went in and drew a really big map of the two towers and also drew the towers and the clans. Carter said are you going to draw all the clans\" Conrat said i don't know the names for the clans\" Carter took the map paper and drew where all the clans were he said \"there's the northern tower were i'm from and the southern tower were the king is and the wild cat's the explosions the killers the treats the dog's the mind fielder's the live or die the rising sun the https means hate those that pleases someone and the matrix\" Conrat,Novel,and MElfort looked at each other asking each other saying \"how many clans are there? All of them got out and planed for a while Conrat asked Carter \"where do you think the king is? he said right now he should be at the wild cat's clan Conrat asked \"why would he go there? he said \"all the clan's are friend's with the king except the northern tower! Conrat asked Why the northern tower he said \"because of what he did remember. While they were planing outside they heard crack's at the wood's Conrat and Carter wen't to check out what was it. They couldn't find anything,Conrat told Carter that they should spread out and see who is the one who made all the cracking. When they wen't back they could not find Novel and Melfort. They searched everywhere but still couldn't find them. Carter hit Conrat in the head so hard it gave him a bruise Conrat asked him why he did it he said \"to see if i am dreaming\" Conrat said \"you don't hit someone else to see if you are dreaming you hit yourself\" Conrat told Carter \"we should check there room's when they got in they couldn't find them. They went back outside they still couldn't find them anywhere. Carter said \"man if we had Novel he could just find them right now. Conrat said Novel is who we are looking for. Carter saw a really big shadow above him he looked up he saw Melfort and Novel flying he said \"look Conrat Melfort and Novel are flying\" Conrat looked up he saw them but he said \"Carter they are not flying ,they are captured by a Dragon![Chapter 4] hey guys so i asked a friend to tell me a monsters a good monster name and she said brian... thankyou fish777 So if you guys please help me on my monster name i will find your name and tell all my friends to like it if you are not interested then let me tell you something i have more than 15 friends so if you like my story and have a good monster name thank you very much.

All of them said \"well um, well um ,well um? Carter said really guys thanks for supporting me jerks. Conrat told him that they couldn't attack because the dragon can breath fire. Carter said to the king \"oh my gosh what is that? the king looked away to see what it was. When he looked to see what was happening Carter attacked him. The dragon saw him attack so he was ready to burn him but out of nowhere 2 and a girl guy came out and killed the dragons. The king was shocked so he just used his magic to make him was so happy he jumped on one of the girl and said \"wow how did you guys do that i mean i was trying to fool it but wow you guys just attacked it you guys have to tell me your name. The oldest said \"i'm Jack my brother's name is Felix and my sister's name is Sophia. As soon as all of them took of there costumes, as soon as Sophia took off her costumes Carter saw her eyes and just fell in love with her. Carter saw a leave and picked it up to put it on his head to make it look like he was wearing a jacket. As soon as Jack asked what there names where Conrat was trying to say it but Carter interrupted him and said \"the guy that was trying to say our names is Conrat And the talking tree is Novel the old guy is Melfort\"and when he was about to say his name he took the leave off his head and said \"i am Carter. Conrat told them they should go to there house but Jack said they should go to there's, Carter said we have to be fare with each other so he got in the middle and called in Felix he said \"the only way to do this is ,i can't belief i am doing this but it is the only way we have to do rock paper or scissor\"all of them started to laugh at him.

They have been throwing the same stuff over and over for 1 hour so Jack got tiered so he said they should just follow Conrat but carter said \"we are not done yet. Jack just went to him and punched him in the face so hard it knocked him down. Felix said \"we weren't done yet\" so Conrat went to him and punched his face hard it also knocked him down. Carter and Felix woke up they were in a tree house they where confused so Felix asked Carter to ask Conrat where they were but he told Felix to ask Jack where they were but he said \"i'm scared of him Carter aked him \"how can you be scared of your own brother Felix said \"because he can beat me up Carter told Felix \"well i guess that makes the two of us. Felix laughed so hard they all could here him. When they all went to them they fake sleep when they left Carter and Felix told each other that they are too worried so they planed to make a prank. When Conrat and Jack woke up they went out but the the ground was filled with mud so they went back to sleep but there beds were gone so they went to there weapons but it was also gone so they woke up everyone but when they got to Carter and Felix's bed they were not there so all of them shouted Carter Felix! They saw them coming out of the bathroom with the weapons and beds. Conrat told Carter and Felix \"this is not the time to make jokes. Carter and Felix said \"well we thought it would well you know get our heads out off all this things we have been trough. Sophia laughed at what Carter said so he felt very good. Sophia went to Carter and said \"so all you did was to make us not think about what we have been trough\" Carter said \"well yea do you like it\" She said \"i don't like it\" Carter sighed Sophia said\"i love it\" Suddenly Carter jumped up with joy. While he was jumping with joy Melfort and Novel said \"we have to go a group of army is coming\" so they got all there stuff and ran away. Conrat told them okay i think we lost them suddenly they all could hear millions of feet stumbling on the ground suddenly they could see them. Conrat said \"lets run now before we die\" but Jack said \"no no more running for me! So they just stood there they were outnumbered 100 to 1 but still they didn't run.

She walked in with some guy and right then, I realize how much I want her back. I was stupid for ending the relationship. Ever since I broke up with her, I've been asking myself why I did it. If I was in love with her, then it shouldn't have been anything more then a bump in the road, right? Everytime I see her smile, it reminds me of how stupid I was, how stupid I'm being. Forgive her already dude! Or actually tell her that you forgive her.. I tell the people I'm sitting with I'll be back and make my way across the room to where Jenny's standing. Our eyes meet, and she meets me halfway. She makes small talk, and I can tell she's nervous. One thing leads to another, and she's asking me if I forgive her. Of course I do, but the show's gonna start, so I say that we'll talk about it later. The concert's good. P.A. sure knows how to bring the performer out of everyone. Jenny's standing beside me and I casually throw my arm around her shoulder. She looks up at me and smiles then returns her gaze to the stage, moving ever so slightly closer to me. Think we're okay now? Jenny's POV: It's been a week since Marco and I patched things up between us. We act as if we never broke up, and we both swear that what we went through was just one of those times when couples fight. It's natural, and right now, we couldn't be happier.

The Adventures of a Singing Student Marco smiled at his girlfriend as she unlocked her father's apartment. Jenny fumbled with the keys as she struggled to unlock the deadbolt. \"Shit,\" she muttered, dropping the keys. Marco laughed as he wrapped his arms around her waist. \"Don't laugh at me,\" Jenny said finally getting the key to turn, before pushing the door open. Marco pulled her in for a kiss as they stepped over the threshold. He kicked the door shut before feeling for the light switch, and turning it on. Jenny broke the kiss. Breathing heavily, she asked, \"Do you want to stay the night?\" Marco raised his eyebrows. Jenny wasn't usually so forward. She noticed his expression and said exasperatedly, \"We aren't going to do anything!\" Marco raised his eyebrows higher. \"Ok,\" Jenny sighed. \"We might make out; a bit .\" Marco smiled. \"Let me call my dad,\" he said pulling out his cell phone. Jenny nodded and went to her room to pull on some sweat pants. As she started to pull her hair up, Marco's voice came from the doorway, \"Leave it down.\" Jenny complied and asked, \"You can stay?\" \"Yup,\" he replied. \"We just have to eat breakfast at my dad's restaurant. Apparently I'm not around enough anymore.\" \"Oh, ok,\" Jenny said sitting down on her bed. Patting the spot next to her, she smirked up at Marco. He sat beside her, after taking off his jacket and kicking off his shoes. He smiled at Jenny and brushed a strand of hair out of her face. \"You know I love you, right?\" Jenny said. Marco's smile grew wider. \"How could you not?\" he joked. \"I have the voice of an angel!\" Jenny slapped him lightly on the arm and said, \"Yeah, you wish.\" \"Oh; really? How did I get into PA then?\" \"I don't know.\" Jenny said lying back on the bed. \"It must have been your charm.\" \"You do have a point.\" Marco said seriously, lying back with Jenny. \"I must have charm; I mean how else did I get you to go out with me?\" \"I'm always right,\" Jenny replied. \"And you didn't charm your way into going out with me. You just got very annoying.\" \"Oh; really? So you're really only going out with me because you feel bad that I don't have any charm?\" \"That's why!\" Jenny joked. Marco faked a hurt look. \"You know I'm kidding,\" Jenny said. \"You have tons of charm. \"I told you so! See even the great Jenny Garrison can admit it!\" \"Yeah, yeah. Now all I've done is given you an even bigger ego! Ms. Fran won't know what to do with you!\" Jenny replied. \"Well at least you love me,\" Marco said before leaning in for a kiss. An hour later, when Mr. Garrison came home, he went into his daughter's room.

Even though no one was in the halls, and there wasn't really much to record, a director could never have enough practice. Besides, things happened when you didn't expect them too. Class was out, but things happened in the halls of P.A. even after class. That was usually because students were always there after school, practicing monologues, learning the words to a new song, or even perfecting their dance skills. And Neil? Neil just liked to walk around and wait for something to happen. Great directors were always there when something happened. He turned his camera on the uninteresting lockers, as if he expected something to pop out and make the afternoon filming day more interesting. But nothing occurred. Neil groaned inwardly. It was a slow day, nothing really all that exciting happened. But, he was a director. He forced himself to be patient. He went on, tearing his camera away from the lockers and moved further down the hall. Neil passed the door of an acting class, where a group of freshman actors were all practicing monologues and critiquing each other on their performances. Neil scoffed. Freshman nearly always practiced and stressed out more than anyone. Mostly because it was their first year, and they had a lot to prove. More than anyone else, at least. Thank goodness he was a sophomore, at least. He kept moving, wandering down a staircase. His camera swiveled around the empty stairway, as if looking for a star, someone or something to record. But, that was difficult when there wasn't any other person in the hall besides himself and his camera. Neil smoothly made his way down the final few steps and suddenly, a sound that wasn't all that foreign to students at P.A. met his ears: Music. But, there was something about this music that drew Neil into the hallway, looking around for the room where the sound was coming from. Finally , something to record. He moved along the hall and the music grew louder. It was an upbeat, hip-hop song, a song meant to move anyone into dancing. He kept twisting his camera around the vacant corridors, searching for the source of the sound that brought life to the dead hallways. After crossing nearly every classroom, with the music only getting louder and louder, Neil finally came across the room where the sweet sound of music was emitting from. He turned to look at the last classroom in the hall on the left side. It was one of the many dance studios around the school where the many dancers practiced and learned new dancing techniques. Yes, the music was definetly coming from this room. Neil peeked inside the room, interested in seeing the dancers inside the room. Because, as Neil had learn, with all music comes a dancer. His inner director triggered his curiosity and got the best of him: Neil peeped in the room, but he was surprised at what he saw. He only saw a sole performer, dancing in the center of the room. It was a girl. She looked to be in Neil's year, in fact, he was nearly certain that he had seen her, probably in the halls of P.A., more than once. She looked to be of Hispanic origin; she had long, dark hair that flowed down her back and fell in her face as she moved, but it didn't pass her waist. She had a dancer's build, but she was different from most of the female dancers he had seen around the school. Most of the girls who danced all had small bodies and almost no muscle; even some seniors who were dancers looked like they were about twelve years old. But, this girl was more muscular and had more curves than the majority. Neil turned his camera to face her. She seemed to move well with the music, almost like she was getting lost in the thumping hip-hop beat. Her hips moved side to side with the music; her arms moving in time with the rest of her body, helping her dancing look all the better. She was so lost in the music and her dancing, in fact, that she didn't even notice Neil opening the door and coming into the room, his camera in hand. When he came inside the room, he moved toward the nearest corner. He had learned that the best footage was usually taken with either really good actors, or when someone didn't exactly know you were filming them. He had filmed a lot of dancers in his high school directing career, but he'd never quite filmed a dancer like this girl. Her body seemed to move in perfect rhythm with the song, and the way she danced made the dance look easy, which was the secret of any great dancer. She glided across the rooms, her steps seeming like they came easily to her. The girl also seemed to be pleased with what she was doing, too, which is how every artist should feel about their craft. She seemed to generally enjoy the sensation of moving to the pace of the stirring music; her face draped with an almost intoxicated expression. Neil kept his camera on the mysterious girl. Finally, after one boring afternoon, his camera had found a star, something interesting and attention grabbing to film. And Neil's camera wasn't the only thing that couldn't seem to stop watching her; Neil found it hard to look away from the dancer, moving so gracefully and simply to the moving beat. His camera followed her around the room, eagerly anticipated every move she made. The dancer was still ignorant to the fact that Neil stood in a corner, recording her with his camera. After the seemingly endless song finally began to fade, its beat growing fainter and fainter, the girl's dancing seemed to lighten, too. Soon, she came to a complete stop when the song had ended. Neil slowly closed his camera and turned it off, his eyes still on the girl. She stood there, in the center of the room, breathing heavily. Sweat trickled down her brow and the side of her face. The shirt she wore was nearly all drenched in sweat around the lower arms and the girl's neck. But the pair of stretchy dance shorts that went up to her knees she wore seemed untouched by sweat. After the girl seemed to regain her breath, Neil couldn't seem to stand the now eerie silence that swallowed the room after the music ended. So, he did something either really brave, or really stupid: He made himself noticed, by clapping his hands together, almost like an individual applause for the dancer. The girl whipped around to face the sound of Neil's clapping, her hair flying around her face as she turned. Her eyes found Neil, stepping out of the corner of the room, clapping his hands. They seemed like two giant orbs, wide with shock. Suddenly, she spoke. \"How long have you been there?\" Neil grinned shyly, but responded, \"Long enough.\" When she didn't respond, but only stood there, watching him carefully, he added, \"That… was a great dance. You did a really wonderful job.\" The girl still look at him suspiciously, not trusting his praise, like she suspected him to tease her or something. \"Um… thanks,\" she said, her shoulders suddenly softening. \"I think,\" she added as an afterthought. Neil laughed a little and reassured her, \"No, really, I meant that. Believe me, if your dancing skills weren't good, I'd probably be the first to tell you. You know… besides Ms. Kraft.\" He was abruptly taken over by awkwardness, unsure of what to do next. He extended his hand to shake, feeling like a total retard. \"I'm Neil Baczynsky.\" She looked at his hand cautiously before taking it in her own and shaking it. \"Rosie Martinez.\" They just kind of stood there, clumsily shaking hands, before Rosie let go of his hand. Then, suddenly, her name fully registered in Neil's brain and he remembered why she looked like he had seen her around before. \"Wait a second, Rosie Martinez… from Mr. Dowd's acting class?\" Rosie nodded. \"And… you're Neil. The one in Mr. Dowd's class with the camera, who likes to record stuff, right?\" Neil pulled out his camera from where he had put it in his pocket. \"Guilty is charged,\" he said sheepishly, putting it back. \" That's why you looked familiar!\" she said, a triumphant look on her face. He just stood there, suddenly feeling kind of uncomfortable. \"Yeah… I like film-making. Hoping to be a director someday.\" Rosie nodded, remembering this new information. \"So, Neil, what are you even doing here?\" she asked, making her way over to the other side of the studio where her dance bag lay on the floor, a water bottle next to it. She reached down for the bottle and drank from it as if she had been stuck in the Sahara Desert without anything to drink for a day. Neil merely shrugged. \"I was just kind of walking around…,\" he looked down at his feet for a second, \"and I just followed the music, really.\" She bobbed her head in understanding as she drained her bottle of the last few drops, then set it back down next to her bag. \"So…,\" he began, \"what about you? What do you like to do, you know, besides acting.\" He paused for a second, pondering the wording of his next statement before he bluntly said, \"I can see you also like dancing.\" Rosie seemed to smile fairly from where she stood. \"Yeah, I'm good at hip-hop dancing. I love it, too.\" Neil scrunched his eyebrows together, interested. \"What about ballet and other stuff? Do you only dance hip-hop?\" Rosie crumpled up her nose in distaste. \"I'm not really that big of a ballet fan.\" He looked at her, partially confused. \"But… you're a dancer, right?\" She simply nodded and shrugged. \"Yeah, but… I don't really like ballet. A dancer doesn't have to like every kind of dancing style, and ballet is just not my style. Honestly, it's just too strict for me,\" she said, the more she talked, the more heated her discussion became, \"there are too many rules and restrictions… plus, I feel so out of place. I mean… I'm surrounded by girls that are so different from me: They're mostly all skinny little girls with no butts, and so little body fat that they'll never be able to partner correctly. It's just sad, really.\" \"Wow,\" was all Neil could say after she was done, looking up at her fiery brown eyes. \"You seem to feel strongly about this.\" \"Yeah, well,\" Rosie went on, \"Ms. Kraft expects me to learn to be a great ballet dancer, but…,\" she sighed, like she felt the world on her shoulders, weighing her down, \"my heart's just not in that kind of dancing.\" She turned to Neil and looked at him, her head cocked to the side, like she was wondering or thinking. \"What about you?\" she said. \"Do you dance?\" Neil hurriedly looked up and shook his head like a madman. \"Oh, no, I-I don't dance.\" Rosie grinned at him and walked slightly forward. \"Really? Not even a little?\" He shook his head harder, almost certain it would fall off. \"No, I can't really dance, so--\" \"You can't dance, or you won't dance?\" Rosie asked, still walking forward. \"No, no, no, I mean I can't dance,\" Neil stammered, feeling self-conscious. \"It's… kind of… not in my nature--\" Rosie smiled at him, now standing directly across from him, crossing her arms stubbornly. \"Then show me.\" \"What?\" Neil asked, feeling even more uncomfortable by the second. \"Come on,\" she said, pressing further. She wasn't the type to back down easily. \"Show me some dancing.\" Neil began to blabber, feeling panic rise inside of him. \"B-But, I just said I couldn't dance--\" \"You didn't prove it, though,\" Rosie said, grinning smugly, her arms not moving from their position, crossed across her chest. \"But, I won't know what to do!\" Neil exclaimed, feeling his face burn at his own stupidity. Rosie ignored him momentarily and turned around, headed back towards her bag. Neil hadn't seen it until now, but next to her dance bag sat a stereo. Rosie pressed the power button, turning it on, then clicked the play button with one swift movement of her hand. She walked back to face Neil and grabbed his hand, dragging him to the center of the room. Neil face burned an even brighter shade of red as music began to play. \"Then I'll show you,\" she said over the starting music. The beat of this song was nearly the same as the last, except this song didn't move quite as quickly. It was still a moving hip-hop song that could make even the lousiest dancer dance. \"Let's start with something simple that only has a few steps.\" Neil attempted to plead his way out of this. \"B-But I really don't--\" \" Shush !\" Rosie said harshly, but then smiled. \"You're going to dance whether you like it or not.\" She took his hand and placed it on her waist. Then she secured his other hand into her own. \"You can dance almost anything with hip-hop music,\" she stated, placing the hand that wasn't in Neil's on his shoulder. He just kind of stood there, waiting for further instructions and getting ready to make a complete idiot of himself. \"Ready?\" Rosie said, grinning because she already knew the answer. \"No,\" he said, wanting to retreat immediately. \"Good,\" she said, not letting go of his hand or looking like she would tolerate him giving up. \"Now, we'll start off with simple steps. One, two three, four….\" Rosie repeated this, keeping time with their steps. She lifted her left foot to bring it forward, so Neil could bring his back. But, too bad Neil wasn't lying when he said he couldn't dance. Instead of moving his foot back, he brought it forward, only to step on Rosie's. Rosie bit back a yelp, abruptly removing her foot from under his. \"Sorry,\" he muttered, embarrassed at his mistake. \"It's ok,\" she said, a grin taking over her face again. \"Let's try this again.\" She brought her left foot forward again, and this time Neil moved his back. But when she brought her right foot back, he did the exact opposite of what he was supposed to do and brought his right foot back. \"No, you have to bring yours forward-- \" \"Oh, sorry, I-I--\" Neil kept stammering and quickly tried to fix his error, bringing his foot rapidly forward. Rosie barely had time to blink as Neil foot landed on top of her right foot, stepping on her toes for the second time. \"Ow!\" she exclaimed, feeling relieved when he moved his foot from her's. \"Oh, I didn't mean too, um--\" Neil's face was a bright shade of crimson as he blushed deeper and deeper. \"It's alright . Really,\" Rosie said, grinning slightly at him, the throbbing pain in her toes now almost completely gone. \"Wow, you sure we're kidding when you said you couldn't dance….\" \"Great!\" Neil exclaimed, looking up and smiling. \"Now that you understand that I can't dance, I think I should stop now!\" He jokingly turned to leave, but Rosie gripped his shoulder tightly. \"No, no, no,\" she said warningly, cocking her finger at him in playful disapproval. \"You're not going to give up, you're going to keep trying until your feet bleed, do you hear me? Keep—AH!\" Rosie yelped in surprise as Neil grinned mischievously, grabbed her hand, and brought his hand over her head, causing her to twirl around in a circle. After she had finished spinning in a circle, Rosie came to a stop, laughing and holding onto Neil's shoulder to steady herself. \"I'm guessing you liked that?\" Neil asked, smirking, the redness that had overcome his face at one point now gone. Rosie just kept laughing, smiling from ear to ear. \"Hey, I'm no ballerina, but I'll admit that was fun,\" she said, slightly breathless from her previous laughter. She looked up, still smiling. Neil chuckled and shook his head, his black curls flying around his face. Rosie just grinned, took a step towards him, stood on her tip-toes and gave him a light kiss on the cheek. Neil stood there, feeling like someone just slapped him across the face. Had she really just done that? Rosie smiled at him, then back away a little. \"Well, nice to actually talk to you, Neil.\" Then, she walked to the other side of the room without another word and turned off the stereo, opening it to remove the CD inside and putting the CD in her bag. \"Wait,\" Neil said after her retreating back, where she was walking over to her dance bag. \"Where are you going?\" \"I have to go home now,\" Rosie said, grabbing her bag and slinging it over her shoulder. \"It's getting late anyway.\" She walked towards the door and opened it to leave. But before she stepped outside, she turned around and said, \"See you around, Neil. Nice talking to you.\" After those final words and one wave of her hand, she was gone. Slowly, after Neil's brain had begun to function correctly again, he found himself walking out of the room and into the hallway, back to filming lockers. But, this time, his mind was still full of thumping music and dancing, even though before that day, Neil didn't think he'd ever be interested in dancing. But that was before he actually had a conversation with Rosie Martinez.

Hahaha, joking xD In all seriousness, I decided to make a fanfiction involving Kevin from the movie \"Fame\". The 2009 version, not the original one. IhaveacrushonKevinalright?! Anyway~ I decided that each chapter will take place during each school year. So there will be time skips! I might also continue a little bit after the movie/after Kevin graduates. So yeah! Enjoy~! 01: Freshman Year -Anna- I sighed, throwing the empty box back into the dumpster beside me. \"Another foodless search.\" I mumbled, running a hand through my short auburn hair. I sighed and looked at the sky. \"What on earth am I going to do?\" I asked, spreading my arms out. I looked down. \"That's right...nobody's listening.\" I scoffed. \"If somebody was listening, I wouldn't be here right now.\" I shook my head and turned to look around the alley. I picked up a box; sturdy enough with no rain damage. Perfect. I walked to the end of the alley and set the box on the ground. I reached into my pocket to find a crumpled up dollar bill. All the money I have. I uncurled the bill and set it in the box. I stood up straight and let out a deep breath. \"Here goes nothing...\" I mumbled. I closed my eyes, and started singing. \" Listen to the song here in my heart A melody I start but can't complete Listen to the sound from deep within It's only beginning To find release ...\" -Kevin- Kevin sighed as he walked out of the Performing Arts School, feeling more down than normal. He shook his head, running a hand through his bangs. \"I can't let this setback get me down! I can get through this!\" Kevin sighed. \"Ms. Kraft...I wish that she would believe in me...\" Kevin continued walking toward his apartment. Sure he missed it back home, but when would he get a chance like this again? When again would he get the chance to be in New York to become a dancer? Never. When he was about a block away from his apartment, Kevin heard a voice; the voice of a girl singing. \" I don't know where I belong But I'll be moving on If you don't... If you won't. ..\" Kevin turned the corner and noticed a girl standing at the front of an alley. She was singing, and she was good . \"... listen to the song here in my heart A melody I've started but I will complete Oh, Now I'm done believing you You don't know what I'm feeling I'm more than what you've made of me I followed the voice you think you gave to me But now I gotta find my own, My own .\" As she finished singing, the people who were watching her applauded. She bowed and thanked them as they dropped change in the box beside her. Kevin walked over to her and dropped a dollar bill into the box. \"Thanks.\" Kevin stood straight and looked at the girl. She has short, choppy auburn hair that sticks out in several directions and blue eyes. \"It's...no problem.\" Kevin said. The girl smiled at him and picked up the box. She took the bills out of it and put the change in her pocket. \"You have a really good voice you know.\" The girl looked at Kevin, her cheeks slightly flushed. \"T-Thank you.\" she said, the smile still on her face. \"Do you go to the performing arts school?\" Kevin asked. The girl shook her head and folded the bills. \"N-No...no. I don't go there.\" she said, her smile fading. \"Really? Have you considered applying?\" The girl opened her mouth to reply, but she shook her head instead. \"What's your name? My name's Kevin Barrett.\" Kevin said. The girl smiled. \"Anna.\" she said. \"Do you have a last name Anna?\" Kevin asked, smiling. Anna chuckled. \"Just...Anna, is fine.\" Anna scratched her head. \"So do you go to that school you mentioned?\" she asked. \"You mean the performing arts school?\" Kevin asked. \"Yeah, that place.\" Anna said. Kevin nodded. \"What do you do?\" \"I dance.\" Kevin said, slightly shrugging. \"Lucky. I can't dance worth crap.\" Anna said. Kevin laughed and she did as well. \"So where are you headed?\" Anna asked. \"Home. Or...well...the apartment that I call home, anyway.\" Kevin said. Anna nodded. \"Yeah, that sounds right.\" she mumbled. \"Pardon?\" Kevin asked. \"Nothing.\" Kevin rubbed the back of his neck. \"Well, it was nice meeting you Kevin. I'm going to go buy something to eat.\" Anna said, a triumphant smile on her face. Kevin smiled. \"Yeah, I'll see you around.\" he said. \"See you around.\" Anna said, waving at Kevin as he walked away. - Two months later - -Anna- The rain. I normally love it, but in this instance, I hate it. I mean, wouldn't you hate being stuck in the rain with no shelter? With nothing to protect you from the rain? Yeah. I thought so. I pulled my knees closer, hugging them tightly. I pulled my hood over my head and sighed. \"Maybe I should have gotten a new sweater with some of that money...\" Thunder sounded and I jumped, squeaking. I curled into a ball and pressed myself closer to the corner of the dumpster and the wall. It's times like this that I hate being homeless and on my own. Thunder sounded again and I buried my face in my knees. -Kevin- Kevin rushed toward his apartment with his grocery bag in hand. He needed some bread and band aids, so he decided to run and grab some. Lucky him; it started pouring just as he bought the stuff. Kevin turned to go down an alley to get back faster, when he heard a squeak. He walked towards the dumpster, which is where he swore it came from. \"Hello?\" he called softly. There wasn't a reply and Kevin looked in the corner to see Anna curled into a ball and tucked into the corner. \"Anna?\" Anna jumped and looked at him in surprize. \"K-Kevin...?\" she asked softly. \"Anna, what are you doing out here? It's...raining.\" Kevin said. \"Well, I decided to sit by this dumpster and it started raining.\" Anna said sarcastically. \"Seriously? You should be home Anna.\" Kevin said. Anna sighed. \"I would...but this dumpster is the closest thing to a home for me.\" she said softly. \"Really?\" Kevin asked. Anna looked at him. \"Why would I lie about this?\" Kevin held his hand out to her. \"Then come with me. You can stay at my apartment with me.\" he said. \"Are you serious?\" Anna asked. \"Well...yeah. I can't just leave you out here.\" Kevin said. \"You...you hardly know me. For all you know, I could be some kind of serial killer or something.\" Anna said. \"If you were, then you would have killed me by now.\" Anna laughed. \"That's true...\" she said. Thunder sounded and Anna squeaked, jumping again. \"Come on Anna. At least stay the night so that you're not out here in the rain.\" Kevin said. Anna sighed and nodded, letting Kevin help her up. He handed her his umbrella and she shot him a look. \"Hey, we're not too far away, and you need it slightly more. Now let's go before we're both soaked.\" Kevin took Anna's hand in his, not noticing her blush, and they started running toward his apartment. -Anna- As we walked into Kevin's apartment, he turned on a few lights. \"You live here by yourself?\" I asked. \"Yeah. My family's back home in Iowa. My mom helps me pay rent since it's not that expensive.\" Kevin said. He opened a closet and tossed a towel to me. \"There, you can start drying yourself off with that. I'll see if...I might have anything that might fit you.\" Kevin said. I nodded and pressed the soft, dry towel to my face as I heard Kevin's footsteps fading. After drying my face, I started drying my hair, suddenly thankful that I have it as short as I do. Kevin walked back into the room, holding some clothes and scratching his head. \"Um...these should fit you.\" he said, handing them to me. I smiled and took the clothes from him. \"Thank you.\" I said. Kevin smiled and pointed to a door. \"You can change in the bathroom. I'll be in the living room if you need me.\" I nodded and walked into the bathroom; which is a small and simple one. After closing the door behind me, I set the clothes on the counter and took off my sweater. I laid it on the toilet and slipped my shoes off. I pulled my long-sleeved shirt off and set it on top of my sweater. I stopped and stared in the mirror. I shuddered at my reflection. Along my arms are scars; some from me, some...not. I shook my head and slapped my cheeks. \"Okay...you're okay.\" I mumbled. I let out a sigh and quickly finished changing into the clothes that Kevin had given me; which was a black button up long-sleeved shirt and a pair of grey sweat pants. As I left the bathroom, I held my clothes in a bundle and left my shoes outside of the bathroom. I heard music playing as I walked to the living room and I saw Kevin dancing. The song playing was the same song that I was singing just before we had met two months ago. As Kevin danced, I felt amazed by his skill. I felt a smile grow on my face as I watched him. The song ended and Kevin looked surprised to see me. \"O-Oh, you're finished already?\" \"Y-Yeah. Kevin, that was incredible!\" I said. I saw Kevin's face turn pink as he smiled. \"Y-you...you really think so?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Yeah! You told me that you danced, but I didn't think that you were going to be that good!\" I said with a grin on my face. Kevin chuckled. \"T-Thanks Anna.\" He looked at the clothes I was holding and I remembered what I was going to say. \"O-Oh! Where should I put these to dry?\" I asked. \"Um...ah! We can hang them bove the heater!\" Kevin said. He motioned for me to follow him and I did. \"Here are a couple of hangers, and the window; you can hang the hangers off of the window.\" Kevin said. He smiled at me and turned to walk back towards the living room. \"U-Uh...Kevin?\" Kevin turned to me. \"Yeah?\" he asked. \"T-Thanks again...for letting me stay here tonight.\" I said, smiling at him. \"Y-Yeah, it's no problem Anna.\" Kevin said. I started to put my clothes on the hangers. \"Like I said earlier, you can stay here as long as you need to.\" Kevin added. I looked at him, and then back at my clothes as I worked on hanging them. \"Why...why are you living in an alley?\" I let out a long breath and hung up my clothes. \"Well...I...I...have nowhere else to go.\" I said quietly, focusing on my clothes. \"Why don't you live here then?\" I stopped and looked at Kevin. \"R-Really?\" I asked. \"Yeah! I mean...you have nowhere else to go. I don't mind, really.\" Kevin said, a smile on his face. I bit my lip. \"Okay...let's say that I agree to stay here. How...would the sleeping arrangements go?\" I asked. Kevin rubbed his chin. \"Well...why don't you sleep on the bed for now? I don't mind sleeping on the couch.\" he said. \"N-no! I...I can sleep on the couch. Besides...what if you start aching because of that? You...won't be able to dance as good when you're at school.\" I said. \"Well...I...I guess that's fine.\" Kevin said. I hung up the hangers and turned to entirely face him. \"So then...what am I going to do while you're at school?\" I asked. \"Well...you can start online classes.\" Kevin said. I looked at him, an eyebrow raised. Kevin smiled and turned. \"Hey, you might as well get that diploma somehow, right?\" - Four months later - -Anna- I sighed and ran a hand through my now ear-length hair. During the four months that I've lived with Kevin, he's insisted on helping me with online school and getting some new clothes. We've also...sort of become friends. I stared at the laptop screen in front of me, at the test score. I had just passed my classes for the first semester of my online school. \"Hello?\" Kevin's voice called as he opened the door to the apartment. \"Hey!\" I called back. Kevin walked into the living room, followed by a girl with her hair in curly pigtails. \"Anna, this is Joy Moy, she goes to the PA school with me. Joy, this is Anna.\" Kevin said. Joy waved and chirped a happy greeting and I waved in reply. \"Oh hey, guess what.\" I said, closing Kevin's laptop. \"What?\" Kevin asked as he and Joy sat on the couch. \"I just finished my first semester of online school!\" I said, feeling a grin on my face. \"Seriously? That's awesome Anna!\" Kevin said, giving me a side-hug. I smiled and Joy smiled at me. \"You know, I don't really know you, but I'm happy for you!\" she said. I laughed. \"Thanks Joy.\" I said, smiling. Kevin clapped his hands. \"Hey Anna! You should totally sing something!\" He said, a goofy smile on his face. \"Are you serious?\" I asked. The grin stayed on Kevin's face and I looked at Joy. \"Is he serious?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I think that he is.\" Joy said with a shrug. I sighed and pouted in Kevin's direction. \"You owe me.\" He pumped his fist happily as I stood up. I turned to face him and Joy. \"Okay then...the song I'll be singing is 'Blackbird' by the Beatles.\" I said. \"Cool!\" Kevin said happily. I smiled and started singing. \" Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise .\" -Kevin- Kevin watched as Anna sang in front of him and Joy. He watched as Anna opened up in front of them. He didn't notice the look Joy was giving him and Anna. Instead, his eyes were glued to the singing girl in front of him. \" Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise ...\" As Anna finished the song, Kevin and Joy clapped. \"Wow, you were right Kevin; she is really good!\" Joy said happily. Anna's face turned red and Kevin laughed. \"Hey, it's a compliment!\" he said. Anna plopped down back in her spot. \"Anna, have you considered going into a singing career?\" Joy asked. Anna shrugged. \"Not really.\" she said. \"You totally should! That would be awesome!\" Joy said happily. Anna shrugged, a sheepish smile on her face. \"You never know.\" - Three months later - -Anna- I let out a whimper as I turned and buried my face in the pillow I was using. Nightmares were running through my head involving some of my memories. Some of my painful memories... I let out a cry and opened my eyes, sitting up. I gasped and put my hands on my face to feel tears on my cheeks. I was breathing heavily and I covered my face in my hands. \"Anna?\" I looked to see Kevin walking toward me, his face full of concern. He stopped beside the couch. \"Anna, what's wrong?\" he asked. Tears filled my eyes. \"I...I...nightmare...\" Kevin walked around and sat beside me on the couch, pulling me into his arms. \"It's okay. It was just a dream.\" he said quietly. The tears started falling down my face and I started crying even more. \"Shh...it's alright. It was only a dream.\" Kevin whispered as he gently brushed his hand over my hair. I felt my body shaking as I stopped crying. \"Anna, are...are you alright?\" Kevin asked quietly. I slowly nodded against his chest. \"I...I'm fine now...\" I said quietly. I looked at Kevin and wiped my face. \"T...Thank you Kevin.\" \"Do you want to talk about it?\" Kevin asked. I looked away. \"I...I think so.\" I said softly. So I told him. I told him how my parents had abused me since I was young and told me horrible things like that I'd never be able to do anything. One day after I had finished middle school, I left. I took my savings and came straight to New York. \"Anna, are you afraid of them finding you?\" Kevin asked, his voice still soft. I nodded. \"I...I dreamed that...that they found me and forced me to live with them again...and that they hurt you.\" I said, looking at Kevin. \"Where are you from?\" Kevin asked. \"...Seattle...\" \"We should be fine Anna. At least for a little while. You don't need to worry about them hurting you.\" Kevin said. I nodded, sniffling. I felt my body slowly stop shaking as I let myself relax against Kevin. \"You don't have to worry Anna. You're safe.\" I looked at Kevin and felt a faint smile place itself on my face. \"Thank...thank you.\" ","Summary":" A wild fanfiction appears!

The girl whipped around to face the sound of his voice, revealing the face of Jenny Garrison. \"Oh, h-hi, Marco,\" she said sheepishly, looking down at the ground and wiping her eyes with her left sleeve. Her voice sounded cracked, like she had been crying or was upset. Marco looked at her with concern. \"What's the matter?\" he asked, stepping closer. \"You sounded pretty troubled on the phone.\" She had called him earlier that day, telling him to meet her here. She had sounded distressed, and when he had tried to ask questions, she only begged him in a fragile voice to just come. Jenny looked up at him when Marco reached her, standing directly across from her, almost like she was expecting him to yell at her or something. \"Um… nothing, it's just that… well… t-today,\" she stopped in the beginning of her explanation, feeling a need to collect her thoughts before she said them out loud. Jenny took a deep breath before continuing, tears brimming her eyes slightly. \"Marco, it's about Andy.\" \"Andy?\" Marco asked, his voice suddenly cold. \"What about Andy?\" Andy was a sleazy guy who graduated from PA last year and had offered Jenny a chance at a role. But Marco knew it was just an excuse to hook up with her. He could tell, just by the way he looked at her. Jenny grimaced at the icy tone of his usually easy-going voice. \"Today he called me, telling me that a casting director wanted to see me about a role… and I went over to his set.\" Marco groaned. \"Oh no, Jenny, please tell me you didn't.\" He could already tell where this was going. He knew the kind of guy Andy was and he remembered the way he had looked at Jenny before at the party. But Jenny took another deep breath, and despite the interruption, kept going with her recap of the things that happened on the set. \"And… we went into his trailer, and --\" \"He didn't try anything on you did he?\" he asked, knowing what she was going to say, and not needing anymore information to know what happened. She only nodded, and said, \"When he kissed me, I thought we were just reading lines from a scene, but….\" She couldn't bear to go on. Jenny just looked at Marco, waiting for his reaction. \"I knew this was going to happen!\" he exclaimed, throwing his hands up and not bothering to contain his obvious rage. At her slightly afraid expression at his anger, he allowed his face to soften a little bit, but didn't back down. \"I just want to know one thing: Why did you do it? Why did you go over to Andy's set, even after I told you that he was just looking for trouble?\" Jenny sniffed, and she looked up at Marco, towering over her, almost like he was demanding an answer. \"I-I thought there might have actually been a casting director, and maybe this could have been my one chance to actually get a real role --\" \"And, what, it would all be ok as long as you got a role?\" he insisted, his face hardening again. He couldn't believe that even after he told her about Andy, Jenny still went ahead and went to see him on set for a role. The thought of Andy even so much as touching Jenny made Marco swell with anger. \"Marco,\" Jenny begged, looking up at him with pleading eyes, her eyes puffy and faintly red. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, bowing her head down to look at her feet suddenly. \"I didn't know he was going to do something. I should have listened to you.\" Marco heard the honest hurt in Jenny's voice and his facial expression softened. He knew that she meant it and that right now, she didn't want to hear I-told-you-so's. She just wanted someone to hold her and tell her everything was going to be fine. He knew that she was hurt and had been violated by Andy and just wanted to forget it all. That's why she had even called him: To reassure her, not to tell her that he had been right and that she was wrong. He sighed, finding it useless to argue, when all it would do right now is make things worse. Gently, Marco grabbed Jenny's hand, causing her to look up at him, like she was surprised. \"It's ok,\" he replied softly, lacing his fingers through her own. She gave him a weak smile, the only kind she could really muster at that second, and opened her mouth, sharing further with him, \"I feel frail, Marco. It's like I was under his control and I just let him harm me. I feel hurt.\" \"I know you do,\" he murmured his words of comfort, putting the hand that wasn't wrapped in Jenny's on her waist, and pulled her closer to him. \"I just want you to know that I'm right here. I'll always be here when you need me. And even when you don't. I'll be by your side.\" The words of comfort seemed to come easily now, almost naturally. She looked up at him, this time grinning without even trying, the tears that threatened to fall from her eyes earlier had now completely disappeared. \"Thank you, Marco,\" she whispered, laying her head down on his chest. \"I'm glad to know that I'll always have someone to catch me if I fall.\" He smiled back down at her and took her into his arms, swallowing her in a hug. He felt that she didn't need any more speeches; she only need to be with him. That's all that it took to lift her sprits and make her feel strong again. \"Jenny Garrison, I know you'll do big things one day,\" he muttered, rubbing her back in comfort. \"And I know you won't need people like Andy to get yourself a role. You'll get there someday soon. I have faith in you.\" Jenny smiled and looked up at him for a second. \"Do you really think so?\" \"I know so,\" he simply responded. Then he grinned and went on, \"Didn't I tell you that no one believes in you more than I do?\" She laughed and allowed herself to be embraced by Marco a little longer. The two just stood there in silence, swaying in the spot they stood, the afternoon fading around them and the sun just beginning to set a bit behind them. Marco had forgiven her for going to see Andy, since she had gotten so hurt by the jerk. And Jenny seemed to be nearly fully healed, just by his acceptance of her and the mistake she made. They stood in silence for a while longer, before Jenny suddenly spoke up from Marco's arms. \"Thank you,\" she bluntly stated, pulling herself away from his hug so she was at arms distance from him, just so she could look him in the eye without having to stare up at him. \"Thank you for everything.\" Marco smiled at her. \"Didn't you already say that?\" he asked jokingly. But he didn't wait for her reply. Instead, he only declared, \"I'm here for you, Jenny. When you need me, I'm right here.\" ","Summary":" I'm Right Here \"Jenny?\" Marco approached the brown haired girl standing on the roof of the buildi"},{"Movie":"Fame, 2009","Title":"Dance","Author":"animerox023","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856519","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dance Sonnet Grace of a swan, Body of a snake, Moving like a swift river, Skimming across the stage.

It had been a year since they had kidnapped 5 Leo Rise. They were officially popular and loving every single minute of it. 5 Leo Rise never kept in touch with them. They were upset at first, but they got over it. Gabby still was a fan, but Devon wouldn't listen to their music anymore or even want to talk about them. She had spent the most of last year after 5 Leo Rise left in her room in tears. Ritchie never got in touch with Devon after they left. He said \"Thank you,\" then ran off. \"So Gabby I was thinking we should go back to my place tonight and stay up late watching horror flicks,\" Devon said. \"But Devon you know I don't like scary movies, come on why don't I bring over my new 5 Leo Rise CD and listen it to it like we used to do,\" Gabby said. \"No Gabs,\" Devon said. \"Come on Dev it's been a year,\" Gabby said. \"Gabs you know why and yes it's been a year but I'm still hurt,\" Devon said. \"Dev come on I have gotten over the fact that Mason left without really saying goodbye.\" Gabby said as they made their way to their lockers. \"Yeah, but I don't know I mean Ritchie kissed me then that was it I mean he never said anything about it after the fact,\" Devon said looking inside her locker. It used to be filled with 5 Leo Rise, but it was just bare. She thought of just putting up photos of her family and friends, but she just never got around to doing it. \"Devon, do we need to go kidnap another band to get you out of this funk?\" Gabby joked. Devon just looked at her. \"Get it cause we kidnapped 5 Leo Rise.\" \"I get it Gabby,\" Devon said putting books into her locker. \"Jeez Dev you don't have to be in such a bad mood,\" Gabby said as Devon slammed her locker shut. \"Maybe if you didn't bring up you know who I wouldn't be in such a bad mood,\" said Devon. With that Devon walked off. Gabby knew Devon needed to work this whole Ritchie thing herself. Gabby walked to her next class hoping that Devon was going to be okay. Devon's House Devon laid in her bed her eyes red and puff. She knew she was being a bit over dramatic with Gabby earlier, but she just wasn't in the mood. There was a knock on the door. \"Come in,\" Devon said sitting up trying to hide the fact she had been crying. The door opened. \"Hey sweetheart is everything okay?\" Devon's mom asked. \"Everything's good mom no need to worry,\" Devon said putting on a fake smile. \"Well this came for you today,\" her mother said handing a letter to Devon. \"Thanks,\" Devon said. Her mom left the room. Devon looked at the letter before her. It was from her sister Danielle. She hadn't heard from Danielle since she left with Scooter and the rest of 5 Leo Rise. She opened the letter. It was a wedding invitation. Devon quickly grabbed the phone and dialed the same number she always dialed when she needed to talk to someone. \"Hello?\" Gabby said. \"Hey Gabs it's Devon,\" Devon said. \"Hey Dev what's up? You better now,\" Gabby asked. \"Gabby Danielle and Scooter are getting married,\" Devon said. \"Oh my god that is totally great,\" said Gabby cheerfully. The other end of the line went quiet. \"Isn't it?\" \"I mean yeah I am happy for them and everything, but I don't think I am going to go,\" Devon said. \"Dev you can't miss your sister's wedding even if you two hardly got along,\" Gabby said. \"It's not that Gabs I don't think I can face him I mean he broke my heart by leaving and not explaining what that kiss meant,\" I said. \"I have a plan,\" Gabby said. \"You do?\" Devon said. \"Yeah and it will sure get Ritchie back for what he did to you,\" Gabby said. \"Gabby we can't kidnap and torture him we already did that,\" Devon said. \"I wasn't going to say that I have a different plan,\" Gabby said. \"Operation Make Ritchie Jealous.\" \"And how is that suppose to work?\" Devon asked. \"Well we find you a super hot dude who's also very charming and sweet and treats you like you are the most amazing person in the world,\" Gabby said as if it was nothing. \"And how are we going to find someone who is like that?\" Devon asked. \"Leave that up to me,\" Gabby said and with that the girls chatted a bit longer then hung up. Somewhere on the 5 Leo Rise Tour \"Hey dude congrats,\" Mason said doing his secret handshake with Scooter. \"Thanks man,\" Scooter said. \"So when's the big day?\" asked KK. \"November twentieth in Italy,\" smiled Danielle as she sat in Scooter's lap wrapping her arms around his neck. Ever since Scooter entered her life Danielle had become a different person. She was more sweet and caring then a controlling vindictive bitch who loved to make Devon's life a living hell. \"That's like soon man,\" Mason said. \"We know, but we wanna get married sooner rather than later,\" Scooter said. Ritchie looked out the window of the tour bus in his bunk. He had the curtain closed but he could hear everything they were saying, but his mind was elsewhere. \"Doesn't that mean we get to see Gabs and Dev,\" Mason said. That's when the curtain opened. \"Wait what Devon's coming,\" Ritchie said. \"Well duh man she is Danielle's sister,\" Scooter said. \"I know that man,\" Ritchie said a little arrogantly. \"So of course you all are coming right,\" Danielle said trying to change the subject. \"Weddings make me happy,\" Nikolai said. \"We know Nikolai,\" K.K. said patting him on the back. \"We know.\" Devon's Place The doorbell rang and Devon went to answer the door. \"Lincoln Pete it is so good to see you guys,\" Devon said hugging them both. \"Oh now that I'm taking you want me,\" Lincoln said. \"Ha-ha very funny,\" said Devon releasing from the hug. \"So Dev what have you and Gabby been up to?\" Pete said. \"Nothing much, but guess what?\" Devon said. \"What,\" Pete and Lincoln both said in unison. \"Danielle and Scooter are getting married,\" Devon said. \"Really that's great,\" Pete said. Lincoln looked at Devon and saw the look in her eyes. \"Or is it not?\" Lincoln asked. \"It's a good thing but a bad thing,\" Devon said. \"How could it be a bad thing?\" Pete asked. Lincoln hit him in the arm. \"Ow man why did you do that?\" \"Because stupid with Scooter and Danielle getting married that means the other members of 5 Leo Rise are coming to the wedding,\" Lincoln said. \"Which includes Ritchie,\" said Gabby walking in from the kitchen. \"I'm sorry Dev,\" Pete said. \"Don't worry Pete I have a great plan for Ritchie to pay for what he did to me thanks to Gabby and this time it doesn't involve kidnapping,\" Devon smirked. Author's Note: Well I hoped you liked it. I absolutely love this movie it is super cute. So please review =)[Chapter 2] Highland High School Devin was at her locker when all of the sudden Gabby came up from behind hugging her. \"Hey Gabs,\" Devin said as Gabby let go and opened her own locker. \"Hey Dev,\" Gabby said all excited. \"What is it Gabs?\" Devin asked. \"Oh just that phase one of my ingenious plan has gone into affect,\" Gabby smiled. \"Really? That didn't take long,\" Devin said. \"Uh-huh,\" Gabby said putting her books into her locker. \"So you going to tell me who it is?\" Devin asked shutting her locker. Gabby just ignored her and started to walk away. \"Gabby are you going to tell me,\" Devin said checking up to her when all of a sudden the hottest guy in school, James bumped into Devin and Devin fell to the ground stuff and all. \"Oh my god I am so sorry,\" James said helping her get her stuff. \"No, no it was my fault,\" Devin said they caught each other eyes and Devin's heart melt. James was handsome about six feet tall with dark chocolate brown eyes and hair. \"I'm James,\" James said helping Devin up from the ground. \"I'm Devin,\" Devin said. The bell rang. \"Well I better get to class,\" James said. \"Yeah,\" Devin said, \"I should probably get to class too.\" \"Okay well it was nice meeting you,\" James said as he walked away. \"Yeah,\" Devin said. Gabby smiled at her love struck friend. Her plan was going perfectly Devin was now crushing again, but his name wasn't Ritchie it was James.

But Don't forget to review =)[Chapter 3] Scooter's and Danielle's Wedding It was finally Scooter's and Danielle's wedding. Gabby and Devin arrived with Lincoln and Pete to the ceremony. Gabby and Devin were both bridesmaids. So far Devin and Gabby hadn't seen 5 Leo Rise since they were probably getting ready with Scooter. As the wedding started Scooter and the rest of 5 Leo Rise walked down the aisle. It was a gorgeous day for a wedding. There wasn't one cloud in the sky. Once the groomsmen took their places, the bridesmaids started walking down the aisle in the order of, two of Danielle's college friends, Gabby, and then Devin. Devin didn't look over at Ritchie, but Ritchie definitely was looking at Devin. Devin was even more beautiful then he had remembered. Her blonde haired curled with a diamond incrusted headband. He noticed her avoiding make eye contact and he didn't know why. He knew he was going to have to find out what was up. Finally Danielle walked down the aisle in a gorgeous Vera Wang gown. It was a floor length gown with a heart shaped neckline with an open back. Her hair was in a French braid with her veil cover her face. She walked down with her father. The ceremony was beautiful and elegant. After the ceremony everybody made their way inside a building close to where the wedding had taken place. Scooter and Danielle had their first dance as husband and wife. Then the father daughter dance. Then party started. Mason and Gabby ran into each other on the way to the wedding and were already hand and hand. They were dancing when Ritchie came over. \"Hey Gabby,\" Ritchie said. \"Hey,\" Gabby said. \"Have you seen Devin?\" Ritchie asked. \"I think I saw her outside,\" Gabby said. \"Cool thanks,\" Ritchie said. \"No problem,\" Gabby said. The song changed to a slow song and Mason wrapped his arms around Gabby's waist and Gabby wrapped her arms around Mason's neck. She laid her head on his chest as they slowly swayed back and forth. Ritchie headed outside looking around for Devin. He looked up and saw Devin on the balcony alone. He smiled and was about to yell her name. When he saw someone go up behind her and wrap their arms around her. She giggled and turned around kissing him on the lips. Ritchie's heart sank. He couldn't believe she had moved on. He needed to win her back, but he didn't know how. That is when he cam up with a plan to win Devin back. On the Balcony Devin released from the kiss. \"I thought you weren't going to make it,\" Devin said. \"Well I pulled some strings and got on the first plane I could,\" James said. Devin hugged him. \"Well I am happy you could make it,\" she said. He held her in his arms. \"Me too,\" he said. \"So you wanna go inside and dance.\" Devin nodded. They headed back inside where they ran into Gabby and Mason making out. \"Way to go Gabby,\" Devin said. Gabby released from Mason and blushed. \"Hey James you made it,\" Gabby said. \"Yeah,\" James said. Mason nudged Gabby. \"Oh James this Mason of 5 Leo Rise,\" Gabby smiled. \"Nice to meet you Mason,\" James said putting his free hand out. \"And Mason this is James Devin's boyfriend,\" Gabby said. \"Same,\" Mason said shaking his hand. \"Umm Devin did Ritchie ever find you?\" Gabby asked. \"I haven't seen Ritchie since the ceremony why?\" Devin asked. \"Oh well he was looking for you,\" Gabby said. \"He was?\" Devin said. Both Gabby and Mason nodded. James looked from Gabby and Mason to Devin. \"Who's Ritchie?\" James asked. \"Oh just another member of 5 Leo Rise,\" Devin said nervously. She thought she saw someone outside, but she couldn't make out who it was. ' Oh crap' thought Devin. Author's Note: I hoped you liked this chapter! Sorry it's short, but it is just a filler there is a big thing that will happen in the next chapter I promise! So what is this plan that Ritchie has?

It had been a week since the wedding and they were inseparable. \"Devin,\" Gabby said running up to her in the hallway. \"Hey Gabs what's up?\" Devin asked. \"You won't believe who is going here now,\" Gabby said. \"Who?\" Devin asked. Gabby opened her mouth about to say the name when they heard a bunch of screaming girls and two guys running down the hallway. \"Hey Devin, hi Gabby,\" said Ritchie. \"Hey Gabby, hey Devin,\" Mason said. They ran down the hallway. \"Are you kidding me,\" Devin said. Gabby shook her head. '\"What's wrong babe,\" James asked. \"Oh it's nothing just nothing,\" Devin said. James put his arms around Devin and walked her to class with Gabby. DGDGDGDGDDGD Devin and Gabby sat in the back of classroom waiting for the class to start. \"What hell is happening around here,\" Devin said. \"What do you mean Devin?\" Gabby asked. \"I mean why Ritchie is here,\" Devin said. \"Well Ritchie and Mason didn't finish high school so I guess they decided to go back,\" Gabby said. \"Why here though why the school we go to,\" Devin said. \"Well maybe Mason missed me,\" said Gabby. \"That could be a possibility,\" Devin said sarcastically. \"Or it could be because it is part of Ritchie's plan to win you back,\" Gabby said under her breath. \"Gabby what did you just say,\" Devin said. \"Nothing,\" Gabby said. \"Gabby did you know they were coming,\" Devin asked. \"No and yes,\" Gabby said. \"What does no and yes mean,\" Devin said. \"Well Mason told me he and Ritchie were coming here because one Mason misses me and wants to be with me while Ritchie tries to win you back,\" Gabby said. \"Gabby Ann Davis,\" Devin said. \"What,\" Gabby said. \"You know I am very happy with James right,\" Devin said. \"Yeah,\" Gabby said. \"You are the one who told me to go out with him right,\" said Devin. \"Yeah I know,\" Gabby said. \"So you better not have anything to do with Ritchie's plan to win me back because it will not work because I have completely moved on,\" Devin said. At that moment the bell rang and Mason and Ritchie entered the classroom out of breath with a bunch of screaming girls behind them. The teacher Mr. Bassie got up from his desk and made his way to the door. \"Get to class ladies,\" he yelled the group of girls left. Devin rolled her eyes as Ritchie smirked and sat in the seat right behind her with Mason. \"Hey Devin,\" he said. Devin ignored him. \"What not going to say hello,\" Ritchie said. \"Excuse young man I would like to start my class,\" Mr. Bassie said. \"Of course sir go right ahead,\" Ritchie said. Devin rolled her eyes this year was going to be very unpleasant with Ritchie. Author's Note: I hoped you liked this chapter!

James leaned down and kissed Devin. Devin kissed him back. \"I love you,\" James said. Devin bit her lip this was the first time he had ever said he loved her. \"I love you too,\" she said. They kissed a long passionate kiss. \"Excuse me I believe there are rules against PDA in the hallway,\" said Gabby. Devin and James released from the kiss Devin blushed embarrassed. \"Sorry Gabs,\" Devin said. \"It's okay,\" Gabby said. \"Where's Mason?\" asked Devin. As if on cue Mason ran by with a bunch of screaming girls behind him. \"Hey Devin, hey Gabs,\" he said as he ran by. The girls waved as Mason left. \"Hey Gabby, hey Devin,\" Ritchie smirked as he ran with his own group of screaming girls behind him. Devin rolled her eyes. \"Let's get out of here,\" said Devin.

Devin threw her bag to the ground before plopping down onto her bed picking up her remote and turning on her television. Gabby took a seat on the beanbag. \"In the latest music news two members of 5 Leo Rise have enrolled back into high school,\" said Ryan Seacrest said. \"Oh god,\" said Devin as she turning off the TV. \"Hey I was watching that,\" said Gabby. \"Yeah well I really don't feel like hear about Ritchie,\" said Devin. \"Come on Devin you shouldn't care about Ritchie especially since you have James,\" said Gabby taking a Hershey chocolate bar from her bag and unwrapped it. She took a bite. \"I know and I mean James told me he loved me today and it just..,\" said Devin. \"Wait James told you he loved you?\" interrupted Gabby. Devin blushed, \"Yeah.\" \"Oh my god Dev,\" said Gabby. \"I know,\" said Devin. \"So tell me about,\" said Gabby. \"There isn't much to say it just kind of happened,\" said Devin. \"Devin, there some friends of yours here to see you,\" yelled Devin's mom from the stairs. \"Who could that be?\" said Devin. Gabby shrugged as they both got up and went downstairs. Author's Note: Another short chapter I know, but a big thing is going to happen in the next chapter so yeah. PLEASE REVIEW![Chapter 7] Gabby and Devin made their way downstairs. Sitting on the couch was Mason and Ritchie. \"You got to be kidding me,\" said Devin. \"Devin honey that is no way to talk to your friends now I'll go make you guys a snack,\" said Devin's mom as she left the room. \"What are you guys doing here?\" asked Devin. \"Gabby invited us to study,\" said Mason. Devin gave a stern look to Gabby. \"Gabby can I talk to you for a minute,\" she said. \"I'm good,\" said Gabby. \"Gabby now,\" Devin said pulling her into the other room. \"Gabby how could you do this,\" whispered Devin. \"Well Mason came to me and asked if we could help him study and well… I didn't know he was going to bring Ritchie,\" Gabby whispered back. Devin sighed. \"I mean you're with James now and you don't have feelings for Ritchie still right?\" Devin hesitated for a moment.\"Yeah of course,\" said Devin. \"Well we better get back in there,\" said Gabby. Devin nodded and they both made their way into the living room. \"Let's get this over with,\" said Devin taking a seat on the couch opposite of Ritchie. Gabby took a seat next Mason. After studying for about two hours the guys left. \"Now that wasn't so bad,\" said Gabby. \"I am surprised Ritchie was even being his usual jerkish self,\" Devin said. Devin's phone started to ring, \"It's James,\" said Devin excitedly she answered the phone. \"Hello!\" \"Hey Dev,\" said James. \"What's up?\" asked Devin twirling a piece of her hair with her finger. \"Not much just thought I would see if you were free Friday night there's this concert and well,\" said James. \"Yes, yes, and yes,\" Devin interrupted. James laughed. \"Cool so I'll pick you up at seven,\" said James. \"Sounds great,\" smiled Devin. \"Okay well I love you,\" said James. \"Love you too,\" said Devin then she hung up her phone. \"Aw how cute,\" said Gabby. \"Shut up,\" blushed Devin. \"So what did he say?\" asked Gabby. \"He invited me to a concert Friday,\" said Devin. \"That's sweet,\" said Gabby. Devin nodded, \"What am I going to wear,\" said Devin. \"I have a plan grab your keys were heading to the mall,\" smiled Gabby. \"I like the way you think,\" said Devin, \"mom Gabby and I are going to the mall.\" Author's Note: Hoped you liked this chapter till next time! PLEASE REVIEW![Chapter 8] Soon enough Friday rolled around and Devin and James were making their way to the arena. \"So what concert are we seeing?\" Devin asked. \"Well you know your friends Mason and Ritchie,\" said James. \"Yeah what about them?\" \"Well they gave me some tickets to their concert tonight,\" said James. Devin felt her stomach doing cartwheels just by the mere mention of Ritchie's name. \"Oh that's great,\" Devin said with a forceful smile. When they entered the arena Devin could already hear the chanting of the Five Leo Rise fans. It wasn't too long ago she was one of them. When the concert began each member of Five Leo Rise rose up from the ground causing the screaming levels of fans to increase. Five Leo Rise started off with some of their early stuff and moved on to their more recent stuff. Devin was actually having a good time, as the concert started to come to an end Ritchie grabbed his mic off its stand. \"You guys have been a great crowd tonight and well we are going to end with a song that is near and dear to my heart because,\" Ritchie looked right at Devin, \"she kidnapped my heart.\" This sent the crowd crazy. Ritchie grabbed his guitar and sat on a stool. As Ritchie set up the Five Leo Rise manger came over to Devin. \"He wants you up there,\" he said into her ear. Devin looked confused, but followed anyways. He lead her up onstage and sat her down on the stool next to him. Hey girl, what's your name? I think I caught you looking my way Do you wanna know how to get me all to your own Weekends work the best I'll pick the place you do the rest Hey now don't be shy but you got to keep me in line Love at first sight never thought it could happen to me But you made me believe Kidnap my heart And take me with you Kidnap my heart Make my dreams come true Take me away Cause falling in love ain't very far Not far from the start Kidnap my heart. Can you get me up? More fun I can ever dream of Could you tie me down? Can you keep me hanging around? I don't wanna be here to keep you company Put your hand in mine Better hold on tight for the ride Love at first sight never thought it could happen to me But you made me believe Kidnap my heart And take me with you Kidnap my heart Make my dreams come true Take me away Cause falling in love ain't very far Not far from the start Kidnap my heart. You've got to hold me tighter I'm a real fighter Don't tear us apart Love at first sight never thought it could happen to me But you made me believe You made me believe, believe, believe Kidnap my heart And take me with you (Yeah, yeah, yeah) Kidnap my heart Make my dreams come true (You make my dreams come true) Take me away Cause falling in love ain't very far (Ain't very far) Not far from the start Kidnap my heart. Kidnap my heart Kidnap my heart... It felt like déjà vu to both Devin and Ritchie. Devin could feel her cheeks burning bright red as she closed her as she had done the first time. As the song came to an end Ritchie and Devin kissed. No one matter at that time not James, not the crowd, no one.

I also lost some inspiration for this story so that is why I am ending it here hoped you enjoyed =) ","Summary":" Highland High Devon and Gabby walked down the hallway arm and arm. It had been a year since they ha"},{"Movie":"Lord of War","Title":"Dreams aren't made","Author":"Timeywimey221b","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11275703","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Grace sat in the small bed, the covers undone, and she beared an unruly appearance. Her grey eyes narrowed as a couple of t-shirts landed inside a small suitcase, her brows furrowed just as she pursed her lips. \"Do you have to go?\" Grace couldn't hold herself any longer, her grey eyes widened, watching Vitaly pleadingly. It was Vitaly's turn to frown, he avoided her eyes, while he took in a breath. \"He is my brother.\" He drawled, his brown hair covered his eyes. Grace's jaw dropped, she watched Vitaly incredulously, shaking her head Grace crossed her arms. \"That's different.\" Grace snaped. Vitaly, exasperated, placed a hand on his hip as he looked at the fan on the ceiling. \"Different how Grace? He asked it as a favor. Besides it's the last deal, it's not as if I'm going to do it again like all those years back.\" He looked down at Grace, who's fists were clenched on the bedcovers. He sighed, walking towards the edge of the bed, he knelt before her. Taking her hands in his, Vitaly glanced at the interlaced fingers as he spoke again, this time in dulcet tones. \"Look around you Gracie, is this the place you want to live?\" smiling softly he shifted on his feet. \"Yuri said that when the deal is done I could get my own restaurant going, we could live in better conditions.\" Grace chuckled humorlessly, she squeezed his hand in return. \"There's nothing wrong with the way we live. It's better than what your brother has right now, have you seen Ava lately? She is miserable.\" Crossed, Vitaly stepped away from Grace, letting her hands go as he did. He began to pace around, lightning a cigarette. Grace watched helplessly, she knew he was torn between his fears and his dreams. She was glad Vitaly had told her the whole truth, instead of a lie. After all, she was the only one who knew about the arms dealing—besides the police obviously. \"I'll be back in a couple of days or so.\" Vitaly announced weakly, huffing the remnants of the smoke. Grace felt her stomach dropped, she didn't feel alright with his decision. That night she only felt a kiss on her forehead, drowsily she heard the front door clicking shut.[Chapter 2] Okay, so I actually planned on leaving this fic to wither and die. But surprisingly, people are reading this! Yes, I see you lurking. I would appreciate any feedback of any sort...Anyway, enjoy! This chapter takes place some time before the Prologue . 1. \"Grace, look.\" Maria's brown eyes flickered towards Grace's face, signaling with her chin behind the other nurse's shoulder. Grace— with her dark raven hair pulled on top of her head in a tight bun—her striking grey eyes, followed Maria's direction, as she craned her neck to take a look. Grace watched the facility's door opening as the guard entered. He escorted a man with a firm grip on his arm, who didn't struggle to get free of his hold. It seemed as if he had resigned to his current twist of fate, and to whatever was to come out of it. \"Here comes another one,\" Maria popped her gum, the disapproval wasn't missed from her attitude. Maria's attention didn't linger on the subject, instead, she turned her gaze back to the magazine dangling on her lap. Grace threw her a sideways glance, shaking her head. She pulled out a form for the guy to fill, that is, if he wasn't too stoned to do it. The two men stood before Grace, she didn't look up as the scratches from her pen scribbling away filled the expectant silence. \"And this would be?\" Grace finally inquired, her focus still on the paper. \"Er...Vitaly Orlov. His brother, Yuri Orlov, called in a couple of hours ago.\" Grace tilted her head, her eyes making contact with Vitaly's, she looked away quickly. \"Oh, right.\" Grace said, not knowing what to say. Grace spared him another brief glance, before scribbling his name down and the time of his arrival. Grace's grey eyes darted back to Christian. \"Take him with his belongings to the room 604. Once he's settled I'll take him from there to .\" Grace instructed handing Christian the key, and a fancy kit they handed to everyone who stayed in the facility. Christian muttered a somewhat angry 'this way' to Vitaly, but he seemed glued to the desk, looking forlorn. Grace hesitated, exchanging glances with Christian and Maria. All wondering if he was about to trash the place in a raging, junky, fit. \"Mr. Orlov?\" Grace asked tentatively. Vitaly looked up, flummoxed and disoriented. Grace smiled, ignoring the annoyed sighing coming from behind her back. Maria, who thought that Grace was being too kind with the patients always told her: 'They are here Gracie because they are a burden to their families, and to the civilization' . That's what Maria repeated as she prepped her morning decaf. He waited, his brows furrowing. \"Your doctor will be appointed to you in the next hour.\" I handed him a bottle of water. The frown faded, he eyed the bottle of water amused. His blue eyes settled on Grace's face, the dark circles encompassed his weary appearance. \"Thanks.\" He mumbled. Vitaly looked at Christian, his glance turned helpless as he let Christian drag him to his dorm room. \"Poor guy.\" Grace muttered under her breath. Her earrings moving along her shaking head. Maria and Grace, both nurses immersed in a peaceful silence, each one busy with their own tasks at hand. \"Holy crap!\" Maria squealed, Grace started. With a hand on her chest, she turned to the loud Italian woman, who seemed to be about to burst with some novelty. \"Now what?\" \"The guy? Orlov?\" Maria's brown eyes were about to bulge out of her sockets in excitement. \"Yeah? What about him?\" \"His brother is that rich guy who married the model Ava?\" Maria paused. Grace's face registered no acknowledgment to this piece of information. Maria clicked her tongue, turned around and muttered in Italian angrily. *.*.* \"If you follow me please,\" Grace instructed. She stood before Vitaly. After checking up on other two dazed patients, she thought it was time to check up on him. She wasn't surprised that half of the nurses in the place already knew of him, and were practically swooning for him. Vitaly was swamped in in sweat. His blue eyes had the all too familiar glassy look. He didn't look much worse from the ones who entered the rehab center every week, but still he was in a bad state. Vitaly shrugged, seeming uncomfortable even in his own skin, his eyes traveled back and forth like an anxious doe, as they strode through the hallways of the mansion. Grace closed her hand on his upper arm, he looked down at her small hand. Licking the sweat off of his upper lip. She talked all the way to the Doctor's office. Going about the way the center managed itself, about the grounds, and that they were prestigiously known by their discretion. Since plenty celebrities, politicians and so entered the facility with more frequency than not. Vitaly didn't seem to be interested in the small talk, he drowned the nurse's voice with his own thoughts, a jungle of memories that hunted him. \"...There is the kitchen. Most of our staff keep the fridges stuffed with food. But the cutlery and such are hidden in cabinets and under lock for obvious reasons.\" Grace rolled her eyes, she took Vitaly through the last ward, one she hated to go through, and thankfully one she wasn't in charge of. It was the ward were the biggest creeps were kept. Grace explained this with an nervous chuckle, which catch Vitaly's divided attention. He watched the nurse's expression, from her pursed lips to the way her hands clenched the papers in her hands. \"You okay?\" He mumbled, startling Grace. \"Yes, of course.\" Grace's smile was forced, and the crease of her eyebrows didn't fade with it. Vitaly saw through the lie but choose to made no comment. It wasn't his business. Since most of the patients were on the grounds, that wing was empty. They went through it, and Grace kept talking about things like a support group while she guided him through their final destination. Her voice still held that sharp edge. He remained silent all along. They stopped in front of a wooden door, Grace's knuckles knocked on the door softly. Grace kept her eyes fixed on the door. She didn't miss Vitaly's eyes fixed on her either. She shifted slightly, she looked back at him, trying to ease the awkwardness Grace smiled pleasantly at him. He reiterated with a small smirk, though it didn't travel to his eyes. \"Boh ty prekrasna\" Vitaly muttered. \"Pardon?\" \"You are beautiful.\" Vitaly answered softly, his eyes watched her closely, searching for a reaction. Grace opened her moth and clicked it shut, she turned her eyes away from him, seemingly uncomfortable and flushed. The door flung open, startling both, a patient came out of the room in a drowsy state. Some of the guys on watch had to drag the skinny redhead. Vitaly and Grace jumped out of the way. \"Yes?\" Dr. Warren asked looking back and forth between them. A bit distressed. \"Vitaly Orlov, sir. He'll be staying for a while.\" Grace explained, amazed that she didn't stutter. That's when she turned to Vitaly with a sympathetic glance and pushed him ahead, ignoring the giddiness settling in her belly. \"I'll come back for you when the session is done,\" Grace said before Dr Warren closed the door on her face. *.*.* Walking back to her post at the entrance, Grace couldn't help but wonder what was that patient's problem. It was obvious he needed rehab for drug—and god knew what else—abuse, but he seemed troubled beyond that. \"Pretty boy's okay?\" Maria asked through her chews. Her voice pulled her back from her thoughts into reality. Grace blushed, immediately hiding behind paperwork, which ironically it was Vitaly Orlov's. To Grace's surprise his brother had invested a crazy amount for Vitaly to have every single commodity, the hospital could give him. \"He is not fine, if that's what you're asking\" \"I meant if he was settled, but whatever suits you.\" Maria teased, looking past her magazine knowingly.[Chapter 3] Hello!

The heat made it too difficult for the residents to go outside given the cool nature of the mansion. Under the shade of a thick Maple tree, Vitaly smoked the last cigarette from a package Yuri had sent over through mail. His thoughts elsewhere, he watched the burning tobacco, engrossed in his own mind as he huffed the smoke out from his nostrils. Vitaly's sick complexion deteriorated, as his time in there passed. The first week in withdrawal was hell. The doctors gave him pain killers to help, they diminished the pain. But they didn't qualm the demons in his head. Throwing the tail of the cigarette with contempt, a deep frown settled in his brow. He felt exhausted, and it wasn't the kind of exhaustion that you just slept away. It weighed on him, and being clean wasn't particularly nice. Because then he remembered. Vitaly's head whipped upwards. Voices coming from the front lawn approached towards his hideout. With clumsy movements, Vitaly hid his cigarette box inside the pocket of his trousers. Sniffing himself, he tried to catch any signs that he had been smoking. He dusted off himself, closing his eyes briefly, he took in a breath. \"I am sure he's around here, Mr and Mrs Orlov.\" Vitaly perked up at the sound of that voice. He had tried to find out that nurse's name, but nobody seemed to care to tell him. And he couldn't find the courage or energy to ask her. He sighed, turning away from his hiding spot. Vitaly froze at the sight of his mother Irina, walking along with his father Anatoly. His mother smiled politely at the nurse, who was explaining something to them. Irina took her eyes off of her, Irina's attention wandered away from the nurse to the place Vitaly stood. Joy poured out of her eyes at the sight of her youngest child. Vitaly noticed how his mom's eyes pooled with tears. Vitaly never felt disappointed with himself even more than he did then. Grace had noticed Vitaly's escapades to the gardens at the end of the property. It unnerved her how much his presence was recognized amongst the nurses and the patients. The other night, a girl who had appeared on a tv show, talked on and off about his dreamy blue eyes, saying the Soviet guy was into her. Grace couldn't help but laugh. The doors of the facility opened. An elder couple entered, muttering between them as a orderly ushered them inside. A man in a pristine suit followed close behind. \"We've come to see Vitaly Orlov.\" the man announced, fixing his cufflinks. The overconfidence didn't fase Maria— who had the visitors list underneath her elbows. She glanced at Grace, both exchanged annoyed looks. Maria shook her head. \"Visiting it's only on weekends. I'm sorry.\" she said. Maria had no idea what she had done. Grace watched as the entire family broke in an argument. The man, who later identified as Yuri Orliv, tried to soothe the couple, who were going into a fit of hysterics. It didn't help that they were all sputtering in another language. Yuri annoyed, turned from the couple, to Maria. Teeth clenched as he squeezed the bridge of his nose. \"I don't believe you understand. This is an emergency. Unless you want to spend the next year job hunting, I suggest you get the permission for us to see my brother. Now.\" the man growled through clenched teeth. Grace stepped forward, as Maria unnerved, made the call. \"It'll be just a few minutes until the permit goes through. In the mean time, I'll take you to him.\" Heads turned, noticing the dark raven haired woman, stepping outside the counter. Grace took Vitaly's family to the gardens. She didn't have to check in his room to know he wouldn't be there. \"Our son Yuri tells us you serve lunch here.\" The man said. His eyes fixated on Grace, daring her to contradict him. Grace darted her eyes to Yuri, who seemed exasperated. \"We could arrange something for you.\" Grace answered composed. Satisfied, Mr Orlov nodded. \"Just so you know, we are Jewish. We cannot eat most of the food you people eat.\" Grace could've sworn she heard a collective groan coming from the other two. \"O bozhe.\" Vitaly's mother muttered under her breath. *.*.* The family reunion was an endearing moment to witness. According to Irina she hadn't seen her son for months since he took that business trip with Yuri. His parents only saw him that week when he got back. Only to witness the wreck he turned into. Yuri stayed long enough to just check out on his brother, until his mobile phone began to ring. The family's mood deteriorated when this happened. Yuri Orlov grinned, apologizing profusely claiming that work was calling. \"It's okay brother.\" Yuri mumbled. His blue eyes charged with meaning. Yuri left without regret. Stumbling with Grace, who was about to ask to enter so they could enjoy lunch. Frowning, Grace heard the grumblings of Vitaly's father. And the crying mother. Vitaly's eyes found her standing there her features puzzled. *.*.* Grace and Maria looked away from the intimate set of goodbyes. Irina held his son to her. Kissing Vitaly's cheek with tears in her eyes, Anatoly tried to steer the woman away. The orderlies opened the doors for Vitaly's parents. Irina watched as his son walked away from the door. Grace and Maria looked away just as Vitaly's eyes focused on them. \"Thank you.\" Vitaly calls Grace's and Maria's attention. \"Is she going to be okay?\" Grace asked tentatively. Maria, rolling her eyes, stepped underneath the counter pretending to write something on the archives. Vitaly shrugged, stepping towards the counter. The orderlies followed close. \"She told me she's praying for you.\" Grace added, shuffling some papers for the tenth time. Vitaly looked down, the cheeky smile disappearing from his lips. \"She is?\" \"Is it working?\" Grace asked. Vitaly's cheeky smile returned. \"I hope so. That model from the east wing looks interested.\" Grace heard Maria gasping as Grace's face dropped.[Chapter 4] Hey! I know it's been a long while. I haven't forgotten about this small story, my mind was buzzing with ideas and such. But writer's block was a bitch! Anyway, without further ado here's the next chapter. Enjoy! A loud bang woke up Grace from her slumber. Tangled in a heap of sheets, she turned to look at her clock on her bedside table. It was well past midnight. Grace wasn't certain that a banging outside her door was what woke her up, until she heard it again. The padding of her feet against her wooden floor broke the silence. Wary, she approached the door. Grace looked through the peephole. Through it, she saw the empty hallway outside her door. From the flickering lamp of the emergency exit, to the the closed elevator doors. Another knock shook the door. Yelping, she jumped away from it. Grace took in a deep breath, trying to calm herself. She was being ridiculous. Unlocking the doorjamb, Grace flung it open. She froze. When was the last time she had seen him? A couple of months ago, just before he left St Joseph's. \"Vitaly Orlov?\" Grace whispered. Vitaly's blue orbes settled on Grace's face. It was the expression of a broken man. \"How did you get here?\" Grace looked at both ends of the building halls. Lifting Vitaly off the floor. \"I followed you home.\" he drawled. Grace eyes went big as saucers, a chill running down her spine. \"You what?\" Grace snapped just as she let go of his grasp. Vitaly nodded, sweat rippling down his forehead. Stumbling his feet, Vitaly looked at Grace. \"You were rushing up the steps of the subway. It's a dangerous place to wander at night. So I worried, and I followed you.\" \"You worried,\" Grace repeated. \"Where were you going when you saw me anyway?\" \"Little Odessa. My parents own the Crimean restaurant. I make an excellent Borscht, by the way.\" Vitaly grinned, but it soon faded when Grace didn't reciprocate. Realizing they were discussing on Grace's threshold, he rubbed his arms. \"It's freezing out here. Can we get inside?\" Grace sighed. He was drunk and maybe even on something, she couldn't just kick him to the curb and send him on his way, could she? Stepping aside Grace helped a stumbling Vitaly inside her apartment. With some effort she set his heavy body unto the red, worn-out, loveseat. Vitaly closed his eyes. Resting his head back, he willed the estupor to fade away. Grace fidget, not knowing where to go from there. Should she call a doctor? Wasn't it creepy he followed her home? Should she bring a glass of water? Choosing the latter, Grace said nothing as she awkwardly padded back to her small kitchenette. *.*.* Vitaly heard the distant clink of the dishes, and Grace muttering to herself. He could picture her. He pictured her biting the insides of her cheek. Her dark hair falling in messy waves around her shoulders. And he could see those alluring gray eyes. Eyes that could read him better than anything else. He couldn't keep his eyes open, but between heavy lids, he distinguished her small figure, moving back and forth in the small space. What did he even intent with stalking her? *.*.* 3 months earlier. \"So you are going away, huh?\" Grace felt stupid for stating the obvious, she looked the other way as she couldn't bear the sight of him. Sick. It's not as if she could've done something, when he didn't want to get better— Maybe her dad was right, she loved lost causes. Vitaly said nothing. It was the first day of many that she had seen him lucid. \"Yeah, guess I'm better now.\" he smiled ruefully. \"Are you though?\" Grace squeezed his shoulder, before turning around on her heels. She marched up the steps to the entrance, turning just in time to see the black sleek car driving away. \"He'll be back,\" Grace looked at Calvin— a big, blond orderly— behind her shoulder. \"What do you mean?\" \"Guys like him, they are always back.\" shaking his head as he went back inside. *.*.* Vitaly sat on a stool while Grace poured him a cup of black coffee. He was eager to get away. He didn't know why he followed Grace. He was on his way to a brothel—the next thing that could help him have a sort of release— as he caught sight of Grace on his way there. The sight of her shocked him. Without thinking, he followed her. Giving the look she was casting upon him, she didn't want him there. \"You look like shit.\" Grace said nonchalantly. His eyes dodged hers. \"I've been better.\" \"What does your family think about all the shenanigans you pull nowadays?\" Grace couldn't help the accusatory tone her voice held. \"They think I'm a fucked up. While they fawn at everything Yuri does. Cause Yuri does no wrong.\" Vitaly let out a bitter chuckle. \"What do you mean?\" \"Nothing.\" Vitaly said stirring his mug. Sighing, Grace sat up. Knowing better than to intrude, Grace just watched him. He looked beyond repair. A strand of his long hair fell on his face, he pushed it back with a flip. \"Can I ask you something?\" Grace asked. Looking back at Grace, Vitaly waited. She took in a breath. \"Why are you like this?\" Vitaly stared, reflecting on her unusual question. \"Because I am.\" Vitaly's eyes traveled the length of her face, as his eyes lowered, he noticed the scar in her wrist. Grace followed his sightline. Realizing what he stared at, her stomach dropped. Clearing her throat, Grace pulled her sleeve down. \"I guess you could stay here for tonight. Roaming the streets at night isn't a good idea.\" If Vitaly noticed the slight stutter, he hid it well. \"Thank you.\" Vitaly said, with his eyes perusing the small apartment, he smirked. \"I suppose that's the bedroom?\" Feeling her cheeks burning, Grace nodded at the small loveseat. \"More like you will take the couch.\" Grace pat his cheek as she pushed past him.[Chapter 5] Happy New Year! I hope you readers had amazing holidays. Thank you to all of you for keeping up with this small piece of fiction and to those kind enough to review, follow, favorite this story. Thank you SakuraHiime for all your support. Enjoy! He lay asleep beside her on the couch. The blankets and pillows bunched up around his body, his breathing slow and even. Grace stared at him, he slept soundlessly next to her. He had pulled her to the couch with him as he sat, telling her to stay with him for a while. She obliged. She was growing uncomfortable with the familiarity he treated her. Vitaly was a stranger, the shadiest person she had ever encountered. And an addict. Grace took a deep breath in. She gathered strength to pull herself up from the love seat, pulling Vitaly's dangling legs up on the sofa, covering her absence. Tomorrow she would take him to his family. *.*.* Darkness engulfed him, he closed and opened his eyes several times, trying to make it stop. Gunshots. Red pooling out of the children's heads. Blank looks. Vitaly threw the covers away, he searched for his jacket, and patted its pockets. Vitaly found what he needed, and unwrapped it. The white substance fell on the coffee table. Without preamble Vitaly bent over to the table, and inhaled. It hit him like a sharp blow in the head, he blinked rapidly. He felt it as it hit his nerves, his brain, his mind put down at ease once more. And his regret shoved to the back of his mind, he relaxed. *.*.* Grace sensed as if she had just closed her eyes. Startled, she rose from her bed. The lights were on. Her radio blasted the national anthem. The hell was going on? She cross her room's door toward the living room, to find Vitaly was nowhere to be seen. The only signs that he had been there were the unkempt sheets and a half chucked bottle of whiskey on the coffee table. Something smashed inside her kitchenette, startled by the sound, she followed the string of curses. Her stomach dropped. The fridge contents lay scattered about, the stove was on, and it smelled like something was burning. Vitaly stood amidst the mess, trying to pick the glass shards from the floor with clumsy movements with a bleeding hand, he cursed as his fingers got small cuts. At the sight of movement, Vitaly looked up. Grace stomach churned. His big blue eyes' brim had reddened, and the look in his eyes stood out with a glassy, blank stare. It was her turn to curse. \"What happened?\" Grace asked trying to keep the histerics out of her voice. She didn't succeed. \"I was hungry.\" Vitaly looked at the boiling contents of the casserole, oblivious to the overcooked stench. With efficiency, Grace crossed the room in swift strides. She took the knife from Vitaly's grasp, and turned off the stove. She looked inside the casserole. A variety of vegetables and a steak floated around of what seemed to be tomato juice. \"I didn't find beetroot inside your fridge, so I made it with a canned tomato soup. \" \"It?\" \"Borsht. My specialty.\" Vitaly chuckled, avoiding Grace's eyes, grimacing at his injured palm. \"Let me look at that.\" Grace took his hand on hers, the wound was deep, it needed cleaning and maybe some stitches. \"I can't keep the nightmares away.\" Grace, taken aback, stared at Vitaly. He looked past her, his blue eyes shimmered away. She pitied him. Grace wondered what he endured that it led him to become who he was. \"I can't stitch your hand here. I need to take you to the hospital.\" \"Take me where my brother lives. He's in a— a business trip. But Ava will be there, she's having a baby you know?\" \"What? You aren't making any sense. Ugh. Fine, better than having you back on rehab, huh? Not a bad idea, though. Here, let me clean it.\" Grace took his arm, and dragged him back towards the small loveseat. She instructed him to wait rushing towards her bathroom to retrieve her aid kit. Grace sat before him, having all she needed, she examined the wound. Vitaly stared at the nape of Grace's head. He sensed the way she worked around the gash, he felt no pain. At least not from the cut. He knew that Grace had many questions, the way her grey eyes glistened and narrowed whenever he said something. He hated the pity behind them, her pity was like a knife plunging on his stomach. \"Where did you learn to cook anyway?\" Her voice snapped him back to reality. Vitaly smirked, closing his eyes he rested his head back. \"My family and I, we are from Ukraine. We emigrated when things were getting tough. My father put up a restaurant, and my mother taught me all culinary skills. But 'shh' nobody needs to know this.\" \"Right.\" Grace mumbled appraising Vitaly's wound. She let out a breath. It didn't need stitches. \"All right Orlov, you'll live. There's no need to go to a hospital.\" He smirked, peaking at her through hooded lids. Nodding, he shut his eyes closed. Grace packed her things, her stomach lurching at the thought of him being broken. Grace patted his arm with stiff moves before she pushed herself from the loveseat. She threw the comforter over Vitaly's body. Grace dragged herself to her bedroom. *.*.* Grace shifted on her chair, she stared at the window as she tried– unsuccessfully— to shut down the rampant fight in Russian coming behind doors of what probably was the kitchen. The Crimean wasn't fancy—which Grace imagined it would be, given Vitaly's brother's lifestyle. On the contrary it seemed old and dirty business, half the people inside eating plates of undistinguishable content spoke in fluent Russian. Grace wondered if she was in the middle of mobster meetings. The door of the kitchen burst open. Vitaly's father— a small man with aquiline nose—came out first, scowling as his eyes contacted Grace's. As if it was her fault his son was such a wreck. \"You eaten yet?\" Grace turned her attention away from the grumpy-looking man, turning her focus on the woman with angry yet kind eyes. Vitaly's mother. Irina. \"It's fine. Actually–\" \"Actually Grace was telling me on our way here that she was hungry.\" Vitaly sat next to Grace in the table, smirking at Grace. \"It's settled then.\" Irina agreed with her tick accent. \"Who'll attend the costumers?\" Anatoly complained. Grace looked around amused. \"You papa.\" Vitaly laughed. Grace smirked, despite her discomfort, she found the entire ordeal hilarious. Flushed, Anatoly jumped off his stool, took his coat and headed to the exit. \"I'm off to temple!\" The door slammed behind Anatoly's back \"Your father is…\" Grace muttered. Vitaly smirked, but it wasn't the usual humorous one. \"He isn't happy with the way both of his sons turned out.\" Vitaly mumbled toying with the salt shaker. \"What do you mean? Everyone is fucked up somehow, and your brother is a wealthy business man.\" \"The thing is–\" Vitaly hesitated. He spared Grace a sidelong glance before fumbling with his pack of cigarettes. \"Yuri's ambition is blinding him.\" She was eager to ask for details. Grace opened her mouth only to close it again when Irina approached the table with a sad smile, two plates in both hands. Setting them in front of both Vitaly and Grace, the woman stared at his youngest child as he ate. Vitaly seemed unfazed, just as Grace shifted in her chair for the hundredth time. About to shove a spoonful in her mouth, Vitaly's hand slammed on the table, causing both women to jump out of their skins. The chatter surrounding the restaurant died, heads turned toward the sound. Jaws stopped their movement as they waited for something to happen. Silence reigned. Diners kept staring at their table. Grace sworn she could hear the silence that fell upon the place. If such thing existed. Irina excused herself and ran into the kitchen. Tears streaming down her face. The chatter resumed, heads turned but sideway glances kept a watchful eye on them. \"Shit.\" Vitaly cursed, running a hand through his hair, pushing it past his eyes. His leg bounced up and down underneath the table. \"Vitaly,\" Grace mumbled tentative. He flinched, it hit him she was sitting right next to him, witnessing all. Vitaly turned away from her scrutiny. His eyes filled with remorse. \"I need to get out of here.\" Vitaly pushed away from the table. He crossed the restaurant in swift strides to the door. Grace watched the steaming contents of her plate, aware of the pointed looks on her back. She took in a deep breath. Grace's chair whirred as she stood and followed Vitaly out unto the streets.[Chapter 6] HELLO! It's been a while since I posted anything, it was a small hiatus of sorts, considering I don't update constantly. Thank you so much to those of you who've taken the time to read, review, favourite this small piece of fiction. I usually write to amuse myself, so I'm glad my writing get to do the same for others... Here's the next chapter! Trigger warning: There's some slight talk of abuse. The mug settled on top of the kitchen table with a loud click that the porcelain made against it. The sound made her jump. They had clustered themselves in a companionable silence, the sound being the first thing to slice through it with the sharpness of a knife. \"Where did you go?\" Her voice rasped against silence, her syllables not too pronounced. She scratched her skin absent minded. Vitaly reacted, his lashes fanned his own blue eyes. Eyes, that in slow motion, grasped for focus. They focused on her, noting Grace was still there. He cleared his throat, as she shifted on the uncomfortable stool, Vitaly slouch, in a nonchalant façade. His eyes finally left hers, focusing on the black mass inside his cup, Grace sensed his scrutiny's absence. \"Nowhere. Just thinking.\" \"I'm amazed.\" Grace laughed humourless. At Vitaly's quizzical look she added, \"Men in my family used to do the same. They lived in both worlds at once.\" She pat her temple to make a point. \"The mind seems a better choice.\" he pauses, \"Sometimes.\" Grace nodded. She looked down at her untouched mug, a mug that once was white, now it had never leaving coffee stains on the borders, the once pristine mug, chaffed and chipped. Ironic. Her grey eyes levelled with Vitaly's, catching him on the act of appraising her. Something he couldn't help but do often, trying to figure her out. She amazed him, and annoyed him her constant kindness. Why did she even care? She was still there for him, and he knew it wasn't out of pity, he endured enough with Yuri's constant pity, Vitaly could recognise when a person's way of caring was honest. But she was something else, Grace treated him different. Like a person, and not a complete fucked up person. After the incident at his family's joint, Grace chased after him, knowing she was meddling in something it wasn't even her business to meddle in the first place, and not to mention, business of a stranger! To whom she seemed drawn to by his mysterious background, and his brooding nature. Vitaly was out of his mind when she reached him. She found him pacing back and forth, running a hand through his hair. He looked everywhere but her. Vitaly wanted to tell her, to speak out of the nightmares that kept him up at night and how much he loathed himself and his brother. Grace stared at him, throughout the inner struggle he had, she remained silent. All of sudden, his anger vanished. Grace thought he was about to have an emotional break down, but his despair transformed into an almost unreadable expression. \"I think we should go back.\" Grace said, she turned on her heels, she hoped he would follow her, and he did. They weren't friends, but there was understanding between them that made the walk back less awkward. He stepped inside the restaurant first. The people looked at the opening door, Grace saw their expressions shifting into fake disinterest, but their heads kept turning slightly towards them as they walked inside, sideways glances followed every step they took. Irina sat by the table in the back, her face devoid of astray tears, she smiled in kind at the clients, the only thing giving away her feelings were the traces of her frown creasing her forehead. Her attention snapped towards them as they approached the counter. Vitaly and his mother locked glances, they didn't speak as he approached her, his stride was of man in sudden need of the comfort only a mother could give. Grace followed close behind as an spectator. An outsider. Somewhat jealous, Grace saw the moment, she was jealous that he had a mother that cared for him, and he took that for granted. Grace contemplated as Mother and son stared at each other, they exchanged unspoken words between them with a single glance. Vitaly cupped his mother's face in his hands, while her mother's poise shattered and she hugged her son with a vicious grip. A grip that wished for him to never leave her care. A hug Vitaly didn't return. Irina's grip on his son lessened, her eyes travelled back to the dark haired woman, her eyes thanking Grace for what she did. Which felt foreign to her since all she did was bring him back. \"Would you like something to drink?\" Irina asked, forcing Grace to stay longer than she planned. Grace forced an indulging smile. \"I should go.\" Grace said. She rose from her stool, her back stiff from being in the same position for too long, her movements awkward. Vitaly insisted she should stay for another cup, after her mother left them alone to keep an eye on business, since he had ruined her night and part of her day. \"Yeah, I bet you have more things to do. Important things, than taking care of me.\" Vitaly chuckled. \"It's not that this wasn't fun,\" Grace said laughing, to which Vitaly laughed too, a boyish grin spreading on his handsome face. \"But I have to get back.\" \"Take care Vitaly Orlov.\" Grace said. All traces of humour abandoned. Vitaly's grin faded, a solemn expression replacing it as he turned around the table to approach her. Unnerved, Grace stared at him, not sure of how to react. He came to a stop in front of her, his eyes trailed her entire face, a spark in his blue eyes loomed as his stare intensified. Grace couldn't seem to move away, frozen by his proximity, her feet seemed to ground her to her spot. Vitaly was close enough, close enough she could smell him. He smelled like a mixture of cigarette smoke and something resembling to soap rom the shower he took that morning back at her place. Vitaly inched forward, his face closed on hers, he paused. Vitaly's eyes scanned hers, his eyes fetching for an emotion out of hers, other than confusion and shock. Involuntarily, her mouth parted, which caught Vitaly's attention. A tiny smirk tilted the corner of his mouth upwards, inching forward Vitaly kissed Grace's cheek. He took notice of her squirms under his proximity. \"Thank you\" Vitaly said before drawing away from her intoxicating presence. *.*.* Grace shifted under Marie scrutiny. She turned the menu down, she took sip from her glass of wine, avoiding her friend's stare. \"So, just to see if I get it.\" Marie said, her voice hitched with that annoyed tone she held. Her elbows coming up on top of their table. \"He followed you? And you let him stay over?\" \"I know it's not the best idea I ever had–\" \"That's an understatement.\" \" But I wasn't about to throw him to the street half drunk and god knows what else.\" Grace muttered. \"It's called being kind. Have you heard of it?\" \"He could've been a complete psychopath. You are too naïve.\" \"Well, it won't happen again.\" Grace muttered with a grimace. \"Uh-huh. I don't blame you, I blame your kind nature that sends you off to trouble.\" \"My father would agree with you.\" Grace murmured, pushing away her menu. Marie had agreed to meet with her and have lunch. She was her confidant and only friend. New York City wasn't a friendly place. \"Your father. He's hiring more staff to help at the centre, although he's reducing our shifts he's also reducing our payment.\" Marie shook her head. Grace shrunk on her seat. She had so many issues, one of them was her father. She hardly saw him, and when she did, he treated her as another employee under his payroll, instead of family. He never even acknowledged her as his daughter. She used to want to please the stoic, uncaring man that treated her with callousness. Her mother left when she was a toddler with the selfish bastard of a man who saw her as a burden. As soon as she could walk, he would send her to every daycare, nannies, she grew under everyone's care...but the lack of love. That's something she had longed. \"...talk to him.\" \"Huh?\" Grace looked up startled. Marie stared, trying to make a point, her mouth pursued as her hand clenched her fork. \"I said, that maybe he would consider not changing our wages if he heard it directly from you. His daughter.\" \"Not going to happen.\" Grace snickered. \"If he wants me to quit so badly, why doesn't he talks to me?\" Marie rolled her eyes, having heard that argument before, she bent over the table. \"Why do you work for him then? Jesus!\" Grace shrugged, having another sip of wine, she looked away from the scrutiny of her friend. *.*.* The contents of the stove burned, Grace stirred the contents with slow movements, her grey eyes focused on its contents, her mind wandering about. The phone rang. Grace looked up with red rimmed eyes, she looked over her shoulder, losing the interest on the constant sound. She looked back at the stove, her movements continued, the phone stopped ringing- Grace let out a sigh. Her hair lied nestled in a messy heap around her shoulders. A long loose blouse covered her with the matching pyjama bottoms. Six months. She lost her job six months ago. It wasn't the loss of her job that kept her up at night, or the cocky smirk her father had, when she begged him not to lay off Marie. He knew it killed her to beg. Especially to the man who abused of his own child, verbally at least. Throughout her childhood she watched him being abusive towards her mother, he would come home at night after working hard to help others, but took to scream his own frustrations and unload his burdens at his own wife. Not only with screams but fists too. The screams never ceased in that house for eight years, the last four, she watched as his violent behaviour increased with the passing of time. \"Mom?\" Grace called out as she came through the small blue house's door. School hadn't been the best that day, considering she had no friends and kids mocked each other over the foreign accents of some. They mocked her for being quiet, and her eyes unsettled everyone, her teacher call them unique, she hated them. \"Mom?\" Grace called out again. She went into the kitchen, it was strange to find it empty, except for the unfinished dinner . Her little upturned nose furrowed at the sight. Her mother would never leave dinner like that. A loud thump upstairs startled her. That's when she noticed. Folded neatly on the living room sofa, a black coat. Daddy's coat. Gulping, Grace made her way upstairs, careful to jump past the creaking floor boards, she already memorised them. She heard the sound again, this time, as she drew near her parents door room, muffled voices accompanied the thump. Biting her lip, Grace cracked the door open. \"When I tell you something, you aren't supposed to talk back. Isn't that what a wife duty is? Stay silent?\" Grace froze at the sight. Her mother's ivory skin, was turning into a deep shade of purple, her yes were bulging out of her sockets. Daddy's hands lay wrapped with an iron grip around her mother's neck, she lay motionless on the floor. \"MOOOM!\" The knocking at her front door startled her out of a haze. The knocking turned into a pounding that reverberated in her ears. Grace wiped her eyes with her sleeve. Nobody was supposed to be there, she thought, it was one of those days she destined to be still. Or depressed, as the doctors called it. Grace turned off the stove, the dish she meant to cook had already burned. She frowned at the doorway, Grace approached, her feet padded towards it, decide to put an end to the constant pounds, Grace opened the door without double checking through the peep-hole. A loud gasp escaped her lips, her hands went to grip her shirt, self-concious in the messy state she was in, Grace shut the door close in the face she thought she wouldn't see again. Vitaly Orlov's face. ","Summary":" Grace sat in the small bed, the covers undone, and she beared an unruly appearance. Her grey eyes n"},{"Movie":"Fame, 2009","Title":"Rock and Roll High School: Year One","Author":"Catlethea","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6786604","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Kevin was standing at the bus stop, thinking about the day ahead of him. Today was his audition for Performing Arts High School, and he was very far away from his home in Iowa, which didn't help his nervousness much. If he screwed up, he would have to go all the way back home and face his father's disappointment and his mother's pity, two things he wanted to avoid at all costs; it was a lot of pressure. For the thousandth time that morning, he reminded himself to relax, took a deep breath, and started pacing the bus stop to take his mind off the audition. There weren't many people there, surprisingly enough, so Kevin was nearly alone at the bus stop, and the people that were present paid no attention to him. And that was okay with him. By the time he had stopped pacing and was relatively calm once more, two boys about his age had arrived and were standing away from the group, talking and laughing together. They both had black hair and were wearing black shirts, and the taller boy was wearing blue jeans, but the slightly shorter, thinner boy had a backpack and was wearing neon green, legging-like pants. The bus finally arrived, and Kevin hung back to let passengers get off, watching the thin boy out of the corner of his eye. He was glancing between his friend and the bus, looking regretful, then his friend said something to make him smile, and he put his hands on the taller boy's sides and kissed him square on the mouth. Kevin wanted to stop watching them-he was blushing profusely-but he couldn't help but keep looking while they kissed, eyes closed in ecstacy. The other people at the stop didn't ignore the pair as they had Kevin, but instead shook their heads or made disapproving sounds, or purposely turned their backs. Kevin boarded the vehicle and watched out the window as the bus driver honked the horn, separating the boys, and the one in leggings dashed inside as well, thanking the driver. The driver, a middle-aged black woman, said, \"Don't thank me, kid, just sit down. I've got better things to do than wait around for you.\" The boy smirked, then headed for the closest empty seat, beside Kevin. To keep from staring at him, Kevin bent down and checked his bag to make sure nothing had fallen out. \"You're a dancer, too?\" Kevin straightened, and the black-haired boy was looking at him, pointing to the ballet shoes in Kevin's bag. Nodding mutely, Kevin watched as his companion reached into his own bag and pulled out a pair of very beat-up black toe shoes; Kevin's eyes widened. He said, \"You dance pointe?\" \"Believe it or not, I've been doing it for three years.\" he admitted. \"How about you?\" Kevin shook his head. \"I'm not very good at pointe yet. I just started last year. How long have you been dancing?\" The boy chewed his lip and thought for a long moment before answering, \"I think I was around seven when I started. So. . . about half my life now. And you?\" \"Pretty much my whole life.\" Kevin said, then stuck out his hand. \"I'm Kevin, by the way.\" \"Jiri.\" Jiri responded, shaking Kevin's hand. \"So, I take it you're trying out for PA?\" Kevin nodded, and Jiri smiled. \"Well, let's hope we both get in, huh? Like to talk with you some more about dancing. Maybe we could hang out sometime?\" \"That'd be fun.\"[Chapter 2] Kevin sat down on the floor and took a swig of water; his audition was over, and the rest was in the hands of his teacher, Ms. Kraft. The next group came forward and took position, and Kevin spotted Jiri, who gave him a small smile, then stretched a little before standing still to wait for the music. Jiri looked out of place in his green leggings and his careworn toe shoes, and people were giving him strange looks, but he didn't seem to notice or care. \"All right,\" said Ms. Kraft, \"Same drill as the other groups. You'll all dance in formation as instructed, and I'll call you forward as random individuals, then you will solo. This is to see how good of an individual dancer you are, as well as to test your improvisation skills. Everyone understand? Now, starting in four, three, two. . .\" The music began, and the group moved as a single, well-synchronized mass. Unlike Kevin's audition, the music was not classical, but an alternative track with vocals, and Kevin could just see some of the students planning out their solos, expressions of deep concentration on their faces. Jiri, however, was smiling a little as he danced, thoroughly enjoying being on his feet. The first few solos were failures; the dancers were unprepared, and one girl even fell. Some of them were getting tense and nervous, but Jiri stayed happy. The teacher noticed this, and called out, \"You there, number 609.\" Jiri grinned even wider, then broke out of the pack to the front of the room, sliding forward on pointe. From there, he spun twice and performed something that was a fascinating cross between ballet, modern, and hip-hop freestyling, and Ms. Kraft was smiling a little by the time she sent him back. On his way back to the group, Jiri caught Kevin's eye and smirked, then winked, falling into step with the others. Kevin couldn't hold back a smile in return.[Chapter 3] For the second time that day, Kevin was at the bus stop. Only this time, he wasn't nervous, and he wasn't alone; Jiri was with him, and they were happily chatting back and forth, trying to learn more about each other. Both of them were very excited and high off the fact they had gotten into PA, so they were much more talkative and less reserved than normal, practically babbling uncontrollably about whatever came to mind. It wasn't half bad, Kevin decided. \"Ah!\" Jiri exclaimed suddenly, stretching. \"God, I can't wait for tomorrow. No, wait, I can't wait to see the look on my mom's face when I tell her I got in. She's going to freak OUT!\" Kevin laughed. \"Why?\" Jiri leaned on the arm of the bench and explained, \"The thing is, well, my mom thinks I'm an idiot for wanting to dance. She just. . . She doesn't get it, you know? Ever since I started taking lessons, she's been betting me I'll never make it as a dancer, and even more so lately. I mean, I've got to dance after school every day, plus my normal homework, and now I have to make time to hang out with Andrew and all my friends. . . It'll be a miracle if I can make it through the year, my mom says. So I'm going to try and prove her wrong.\" \"That makes sense. And Andrew, is he that guy-\" Kevin began. \"Yeah, he's the one from this morning.\" Jiri said, nodding, then he looked down with a blush and a smile. \"We've been going out for a month now. That's another thing my mom thinks will make me fail, being gay.\" An awkward silence followed, then Kevin swallowed and said quietly, \"I don't think your sexuality has anything to do with the way you dance. I mean, you're the best dancer I've seen in a long time, so. . . And it's perfectly fine with me that you're gay. I mean, I. . .\" Kevin stopped, licking his lips. \"I've-I've been. . . trying to-\" \"Figure yourself out?\" Jiri supplied, and Kevin nodded with a sigh of relief. Jiri half-turned to Kevin and said, \"Well, if you need. . . like, any kind of help with it, you know, I know plenty of guys. So yeah.\" Kevin blinked, surprised. \"Thanks, Jiri.\" Jiri shrugged, pushing some of his black hair out of his eyes. \"No problem. I mean, what are friends for?\" He chuckled, then suddenly snapped his fingers and exclaimed, \"Oh! I just remembered. . . There's a party on my block next week, for my sister's Sweet Sixteen, just some friends in the neighborhood. Would you maybe want to go?\" \"Sure. I mean, if this first week of PA doesn't kill us.\" Kevin joked, happy; he had been accepted into PA, he had a friend, and he was going to a party! His life couldn't be better. ","Summary":" Kevin was standing at the bus stop, thinking about the day ahead of him. Today was his audition for"},{"Movie":"Taking 5","Title":"Hiding My Heart The Kidnapping of Devon Thompson","Author":"aerin29","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5112758","Passage":"[Chapter 1] HidingnMy Heart (The Kidnapping of Devon Thompson) Chaptern1: Movie Nigh t Prologue Inhave to get to him. I just have to. That's all Devon could think. Never mind that it was a mile tonhis house. Never mind that it was raining - raining in torrents in anway rarely seen in Southern California. Never mind that she wasnsoaked and exhausted. Inhave to tell him. Ninenmonths earlier \"HotnFuzz?! That's your pick for movie night? I thought we agreed onnThe Notebook.\" Devon wrinkled her nose at she looked at the backnof the DVD cover and then sank back into the pillows of her couch. \"Ohnye of little faith. Just give it a shot. You're totally going tonlove it. Besides, The Notebook is a total chick flick and it's mynturn to pick.\" Ritchie walked into the living room carrying ancouple of bottles of water and a bowl of popcorn. He placed thenpopcorn bowl on the coffee table and handed one of the bottles ofnwater to Devon. \"We'llnsee.\" Devon stated as she watched Ritchie pick up the remote andnhit the play button. Devon narrowed her eyes at Ritchie and pursednher lips in a look meant to convey skepticism. In response, Ritchiengrinned and popped some kernels into his mouth before turning back tonface the TV. Althoughnshe liked giving Ritchie a hard time about his movie picks, innreality, Devon adored movie night with Ritchie. It had become theirnlittle tradition ever since she moved to Los Angeles six years ago tonstart her undergrad degree at UCLA. Whilenshe would never have admitted to anyone but her best friend Gabbynthat she was apprehensive about moving to LA -- the indominatablenDevon Lissette Thompson admit fear - forget it! -- she had been sonnervous. At the biggest part of her nervousness had stemmed from thenman currently sitting on her living room couch. Backnwhen she was 16, she and Gabby had kidnapped members of the Ritchie'snband, 5LeoRise. In the course of that adventure, Devon had fallennfor Ritchie and fallen hard. And she thought Ritchie had felt anconnection with her too. But after the concert at her school,nRitchie and the rest of the band had been occupied with cuttingnanother album (this time with them all playing instruments) andnsubsequent touring. The band's tour schedule and long distance hadneffectively stunted any real romantic relationship from formingnbetween Devon and Ritchie. Sure they had kept up contact throughnemail and MySpace. And they saw each other whenever the band was innher hometown on tour. But it wasn't enough to sustain, let alonenstart, a romance. Sonwhen Devon moved to LA with Gabby six years ago, a small part of hern-- actually a big part of her -- hoped that she would finally be ablento start a real relationship with Ritchie. But when she arrived innLA, she found that Ritchie had a girlfriend. While the girlfriendnlasted only five months, the romance never got off the ground. Innthe years since, Devon told herself that it didn't matter. She hadna real friendship with Ritchie -- aside from Gabby, he was her bestnfriend. And she was friends with everyone else in the band. Evennso, looking at him sitting next to her, watching his dark hair fallninto his pale blue eyes, made her stomach clench and her heart race. nBut ever practical Devon pushed those feelings down and turned hernattention back to the movie. Ancouple of hours later, Devon turned to Ritchie \"As much as thisnpains me to say - you were right. It was funny. You actually pickedna decent movie. Will wonders never cease?\" \"Intold you to trust me. You never learn.\" Ritchie grinned again. n\"I just hope that next week when it's your turn, you can live upnto the high standard that I've set.\" \"Buddyn- the bar isn't that high. Hot Fuzz is funny. But it ain't nonCitizen Kane. And by the way, why are we always doing this at mynapartment? You're the famous rock star with the MTV-worthy crib ofna mansion? And the High Def TV? I'm just a lowly employee of thengreat 5LeoRise empire.\" \"Finen- my place next time. I just always figured it's easier for you ifnwe do it at your place. And you don't work for me - you work fornHollis. You barely even do anything for the band anymore. Lately,nall I hear about from you are all these new bands.\" Ritchienfrowned as he recalled how irritated he'd been lately about Devon'snincreasing involvement with The Lepers, a new band Hollis had justnsigned. A couple of weeks ago, Ritchie had been in the Viper Roomnand had seen Devon sitting next to Garrett Worthington, the leadnsinger of The Lepers. Ritchie saw Devon throw back her head andnlaugh at something Garrett had said. Ritchienhad also seen the way Garrett looked at Devon. A part of Ritchiencouldn't blame Garrett for thinking what he was obviously thinking.n With her long blonde hair and lithe body, kept trim and fit by allnthe running that she liked to do, Devon certainly attractednattention. And her laugh was the best -- like everything else, whennDevon laughed she fully committed. When Devon laughed at somethingnyou said, you felt like you were on top of the world. Ritchie knewnthis. And it irritated the crap out of him that she was laughing atnsomething Garrett had said. Injust don't want her to get involved with the wrong guy. I justndon't want to see my best friend hurt. Ritchie had thought - even as his insides rolled and his fistsninvoluntarily clenched. \"Don'tnpout - I do plenty of stuff for you guys. In fact, Hollis is lettingnme take lead on planning out your tour. He even said that I'llnprobably go out on the road as assistant tour manager. So you'llnbe seeing me plenty. You'll see me so much, you'll be sick atnthe sight of me.\" Devon smiled and wiggled her eyebrows as shennudged Ritchie's shoulder with her own. Ritchienlaughed, \"Good to know you haven't forgotten us. We'll alwaysnbe your first band, you know.\" \"Inknow.\" Devon held Ritchie's gaze. Whatnis this weird lurching in my heart .n Ritchie tugged at his T-shirt collar. \"Listen, it's late. Inshould get going.\" He stood up and started walking towards thendoor. \"Lock the door behind me, though.\" \"Whatnare you, my father? I'll be fine.\" Devon reached out to hugnRitchie. Neither noticed that they held on a little longer than mostnplatonic friends. I'mnjust his friend. Devonnthought. She'snmy best friend. Ritchie reminded himself.[Chapter 2] Chaptern2: Here Comes Trouble [Ritchiensinging and the band playing] I'venbeen hiding my heart I'venbeen scared to let you see me Waitingnhere for you \"I'mnnot sure about the bridge though. What do you think, Scooter?\" nRitchie turned to the spiky-haired blonde guitarist. \"Dude,nI think it's good. Rich - we gotta wrap this up soon. I'm goingnout with Devon tonight.\" Ritchiensmiled, \"Another top secret scouting mission?\" \"Youngot it. Just call me Danger 'cause Danger is my middle name.\" nScooter pulled on a baseball cap and dark sunglasses. Anfew months ago, Devon had taken to going to clubs to try to scout newntalent for Hollis's management company. Somehow, Scooter hadngotten involved and so Devon and Scooter often went together onnDevon's \"scouting missions.\" \"Indon't get why you're so into this, man. You're helping thencompetition. It blows my mind.\" Mason said as he put his guitarnback into its case. \"Firstnrule of business, my friends, know your competitors. Besides, it'snfun. I get to dress up incognito and have fun without everyonenknowing that Scooter from 5LeoRise is in the house.\" Scooterndiscarded his baseball cap and picked up a cowboy hat. \"Tonight, Inthink I'll be Danger from Texas.\" \"Sonif you're Danger, what's Devon - Trouble?\" Ritchie teased. \"Nawnman, she always goes by the same name - Suzy Parker. She won'tntell me where it's from either.\" Scooter rolled his eyes. It'snthe Velvet Raven's alter ego .n Ritchie thought as he remembered Devon wearing the Velvet Ravenncostume all those years ago. Andnit was a great costume. She looked amazing. Justnthen, a flame-haired woman in body-hugging black catsuit andnsunglasses walked through the door. \"Hey guys\" said the womannwith Devon's voice. \"Devon?!n Is that you?\" Ritchie choked out - shocked to see Devon in such ansuggestive get up. \"Darlin'n- so glad you could make it\" Scooter affected a Texas drawl as henkissed Devon on both cheeks and she giggled. \"Let's go, Suzy.\" \"Okay.n Rich - the bridge sounded great. See you guys later.\" Devonncalled out as she and Scooter walked out. \"Wherenare you guys headed?\" Ritchie called after them. \"Oval.\"n Scooter called back - naming a new club that was fast gaining anreputation for booking the hottest unsigned bands in LA. Ritchienturned to Mason, \"Can you believe that get up that Devon had on? nShe's just asking for trouble.\" \"Duden- what's your problem? She's barely showing any skin.\" \"Shenlooks like Britney Spears in that Oops, I did it again video. Exceptnthat Britney's outfit was red and Devon's is black.\" \"Comento think of it, Britney did look pretty hot in that video. Okay - Insee where you're going with this. I guess I just don't noticenbecause I don't see Devon that way.\" Mason put a slight emphasisnon the last phrase - which Ritchie didn't pick up on at all. Unlike some people Inknow . Mason thought tonhimself. \"She'snjust asking for trouble.\" Ritchie muttered as he walked outncarrying his guitar. \"Whennare the two of them going to realize what's staring them in thenface?\" KK asked Mason as KK stepped out from behind the drums. \"Duden- it's Ritchie and Devon. It's been years and they're stillnboth oblivious.\" Mason answered. \"Inthink that Ritchie will soon realize what he might lose. MamanFortunata told me so.\" Nikolai intoned solemnly. \"Yournfortune teller? Nik - I thought you weren't seeing her anymore.\"n KK shook his head at his bandmate. \"MamanFortunata tells the truth. She foresaw that I would become a citizenntwo years ago.\" \"Nikn- you became a citizen because Devon and Gabby helped you study andnyou passed the citizenship test. It's not magic. It was your ownnhard work.\" KK explained. \"Non- Mama Fortunata tells the truth. You will see.\" Nikolai smilednenigmatically.[Chapter 3] Chaptern3: The Movie Star Author'snnote: I picture Reese Worthington as being played by Jensen Acklesnof the TV show \"Supernatural.\" Specialnthanks to Maiqu for pointing out that Ritchie's full name (andnScooter's too) is given in the movie when Ritchie, Mason andnScooter are being interrogated by Lincoln. Devonnwas bored. She should never have let Scooter talk her into coming tonthis party. Theynhad gone to Oval as planned and seen a couple of bands -- only one ofnwhich was really exciting enough to remember. Devon had made anmental note to try to catch a couple more of that band's showsnbefore she went to Hollis. GarrettnWorthington from the Lepers had been at Oval. He had been the one tontell Scooter about the party. \"You'vengot to come! Otherwise, I'll be so bored. It's my brother'snparty and I can't stand most of the people who he has coming.\" \"Why?\"n asked Scooter as he lifted his drink \"What's your brother do?\" Devonnhadn't heard Garrett's response since the next band had taken thenstage and started to play. But it must have been enough to getnScooter's attention because he had insisted on going to the partynand dragging Devon along. \"Scootern- I'm tired. I just want to go home.\" Devon whined. \"Darlin'n- trust me. You'll thank me later.\" Scooter drawled. Sonthey had gone to some big McMansion in the Hills where Devon wasncurrently standing by the pool - bored. Scooter had become entrancednby some model/slash/actress and God only knows where Garrett hadngotten to. \"EmmanPeel, I presume\" intoned a deep voice behind her. Devonnspun around and gasped, \"You're you!\" Thentall blonde man smiled and said, \"Yeah - I'm Garrett's brother.n Don't hold that against me.\" \"Non- I mean, I didn't know you were Garrett's brother. God, it allnmakes sense now. He said he hated most of the people who came tonyour parties. God, I'm babbling.\" \"Don'tnworry - it's mostly charming.\" \"Cannwe start over? I'm Devon. Devon Thompson.\" \"Pleasednto meet you Devon Thompson. I'm Reese Worthington.\" \"Inknow. I hated your last movie. Except your part, of course. Wasnthat totally rude? I'm sorry. I'm just a little stunned to benmeeting Reese Worthington.\" Reesenlaughed. \"It's actually refreshing to not have someone kissingnmy ass. You can't possibly be an actress or in the industry, arenyou?\" \"No,nGod, no. At least not the movie industry. I work for a musicnmanagement company. We manage Garrett's band. That's hownGarrett and I met.\" Reesenlooked at Devon appreciatively, \"So you're that Devon. Garrettntalks a lot about you. But he didn't tell me how beautiful younare. My brother and I will be having words later.\" Devonnblushed. \"Garrett didn't tell me his brother was the famousnReese Worthington or that we would be coming to your party. We'llnbe having words as well.\" Reesengrinned sheepishly, \"My brother doesn't like to look like he'sntrading on my fame. It's one of his more redeeming features. SonDevon Thompson, want the nickel tour of my house?\" \"I'mnguessing it costs more than a nickel. But yeah - I'd love to.\" nDevon slipped her hand into the crook of Reese's proffered elbow. Thennext morning Devonnadjusted her cell phone headset as she poured herself a glass ofnorange juice, \"Gabby, I wish you could have been there. The wholenthing was so surreal. I met Reese Worthington. Reese Worthingtonntook me on a tour of his house.\" \"Sonwas he as cute in person as he is in the movies? By the way, I hatednhis last movie. Totally unbelievable. But he was good, though. Ohn- and tell me about his house. No detail is too small.\" Devonnsmiled. She missed Gabby who was currently in medical school atnStanford. It was the first time the two of them had really beennapart. But Gabby's dream had always been medical school and if itnmade Gabby happy, then Devon would have to make do with almost dailynphone calls. \"Cutern- way cuter. And his house is amazing. The requisite LA infinitynpool. The movie theater quality screening room. And it was all sontastefully done. Everything matched so well. Like something out ofnBetter Homes and Gardens. Totally not like Ritchie's house fornexample. I think Ritchie's idea of interior design is making surenhe's got matching anime posters on his walls.\" WhilenDevon couldn't see it, Gabby rolled her eyes. TypicalnDevon, Gabby thought, Every guy's gotta bencompared to Ritchie. \"Gabsn- he asked me to his movie premiere.\" \"OHnMY GOD! Devon - we've been on the phone for half an hour andnyou're just telling me this now! Way to bury the lead! Okay, okayn- let's discuss. What are you wearing?\" \"Gabbyn- it's not like it's a date or anything. I don't even know ifnI'm going.\" Devon flopped down on her couch. \"Ofncourse, it's a date! A movie premiere is a high profile event innLA - let alone a Reese Worthington movie premiere! And you arengoing, my friend. I don't care if I have to fly down there and putnyou in a dress myself. You are going.\" Gabby stated withnfinality. \"Indon't know. Things are really picking up at work. You know thatn5LeoRise have that tour coming up. The band needs me. Even if thisnis a date, I don't really know if I have time for a relationshipnright now.\" Gabbynsighed, \"Devon - I want you to listen to me very carefully. I lovenRitchie - you know that.\" \"Thisndoesn't have anything to do with Ritchie\" Devon interrupted. Liar said a small voice inside Devon's head. \"Sweetie,ndon't interrupt me. As I was saying, I love Ritchie. But for thenpast six years, all I've watched you do is wait for him. I'venseen you end it with guy after guy just because they have the badnluck not to be Richard Tressiak. Devon - you're in love with him. nYou need to tell him.\" \"I'mnnot in love with Ritchie. I'm not that starry-eyed 16-year-oldngirl.\" Devon shifted uncomfortably. \"Anyway, Ritchie doesn'tneven see me that way. We're just friends. That's all we'venever really been. That's all we'll ever be.\" \"Oh-kay\"n Gabby dragged out the two syllables. \"Fine - you're justnfriends. If that's really true, then prove it. Stop using him andnthe band as an excuse. A freakin' movie star just asked you out. nGO OUT WITH HIM, Devon. Have fun. Maybe it will turn intonsomething. Maybe it won't. But you owe it to yourself to give itna try. Sweetie, I gotta go -- I'm sorry. I'm going to be latenfor class.\" \"Yeahnsure. I'll talk to you later.\" \"Gonto this thing, Devon. Promise me.\" \"Okay,nokay. Have a good class. Call me later.\" Devon pushed the endncall button on her phone and stared thoughtfully out of her window. Whatnthe hell, she thought, it's only a movienpremiere.[Chapter 4] Chaptern4: The Big Premiere Author'snnote: I updated the last chapter to reflect Ritchie's full name asngiven in the movie. Special thanks to Maiqu for pointing out thatnRitchie's full name (and Scooter's too) is given in the movienwhen Ritchie, Mason and Scooter are being interrogated by Lincoln. Thanksnto everyone who has been reviewing. If you notice a discrepancynbetween something I write and what's in the movie, please point itnout to me in a review. There might be a real reason for thendiscrepancy. But it also might be (and more likely is) because Indidn't realize that particular detail was provided in the movie. Inam trying to stay as close to the \"canon\" of the movie as I can. Onnwith the story . . . . Dingndong rang Devon'sndoorbell. \"Coming\"nshe called as she pulled her hair into a messy pony tail and thennopened her door. \"Hey\"n Ritchie smiled as he stepped inside Devon's apartment, \"I'mnheaded to In-N-Out Burger and I thought you might want to join.\" nRitchie looked closer and took in the emerald green straplessnminidress and sparkling chandelier earrings that Devon was wearing. n\"But I'm guessing you'd be a bit overdressed. Where are younheaded?\" \"Movienpremiere - The Last Falconer. Can you zip me up? I'm having a bitnof trouble with this dress.\" Devon turned and presented hernhalf-zipped back to Ritchie. Ritchiengulped involuntarily. \"Yeah sure.\" He zipped her dress andnnoticed Devon's smooth bare back, his fingers itching to lingernlonger. But he made himself move his hands. \"So\"nhe made himself say nonchalantly \"Who are you going with? Hollisnor somebody?\" \"Nonactually.\" Devon turned back to face him. \"I'm going withnReese Worthington. I'm not sure but I think it could be a date.\" \"Backnup. Reese Worthington - the actor? The star of The Last Falconer? nThat guy?\" \"Yeahn- we met at that party I went to the other night with Garrett andnScooter. Didn't Scooter mention that we met him?\" Devon askednas she slipped into her heels. \"Okay - help me out. Hair up orndown?\" \"Down.n You always look better with it down. And Scooter mentioned you guysnwent to a party at this guy's house. He did not mention this guynasked you out. Why am I only hearing about this now? And why do younthink it might be a date.\" Devonnpulled her hair out of her pony tail and fluffed her hair with hernfingers. \"I'm not sure if it's a date, okay. We only justnmet. But I talked to Gabby and -\" \"Holdnup.\" Ritchie interrupted, \"Gabby knows! Gabby - who's in PalonAlto knows and you didn't tell me?! I thought I was your bestnfriend too.\" \"Lookn- it's not a big deal. I don't even know if it's really andate. I only think it might be a date because Gabby said so. Shensaid that it's a movie premiere and that's a big deal in LA andnso it must be a date. And you've been really busy with the album. nIt's not like I'm trying to hide it from you.\" Devon said asnshe turned from Ritchie to face the mirror and apply her lipstick. \"Uhnhuh. So Gabby thinks it's a date. But you don't.\" saidnRitchie, not wanting to admit that he thought that Gabby was right. \"I'mnnot sure. He's a movie star, right? He could be with anyone. nOkay - how do I look?\" Devon turned back to face Ritchie. \"Younlook great. You always look great in that shade of green.\" nRitchie admitted as he flashed back to the first time he saw Devon inngreen - dressed up as a peacock. Inremember how she looked sitting next to me with her eyes closed. Shenlooked so happy. I just had to kiss her . Devonnblushed prettily. \"Thanks Rich. I can't believe I'm sonnervous about this.\" She smiled at him and widened her eyes. \"What'snto be nervous about? It's just a movie premiere.\" \"Yeahn- of a Reese Worthington movie! And I'm going with ReesenWorthington! It's like I'm Cinderella or something.\" \"Andnwhat am I - your fairy godmother?\" Ritchie teased. \"Nonway - that's Scooter! You're one of the singing mice.\" Devonnteased back. \"Ansinging mouse! That's what you're casting me as? Woman - younwound me!\" Ritchie clutched his chest and pretended to staggernback. Devonngiggled. Then the doorbell rang. \"Oh God! It must be him!\" \"CuenPrince Charming.\" muttered Ritchie unenthusiastically as Devonnwalked to the door and opened it. \"Hey\"n Reese took off his sunglasses and looked Devon up and downnappreciatively. \"You look incredible.\" \"Thanks.n You look great too. Reese - I'd like you to meet one of my bestnfriends - Ritchie Tressiak.\" \"Heyn- it's great to meet you. I love your sound.\" Reese stuck outnhis hand. \"Thanks.\"n Ritchie said curtly as he briefly shook Reese's hand. \"Congratsnon the movie.\" \"Yeahn- hope it does okay. Dev - I think you ought put your hair up. It'snkind of hot outside. You'll be more comfortable.\" \"Okayn- sure. Good thinking. I'll be right back.\" Devon walked backnto her bedroom.\" \"So\"n Reese stuck his hands in his pockets and looked at Ritchie. \"Havenyou known Dev long?\" \"Yeahn- I've known Dev-on since she was 16.\" Ritchie placed added emphasis on the twonsyllables. Who the hellndoes this guy think he is calling her by a nickname? He just metnher . \"Ohnreally.\" Reese said noncommittantly. \"That's quite a whilenthen.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Okayn- I'm ready.\" Devon emerged from the bedroom with her hair up innan elegant chignon.\" \"Great.\"n Reese smiled. \"We should get going then. Rich - it was nice tonmeet you.\" \"Inprefer Ritchie actually. But great to meet you.\" Ritchie halfnsmiled briefly. \"Ritchien- do you mind locking up behind us?\" Devon put a hand on Ritchie'snshoulder and looked at him. What'sngoing on ?Her eyes seemed to bensaying. \"Nonproblem. Have a great time.\" Ritchie pulled Devon into a quicknhug. Asnthe door closed behind Devon and Reese, Ritchie muttered \"It wasnbetter down.\" Twondays later Ritchienwalked into the rehearsal studio and saw three of his bandmatesnhuddled together. \"What's going on\" he asked. \"Nothing.\"n said Scooter as he whipped a magazine behind his back. \"Not anthing. What's going on with you?\" \"Nothing.n What have you got behind your back?\" Ritchie asked as he pickednup his guitar. \"Thisn- just one of those gossips mags.\" Scooter scoffed as he tried toncasually toss the magazine aside. \"Indidn't know you were into those things.\" Ritchie said as hentuned the strings on his guitar. \"I'mnnot. Sometimes Danielle is in them because of that idiot boy toy shenmarried.\" \"Notnstill pining after your ex, are you?\" asked a grinning Ritchie. \"Don'tnbe ridiculous. But we did used to be married. I like to know what'sngoing on.\" \"Welln- I hear she's getting divorced.\" Mason added. \"Reallyn- what have you heard?\" Scooter whipped around to stare at Mason. Justnthen Nikolai walked in carrying the same gossip magazine that Scooternhad just tossed. \"Guys - Devon has her picture in this paper. Shenlooks very pretty.\" \"Givenme that\" Ritchie snatched the magazine from Nikolai's hands. nRitchie clenched his jaw as he looked at the picture of a smilingnDevon holding hands with Reese as they walked down the red carpet. Thencaption under the picture read: Looksnlike Reese has found a new leading lady. Are they serious? Onlyntime will tell.[Chapter 5] Chaptern5: There when she needed him most Author'snnote: Since the movie filmed in Utah, I thought I'd make Devonnfrom Utah. I don't recall the film saying where her hometown isnlocated. But if I'm wrong, let me know. \"HeynHolly\" Devon said as she walked down into Hollis's office, peckednhim on the cheek, and sat down on the sofa next to him, \"you wantednto see me?\" \"Heynsweetie.\" Hollis smiled at her. \"I wanted to talk about wherenwe are with the tour. I think we've got the West Coast citiesnnailed down. But where are we on the East Coast venues?\" Devonnopened her folder and proceeded to update Hollis on the progress withnthe concert venues in New York, New Jersey and other East Coastnstates. Devonnhad started interning for Hollis's company during her junior yearnat college at Ritchie's suggestion. When Ritchie had suggested it,nDevon had thought it would be a cool temporary gig - a fun way tonhang out with the band while earning college credit at the same time.n But as her internship progressed, she realized that she loved beingnin music management. It was a field that seemed to combine all thenthings that she loved and was good at - music, tenacity,nassertiveness, organization, and an ability to get other people to donwhat she wanted them to do. Andnas she came to work more closely with Hollis, she realized that hencared about 5LeoRise and cared very deeply. She saw how protectivenhe was of the band and how he defended them to label. Devon evennrealized that Hollis's ill-conceived idea years ago to have Ritchienlip sync songs in concert was motivated by a real concern for and andesire to keep Ritchie in the band, no matter the cost. Shenhad even come to see Hollis as a surrogate father figure, especiallynin light of what had occurred at the end of her junior year. ** Flashbacknto the day after Devon finished her last final exam for her juniornyear of college** \"Finally!n I'm done.\" Devon flopped down dramatically on Ritchie'sncouch. \"Good.n Cause all of your stressing was beginning to stress me out.\" nRitchie said as he lifted her legs, sat down and then put her legs onnhis lap. \"GoodnLord - what now?\" Devon muttered as her she reached for hernringing cell phone. \"Hello. Slow down, Danielle - what happened? nOh my god. Oh my god.\" Ritchie'snbrows knit together and he looked at Devon with increasing concern asnshe swung her feet to the floor and her face lost color. \"Devon -nwhat's wrong? What happened?\" \"I'mnon the next flight, Danielle. I'll be home soon. I love you too. nTell mom I love her.\" Devon didn't notice but Ritchie did noticenthat tears were streaming down Devon's face. Ritchie took Devon'snhand, \"What? Tell me what happened?\" \"Myndad. He had a heart attack. He died.\" Devon put her hand to hernmouth and looked at Ritchie horrified, as if she was aghast the wordsnhad left her mouth. Then her face crumpled and she began to cry. Ritchientook Devon into her arms and just held her for a few long minutes. nDevon then sat up and wiped her face with her hands. \"Whatndo you need? Tell me what you want me to do?\" Ritchie asked Devonnintently. \"Inneed to go home. I need to get home.\" Devon whispered. \"Notna problem. I'll have Kevin buy you a ticket on the next flightnout.\" Ritchie said firmly as he picked up his cell phone to callnHollis's assistant Kevin. Afterna brief conversation with Kevin, Ritchie then told Devon, \"Okaynwe're both first class on the next flight to Salt Lake City. Wenhave a couple of hours. Let me pack a bag real quick. Then we'llngo to your apartment and get your stuff and then go to the airport.\" Devonnlooked at Ritchie bewilderingly, \"You're coming with me.\" Ritchiensaid gently, \"Of course I am. You're not getting on thatnairplane alone. And Gabby already left two days ago right? So it'snjust you and me, then.\" Devonnclosed her eyes, \"Gabby. She loved my dad too.\" \"I'llncall her. Let her know.\" Ritchie said as he stood up. \"Justngive me a few minutes and we'll leave soon, okay?\" \"Okay.\"n Devon answered, even though nothing felt okay. Thendays and three months that followed took on a surreal quality. nLooking back, Devon could hardly remember or distinguish one day fromnthe next. The only good thing that had come from the wholenexperience was a new sense of closeness with Danielle as they bothnleaned on each other - a lot. Thatnand realizing that Ritchie was there when she needed him most. Ritchienhad come out with Devon to Utah and had in fact stayed the summer -nrenting a house down the street from Devon's. It was Ritchie andnGabby who had stayed home with Devon when she needed it, left hernalone when she needed it, and gently pushed her to do socialnactivities when she needed it. Onlynyears later did Devon learn that Ritchie had risked the wrath of thenlabel by staying the summer in Utah with her rather than spend thensummer in the studio in LA. And only years later did Devon learnnthat it was Hollis and the rest of the band that had supported andnprotected Ritchie's decision. **Flashforwardnto Hollis's office** \"Wellnthat sounds great. Devon - I'm really proud of your progress withnplanning this tour.\" \"Thanks,nHolly. It's been a lot of fun.\" \"Innfact, I'm thinking about having you fly solo as tour manager fornsome of these cities.\" \"Hollisn- do not joke about that. You know how much I want that.\" Devonnlooked at him with deadly earnestness. \"Youngnlady - you know I don't joke about touring. I'm serious. You'venbeen doing a stellar job on this tour, on top of yournresponsibilities to the other bands. You've earned this.\" \"Hollyn- you're the best\" Devon hugged him, \"All right - whichncities? You should let me have Chicago. And Denver. And you havento let me do Salt Lake.\" \"Slowndown, slugger. We'll discuss later. I've got to get to anothernmeeting.\" Hollis stood up and reached for his coat. \"And youngnlady, when am I meeting this guy I keep hearing about? The movienstar? I keep seeing your picture with this guy in US Weekly for thenpast seven months.\" \"Soonn- in fact, Reese wants to throw a big party in a couple of weeks. nYou've got to come.\" \"Soundsnlovely. Let me know when and I'll be sure to be there. Oh andnDevon - what's up with the new look and hair? Is it the movienstar's idea?\" Devonntouched her upswept hair self-consciously, \"What you think I can'tndecide to make a change on my own?\" \"Sweetien- I don't mean anything by it. It's just such a big change, it'snhard not to notice. All the updone hair and black clothing and all. nWhen you used to be so big into color.\" \"I'mntrying to look more professional. I thought you of all people wouldnapprove.\" Devon retorted. \"Whatevernmakes you happy, sweetie\" Hollis laughed. \"All right -- I'mnoff to the label. I'll talk to you tomorrow.\" Hollis kissednDevon on the cheek and walked out of the office. Devonnsank back slowly to the couch and grinned. Ohnmy god. Solo tour manager. I've got to tell Ritchie. And Gabby. nAnd Scooter. God - everybody! Itnwasn't until the next day that Devon thought to tell Reese. \"Honey,nthat sounds like an amazing opportunity for the future.\" Reesensaid before forking his salad and putting the forkful in his mouth. \"Whatndo you mean - the future?\" Devon asked. \"It'snjust that this tour is going to be happening when I'm filming mynnext movie. I thought we agreed that you were going to move to thenlocation so we can be together.\" \"Reesen- I didn't agree to anything. You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that you'd be innAustralia filming and that we should try to see each other as much asnpossible. You never said anything about me moving out there.\" \"Honeyn- if you're on this North American tour with some boy band and I'mnon a totally different continent, when are we going to get to seeneach other?\" \"They'rennot a boy band .n They are really talented musicians. Reese - this my job. This isnwhat I do. I've worked really hard for this and I've earnednthis.\" Devon said with conviction. \"Devonn- I know this is important to you.\" Reese covered her hand withnhis own and looked into her eyes. \"But you're important to me. nYou and me - us together - that's important to me. Isn't thatnimportant to you? \"Ofncourse it is. It just feels like you're making me choose. And Indon't like it.\" Devon frowned. \"Don'tnpout - it'll give you wrinkles.\" Reese smiled. \"Look we don'tnhave to talk about this now. Just think about it, okay.\" \"Okay\"nDevon said skeptically. He'snjust trying to keep us together ,nshe told herself. Even as part of her couldn't help but feel likenReese's concern was feeling more and more like control.[Chapter 6] Chaptern6: Just no to caramel Author'snnote: The movie mentioned that Mason, Scooter, and Ritchie werendiscovered by Hollis in Orlando. So I decided to make Ritchie fromnFlorida. \"Duden- I hate this song. Change the station.\" Mason moaned from thenbackseat of Ritchie's car. \"Toonbad, sucka. I called shotgun and that means I get to control thenradio station.\" Scooter smiled. \"Inthought the driver got to control the radio station.\" Ritchienpointed out as he maneuvered his car from the highway onto the exitnramp. \"Nonway. That'll just distract you from driving. Safety first. Rightn- Doctor Davis?\" Scooter called back to Gabby. \"I'mnnot a doctor yet, Scooter. And I'm not getting in the middle ofnthis.\" Gabby said definitively.\" \"SonGabs - how's med school treating you?\" Ritchie asked. \"It'sngreat. And by great, I mean it's a ton of work and I never get anfull night's sleep. But I love my professors and I've met somenreally great people - like my lab partner Jeff that I was telling younguys about earlier.\" Gabby grew more and more animated. \"Sonwho is this Jeff character and why are you always talking about him?\"n Mason frowned at Gabby. Ritchienturned to Scooter and grinned briefly. Typical Mason/Gabbyninteraction, the grin seemed to say. No one knew exactly what thenstatus of Mason's and Gabby's relationship was - not even Devon. nMason and Gabby were uncharacteristically vague about the wholenthing. But everyone noticed that Mason got a bit jealous whenevernGabby brought up Jeff and that Gabby grew a foul temper when Masonndidn't call enough. \"SonI can't believe I finally get to meet Reese Worthington! And seenhis house too! Does anybody know what kind of food we'll bengetting at this party?\" Gabby changed the subject. \"KnowingnDevon, I'm sure we'll have plenty of key lime pie.\" Ritchienproclaimed. \"Andnno caramel.\" Scooter added. ** Flashbacknto two years ago** \"Sonthis is the famous Annie's Diner, huh?\" Devon looked around thenrestaurant. \"It's cute.\" \"Butnwait until you try their specialty - key lime pie. Best key lime pienin Key West. Hell - best key lime pie in all of Florida.\" Ritchienproclaimed and leaned back in the booth. Then, abruptly, he leanednforward, \"Listen, Dev, I really want to thank you for coming downnwith me and helping out with my grandma while she's been sick. Shenand my mom are all the family I've got.\" \"Ofncourse I came. After the way you were there for me when my dad died.n I owe you this much at least.\" Devon smiled ruefully. \"Youndon't owe me anything. We're best friends. We're there forneach other. That's what we do.\" Ritchie took Devon's hand andnheld it, only letting go when the waitress came and took their ordern- one slice of key lime pie and two forks. \"Rich,ncan I ask you a question.\" Devon asked. \"Asknaway.\" Ritchie took a sip from his water glass. \"Donyou ever think about trying to find your dad?\" Devon nervouslyntwisted her paper napkin, unsure how Ritchie would react to hernquestion. \"Myndad. Huh. I haven't thought about him in a while. Honestly -nno.\" Ritchie tried to say nonchalantly. \"He'snyour family though, Ritchie.\" Devon said gently. \"Devonn- he stopped being my family when I was six years old and he walkednout on me and my mom. And I haven't heard from him since. Younknow, it's funny - when 5LeoRise first started to get famous and Instarted getting press attention, I used to think that my dad wouldntry to contact me. You know, hit me up for money or something likenthat. I used to imagine how I would laugh in his face. But then hennever did get in touch with me. And now I don't want him to. AndnI don't want to try to find him. And I don't miss him.\" nRitchie looked at Devon and shrugged. Devonnalmost believed Ritchie when he said he didn't miss his father. nBut she saw the tight set of Ritchie's shoulders and she knewnRitchie better. Thisntime, Devon reached out and took Ritchie's hand. \"You'renwrong, you know. Your mom and your grandma aren't the only familynyou have. At least if you define family as the people who love you.\" Ritchienjust looked at his and Devon's intertwined hands and neither saidnanything until the waitress came back with the slice of key lime pienand two forks. Devonnspeared some pie onto her fork and took a bite. \"Oh my god! Thisnis incredible! And I don't even like pie that much!\" \"Intold you - best in Florida. Hell -- best in the whole country!\" nRitchie smiled widely. \"Inwill never doubt you about pie again.\" Devon said solemnly. \"Thatnis a wise move on your part, Thompson. 'Cause I know my pies.\" nRitchie stated. \"Justnno pies with caramel.\" Devon said warningly. \"Inknow. I know. You hate caramel.\" Ritchie rolled his eyes. \"Andnby the way, how can you hate caramel? It's gooey and sugary. It'snlike saying you hate chocolate.\" \"Indon't have a problem with chocolate. But caramel is all sticky andnit gets in your teeth. Just no. Just no to caramel.\" Devon shooknher head. \"Weirdo\"n Ritchie muttered. \"Freak\"n Devon retorted. Thennthey both grinned at each other and proceeded to eat the rest of thenpie. ** Flashforwardnto inside Ritchie's car** \"Herenwe are. Casa de Worthington.\" Scooter said as Ritchie stopped thencar. \"God,nit's gorgeous. I can't wait to see inside.\" Gabby bounded outnof the car. \"Yeahn- can't hardly wait.\" Ritchie said without enthusiasm. Mason'snand Scooter's eyes met in the rear view mirror. Both had noticedntheir friend's increasing jealousy and irritation over Devon'snrelationship with Reese. And both hoped this party would be dramanfree. Itnwould turn out to be a vain hope.[Chapter 7] Chaptern7: I have a surprise for you Sonfar, so good . Devonnthought as she surveyed the guests at the party. She spotted Hollisntalking to KK and Nik. She waved at her mom and her sister, both ofnwhom had arrived a couple of days ago. Devon had offered to put bothnof them up at her place but was secretly relieved when Danielle hadnannounced that she had booked herself and their mother at the FournSeasons. Devon loved her mom and her sister but having them bothnstay at her modest two-bedroom apartment would have been a bit much. Devonnsmiled as she thought about Danielle. Although she and Danielle werena lot closer than they had been when Devon was in high school,nDanielle was still a lot to handle. Basically, Danielle stillnexpected the world to revolve around her. Having been married tonScooter (a rock star) and Ben (a fashion model) had only inflatednDanielle's ego. Currently, Danielle was on husband number three -nCarlos, a supposedly aspiring DJ who was also heir to his father'sncomputer empire. Devon had noticed that Carlos had not made the tripnfrom New York City with Danielle and that Danielle rarely spoke aboutnCarlos since she had arrived. Sometimes Devon worried about hernsister finding lasting happiness and wondered whether Danielle wouldnhave been better off trying to make it work with Scooter. Speakingnof which - Devon spotted Danielle talking to -- or more accurately,nflirting with -- Scooter, whom Danielle called \"her favoritenex-husband.\" Devonnsighed, turned and saw Gabby, Mason and Ritchie together. Just asnDevon was about to walk over to them, Reese appeared in front of her.n \"Honey,\" he said as he lightly kissed her on the lips, \"Have Inmentioned how incredible you look?\" Reese looked over Devon'snlittle black dress and upswept hair with approval. \"Notnin the last thirty minutes.\" Devon smiled and kissed him again. \"Inhave a surprise for you,\" Reese smiled and turned to face thenroomful of guests. \"Everybody - could I have your attention?\" Onceneveryone quieted down, Reese continued, \"I want to thank everyonenfor coming. Especially Devon's mom Val for flying down here andnDanielle for making the cross-country journey. I'm so glad youncould all be here for this.\" Reese then turned back to Devon andngot down on one knee. \"Ohnmy god. Reese - what are you doing?\" Devon put her hands to hernmouth as a collective gasp went through the room. \"DevonnLissette Thompson - you are the most incredible woman I have evernmet. You're beautiful, smart and funny. You try to take care ofneveryone around you. And you deserve to have someone who wants tontake care of you for the rest of your life. And I want to be thatnperson. Devon, I love you so much. Will you marry me?\" Reesentook out a small jewelry box from his pants pocket and opened it tonreveal and large diamond ring which he then slipped onto Devon'snleft ring finger. Devonnlooked into Reese's steady eyes which were locked onto hers andnfound herself saying, \"Yes.\" Thenroom erupted in applause as Reese stood up and kissed Devon. Exceptnfor one man who stood silently stunned. Ritchienturned and made his way out of the room, as if in a daze, and headednoutside to the pool. His throat tight and his stomach in knots, allnhe could think was, Inhave to get out of here. This isn't happening. Author'snnote: There's more that's going to happen at this party so stayntuned. Thanks for the continued reviews. I really appreciate them. nKeep them coming! To Cydney-Sumiyen- Banana cream pie is Ritchie's favorite. So I thought it madensense and symmetry to have him introduce Devon to another kind of pienwhich would become her favorite.[Chapter 8] Chaptern8: He doesn't even know you \"Heyn- I'm glad you're still here. I've been looking for youneverywhere. I thought you might have left.\" Devon frowned as shenwalked toward the edge of the pool where Ritchie stood. \"Nopen-- still here.\" Ritchie took a deep breathe and tried to calm hisnrioting emotions. He turned to face Devon with what he hoped was ansincere-looking smile on his face. \"So congratulations, then. Younseemed pretty surprised.\" \"Totally.n I had no idea that he was thinking along these lines.\" Devonnshook her head in wonderment. \"Butnthis is what you want, right?\" Ritchie asked intently. Devonnlooked at him with wide eyes. \"Of course. He loves me.\" \"Andnyou love him?\" Ritchie whispered the question, as if it was hardnto push the words out of his mouth. \"Whynwouldn't I? He's amazing. He's so talented and he wants to benwith me. He even wants me to move with him to Australia in threenmonths when he goes on location for his next movie.\" Devon took anfew steps away from Ritchie and sat down on a lounge chair by thenpool. \"Waitna minute - he wants you to move to Australia in three months? Butnthe tour starts then. How long would you have to be in Australia?\"n Ritchie approached Devon. \"Indon't know. He thinks filming would take probably six months.\" nDevon didn't look at Ritchie but looked instead at the water. \"6nmonths?! You'd miss the entire tour!\" Ritchie exclaimed. \"Look,nnothing's been decided. I told him about the tour and Hollisnsaying that I might be solo tour manager for some of the cities. Andnthen Reese brought up that he'd be in Australia and he wants usntogether --\" Devon started to explain but Ritchie interrupted. \"Sonyou tell him about how your career is taking offnand he demands that you drop it to play housewife in Australia?! nJesus Christ, Devon! How much of yourself are you going tonsacrifice to this guy?! For God's sake, he doesn't even knownyou!\" Ritchie exploded. \"Whatnthe hell are you talking about!\" Devon demanded as she stood upnand stalked over to Ritchie so that she was inches away from him. \"I'mntalking about the fact that this guy wants you to put your career onnhold for six months while he promotes his. And then all of a suddennhe proposes! I'm talking about how you never wear your hair downnanymore. I'm talking about how all you seem to wear lately isnblack or some other neutral, boring shade. I'm talking about hownit's your goddamn party and they're serving creme caramel. Andnyou hate caramel! Where are you in this relationship, Devon? Or is it all just about him ?\"n Ritchie swept his arms around as if to encompass Reese's entirenhouse. \"Younhave no right to say this crap to me! You don't know anythingnabout me and Reese! He makes me happy! He just proposed to me fornGod's sake! And if you really were my friend, you would want me tonbe happy!\" Devon's face crumpled and she started to cry. \"Devon,nI --\" Ritchie reached out his hand to try to touch her. \"Don't.\"n Devon stepped back. \"I think you should go.\" \"Devon,nlet's just talk about this, please.\" Ritchie started to say. \"No\"n Devon said quietly as she turned away from him. \"Just go,nRitchie. Please, just go.\" Ritchienlooked at Devon's rigid back for a long moment before turning andnwalking away. Devonncollapsed into the nearby lounge chair and cried silently into hernhands. \"Dev-on,nReese is looking for you.\" Nikolai walked over to Devon. When shenlifted her tear-stained face to him, Nikolai said nothing but took anclean handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to her. She smilednat him gratefully. \"Dev-on,nI will tell Reese that I could not find you. Then I will sneak younto the upstairs bathroom and you can repair yourself before you seenReese.\" Nikolai proclaimed. \"Goodnplan.\" Devon smiled a watery smile. Nikolai gave a brief, butnelegant bow, before turning to go back into the house. He stoppednafter a few steps, turned around, walked to Devon and enveloped hernin a strong hug. \"It will be all right, Dev-on. Mama Fortunatantold me so.\" Devonncouldn't help but give a brief laugh. \"Nik, I didn't know younwere still seeing her. I hope Mama Fortunata is right, though.\" nShe tried to smile but couldn't quite manage it. \"Younwill see, Dev-on. You will see.\" Nik said as he gave her back anreassuring pat before releasing her. Backnin the house \"Gabsn- can you and Mason and Scooter get a ride back with somebody? Inreally need to get out of here.\" Desperation tinged Ritchie'snvoice as he ran his hand through his hair. Gabbynsaw a pain in Ritchie's eyes that she had never seen before. \"Richn- what happened? Did Devon find you?\" \"Yeah.\"n Ritchie gave a short, humorless laugh. \"Although I'm sure she'snwishing she hadn't.\" \"Ritchien- tell me what happened.\" Gabby put her hand on his shoulder andnfocused on him intently. Ritchienonly shook his head, wordlessly. \"I really messed up Gabby. And Indon't know if she'll forgive me.\" \"Ritchie\"n Gabby's voice was filled with concern for her friend. \"Don'tnworry about me, Gabs. I just gotta get out of here. But you shouldnfind Devon. She probably really needs you right about now.\" nRitchie half-smiled and gave Gabby's shoulder a squeeze before henwalked quickly away.[Chapter 9] Chaptern9: Time to get creative Hendoesn't know anything about me and Reese. How dare he?! Devon fumed and started to run even faster. \"Heyn- Dev! Maybe we can take a breather. We've covered five milesnalready.\" KK panted slightly behind her. \"Ohngosh, KK! Of course.\" Devon slowed down and eventually stopped,nallowing KK to catch up to her. \"Somethingngoing on Dev?\" KK asked as he walked in a small circle. \"Whatndo you mean?\" Devon asked nervously. \"It'snjust that you've been running like something's chasing you ornlike you're trying to get away from something.\" KK explained. n\"So is there something going on?\" Devonnsighed. \"K - do you think I'm making a mistake marrying Reese?\" \"Whynare you asking?\" KK raised an eyebrow. \"Ritchienbasically accused me of giving up my identity to be with Reese. Andnit made me so mad! I'm still not even talking to him yet! It'sncrazy. He's crazy!\" Devon cried out. \"Andnyet you're still asking me if you're making a mistake by marryingnReese?\" KK asked gingerly. \"Injust don't want to make a mistake. I mean - marriage is supposednto be forever, right?\" Devon looked at him pleadingly. \"Devon,nyou know I can't tell you if you're making a mistake. Only younknow that. I know that Ritchie cares about you a lot. We all do,nDevon. But it doesn't matter what Ritchie thinks or what I thinknabout your relationship. It only matters what you think. It onlynmatters that you love him.\" KK said gently. \"Ifnyou had asked me 2 days ago whether I love Reese, I would have saidnyes in a heartbeat. But I don't know - I feel so confused evernsince Reese proposed. And that damn party. And all the stuff thatnRitchie said! And no one in my life seems to like him.\" Devon putnup a hand as KK opened his mouth and appeared to want to startntalking, \"I know that you guys have been unfailingly polite. nEveryone's been so polite. Gabby. My mom. Danielle. Hollis. nBut I can tell. No one really likes him.\" \"Devon,nwe obviously don't know him like you do. Most of us of just metnhim at that party and then, poof! He proposed to you. It's a lotnfor us to take in all at once. But if he's what you want, then I'mngoing to be here for you. We're all going to be here for you. nEspecially Ritchie. You know that.\" KK reminded her. \"DonI really, KK? You should have heard what he said to me. And thenworst part of it is, I feel like I can't get his words out of mynhead. Even when I'm with Reese.\" Danielle looked skyward. \"Indon't know what to do.\" \"Thenheart wants what the heart wants. Remember - you told me that when Incame out a couple of years ago?\" KK smiled at her. \"Inremember. You were so brave.\" Devon smiled. \"Younlove who you love. If who you love is Reese, then to hell with whatnanybody thinks, even Ritchie. But Devon, you have to decide whethernthe reason that you can't get Ritchie's words out of your head isnbecause he has a point. I don't know. Only you can know.\" KKncocked his head to the side and then straightened it. \"Let's gonback.\" Devonnfollowed KK back to his house where she had left her car. As she putnher running shoes in the trunk of her car and changed into flipnflops, one phrase kept reverberating in her head. Thenheart wants what the heart wants . Ritchie'snhouse Ritchienreluctantly pushed himself off of his couch as it became clear thatnwhoever was leaning on his doorbell was not going away. \"WHAT!\"n He snapped as he opened his door. \"Well,nhello sunshine. Nice to see you too.\" Danielle said snappily asnshe whipped off her designer sunglasses. \"Aren't you going toninvite me in?\" \"DonI have a choice in the matter?\" Ritchie asked wearily. \"Notnreally.\" Danielle breezed as she gently pushed Ritchie aside andnwalked into the house. Ritchie rolled his eyes and closed the doornbefore following the scent of Danielle's very expensive perfumeninto his living room. AsnRitchie walked to the bar and poured out some Scotch into a glass, henasked, \"What do you want, Danielle?\" \"Dude!n It's only 10 o'clock. Isn't it a little early for the hardnstuff?\" Danielle asked as she sat down on the couch and arrangednher skirt around her. \"Whatnare you - my mother? I repeat - what do you want?\" Ritchie took answig from his glass. \"Pournme a drink first, will you?\" Danielle demanded. \"Inthought it was a little early to be hitting the hard stuff.\" nRitchie smirked. \"Whatnare you - my mother? I'll have what you're having.\" Danielle replied. nRitchie got Danielle her drink and handed it to her. Then he satndown in the overstuffed chair next to the couch and looked back atnher. \"So,nRitchie - are you planning on doing anything about this thing betweennyou and my sister? Or are you just going to stand back and let hernmake the biggest mistake of her life?\" Danielle stared back atnRitchie. \"Shenwon't talk to me. She won't return my phone calls. Texting - nonresponse. All other forms of communication - no response.\" nRitchie listed his efforts. \"So what's your bright idea? Andnyou think she's making a mistake too?!\" \"Ofncourse, I do. Devon never lets anyone tell her what to do. Not evennme. But she lets this Reese guy dictate what she wears and what sheneats. Please.\" Danielle eyed Ritchie for a moment, took a sipnfrom her glass, and then placed the glass on the coffee table. n\"Ritchie, do you understand why Devon is marrying this Worthingtonnfellow?\" \"I'mnguessing him being a world renowned movie star isn't a turnoff.\" nRitchie said. \"Younknow that's not it. That's not important to Devon.\" Daniellenshook her head. \"ThennI guess she must love him.\" Ritchie's jaw clenched and he tooknanother swig of Scotch. \"Indon't think that's it either.\" Danielle said thoughtfully. n\"Here's what I think is going on. You remember how much Devonnloved our dad. How broken up she was when he died?\" \"Ofncourse, I remember that.\" Ritchie replied. \"Ourndad loved Devon and me. We never doubted it. But he and Devon hadnsomething special. She was his favorite.\" Danielle explained. nRitchie was more than a little surprised at Danielle's even tone,nwhich betrayed no hint of jealously or bitterness, and raised anneyebrow at her. Asnif guessing what Ritchie was thinking, Danielle continued, \"Ofncourse, I had Dad wrapped around my finger. He never said no to me. nBut I had to work at it. Throw a tantrum here. Bat an eyelash orntwo there. But with Devon - he just always knew what she needed. nSometimes even before she did. He just knew how to take care of her.n She misses that in her life. And Reese offers her that. Somebodynwho'll take care of her.\" \"Shenhas that. I look out for her. We all do.\" Ritchie was obviouslynreferring to his bandmates. Daniellenlooked at Ritchie in disbelief. \" Comenon . She works for you.n She takes care of you. You guys may care for her but if anybody isndoing any taking care of anyone, it's her. Christ, Tressiak, younhaven't even done anything in years about the fact that she'snbeen in love with you since she was 16. And I'm pretty sure you'venbeen in love with her for just as long. Why have you been such ancoward anyway?\" Ritchienwanted to deny everything that Danielle had just said. He wasn't ancoward. He wasn't in love with Devon. But as he opened his mouth,nhe realized that she was right. He was in love with Devon - had beennfor years. And for years, he had been afraid to admit it. Ritchienlooked down at his glass for a long moment before looking up andnsaying, \"I don't know, really. I guess I've been afraid to letnanybody in. I saw what my dad leaving did to my mom. I guess I wasnafraid of that happening to me.\" \"Hatento break this to you, Ritchie, but it's happening now. And it'sngoing to keep on happening unless you do something to stop thisntrain.\" Danielle took another sip from her glass. Ritchienleaned forward, serious and intent. \"What do I do, Danielle? Howndo I convince her not to marry this guy? She won't talk to me ornsee me.\" \"You'renthe artist - it's time to get creative.\" Danielle said,nseemingly dismissively. As she looked at Ritchie's crestfallennexpression, she seemed to relent. \"Okay - you have eight hours. nAt 6 o'clock, you are going to text me the address of where younwant me to get Devon to be. And I'll get her there. The rest isnup to you.\" Danielle put her drink down and stood up. Asnshe walked towards the door, Ritchie followed behind and said, \"Sonyou'll get her there?\" Daniellenturned and said, \"I'll get her there. But you better make itngood. And Ritchie - if you hurt my sister, you will discover newnmeaning to the word pain. Got it?\" \"Yeah,nDanielle, I got it.\" Ritchie agreed. \"Good.\"n Danielle put her sunglasses on and walked out the door. Getncreative. Ritchienthought. Then he smiled.[Chapter 10] Chaptern10: The Kidnapping Devonngot out of the black Lincoln town car and closed the door. Beforenshe could do anything, the car then drove away. Devon looked at thenunassuming house before her that was nestled in the heart of a quiet,nmiddle class suburb of Los Angeles. She would never in a millionnyears have figured that this was the kind of house that Daniellenmight be considering purchasing. But then again, Danielle wasnnothing if not unpredictable. Funnyn- it kind of looks like my old house in Utah. Devon thought as she walked up the pathway and knocked on the door. nAs she rapped on the door, the unlocked door flew open. Devon walkednthrough the door and saw a wooden table in the entranceway. A cardnaddressed to her was on the table. Devonn- go to the basement. 2nd door on the left. I'll be there. Can'tnwait to hear what you think of the place! Danielle Followingninstructions, Devon opened the second door on the left and walkedndown the stairs to the basement. As she reached the bottom of thenstairs, she looked around the basement in amazement. It looked likenthe basement in her old house in Utah - complete with old toys andntwinkling Christmas lights. Justnthen, the door at the top of the stairs slammed shut. Devon rannquickly up the stairs and tried the door knob. Locked. Innfrustration, Devon slammed at the door. \"You'rennot going to be able to break the door down, you know.\" A familiarnvoice drifts up from the bottom of the stairs. Devonnwhirled around. \"You! Where's Danielle?\" \"Asnyou can see, Danielle is not here.\" Ritchie said evenly. \"What'sngoing on here, Ritchie?\" Devon demanded as she descended thenstairs and came face to face with him. \"Where's Danielle? Andnhow did you get in here?\" \"AsnI said, Danielle is not here. And this house is kind of on loan tonme.\" Ritchie walked over to a table and two chairs and sat down innone. He patted the other chair and looked at Devon. Reluctantly,nshe walked over and sat down. \"Inwant to tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was this scarednteenager who was pretending to be a rock star but who knew he was anfake. He tried to hide his fear from everyone around him by being andick to almost everyone he met - including his two biggest fans.\" nRitchie began. \"Inknow this story, Ritchie. I lived it too,\" Devon snapped. \"Justnlet me finish.\" Ritchie said quietly. His eyes were pleading andnfull of some other emotion that Devon was afraid to name. \"Okay,\"nshe said. \"Continue.\" \"Butnthese two fans wouldn't give up. So they saw through his front. nThey helped him through his fear. One of these fans was a beautifulnblonde. She believed in this scared teenager so much that,neventually, he believed in himself. And he became a rock star fornreal, and not just pretend. And it was all due to moment when anbeautiful girl in a gorgeous and ridiculous peacock costume sat nextnto him and gave him the power to believe in himself.\" Ritchienwhispered, \"Close your eyes, Devon.\" \"Ritchie\"n Devon said warningly. \"Please.n Devon. Please.\" Ritchie's voice was gentle and bittersweet. nDevon looked at Ritchie's eyes - still full of that namelessnemotion - and then closed her own. Ritchientook a deep breath. Breathenand believe . He thenntook the guitar out of the case that was lying beneath the table andnbegan to play the familiar song. Lovenat first sight. Never thought it could happen to me. Butnyou made me believe. Devonnstarted mouthing the lyrics. She couldn't help herself. AsnRitchie finished the song and the last notes of the guitar died away,nDevon felt herself waiting for the inevitable kiss. But none came. nDisappointed, she opened her eyes. And found Ritchie looking at hernas if his life depended upon it. \"Inlove you, Devon. I have for years. And I can't let you marry him.n So you're not going anywhere until you see that.\" Ritchie saidnvery calmly. \"You'venkidnapped me?!\" Shocked, Devon enunciated every syllable verynclearly, as if making sure there was no misunderstanding. \"Youndid the same thing to me.\" Ritchie pointed out. \"Inwas in high school! And that was years ago! We're adults now. Atnleast, you're supposed to be!\" Devon shot out of her chair andnwalked back and forth in front of Ritchie. \"I can't believe you!n Are you nuts?\" \"Inlove you. I'm not letting you go.\" Ritchie spoke determinedly. \"Stopnsaying that!\" Devon cried out in frustration. \"You don't meannit.\" \"Don'tntell me how I'm feeling.\" Ritchie could feel his own frustrationnbuilding. He took another deep breath and released it. \"I lovenyou. I'm in love with you. And I'm saying it out loud.\" \"Younare not in love with me. This isn't love. This is fear. You'renafraid that you're going to lose the person who's been helping tontake care of you and the band for years. I'm a person, Ritchie! Indeserve to be happy!\" Devon exclaimed. Ritchie stood up and facednDevon. \"Inknow you're a person, Devon. I know that you have your ownnidentity and your own needs. Does Reese? Does he know your favoritenmovie? Your favorite book? Your favorite songs? Does he know younlove the snow but hate the rain? Does he know how good you are atnwhat you do? Is he proud of that? Because I am. I'm amazed bynyou every day, Devon. I love that you're the bossiest person I'venever met, apart from your sister. I love that you never let me benlazy, that you always push me to be the best I can be. I love hownloyal you are to your friends and your family. I love that you canncharm a son-of-a-bitch like Hollis into letting you call him 'Holly.'n I love that you're willing to try anything, absolutely anythingnonce. I love that you're fearless about just about everything. nAnd I love that the best part of my day is seeing you. And, if I'mnreally lucky, hearing you laugh. I've been afraid for years tonadmit how I feel. To admit that a part of me knew all along thatnyou've had feelings for me since you were sixteen. I was afraidnbecause I saw what it did to my mom - when her love walked out onnher. And because of that fear, I never let myself really see whatnwas going on between us. I pushed it away. I told myself we werenonly friends - best friends. I was wrong to do that, Devon. I wasncareless with your heart. And I'll admit it - Reese wouldn'tnhave been so careless with you. He would probably make a morenattentive husband. But he doesn't need you, Devon. Not like I do.n And he doesn't see you. Not really. But I see every part of youn- good and bad. And I love every part - good and bad. And I knownyou know me like that too. So see this. See I'm telling you thentruth.\" Ritchie breathed hard. Devonnwas stunned speechless. She sat back down in the chair and starednahead, focused on nothing. Ritchie kept his eyes on Devon and warilynwaited for her to say something, anything in response. \"Youncan't keep me here, Ritchie.\" Devon said in a low voice, almostntoo low for Ritchie to hear her. Ritchiensaid nothing - only slowly sat down next to her.[Chapter 11] Chaptern11: If you love someone . . . \"Devon\"n Gabby called out as she let herself into Devon's apartment usingnthe spare set of keys that Devon had given her. Weird.n She said she'd be back by now .n Gabby was supposed to have dinner with Devon that evening. Gabbynwas anxious to talk to Devon about this ongoing fight between Devonnand Ritchie. Gabby was worried about the effect it was having onnDevon. And Ritchie. Justnthen, the doorbell rang. Puzzled at the thought of her friendnringing the doorbell of her own apartment, Gabby opened the door. \"Abby\"n Reese smiled, \"Have you seen Devon?\" \"It'snGabby, actually.\" Gabby corrected Reese, more than a littlenannoyed. \"With a 'g.' And no - I haven't seen Devon.\" nGabby's close friends knew that Gabby disliked very few people andnsaid a disparaging word about even fewer. But there was somethingnabout Reese which she couldn't quite pinpoint which rubbed her thenwrong way. \"Sorry\"n Reese smiled the rueful smile that the average movie goer regularlynpaid upwards of $10 to see. \"It's just that I've been callingnher for a couple of hours now and she's not picking up her phone.\" \"That'snodd.\" Gabby commented and then looked up, \"Danielle! What arenyou doing here?\" \"Whatnare you talking about, Gabby? You remember - Devon said I could staynhere while she went out of town on business.\" Danielle stoodnbehind Reese and raised her eyebrows, seeming to say Playnalong. Intrigued,nGabby decided to go along - for now. \"Oh right. Where was shengoing again?\" Gabby asked sweetly. \"Younknow - she's trying to sign that band - the one that lives innArizona.\" Danielle answered back just as sweetly. \"What?\"n Reese asked as he looked at Danielle. \"Why isn't she picking upnher phone?\" \"Reesen- this band is very eco-conscious. They try to live off the grid. nThat means they live in a place where there aren't cell phonentowers for miles.\" Danielle lied convincingly. It was one of hernmany talents - the ability to lie on her feet and lie well. \"Inhad no idea such places even existed.\" Reese said wonderingly. n\"You and me both.\" Gabby said brightly and smiled. Daniellenglared warningly at Gabby. Gabby only smiled wider. \"Reesen- you should just go home. Devon may be a couple of days. This bandnis really elusive but Hollis really wants to sign them. So Devon isngoing to be incommunicado for a day or so. But I'll have her callnyou as soon as she gets home.\" Danielle took Reese by the arm andnled him firmly out the door. Asnsoon as the door closed behind Reese, Gabby waited a few seconds tonmake sure that he was not in eavesdropping distance. Then she lookednat Danielle and said, \"talk.\" Daniellensmiled the smile that had led many a man to open their wallet for hernand proceeded to tell Gabby all about Ritchie's plan. Thenloaner house where Ritchie has Devon Ritchienlooked over at Devon as she slept on the couch. She hadn't spokennto him in hours, not after proclaiming that he couldn't keep her. nShe hadn't even said anything during the makeshift dinner he hadncobbled together from the non-perishable foods that he had hadnstocked down here. After all, he had no idea how long it would takento convince her. At thenrate we're going, I hope I have enough food to last us .n Ritchie thought. After dinner, Devon had walked over to the couchnand pretended to fall asleep until exhaustion had made the pretense anreality. Henwalked over to the couch and knelt down beside it. Gently, he pushednher hair out of her eyes. When she didn't wake, Ritchie decidednto risk placing a soft kiss on Devon's cheek. After a while,nexhaustion claimed another victim and Ritchie slept, his hand on thencouch above Devon's hair. Anfew hours later Ritchienwoke with a start from the sun in his eyes and a crick in his neck. nHe slowly eased himself to his feet and rubbed at the back of hisnneck with one hand. He pulled his cell phone out of his pocket andnlooked at the date and time. Inguess I better call Mason and tell him I'm not making rehearsal. AsnRitchie waited for Mason to pick up, he smiled at the old school songnchoice his friend had picked for callers to listen to. Ifnyou love somebody, If you love someone, Set them free. Sting'snvoice sang. Ritchienclosed his eyes. Then he looked at Devon and realized that she --nand Sting -- were right. He couldn't keep her here. Not if shendidn't really want to be here. Not if she didn't love him. Ritchienpressed a button on the phone to end the call and walked to the doornat the top of the stairs. He took a key from his pocket and unlockednthe door. He walked back down the stairs. He took out his cellnphone again and placed a quick call. Then he pulled a chair in frontnof the couch and waited for Devon to wake up. Hendidn't have long to wait. Devon opened her eyes and slowly sat up.n She saw Ritchie in a chair in front of her, with sad and resignedneyes. \"You'renright. I can't keep you here. So if you look, you'll see thatnthe door is unlocked and there's a car outside waiting to take younwherever you want to go.\" Ritchie spoke slowly, almost as if henwas unwilling to finish his sentences. Devonngot up, walked to the bottom of the stairs and looked at the openndoor at the top. She hesitated and then put one foot on the bottomnstair. \"ButnI want you to understand something.\" Devon turned as Ritchienstarted speaking again, \"You're wrong if you think that I don'tnwant you to be happy. I want that more than anything, Devon. And ifnReese Worthington makes you happy, then I'll be happy.\" Ritchienhalf smiled. Devon looked at Ritchie's eyes and saw truth. Andnlove. Ritchienopened his mouth as if to say more. But there was too much to say. nAnd at the same time, nothing more to say. So he closed his mouthnand said nothing - only continued to look at Devon. Devonnleaned forward, as if she was going to go to Ritchie. But instead,nher hand on the bannister tightened and she pushed herself up thenstairs and out the door. Ritchiensat and waited in the basement for a long time. Wishing that shenwould come back. Knowing that she wasn't going to.[Chapter 12] Chaptern12: You came back \"Dude.n You just blew my mind.\" Mason echoed the sentiment shared by thenrest of the band who had just heard from Gabby and Danielle the storynof how Ritchie had kidnapped Devon and then set her free. \"Sonwhere's Devon now?\" Scooter asked. Gabbynand Danielle exchanged looks. **Flashbacknto two hours ago** \"Devon!\"n Gabby exclaimed as she got up from the couch. Danielle came intonthe living room from the bedroom. \"Ritchienjust tried to kidnap me!\" Devon exclaimed with her hands on hernhips. \"Oh,\"n Gabby said weakly. As her close friends knew, Gabby was a terriblenliar. \"GabbynAnne Davis,\" Devon advanced on her friend, \"What do you know?\" \"Leavenher alone. She doesn't know anything.\" Danielle said. \"AndnI suppose you do.\" Devon turned her attention to her sister. Innresponse, Danielle merely shrugged and said, \"I take it that younand Mr. Rock Star decided against happily ever after, then.\" Devonnshook her head and muttered, \"Unbelievable.\" Devon strode to hernbedroom but stopped just as she passed Danielle. \"He said he lovednme. He said he was in love with me. He said he needed me. And henwasn't letting me go. It was all kind of moving actually. Then anfew hours later, he says that he can't keep me and tells me I canngo. And he says that if Reese makes me happy, then that will makenhim happy\" Devon shook her head, to keep from crying, \"And thencrazy thing is - I think he was telling the truth the entire time.\" \"Huh,\"n mused Danielle, \"I guess he really must love you then.\" \"Yeah\"n Gabby chimed in as she walked closer to the Thompson sisters,n\"Especially if he's willing to sacrifice his happiness fornyours.\" Devonnlooked her sister and her friend and then strode to the bathroom. nTwenty minutes later, Devon emerged from the bathroom with her hairnup and a determined look on her face. \"Wherenare you going?\" Gabby asked. \"Tonfind Reese.\" Devon called back as she headed out the door. **Flashforwardnto the band (minus Ritchie) and Gabby and Danielle in the rehearsalnstudio** \"Sonwhat do you think Devon will do when she finds Reese?\" KK asked. Gabbynand Danielle exchanged another set of looks. \"Frankly,nK,\" Danielle said, \"Your guess is as good as mine.\" \"Ritchie\"nGabby exclaimed as the lead singer walked in. Ritchie looked at thenfaces looking back at him with expressions of pity and concern. \"Intake it you all are up to speed, then.\" Ritchie said dryly beforenhe turned his attention back to opening up his guitar case. \"Rich\"nScooter began but Ritchie quickly cut him off. \"Scooter - I don'tnwant to talk about. Let's just rehearse, okay.\" Ritchie didn'tneven look up as he spoke. KK,nScooter, and Mason looked uneasily at each other. But Nikolai walkednover to Ritchie, clapped a firm hand on Ritchie's shoulder andnsaid, \"Whatever you want, Ritchie. Everything will be all right. nMama Fortunata told me.\" \"God,nNik - don't you know that woman is a waste of your money,\" nRitchie shook his head in mock despair. \"Younwill see\" Nikolai smiled. Gabbynwalked over to Ritchie and wrapped him in a big hug. \"Just breathenand believe, Ritchie\" Gabby whispered. \"Thanks,nGabs. I'm working on it,\" Ritchie whispered back. Gabby kissednhim on the cheek and walked out. Daniellenwalked over to Ritchie. Ritchie looked at her warily and said,n\"You're not going to get mushy on me or anything, are you?\" \"Don'tnbe idiotic\" Danielle retorted as she slapped him upside the head. n\"Ow\" Ritchie put a hand to the back of his head, \"that hurt.\" \"Wellnyou deserved it.\" Danielle replied. She grabbed Ritchie's chinnbetween her thumb and forefinger and gently forced him to look her innthe eye, \"It is fairly common knowledge that Thompson women are notnidiots. We are, in fact, pretty sharp cookies. She'll come backnto you.\" \"Ifnyou say so.\" Ritchie's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. \"Andnwhat I say always goes.\" Danielle stated, as if it were a etchednin stone, \"Right, favorite ex-husband?\" \"Ingotta say, Rich - she does tend to be right an annoyingly highnpercentage of the time.\" Scooter reluctantly agreed. Daniellenlooked them over and said, \"I believe my work here is done.\" Shenleft the room, trailing her very expensive perfume after her. n\"Arrivederci!\" \"Whonwas that hurricane?\" murmured KK. Scooternclapped a hand on Ritchie's shoulder and said, \"Thompson women. nBest and worst thing to ever happen to a guy.\" Meanwhilenat Reese's house Reesenopened the door to Devon, \"Honey - I'm so glad to see you? Hownwas Arizona?\" \"What?\"n Devon asked, confused. \"Yournbusiness trip that your sister said you were on,\" Reese replied. \"Oh,nright! It was fine. Reese, we have to talk,\" Devon began. \"Honeyn- you're so right and you have impeccable timing as usual. Comenwith me.\" Reese took Devon's hand and led her to his dining roomnwhere pictures of various houses were on the table. \"The realtornin Australia sent me these for us to look at. They're contendersnfor the house we're going to rent. And if we really like it, wencan buy it.\" \"Reese,\"nDevon frowned, \"I still haven't decided this is what I want tondo. I still have obligations to Hollis and the band. And the tour.\" \"Devon,nc'mon,\" Reese said cajolingly, as he picked up a picture fromnthe table, \"I think this one is the top contender. It's a ranchnreally. We can have horses. Go riding every day.\" \"Inhate horseback riding.\" Devon folded her arms over her chest. \"Honeyn- that's because you've never been riding with me.\" Reesengrinned and kissed her on the cheek. Devonnlooked at Reese as he proceeded to pick up picture after picture andnlist the pros and cons of each house. She felt like she could seenthe life she would have with Reese. See it like it was a movienunfolding before her very eyes. Shencould see that he would always be concerned about her, would alwaysnwant to check up on her and take care of her. And she could see hownyears later, that Reese's concern would go from feeling like ancomforting blanket to a smothering strait jacket. She could picturenhow the person she was now would slowly become enfolded into Reese'snmagnetic persona, until there was no \"us\" and no \"Devon.\" nOnly Reese. Devonnlooked at Reese and realized that she wasn't in love with him. Shenwas in love with someone else - a dark-haired singer who had somehownfallen into her life and, even more miraculously, never fallen out ofnit. She was in love with Ritchie Tressiak -- and she had been sincenshe was sixteen years old. Devon realized that the fear that she hadnaccused Ritchie of acting upon last night was really her own fear --na fear that a dream she had never really dared let herself believe innwould never come true. Anfeeling of calm settled upon Devon. A feeling like all of the partsnof heart were finally clicking into place. But it also came with anfeeling of sadness for what she was about to do. \"Reese.n Reese - you have to listen to me.\" Devon interrupted Reese as henwas about to discuss another housing prospect, \"I can't marrynyou.\" \"Devonn- that's not funny.\" Reese replied. \"I'mnnot making a joke. I'm very serious. I made a mistake in agreeingnto marry you, Reese. I'm not in love with you. I convinced myselfnthat I was. But I see now - I was just trying to hold on tonsomething that wasn't there. I was trying so hard to be the girlnthat you wanted me to be that I never let you see the girl that I am.n That was wrong of me. I'm sorry for that. And I'm sorry tonhurt you like this. But I can't do this.\" Devon pulled the ringnoff her left hand and placed it on the table. She kissed the cheeknof a stunned and silent Reese and left the house. Devonngot into her car and exhaled a breath she didn't know she had beennholding onto. Then she started her car and drove. Threenhours later . . . \"Dammit\"n Devon was pissed and cranky. She had wasted precious time stuck inntraffic on the 405. Devon vowed to never listen to another trafficnreport on KJCA ever again. And now her not-so-new car had proceedednto die on her, just when she was only a mile from her destination. Justnthen, as if to add insult to injury, the heavens opened up and itnstarted raining. Hard. God,nI hate the rain . Devonnthought as she looked up at the dark sky through her front window. nDevon thought about calling for a tow and waiting. But she realizednthat she could never just sit here. Then, she realized that hernrunning shoes were still in the trunk of her car . . . Tennminutes later, running shoes laced up on her feet, Devon started anbrisk pace down the path that would take her where she need to go. Inhave to get to him. I just have to. That's all Devon could think. Never mind that it was a mile tonhis house. Never mind that it was raining - raining in torrents in anway rarely seen in Southern California. Never mind that she wasnsoaked and exhausted. Inhave to tell him. Ritchie'snhouse Ritchienlay on the sofa, mentally and physically drained. Rehearsal had notngone well. He could barely concentrate and had forgotten half of thenlyrics to half of the songs. Out of kindness, his bandmates had saidnnothing. But he could tell that they were worried. They were goingnto go out on tour soon. Nothingnsays successful tour like a lead singer who can't sing .n Ritchie thought. He vowed to get it together in time for the tour. nBut for right now, Ritchie vowed to get drunk enough to forget. Asnsoon as he could pull himself up off the couch. Hisnpity party was interrupted by the long, uninterrupted sound ofnsomeone leaning on his doorbell. \"I'm going to kill Danielle,\"n Ritchie muttered as he reluctantly levered himself up from hisncouch, \"I don't care whose sister she is or who she was marriednto.\" Ritchienopened the door . . . to a soaking wet Devon. \"Whatnthe hell happened to you?\" Ritchie demanded. \"Inran. A mile. It's raining.\" Devon walked past Ritchie as shenpanted and shivered. Ritchie closed the door. \"It'snnot raining. It's monsoon season in Calcutta. So you decided tongo for a run? In the rain?! Are you nuts? You hate the rain! I'mngoing to get you a towel. Or five.\" Ritchie said as he started tonwalk towards the stairs and the upstairs bathroom. \"Wait\"n Devon said a bit desperately. \"Did you mean it?\" \"Meannwhat?\" Ritchie asked. \"Meannwhat you said back in that loaner house. That if Reese made menhappy, then you were happy.\" Devon looked at him with bright eyes. \"Inmeant everything I said to you back there. And I meant that too.\" nRitchie stood perfectly still. Whatnis she trying to do? Ritchie thought. Breaknmy heart again? \"Whatnif Reese wouldn't make me happy? What if I would only be happynwith someone else? What then?\" \"Someonenelse.\" Ritchie repeated slowly, his brain refusing to take in thenclear implication of her reference to someone else. Devonnwalked to Ritchie and took his hands in her cold, wet hands, \"Inlove you. I've been in love with you since I was sixteen yearsnold. Last night, I accused you of acting out of fear. But I was thenone that was afraid. For the past eight years, I've been afraidnthat you might never love me. So I hid my heart and I found excusesnto push guys away. And then I met Reese. And I tried to convincenmyself that I loved him because he wanted to take care of me. Andnbecause I thought you and I would never be together. But it was anlie. The girl I was pretending to be for Reese was a lie. And mynbeing in love with him was a lie. It was a lie I told myself andntried to make myself believe. But I'm not lying anymore. And I'mndone with hiding my heart. I love you. I'm saying it out loud.\"n She smiled tentatively. Ritchiencould only look wonderingly at Devon. He cupped her the side of hernface with one hand, tenderly and gently. \"You came back,\" henwhispered. \"Yeah.n I did.\" She whispered back. Slowlynand gently, he leaned in and kissed her. Kissed her with all thenlove and emotion that he had been storing for the past eight years. nShe kissed him back with the same feelings that she had been hidingnand suppressing for eight years. Thenkiss quickly turned from a gentle exploration to a more intensive andninsistent wanting as each pressed up against each other with no spacenin between. \"You'rengoing to get all wet.\" Devon murmured as she broke her lips awaynfrom Ritchie's and tilted her head back to allow his mouth accessnto her neck. \"Don'tncare.\" Ritchie muttered as he stripped off his T-shirt and went tonwork on tugging down the straps of Devon's dress. Havingnsuccessfully gotten Devon out of her dress, Ritchie started movingnthem towards the stairs leading to the Ritchie's bedroom. \"Couchnis closer,\" Devon whispered before pulling Ritchie's head downnfor a hot and hungry kiss. \"Good thinking,\" he muttered beforenhis mouth came down on hers. Somehow,nthey made it to the couch where they quickly disposed of the rest ofntheir clothes. Ritchie fished a condom from the wallet in his pantsnand looked down at a beautiful, waiting Devon, her hair spreadngloriously across the cushion of his sofa. \"Are you sure?\" henasked. Devonnlaughed - a laugh that was full throated and fully committed. \"Don'tnask stupid questions.\" She said as she reached up for him. Thennext morning Ritchienhastily pulled on a T-shirt and finished buttoning up his jeans as henran down the stairs to answer the by now familiar sound of someonenleaning on his doorbell. \"Does no one realize that they can stop pressing that damn button?!\" he muttered as he reached thendoor. Henopened the door to Scooter and Mason. \"Hey dude,\" Mason greetednhim. \"We came with breakfast sandwiches.\" Scooter held up twonwhite paper bags and grinned. \"Lookn- guys, I'm not really in the mood for company right now.\" nRitchie said as he rubbed his face. \"Ritchien- you can't spend your life pining for Devon. Trust me, I'venbeen down that road over a Thompson woman. It's not a good idea.\"n Scooter said as he walked past Ritchie, with Mason following behind. \"I'mnnot pining.\" Ritchie protested. \"Devon's here, okay? Soncould you both please go away?\" Masonnlooked pityingly at his deluded friend, \"If she was really here,nthen her car would be here, dude.\" \"Exceptnthat my car died about a mile away and so I decided to run here.\" nDevon came the stairs wearing a large Queen concert T-shirt. Shenwalked up to Ritchie and kissed him as he smiled and put his armnaround her shoulders, pulling her tightly to his side. \"Hey guys,ndid you bring breakfast?\" Scooterngrinned and said, \"Actually, we were just dropping it off for younguys.\" Scooter pulled Mason along with him as they both headed fornthe door. Ritchie and Devon heard Mason say \"But I'm stillnhungry\" before the door shut. Ritchiengrinned at Devon, \"So you're hungry, then.\" \"Notnfor food.\" Devon said enticingly as she leaned up and kissed himnagain, longer this time. \"Whatevernthe lady wants,\" Ritchie said as he swept Devon in his arms andncarried her to the waiting couch, her laughter ringing in his ears. If you love someone, set themnfree. If they come back, they're yours. If they don't, they nevernwere. -- Richard Bach (author of Jonathan Livington Seagull) Author's Note: Some of younmay disagree with Devon apologizing to Reese for breaking up with himnand believe that the blame for the failure of Reese's and Devon'snrelationship rests squarely with Reese. However, I believe that mostnrelationships (romantic or otherwise) are a two-way street and thenproblems in any relationship (romantic or otherwise) are rarely thendoing of just one person. In this case, while Reese was certainlynbulldozer, he only got as much control over Devon as he did becausenshe never stood up for herself and who she was until the very end. nDon't get me wrong. I'm not trying to \"blame the victim.\" nBut I think it's important for Devon's own growth for her tonacknowledge and take ownership of her part in creating the dynamicnbetween herself and Reese. Ultimately, doing so helped her to seenthat it was unhealthy and that she really belonged in a relationshipnwith Ritchie. Of course, you don't have tonagree with me. ButnI hope you did enjoy revisiting these characters with me. This isn'tnthe end though. How could we have a story about a band without annepilogue/encore! So put your hands together for that! Remember -nthe harder you clap (i.e., the more you review), the faster the bandnwill come back on stage.[Chapter 13] Epilogue:n Encore \"Sonwhat do you think? 9 out of 10? 10 out of 10?\" Ritchie askednDevon as he came backstage. The tour had been going for a few weeks.n It was the first show in Salt Lake City and the band had justnfinished up the last song on their playlist. \"Atnleast a 9.5\" Devon smiled. \"Sonwhat do we have to do to make it a 10?\" Ritchie put his hands onnDevon's hips and pulled her close for a quick kiss. Devonnpretended to consider the question for a couple of seconds and thennanswered, \"Well, you've still got the encore to wow me.\" Ritchienand the rest of the band listened to the clapping, shouts andnwhistles of the audience as they clamored for an encore. Devonnheard it too and smiled as she fingered her necklace, a recentnpresent from Ritchie. **Flashbacknto yesterday evening at Devon's old high school** Devonnand Ritchie were strolling hand in hand around the track, having justnhad dinner with Devon's mom. The band, Devon, and everyone elsenworking on the tour had just arrived in Salt Lake City that day andnwere preparing for tomorrow when the first of the two shows in SaltnLake City would begin. \"Sonmy mom said she thought it was about time that we got together.\" nDevon confided. \"Funnyn- my mom and my grandma said the same thing when I called themntoday.\" Ritchie smiled. \"They want us both in Key West as soonnas possible.\" \"Don'tnworry - I've got family time in Florida built into the tournschedule.\" Devon explained. \"So - do you realize what date todaynis?\" \"Uh,nWednesday?\" Ritchie asked. \"Notnjust Wednesday,\" Devon answered, \"It's --\" \"Ournfour-month anniversary,\" Ritchie finished. \"You thought I forgotn- didn't you?\" \"Ofncourse not!\" Devon replied. Ritchie gave her a skeptical look andnshe admitted, \"Okay, okay. I thought you might, possibly havenforgotten.\" \"Notnonly did I not forget - I have a present.\" Ritchie stopped andnpulled a little pouch from his pocket. \"Open your hand.\" Devonncupped her hand open and Ritchie dropped a necklace from the pouchninto her hand. It was a pendant - a peacock made of gold, sapphiresnand emeralds. \"Ritchien- it's gorgeous! Where did you get this?\" Devon gasped. Ritchientook the necklace from Devon's hand, put it around Devon's necknand fastened the clasp. \"I had it made. Do you like it?\" Devonnput a hand to the pendant and looked at it. \"I love it! I lovenyou. So much.\" \"Good.n I love you too.\" Ritchie leaned down and kissed her. \"HappynAnniversary, Devon Thompson.\" \"HappynAnniversary, Ritchie Tressiak.\" Devon smiled back. **Flashforwardnto the concert** \"I think we've kept themnwaiting long enough.\" Ritchie said as the applause, shouts andnwhistles grew to a deafening level. Ritchie then walked back onnstage. Devon looked quizzically at thenrest of the band, \"What are you guys doing? Go out there!\" \"Just watch.\" Scooter said asnhe pushed Devon forward so she could see exactly what Ritchie wasndoing. A lone spotlight illuminatednRitchie seated on a high stool holding his acoustic guitar. \"Hownare you guys?\" he asked the crowd. The crowd roared back itsnanswer. \"So being here is really specialnfor me and I'll tell you why. Not too long ago, I had terriblenstage fright. Really awful. But then, in a town not too far fromnhere, I met this girl and she changed my life. And she made menbelieve. And she still does. Every day. So this song is for Devon,nfor always.\" Ritchie then proceeded to singn\"Kidnap My Heart\" -- the way he sang it to her all those yearsnago. The way he sung it to her a few months ago when he hadn\"kidnapped\" her. Devon watched Ritchie and even though therenwere hundreds and hundreds of people in the arena, it felt like theynwere the only two people in the world. Her heart felt full. When Ritchie was done, there wasnsilence for a few seconds and then thunderous applause. Scooter,nMason, KK, and Nikolai then walked onstage to join Ritchie. The bandnthen played three more songs to complete the encore. Once the final song had beennplayed, the band walked off stage with Ritchie the last one off thenstage. He stopped in front of Devon. \"So - 10 out of 10?\" Devon laughed. \"Are younkidding? A million out of 10! Only problem is we have a lot ofncities left and I have no idea how you're going to top that.\" Ritchienenveloped Devon in his arms and murmured before his mouth came downnon hers, \"Don't you worry. I'm an artist. I'll getncreative.\" ","Summary":" HidingnMy Heart (The Kidnapping of Devon Thompson) Chaptern1: Movie Nigh t Prologue Inhave to get t"},{"Movie":"Fame, 2009","Title":"You Can Trust Me","Author":"marcoandjenny4Ever","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6557890","Passage":"[Chapter 1] You Can Trust Me Jenny came walking down the hall when she looked up and smiled. The handsome face of her boyfriend Marco stared back at her. \"Hey baby\" Marco said smirking as he approached Jenny and pulled her in for a kiss. \"Hey babe\" Jenny said, returning the kiss. \"How was your day?\" \"Ugh…it sucked! I was away from you all day!\" Marco smiled as he pulled her in for another kiss. \"Uh huh\" Jenny playfully said but still returning the kiss very quickly. Both walked hand in hand down the hall and out the door. \"So what will it be tonight? Dinner at my dad's restaurant? Movie?\" Marco suggested. \"Umm how about a movie? More make-out opportunity\" Jenny smirked as she looked up at her boyfriend. \"You know I'm always up for make out\" Marco laughed as he held Jenny closed to him. The two walked until they reached Mr. Garrison's apartment. \"So I'll pick you up around 7:00?\" \"Sounds perfect!\" The couple shared a kiss before going separate ways. After the movie had ended, Marco and Jenny came out of the theater holding hands and talking about the movie. After they had gotten half way to the apartment, Marco stopped and Jenny turned around to face him. \"What's the matter?\" Jenny asked, worried. \"Spend the night with me.\" Marco said quickly. Jenny was taken aback by what her boyfriend had just asked her. \"I'm sorry, what?\" Jenny asked again, hoping for a clear explanation. \"I want us to spend the night together\" Marco said again, standing his ground on the words that had just come out of his mouth. \"Marco I….\" not knowing what to say, Jenny just stared at the ground. She had always been a little hesitant about this topic, she knew Marco was going to bring it up eventually but she was hoping it would be later when she was ready. It had only been a couple months since the incident with Andy, a former PA student who had tried to take advantage of Jenny. It had been so bad that Jenny was worried about being close like that with anyone, sadly including her own boyfriend. \"I know you said that you need some time because of Andy, but Jenny you know that I would never try to make you feel uncomfortable like that. I love you and you can trust me.\" \"I know I can, I'm sorry I don't know what's come over me. I guess you just took me by surprise, that's all. I know, I do trust you and I know you love me.\" Jenny looked at her boyfriend. She looked in those gorgeous brown eyes and smiled. She wondered how she had gotten so lucky. They had been together since they were sophomores. Here it was, their senior year and they were happier than ever. Even with the school year coming to an end, they weren't worried because they know they were going to be together forever. \"Okay, I'll spend the night with you\" Jenny smiled, a little shaky in her voice but was still sure what she wanted to do. \"Really? I mean, if you still need more time, I would understand. I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have tried to jump down your throat like that.\" Marco said. \"No, no you didn't.\" Jenny interrupted. \"Like I said Marco, I know you love me and I trust you.\" Jenny smiled and kissed her boyfriend. After going back to the apartment so Jenny could grab some things, they walked down until they had made it to Marco's place. They walked inside and found that they were alone. Marco's father and siblings had gone to visit other relatives and would not be back till the next night. They made their way upstairs. Marco turned to face Jenny and noticed the nervous look on her face. \"You okay babe?\" Marco said, concerned. \"Yes I think so.\" Jenny stuttered. But the thing was, she really wasn't sure if she was okay. She looked in front of her and knew it was her boyfriend, the one she truly loved and who she knew would take care of her. But inside her mind, she saw Andy, trying to somehow get inside of her and take all he could from her. Marco took Jenny's hand gently. \"Hey, it's only me, Andy is not here. I promise you, he will never come between us again. You have nothing to worry about.\" Jenny smiled and took a step forward to be embraced in Marco's arms for a little while. Just the touch of his arms around her made her feel safe and secure. Jenny looked up and smiled at Marco, the love of her life. \"I love you so much. Nothing is going to change that, not Andy or anyone else. Andy may have taken advantage of me but he didn't damage me permanently. You are the only person I'll ever want to be with.\" Jenny almost had tears in her eyes reciting those words to her boyfriend. \"I love you too Jenny. And I always will\"[Chapter 2] Please don't compare me A couple of hours had passed and Marco and Jenny had just been sitting on the couch watching TV. Jenny was okay for the most part, she was trying to calm down. She knew that is was just her boyfriend. Why couldn't she get past this? Marco looked down at her, she was curled right beside him, trying to put a brave face on and he knew that. He was just worried about her and wondered if there was anything he could do for her. \"Look Jenny\" Marco said softly as he turned around to face her. \"The last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable, I love you. I just want to know if you are somehow trying to compare me to Andy and that is what's making you nervous.\" Jenny's eyes were about to tear up. She didn't want to put Marco in this position, not the one that she loved, it wasn't fair to him. \"I'm so sorry Marco! You don't need this and I'm just making it worse for you. I think I may just go.\" As jenny started to get up, Marco grabbed her arm. Jenny looked down and there it was, the vision of Andy grabbing her arm and throwing her back down on the couch in that trailer. Jenny quickly pulled her arm out of Marco's grip and just stared blankly at him. She didn't want to cry but she felt like she couldn't help it. \"Jenny I…..\" Marco started to say, but by the time he found the words, Jenny was already up and heading for the door. \"Jen, please just talk to me!\" Marco was desperate; he couldn't stand to see the girl he loved with all his heart in such pain. \"I can't Marco!\" Jenny shouted. \"You don't understand, I'm just fragile right now, I can't explain it but I don't know if I'm ever going to be okay again.\" \"Yes you will. I'll help you, you just have to let me in that's all\" Marco interrupted, desperate to calm her down. \"I know and I love you for it but I just can't…\" Jenny couldn't and she wouldn't do it, she wouldn't put the man she loved through her own pain. \"Andy may not have physically attacked me at that moment but I know that if I had stayed, he would have done something. And I also know that it's my own damn fault. You warned me not to go see him and I did it anyway! God, I'm so stupid!\" Jenny threw herself onto the chair, crying harder than ever. Marco got up and moved over to where Jenny sat. He put his arm around her and just sat there in silence, letting her get all her tears out before he spoke. \"Jenny, we have already been through this, its okay. You made a mistake; nobody is perfect…except you are to me.\" Marco smiled. Somehow this forced Jenny to look up and smile back a little. She looked back down and realized that Marco fingers were laced through hers. \"Seriously Marco, how can you still love me? I went behind your back.\" Jenny could feel herself about to cry again. \"I told you, you made a mistake. We all make them. We would make for a pretty boring couple if we didn't make mistakes once or twice right?\" Marco joked, hoping to cheer Jenny up a little. This helped Jenny to smile a little more. She looked at her boyfriend and couldn't understand how she got so lucky. Here she was, struggling to figure out who she is and making tons of mistakes along the way. She had no idea that the very first day she would walk into PA, she would end up meeting the guy of her dreams, a guy that is so accepting of her that it almost makes everything unreal. Jenny smiled and leaned in to kiss her boyfriend. It seemed like there was no need for words at that moment. She just knew that she just wanted to be with him right then. The two of them spent the rest of that night on the couch, just in each other's arms, knowing that they both have found the person that they were going to spend forever with.[Chapter 3] I'll be okay Here it was, almost 2 weeks after Jenny spent the night over at Marco's and things were going good. She was okay enough to talk about it, although that was just with Marco, not with other people just yet. She was going to talk about it with the rest of her friends, she just wasn't ready. Marco understood that and respected her wishes. Weeks later though, things were continuing as normal until students were called to the auditorium for a meeting with the principal. They were not sure what was going on, but they just knew that whenever Principal Simms called for an assembly, it probably meant big trouble. As the students took their seats, Principal Simms came over to the microphone and began to speak. \"Students, since new students will be coming this week to take a tour of the school, we also have invited PA alumni to come and speak to them. This maybe a great opportunity for you all to come a talk to the alum if you maybe need any advice as you finish your year here at PA. It's never too late to get advice from fellow students.\" Jenny's stomach dropped. She couldn't handle that, not again. She knew that if Andy saw her again, he would pull something and that her nightmares would become reality. She wanted to leave but no one had gotten up yet so she couldn't. Turning around to look at Marco, she felt as if she would start to burst out crying again. Marco looked her straight in the eye and knew that she was dying inside. But this time, he promised himself that he wasn't going to let this happen again. He let it happen once before and look what happened, he let the girl he loved to become completely scared of everything, the way he touched her, looked at her…He wasn't going to let Andy tear his girlfriend up inside anymore. The next time he saw Andy, he was a dead man. After school, Marco had walked Jenny home. When they were about half way there, he stopped. \"Jenny, are you okay baby? I can feel you shaking.\" \"Yeah I guess, it's just that you know I'll never fully get passed this. It's just difficult.\" \"I know I'm sorry I wish I could take all that pain away for you.\" Marco looked disappointed. He just wanted to be a good boyfriend. How could he do that when he didn't know how to comfort the girl he loved. \"Marco, you may not realize this but you have helped me so much.\" Jenny smiled. This had been the easiest she had smiled in weeks. \"As long as I have you, I'll be okay.\" Marco took Jenny's hand \"You know that I would have never let this happen. If I had actually seen that he pulled something, he would have been a dead man.\" \"I know that\" Jenny laughed a little and gently kissed him. \"But you have to promise me something.\" \"Sure, anything\" Marco smiled. \"You have to promise me that when the alumni come to PA next week, you won't do anything to Andy. I know he's an ass and I would be all for that if you didn't have the chance of getting suspended. Please promise me.\" \"Okay, I promise I won't do anything.\" Marco smiled and kissed his girlfriend again. \"Good, I will see you tomorrow.\" They exchanged one more kiss before parting ways.[Chapter 4] A Broken Promise Nights had passed and all Marco could do was think about what could happen when Andy caught that first sight of Jenny. He was such a jackass; he would try anything, even if Marco was standing right there. He just wanted to punch him out so badly, letting him know that he would do anything to protect the girl he loved with all his heart. Then the promise he made to Jenny came into his mind. He promised her that he would stay away from Andy; she didn't want him to get into trouble that would result into huge consequences. The more he thought about it, the more upset he got. He loved her for worrying about him, but he wasn't just going to stand by and let him get away with anything. The next morning came and Marco woke up not very thrilled. He knew this was the day that the alumni were coming to PA. To be honest, he started to feel a little sick with just the thought of Andy just looking at Jenny. Right then his cell phone rang; he smiled before he even reached for his phone knowing that it was Jenny. \"Hey beautiful!\" Marco smiled. \"Hey baby!\" Jenny said quickly. \"I'm outside when you're ready.\" \"Okay, I'll meet you out there in five minutes.\" Marco replied. \"Alright love you!\" \"Love you too\" Five minutes later, Marco came out when a smile on his face as he laid eyes on his beautiful girlfriend. He kissed her as the two of them started walking down the street. A little while later, Jenny noticed a troubling look on her boyfriend's face. \"I know what you're thinking. It's about Andy isn't it?\" Jenny said. Marco looked down at Jenny. \"I'm sorry baby, I just can't bear the thought of him touching you, let alone just looking at you.\" Marco expressed a frustrated look. \"I know and I love you for that but I really need you to keep your promise to me that you won't do anything.\" Jenny almost sounded desperate. \"I know Jen; I won't do anything to him, it really isn't worth it anyway.\" Marco replied. They arrived at school and the alumni had already been there about an hour before. Now it was Marco's turn for his stomach to drop. It wasn't really sure is he could contain himself, it was going to be hard but he made a promise to his girlfriend and he loved her more than anything else. As the two stepped into the hallway, Jenny broke away for a few minutes to talk to Rosie and Joy and Marco was at his locker. As he looked over his locker; the moment was here. Principle Simms was walking down with some of the alumni and Andy was among this group. Marco could feel his hand turning into a fist. Jenny glanced down the hall and then glanced at him; she knew what he wanted to do. \"Talk to you guys later.\" She quickly said to the girls and then rushed over to the place where Marco was standing. \"You alright?\" Jenny said worried. \"Yeah I'm fine.\" It sounded like there was anger in Marco's voice. It wasn't at Jenny; it was just because he was looking at Andy coming down the hall and he couldn't help but cringe. \"Let's just go to class okay.\" Jenny said quietly. \"Yeah, let's go.\" Marco smiled at his girlfriend to reassure her that everything was alright. This made Jenny feel a little better, although from the look on his face it didn't seem okay. Marco wrapped his arm around her and the two walked past the group. Jenny was holding her breath, praying that nothing would happen; especially with Principle Simms right there. Marco looked back for a split second and saw that Andy had passed a glance as Jenny was walking by. He could feel his hand, the one that was around Jenny, go into a fist again. Jenny saw this and gently put her hand over his. They finally got to the classroom and sat down. Jenny swung around to Marco and smiled. \"I know that was hard but thank you.\" Jenny gave a little laugh. \"Geez, Jenny I must really love you because that was awful.\" Marco laughed a little also. \"I know and it means a lot that you care about me.\" Jenny got up from her seat and gently sat on Marco's lap. \"But I just don't want to see you in trouble. I mean, what would I do without this face?\" Jenny grabbed Marco's face and laughed. \"I know, I know.\" Marco laughed. \"It's just like I said before, I can't stand the thought of that asshole looking at you the way he did.\" \"We just have to realize that he isn't worth it anymore. We are going to be much better off that way. Besides, you know that I only want a future with you.\" Jenny kissed her boyfriend. \"I love you babe.\" Marco smiled \"I love you too.\" As class started, Ms. Fran came in and made an announcement. \"Students for class today we are honored to have some of the alumni come in and speak to us.\" A group of alumni walked in, the same group that was in the hall before. Andy was the last to come in and Marco and Jenny both looked at each other. All the alumni had the class' attention now and after quite some time, Andy was the last to speak. After the agony of a long speech from him, he ended with this: \"Part of our jobs as actors is to make the audience believe that's really going on. Who knows, maybe some of you will get lucky.\" With that sentence, he gave a little wink to Jenny. Jenny couldn't even bare the thought of turning around and looking at Marco's face after that. Ms. Fran let the alumni out and that was the last straw. Marco was about to snap. He asked Ms. Fran if he could step out for a minute and she let him. Jenny looked sick. She knew what would happen in that hallway and she wanted to stop it but she knew Ms. Fran wouldn't let her leave. Marco flew out the door in a rage. The groups of alumni were still in the hallway, talking with one of the other teachers. As they were about to step out the door, Marco rushed down the hall causing the group to turn around. About twenty seconds later, Andy was on the ground from a punch Marco threw at him. Andy quickly stood up and tried to throw a punch back but missed, then proceeded to shove Marco up against the lockers. Marco freed himself and threw another punch. A couple of teachers had come to break them up and Principle Simms came in the hall. \"Marco! My office, now!\" Principle Simms shouted. A while later; Marco left Simms office. This is exactly what Jenny didn't want, Marco had been suspended. After he came out into the hall, class had ended for the day. Jenny had come out of Ms. Fran's room and she was not happy.[Chapter 5] \" I can't compete\" \"Marco, I can't believe you. I told you to let it go!\" Jenny went stomping down the street so fast that Marco could barely keep up with her. \"Jenny I'm sorry, I just can't stand that creep and you know that!\" Marco yelled. \"Yes I know that, and now the whole school knows it to thanks to your display in the hallway!\" Jenny yelled as she turned around to face Marco. \"Please, you just have to hear me out…..\" Marco started to say but was quickly interrupted. \"No not this time! Listen I know you hate Andy okay? So do I. I was the one in that trailer for God sake! But you shouldn't let him affect us anymore. We're back together and we're happy.\" \"I know you're right, but there's just something about the way he can act like a player and get away with it. I just don't want to compete with that. I'm not as successful as him either. I'm not sure if I ever will be.\" Marco said with a hurt look on his face as he sat on the front step and looked at Jenny. She walked over to sit next to him. \"Baby, you don't have to compete with anything. I didn't fall in love with how much success you have. I fell in love with a sweet, caring guy who loves me for me.\" Jenny smiled as she linked arms with her boyfriend. \"Believe me, you are a hundred times the man Andy will ever be.\" \"I guess, but it's not just that. It's about the whole incident with you. I should have been there to protect you. If I had just done something….\" Marco was interrupted by Jenny again. \"How could you have known, I kept it all from you. That was my own fault. I didn't realize what he was going to pull but the important thing is, I left when I should have.\" Marco then looked at Jenny and gave a smile. \"Yeah I guess you're right, you and I are together again and that's all that matters.\" He turned to Jenny and kissed her. When Jenny broke the kiss, she gave a smile but then quickly changed that with a face drop. \"But we still have a problem, no you're suspended. So what are we going to do?\" Jenny asked. \"Now, I go home to tell my parents…..God help me.\" Marco could feel his stomach turn at the idea of telling his parents what had happened. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Jenny asked, hoping Marco would say yes. \"No babe, I don't want you to have to deal with all that shit.\" \"Alright, well text me and tell me what happened.\" \"Okay, I will.\" A couple hours later, Jenny got a text from Marco and got extremely upset. Marco was not allowed to see her for a month.[Chapter 6] Not the one for him Jenny sat there, looking at her phone for the longest time. A month? Really? Probably to most people that doesn't seem like a long time but to a couple who are so in love, it feels like an eternity. Jenny came out of her room and into the kitchen where her father was sitting at the table. \"You okay sweetheart?\" Her father asked, looking up from his newspaper. \"No. Marco got into a fight today. He got suspended and now his parents are keeping us apart for a month.\" Jenny sat down on the chair next to her father, shaking with anger. \"A month? Now I know he started a fight but that seems a little harsh.\" Mr. Garrison said surprised at the news. \"Tell that to his parents.\" Jenny almost screamed. \"Alright hunnie; calm down. I'll go talk to his parents in the morning. Maybe we can settle something.\" Mr. Garrison said in attempt to calm his daughter. \"Thanks dad\" Jenny smiled and kissed her father's cheek. The next morning, Mr. Garrison kept his promise to Jenny and went to go talk to Marco's parents. He knocked on the door and Marco was the one who answered it. \"Mr. Garrison?\" Marco said surprised. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Hi Marco, just came to talk to your parents. Are they home?\" \"Yeah, come on in.\" Mr. Garrison stepped inside and he and Marco turned to face each other. \"Listen, I'm so sorry about the fight. I know it was stupid of me. I just had all this anger and didn't know where to put it. I hope you don't hate me for all of this.\" Marco hesitated to say as he looked up at Mr. Garrison waiting for a response. \"Don't worry about it. To be honest Marco, I'm just happy Jenny wasn't in harm's way.\" Mr. Garrison smiled. \"No, no she wasn't.\" Marco said quickly. \"Just know that I love your daughter very much and I would do anything to protect her.\" \"I know you would. You're a good man Marco. And if anyone is taking care of my daughter, I'm glad it's you.\" Mr. Garrison reached out his hand and Marco returned the handshake. Just then, Marco's parents came in to the front of the restaurant where Marco and Mr. Garrison were standing. \"Bobby, what are you doing here?\" Mr. Bamonte asked sternly. \"I just came to talk about this whole situation.\" Mr. Garrison said in defense. \"Marco, go upstairs.\" Mrs. Bamonte said quickly. Marco exchanged one more look with Mr. Garrison before heading upstairs like he was told. The Bamonte's and Mr. Garrison walked to a table where all three sat down in a little hesitation. \"As both of you know,\" Mr. Garrison started. \"Even though Mrs. Garrison and I are not together, we both accepted Marco right away. We love how much he loves Jenny and how he is willing to do anything for her. He has become a part of our family. And so have the rest of you. I know that Marco was the one who had started the fight today and I'm not condoning what he did, but I think not letting Marco and Jenny see each other for a month is a little harsh.\" Mr. Garrison said, hoping maybe this conversation would start out in his favor. \"Bobby, we appreciate that you've been so accepting of all of us and we also fell in love with Jenny right away. You have an amazing daughter, but to be honest with you I think that these two are spending too much time on a high school romance and today it was just taken too far.\" Mr. Bamonte explained. Marco was listening at the top of the stairs and he was shocked at what had just come out of his father's mouth. How could they be so accepting of their relationship at the beginning and now all of the sudden their supposedly spending too much time on just a high school romance? This was more than just a high school romance to them, this was real love. \"But in Marco's defense, I think this is more than just a high school romance.\" Marco smiled, knowing that Mr. Garrison was really on his side. \"Even though it wasn't in the best way, Marco showed that he would do anything to protect Jenny. I think he felt guilty about not having done anything about the whole Andy situation. He just wanted to finally do something about it.\" \"But fighting with someone else is not the way to prove how much you love someone. Marco could have handled this much better and Jenny was a huge cause of what happened today.\" Mrs. Bamonte said in anger. Marco was about to run down the stairs and scream. He couldn't believe what was just said. \"Excuse me, are you blaming my daughter?\" Mr. Garrison said angrily. He stood up in a rage. \"Honestly, yes for some of it.\" Mr. Bamonte said standing up after Mr. Garrison. \"She wasn't even there in the hall when the fight happened!\" Mr. Garrison snapped. He had had enough of this. He wasn't going to stand there and let the Bamonte's blame his daughter. \"How dare you, you will not blame Jenny for this. Marco was just protecting her. I think it's wonderful that your son loves her that much; although now I have no idea where he got that from; certainly not from you two!\" Marco couldn't help but laugh a little at that comment. \"Bobby, I just think letting Marco and Jenny see each other is a bad idea, I don't think that she is going to be the one for him, I really don't.\" Marco stood up; I didn't want to believe that this conversation was going to turn out this way. He couldn't stand not seeing Jenny ever again. \"Well I just hope that one day you'll see the mistake you made by saying that.\" That was all Mr. Garrison had to say before turning and walking out the door. Marco's parents turned and noticed Marco was standing at the top of the stairs. You could tell he was angry by the way he held onto the railing so tightly that you could see the veins popping out of his hand and arm. \"How could you say that dad? Jenny had no part of this! And now all of the sudden you blame her for every decision I make. Well I'll tell you something, I'm proud of the decisions I've made, because I made those decisions for her and for us! And neither of you can tear us apart, not now and not ever!\" Marco ran down the stairs, slamming the door behind him and he left the house. \"Marco, come back here now!\" Mr. Bamonte screamed out the door. But it was no use; Marco was already too far down the street.[Chapter 7] They Can't Stop Us \"Jenny, I'm sorry. I tried my best.\" Mr. Garrison desperately said in attempt to calm his daughter down. Jenny was furious with what her father had told her after he got back from the Bamonte's. \"Why the hell would they all of the sudden blame me! I was nowhere in the hall when the fight started. Is it because they know I made the mistake of seeing Andy after Marco warned me not to?\" Jenny asked spastically. \"What they told me was, they were worried that you and Marco were spending a little too much time on a high school romance and it was getting in the way for both of you.\" Mr. Garrison almost hesitated to say these words to Jenny because he didn't want to see her explode. \"We've been together since sophomore year! Now all of the sudden, they think every decision we make is wrong? What the hell!\" Jenny screamed. \"I don't know hunnie; I just think it maybe best to stay clear of Marco for a while like they want.\" Mr. Garrison looked at Jenny, who was about to go into tears. \"What? Daddy, please tell me you are not starting to think the same way?\" Jenny pleaded. \"Actually no, Marco was the one who had answered the door when I got there. He and I had a talk. I told him that if anyone was taking care of my daughter, I'm glad it's him. Now, the way he handled things may not have been in the best way but I'm glad he would do anything to protect you.\" Mr. Garrison gave a little smile before going on. \"I understand that this isn't fair, but the sooner you agree to what the Bamonte's want, the sooner we can get this all over with and we can move on.\" Mr. Garrison got up and swallowed Jenny in a hug. Just then, there was a pounding at the door. Jenny opened it and to her surprise, Marco was standing in the doorway. \"Marco? Babe what are you doing here?\" Jenny said with a sudden panic in her voice. She would bet anything that his parents knew he was there and this would cause even more trouble. \"I had to see you, my parents are being ridiculous.\" Marco said furious. Mr. Garrison came around the corner. \"Marco, I really don't think it's a good idea that you're here right now. Your parents are going to be furious.\" \"I don't care; they can't stop me from being with Jenny. They need to let me grow up. I started the fight and I take full responsibility for that. But to blame Jenny for it is where I draw the line with them.\" Marco stood by this statement and he wasn't letting up. \"Alright alright, I think that we at least need to call your parents and tell them you're okay. We can talk this out later. If you need some time, take all the time you need okay?\" Mr. Garrison was not going to argue. He knew that Marco was not going to back down so there was no point. \"Thank you Mr. Garrison, I appreciate it. I really do.\" Marco breathed a little sigh of relief. \"Thank you daddy.\" Jenny also breathed a sigh and smiled at her father. Marco and Jenny went into the living room and Mr. Garrison went to the kitchen to make the phone call to the Bamonte's. A little later, Mr. Garrison came into the living room where he found Jenny curled up next to Marco with Marco's arm around her. \"I just got off the phone with your parents Marco, they're glad you're alright but upset you ran off. I know this is what you probably don't want to hear, but they're on there way over here now.\" Mr. Garrison finished what he had to say and just looked at his daughter and her boyfriend on the couch. Marco was shaking with anger and Jenny was just in a panic. \"Well fine…\" Jenny finally spoke up. \"They want to come and scream at me, let them! I'm not going to let them blame me for something I was not a part of or for loving their son!\" Jenny went into a rage. \"Alright baby, calm down.\" Marco said as he stood up with Jenny. \"No, I'm not gonna calm down! We are adults and we need to make our own decisions without our families over our shoulders all the damn time!\" Jenny screamed. \"I understand that you're upset sweetheart, but there really isn't anything you can do. Marco leaves with his parents and as long as he lives under their roof, he goes by their rules.\" Mr. Garrison didn't want to admit it, but he knew that he lost this battle. \"We're just gonna have to play by the rules until this all blows over.\" \"Actually no, there is something we can do.\" Jenny said turning to her boyfriend. \"You and I are both over eighteen; we can get our own place together.\" Jenny said smiling. But Marco and Mr. Garrison were just in utter shock. \"Baby, I really don't know if that's a good idea, I….\" Marco started, but as soon as he started to speak further, the Bamonte's came from around the corner. \"Go ahead Marco,\" Mr. Bamonte said with a stern face. \"I definitely want to hear your response to this.\"[Chapter 8] We know what real love is Marco stood there frozen; he couldn't believe the situation he was in. His parents just stared blankly at him, waiting for his answer to pop out of his mouth. \"Well son, we're waiting.\" Mr. Bamonte said with a stern face. Marco still stood there is silence, staring back and forth between his girlfriend and his parents. \"Well….\"Marco started to say, but Jenny intruded to finish his thought for him. \"Come on babe, we can get our own place and then we don't have to deal with this shit anymore.\" Jenny whispered close to him. But apparently, it wasn't close enough. \"Jenny, I was talking to my son. You should keep your mouth shut, you're part of the reason we're in this horrible situation anyway.\" Mr. Bamonte practically shouted. Mr. Garrison stood up quickly \"DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO MY DAUGHTER LIKE THAT!\" He screamed. \"Oh come on Bobby, its true.\" Mrs. Bamonte said, coming to her husband's defense. Marco was about to snap himself. You could feel himself going red with anger. \"Now son, let's make the smart decision and go home now.\" Mrs. Bamonte tried to say calmly. \"Hell no!\" Marco finally said. \"Excuse me?\" Mrs. Bamonte was taken aback by the way her son just spoke to her. \"You heard me mom. Look, I love you both but I am twenty years old. You can't tell me which direction to go in. I have to find it on my own.\" Marco turned to look at Jenny. \"You guys also can't tell me what real love is either. I found that when I was fifteen and I'm never letting go of it.\" Marco smiled and kissed his girlfriend. \"Marco, you are making a huge mistake. You both cannot make it by yourselves. You can't survive on love you know?\" Mr. Bamonte said furious. \"Dad its fine, I'm working on getting signed with the record company and I think it's going to happen in the next couple of months or so, we'll be taken care of.\" Marco said, trying to plead with his dad. \"You THINK you can? It is harsh out there Marco, you just think that money is going to magically fall into your lap? You are not going to be set over night!\" Mrs. Bamonte shouted, just as equally upset as her husband. \"We understand that Mrs. Bamonte.\" Jenny finally said. \"Marco is not going to be the only one carrying the weight, we can make this work.\" \"Bobby, would you do something?\" Mr. Bamonte said looking over at Jenny's father. \"Sure I will….I'm going to take them apartment hunting tomorrow.\" Mr. Garrison said smiling at Marco and Jenny. \"WHAT!\" Mr. and Mrs. Bamonte said together. \"Oh come on, they are both adults. They can't stay with the comfort of their parents forever.\" Mr. Garrison calmly said. \"I mean, I don't want to lose my little girl either, but I know I'm gonna have to let her go out there someday, why not let that time be now?\" The Bamonte's just stood there in shock, not wanting to believe that they were going to lose this battle. They stared at Marco, their little boy. The one who they have watched grow up and now realizing that he is a man now. They can't make all of his decisions for him and they have to start with this one. \"I guess you're right sweetie.\" Mrs. Bamonte said as she started to tear up. \"We can't make your life decisions for you. Your dad and I raised you to eventually go off on your own and I guess now is the time for that.\" \"Your mom is right.\" Mr. Bamonte agreed. \"We also raised you to be a good man. And I think seeing Jenny so happy, that is exactly what you proved that you are. You're our son; we don't ever want you to be in pain.\" \"Thank you.\" Marco smiled. \"And Jenny, we are so sorry. We really do love you like you're our own daughter. We just were afraid of the idea of losing Marco and we shouldn't have blamed you.\" Mrs. Bamonte said apologetically. \"It's okay, you know that I love your son with all my heart and I will be good to him.\" Jenny smiled back at the Bamonte's. \"We know that. Bobby, you have raised a wonderful daughter and we are sorry for the situation we have put you in also.\" Mr. Bamonte said as he shook hands with Mr. Garrison. \"Thank you. Truth is, I didn't want to see them torn apart I guess. I made that mistake with Jenny's mom and I really wish I hadn't let her get away from me. I didn't want to see Marco make the same mistake I did by letting Jenny get away from him.\" Mr. Garrison said smiling. \"But you know Marco, your parents are right. This isn't gonna be easy. And I'm trusting you with my daughter.\" Mr. Garrison said looking Marco straight in the eye so he understood what he meant. \"I understand Mr. Garrison, and I will take good care of her, I promise.\"[Chapter 9] My Life is with You 6 months later: Marco and Jenny were as happy as they could be. They lived in a beautiful apartment, far enough away that they felt like they were on their own, but just close enough to their parents so that they could see them whenever they wanted to. And they were doing well for themselves. Marco ended up getting signed by a record company and he was working hard on his first solo album. Jenny was getting involved in Community Theater and she was also a model for a few popular magazines. \"Baby, I'm gonna be a little later tonight. I have to pick something up on my way home.\" Marco said as he kissed Jenny. \"Okay, what is it?\" Jenny asked curious. \"Can't tell you now, you'll just have to wait and see.\" Marco smirked. Jenny sighed. \"Oh come on, just a hint.\" She laughed as she put her arms around Marco's neck. \"Nope, gotta go. Love you\" Marco smiled as he raced out the door. Marco was out of the studio about six o'clock that night. His next stop led him into the parking lot of one of the most popular jewelry stores in New York. He stepped in and went to the front of the displays. \"Mr. Bamonte, we have been expecting you. The ring you were requesting is ready.\" A sales person said cheerfully as Marco approached. Marco smiled \"Perfect! Thank you\" The sales person went to the back to get the ring and came back a couple minutes later carrying a black velvet box. \"Thank you so much, I really appreciate everything.\" Marco shook hands with the sales person. \"You are so welcome, good luck and I hope she loves it.\" Meanwhile back at the apartment, Jenny had been pacing the house all day, wondering what Marco could possibly be picking up and why he was so anxious to do so. Just then, there was a knock at the door. When Jenny opened it, Joy had popped in. \"Hey Jen, what's up? Hey, why don't we get a little shopping in today?\" Joy said anxiously. Little did Jenny know, Marco had asked Joy earlier in the day to pick Jenny up and get her out of the house so that he could get the place ready. \"Sure, I could go for some shopping. Marco's not home anyway.\" Jenny smiled. \"Great!\" Joy said excited. About 2 hours later, the girls came back. Jenny said her goodbye to Joy and unlocked the door. She walked in to find candles and roses everywhere. \"Marco? What's going on?\" Jenny said with a little nervous laugh. Just then Marco came out looking just as handsome as ever. \"Babe, what are you doing?\" Jenny said, practically lost with what was going on. \"I need to ask you something, but first come sit on the couch.\" He took Jenny's hand and led her to the living room and sat next to her. \"Baby, I love you so much and you mean everything to me. When I came to PA four years ago, I wasn't sure what was gonna happen in the future. I never realized that I would end up meeting the girl of my dreams. I found my soul mate when I was fifteen and it's just been amazing ever since. I know in my heart I want to spend my life with you. I am so lucky to be in love with my best friend. So with all that being said…\" Marco pulled out the black velvet box from his jacket pocket. Jenny went wide-eyed. She couldn't believe that this was happening. \"Jenny, will you marry me?\" Marco choked out as tears started to come out of his eyes. Jenny sat there in tears. They were coming out so fast; she could not catch her breath. After a little bit of silence, Jenny finally choked out. \"Yes, of course I will!\" Marco took the ring out and slipped in on Jenny's finger with the biggest smile on his face. Jenny buried her face in her hands, still in shock. She finally threw herself in Marco's arms. \"I love you so much!\" \"I love you too Jen.\" Marco could feel himself start to cry again. ","Summary":" You Can Trust Me Jenny came walking down the hall when she looked up and smiled. The handsome face "},{"Movie":"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure B...","Title":"Oates","Author":"Heather Giesbrecht","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10743531","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: Hey, how's everybody doing ? I hope you're good. This is my first Bill & Ted fic so please excuse any small discrepancies and, again, just so we're clear it will eventually be Ted/Bill. So here's the story run down : Emphasize 'First person thought' \"Thought Bill.\" Plane Theodore 'Ted' Logan couldn't believe this, it was…it was, like, the most impossibly heinous thing he'd heard in the history of ever. ' This is completely and utterly bogus; I passed the assignment with an A+. He can ' t do this to me, the future needs me and more importantly, Bill needs me. ' His dad, tall, black-haired and brown-eyed just like him, gave him a 'cop look' and said, \"Don't even try, Ted. I know why you passed, there's only one possible reason. The reason you buckled down is simple and it's not because you actually wanted to pass, it's because of Bill and that idiotic band. You need real discipline and since you won't listen to me, you need to go to Oates Military Academy. Trust me when I say that someday you'll thank me for this someday, Theodore Logan. Now go and pack.\" He, still, protested anyway, \"But, dad, you can't.\" \"Well, I am, go pack, now ! We leave in two hours.\" It made him sigh, \"Yes, sir.\" His heart leapt at the knock on the door and sank at, \" I will answer it.\" Slowly, he trudged to his bedroom to throw the old brown suitcase on the bed, open it and start jamming things in it. A minute later, his blond-haired and most excellent of friends William 'Bill' Preston, Esq. walked into the room and exclaimed, \"Ted, dude, I don't even know what to say ! This isn't what Rufus said would happen.\" As he snarled, \"Well, maybe Rufus lied to us about the future ! Maybe he lied to us about the Wyld Stallyns, too ! Maybe he's just a bogus fraud and we got majorly conned. My dad's being a major dickweed and I don't want to leave, Bill.\", he pushed the suitcase onto the floor, scattering clothes all over. It made him startle when, suddenly, there were warm hands rubbing his shoulders, \"Calm down, man, I haven't seen you angry in a long time. I know, I don't want you to go to Oates either.\", and he leaned back against Bill subconsciously. Eventually, he calmed down and Bill helped him pack up. All too soon, dad, himself and Bill stood in front of a plane. He didn't really notice the surroundings as his heartbeat was pounding in his ears when Bill hugged him, \"I'm gonna miss you. Don't forget about me, bro.\" \"I won't, I'll see you later. When I get back you'll have to teach me those awesome guitar lessons you're gonna learn. Deal ?\" \"Deal.\" They both said, \"Excellent.\", then he forced himself to move and get on the plane. After he'd put his luggage away and sat down, the plane started to move. He looked past his seatmate - a dark-blond, dark-blue/gray eyed and tan-skinned dude, out the window. Bill was doing air guitar and dad was face palming. It made him smile, beside him the dark-blond asked, \"Who are you ?\" For a second without Bill to help him out, he floundered, \"My name's Ted, dude. Err, I mean my name is Theodore 'Ted' Logan.\" Dark-blond grinned, \"Awesome, it's nice to meet you, Ted. Now, man, you calm down until you meet the Colonel or you'll just psyche yourself out. I'm good at growing on trees. By that I mean I'm Jim, Jim Moss.\" \"Thanks, Jim.\" He and Jim shook hands as the plane took off, he looked through the window again. Bill was still grinning and waving like crazy. ' I ' m really gonna miss him, but, at least, I ' ll have one friend at Oates. '[Chapter 2] Oates It was a bright and cold morning as Ted, still bleary-eyed from sleep, stepped off the plane and onto another runway. He groaned as he dropped the suitcase on the tarmac. His legs were tingling from sitting so long. Jim stopped beside him, in the loosely forming line, the black duffle bag slung over his shoulder. A guy with light-brown skin in loose, dark-green clothes stood in front of them, the man had really short, graying hair. The dude was saying something and a thought popped into his head, ' Huh, that dude looks a lot like a bowl of old oatmeal. ' Beside him, Jim chuckled quietly and the old dude walked up to stand in front of him. Despite the man being way shorter than him, like Napoleon's height, he was heavily muscled with piercing, gray-eyes. Flinched as the man asked, \"What'd you just say to me, son ?\" Bill's voice in his head, \" Ted, man, you forgot to filter. That ' s, like, majorly important, dude, remember ? It ' s like that time you said Mrs. Maus looked like a bat and got sent to the principal ' s office and you got that hideously atrocious chalk-brush cleaning detention for the whole week. \" As he back-pedalled, \"Err, it's nothing against you, dude-sir. You just sort of resemble-\", he had the very bogus feeling that he'd just insulted Colonel Oates. \"You think I'm funny looking, huh ? Well, what's your name then, funny man ?\" \"Err, Logan, Theodore Logan, Colonel, sir.\" That had the Colonel raising an eyebrow, \"Hmm, well, why don't you walk to the academy, Cadet Logy ? While the rest of us ride the bus. If you have the energy to be funny, surely you have the energy to walk after all the academy is only five…miles…from here and it'll be good practice for the rest of your stay. Find your way to the barracks and mess hall after you're done putting your things away and cleaning up. Just maybe you'll get there in time for breakfast.\" \"Yes, Colonel Oates, sir.\" Jim gave him a sympathetic look, and muttered, while the colonel walked away, \"Yeah, old Oates.\", as the about fifteen or twenty other cadets followed the colonel toward the gray bus. ' Logi, what ? Isn't that a bean or something ?' \" No, Ted, he's calling you lazy.\" ' He could've just said that. I miss you already, Bill.' As the bus started up and moved off, he shook his head. ' Nice going, Ted, first day and the colonel already doesn ' t like you. Five miles, that ' s harsh, better get started or I won ' t get anywhere. At least, if Colonel Oates had heard Jim I wouldn't have to do it alone. ' He picked up the suitcase and walked off the tarmac onto the side road after the bus. It was mainly flat, green plains with a bunch of flowers and stuff. When his legs had finally stopped tingling and just turned numb, something happened. 'This is boring, ooh, rabbit. It's blond, cute and fluffy…just like Bill. Bad Ted, bad, you're not supposed to think like that. It's not cool, dude, you know that.' A little yellow rabbit had just hopped across the road in front of him. Somehow, he sensed the bird, dropped his suitcase and lunged to scoop-up the 'Bill' rabbit as a hawk practically screeched in his ear. He got up and turned the rabbit to look at it, it even had dark-brown eyes, and he stroked the rabbit's fur as it trembled, \"Don't worry, my furry, little, friend who sort of looks like Bill, I've got you.\" ' Why's it so wrong that I wish it actually was Bill and not a rabbit ? It didn't feel 'weird' when Bill was calming me down earlier. Therefore, it's not that different from Joe Burns and Sally Moore's thing. Except that Joe and Sally could make-out almost whenever they want. What's better Colonel Oates, or a rabbit ? The rabbit cause, at least, he's nice.' When the rabbit stopped shaking he, rather reluctantly, put it down, with a, \"See you later, awesome little rabbit dude.\" Then he picked up his suitcase and continued down the road. The road had turned from pavement into dirt, so he followed the tire-tracks to the academy. There was some sort of tollbooth type thing across the road. As he approached it, he became aware of the fact that he was panting and covered in sweat. 'That's not a good sign and it's only going to get worse. He-ey, that looks like the time machine. Wish I could use it to get out of this, where's Rufus when I want him ? Nowhere, that's where.'[Chapter 3] Range Ted ran a hand through his hair; it was odd having it short. Still, he felt somewhat better as the gun range's dividers and tables came into sight. Back in Gr. 10 when his 'tendencies' began cropping up, dad had gotten him into gun training in such a way as to try and 'normalize' him. He'd kept it up only so he wouldn't get angry with Bill, Deacon or dad. Not that it had always worked, but most of the time it had, last night had been the first time in a long time. Before he, Bill and dad had left the house last night, Deacon had said he was supposed to, \"Do cool stuff for me.\" Well, the morning walk followed by cold oatmeal and toast, which was itself followed by a chewing out from the colonel, and then getting his hair cut wasn't exactly something to call home, or Bill, about. Flashback He set down the tray as he sank down onto the bench at the bare-metal table, beside the white wall. Jim sat across from him in the green uniform, like the one he'd just barely changed into, and then Colonel Oates asked, \"What did you think of your walk, Cadet ?\" ' It was bogus, except for the rabbit ' Bill ' . ' \"Bodacious, Colonel.\" \"Don't lie to me, Logan. What did you really think of it ?\" \"Most of it was quite tiring and horrendous, sir.\" \"Good, now, that was your first lesson, Cadets. If anyone else thinks their funny or want's to get funny, don't follow in Cadet Logy's footsteps or you'll be catching up to him in no time and tripping yourselves.\" It made him cringe when the others laughed except for Jim and the dark-olive skinned, dark-brown haired man next to him. Said man in a very quiet voice introduced himself as, \"Soren Mason.\" End Flashback He looked over at Jim and Soren, Soren looked nervous and kind of green as they stopped in a line in front of the range. Jim asked, \"Are you all right, Soren ?\" Soren answered, \"N-no.\", as he wrung his hands together. Noticed that Soren was eyeing the pair of earmuffs and eye-goggles like it was going to snap him in half like Genghis on a horrendously bad day. Slowly, he reached around Jim to put a hand on Soren's shoulder, \"What's wrong, man ?\" \"I-I, ah, I'm not t-too great wi-with guns.\" \" You ' re, like, stupendous at this stuff, Ted, try something. \" ' Are you sure, Bill ? Err, voice that sounds like Bill ? ' \" Yeah, dude, you ' re basically radical. \" \"You'll do fine, they're not going to try n' bite you, Soren. All you have to do is keep a good stance, grip and aim n' then, well, you'll be soaring.\" They laughed quietly and Jim muttered, \"Soaring Soren, I think that'll be your nickname now.\" The whisper faded before Colonel Oates stopped beside them and the shorter man questioned, \"Do you want to know something, Cadets ? Like, why I have yet to hand you over to Sergeant O'Hare or Sergeant Smith, Cadets ?\" A general response of, \"Yes, sir.\" The colonel started walking down the line, looking up at, nearly, every one of them and eyeing them critically before he said, \"The reason is rather simple, in all my time running this academy I've never had so many people signed up for discipline and authority problems. So, I will make sure that when you leave my academy either you will leave worthy of its name, or you will leave it crying in shame.\" ' Heh, that last bit rhymed. ' \" Dude, Ted, again , focus on what he said. \" ' Oh, right, thanks man. Ye-ah, that doesn ' t sound fun. It sounds like that depressingly bogus iron maiden thing the royal ugly dude wanted to put us in. ' \" It is really harsh, but you can do it, Ted, I know you can. Besides shouldn ' t you earn those awesome lessons I ' m going to teach you ? Or rather that real Bill is ? \" Out of habit, he started smiling until he remembered what the colonel had said about visible emotions making you vulnerable to enemies and that was going to be stopped while at the academy. ' What if you think of something really funny ? Or someone runs straight into a brick wall while getting chased by, like, snails because their terrified of them ? Like when it happened to Maurice Phillips way back in Gr. 2. Seriously, this poker face thing is hard. ' Someone, a girl, asked, \"What if you don't agree with an order, sir ?\" \"Unless in the very unlikely occurrence that you are given permission to disobey, you will obey it anyway, or you will be punished with whatever I think is necessary for you to learn. Tell me, Cadet Wilson, what is this place ?\" He looked down the line to see a girl with red-hair and tan-skin who replied, \"It's a gun range, sir.\" ' I really, really do need to pay more attention to things. ' \"Does anyone wish to elaborate on Cadet Wilson's very lengthy response ?\" It surprised him that Soren answered, in a steady voice, \"It's a place to train and use all manner of guns and rifles. Sir.\" \"Well, Cadet Mason, perhaps you can also do a demonstration for us. Get out a Colt from the gun storage, ammo from its storage and do a test round. Guns on the right, Ammos on the left.\" Soren nodded, stepped out of the line and walked over to the pair of big, silver warehouses as the colonel continued, following Soren, \"Every time you need a weapon for exercises, you will approach one of the Sergeants or myself. Otherwise, you will be reprimanded and punished for trying to break in without authorization. Is that clear, Cadets ?\" \"Sir, yes, sir.\" A few minutes later, he was cringing from behind his table as Soren missed the target for the fourth time; the bullet, probably, flew through the fence and into the prairie beyond. He barely held back the cheer as the next two bullets actually hit the target's center. Colonel Oates growled at Soren, \"You need to vastly improve your aim, Cadet Stone, your aim's as bad, if not worse, than a drunken statue's.\" ' Drunk statues ? I thought that was, like, impossible, unless you were tripping. Then again, I did, probably, get suckered by a sanctimonious, and likely lying, time-travelling dude. ' Then it was the rest of theirs turn, it wasn't surprising since he'd been practicing for a few years that he hit the target every time. When he was done, he ejected the magazine and then cleared the rounds from the chamber, before locking the safety and putting it down. It startled him when the graying, dark-brown haired man said, \"Nice work, Logy, it's seems your practice with your father did pay off. Today, I will inform Sergeant O'Hare that yourself and Cadet Mason will be using the range at 1300 hundred hours tomorrow afternoon so that he can supervise. Cadet Stone can use all the help he can get.\" \"Ah, thank-you, Colonel and yes, sir, we'll be here.\" ' A compliment ? Whoa, but what sort of time is 1300 hours ? Where ' s Bill, or sound-alike Bill, when I need him ? ' \" Right here, buddy. That means it ' s going to be, like, one o ' clock in the afternoon tomorrow. 1400 hours is two o ' clock and so on. \" ' S. Bill why are you in my head ? ' \" You don ' t think it, but, you ' re really stressed out, man. I ' m just here to help you cope until you don ' t need me anymore. \" Colonel Oates left him to walk down the line to, as he leaned out to see, check on Cadet Wilson. Almost suddenly, the colonel was calling for a cease-fire and they were locking up the Colts before heading to the mess hall for lunch.[Chapter 4] Call Ted knew he was dreaming when he was laid out on his bed at home, and Bill walked in. As he looked up, the curly-haired blond asked, \"How's it going ?\" \"Well, it's not completely bogus since I made some new friends. Still, most of it's boring and there's, like, a hellacious lot of running. It's killing me, I mean, dude, this week my whole body's been hurting like crazy.\" \"Think about it for a second, Ted. It's like a whole new routine, take for example my guitar lessons, it's majorly confusing at first and then it gets easier as you memorize it. Plus, it'll be totally worth it, dude, you'll have babes hanging all over you.\" The thought, ' Well, what if I don ' t want them ? ' , echoed in his head as he was awoken by a shout of, \"Wake up, you sorry excuses for cadets ! Atten-tion !\" After a week of it, he didn't even stumble, much less fall out of bed, as he got up and stood at the foot of the bed. The first time it'd happened on Sunday they'd all gotten yelled at for being lazy and not standing straight enough, then they'd had to do two extra laps around the academy. Shook himself out of it and looked at Sergeant O'Hare, as the man walked along the aisle towards him. The sergeant had short, blond-hair and bright-green eyes. ' I can ' t believe how helpful he was on Sunday. Soren and I would never have gotten those tips otherwise. Sergeant O ' Hare was a lot nicer than Sergeant Smith. Then again, Sergeant Smith ' s even older than Colonel Oates and he doesn ' t like the way I talk. At least, after that incident, Sergeant O ' Hare was awesome enough to explain that using too much slang can mess up orders n ' stuff. ' When the man had stopped surveying them, he said in a regular tone, \"At ease, now today is a good day for you, because it is the day that you're allowed to call home for twenty minutes. You will have this opportunity once a week or every two if it is revoked. You have from 600 hours this morning up until 800 hours this evening. If you forget, even if you are only two minutes late, you will wait until next week. Is that clear ?\" ' Yes, finally ! Ah, only twenty ? Only twenty, that ' s bogus. Doesn ' t matter, except a little, but, who am I going to call first ? Dad and Deacon or Bill ? ' He wasn't the only one who's, \"Yes, Sergeant O'Hare.\", was obviously trying to suppress the happiness that wanted to escape. \"Good, now dismissed to the mess hall.\" When he walked into the mess hall, the white-haired, tanned-skinned and gray-eyed Sergeant Smith gave him the stink eye. Four hours later, he was waiting for his turn at the payphone behind the red-haired female cadet Maria; they'd started calling her 'Wilful' Wilson after she'd stood up to Sergeant Smith's totally heinous and sexist attitude on Wednesday during tactics class. ' Now, that ' s a dude who really needs to loosen up. I know he ' s awesome deep down and all for his six tours, but, it ' s not World War 1 anymore. Dude, focus, she ' s got thirty seconds. ' He could barely restrain himself from checking his watch yet, again; since he'd finally remembered to wind it after the all-day physical course on Monday. It almost made him sigh in relief as Maria said, \"Yeah, we'll talk again next week, Mom, Bye.\", and hung up. Maria turned and slipped past him and the others, as he walked up to the phone and dialled home first. Seconds later, his dad answered with, \"Logan Household.\" ' Why couldn ' t it have been Deacon ? At least, he ' d be excited about my calling home to ask if I ' d done any cool stuff yet. I ' d have stuff to tell him too. ' The memory of his dad's, \"Stupid band.\", comments echoed in his head. He, awkwardly, managed, \"Uh, hey, dad.\" It surprised him when dad, almost, sounded happy, \"I have to say I'm happy I have yet to get a call about you from the academy. So, what do you think about it, Ted ?\" \"It's tiring, but it's not bad. I mean, Sergeant O'Hare is an awesome dude and I've made a few friends.\" \"See this is why I sent you to Oates. To, finally, respect authority and get some actual, productive friends, instead of that layabout Preston.\" \"Bill's not a layabout, dad, he's my best friend.\" Dad's answer was an angry, \"If you call him your best friend, I don't want to think about who you call your worst. I'll pick you up for Christmas, that's it.\", and then the phone went dead. Slowly, he shook his head as he hung up, and then picked it up again before he dialled Bill's house. Checked him watch and saw that he still had fifteen minutes; this time, his heart thudded in his throat as he waited an eternity for someone to pick up. ' Please let it be Bill, please let it be him. ' Disappointment flooded through him as Missy answered, \"Hello ?\" \"Err, hi, Missy, it's Ted. Is Bill at home ?\" \"He's at those guitar lessons, I think. Oh, wait a second.\" In the background he heard the door open and close, Bill's voice asked, \"Who is it, Mi, ah, Mom ?\" \"It's Ted.\" The sound of an enthusiastic, \"Awesome !,\" as Bill raced over to the phone. Bill said, \"Ted\", at the same time that he replied, \"Bill.\" A simultaneous, \"Dude, stop it.\", had them both laughing. ' God, I missed him, I didn ' t really realize just how much until now. ' \"So, is Alaska bogus or what, man ? I've been, like, majorly heinously dying to know since you left.\" \"Some of it's like really tiring, it's all the running and the training courses. Seriously, my legs are still sore from on Monday and Friday. I've made a few friends too, Jim Moss, Soren Mason and, uh, Maria Wilson.\" \"Cool, so did you tell them about Wyld Stallyns ?\" \"You think I couldn't ? Jim and Maria think it's awesome. Did you find a guy for those guitar lessons yet ?\" \"Yeah, and, dude, you won't believe who it is.\" ' It can ' t be, that ' s like a one-in-a-million chance. That ' s like impossible. ' His excitement and his disbelief warred with each other as he exclaimed, \"No way, dude, no-freaking-way ! That's, like, you're bluffing, Bill Preston, you've gotta be bluffing, aren't you ?\" Bill laughed as he answered, \" Yes way ! Eddie Van Halen is teaching me to play guitar for free ! He said, \"Rufus said to tell you that he sent me as a sign that he wasn't lying to either of you. Whatever that means, man, let's see what you can do.\" So, Ted, do you think we still got conned ? I mean, if he was bogus and lying about us, why would he send Eddie Van Halen to teach me to teach you how to play guitar ?\" ' Eddie Van Halen. Eddie Van Halen ! Is teaching Bill, who ' s going to teach me ! ' \"You've got a bodacious point there. It really wouldn't make sense, so, I guess we're not getting conned after all. How are they going ? Man, I wish I could be there, it sounds majorly awesome.\" \"I know, I do too, it's just not the same without you, Ted, and you're missing a majorly awesome time. Oh, dude, Deacon's here too, he got in a fight with your dad about you being in Alaska cause he wanted to go along.\" \"Huh, I just had a fight with my dad about Alaska and you, that's odd, man. Hey, could you put Deacon on for me ?\" \"Sure, dude.,\" The sound of Bill pulling the phone away and shouting, \"Deacon, Ted wants to talk to you.\" He almost laughed at the shout of, \"Hi, Ted !\" as he heard Deacon thundering down the staircase, likely, from Bill's room. When Deacon got the phone he answered, \"Hey, Deacon.\" \"Have you done cool stuff yet ? Have you, have you ?\" \"Of course, I did. You know on Monday I saw this, like, really weird white eagle sitting on the barracks roof.\" \"Aw, man that's so cool.\" There was a tap on his shoulder from Jim, who also muttered, \"Forty seconds, Teddy.\" In response, he nodded and reluctantly, said, \"I've got to go now, Deacon. Tell Bill I'll call him next week, or the week after, 'kay ?\" \"Yeah, I miss you, Ted.\" \"You too, Deacon. Bye.\" \"Bye.\" Now, it was his turn to hang up first and as he spun on his heel, despite the fact he'd just heard from Bill and Deacon, he felt a lot more alone then before he'd called. Still, Eddie Van Halen was teaching Bill guitar. He grinned and it felt a bit odd after a whole week of trying to keep a straight face no matter what.[Chapter 5] Scrape Ted stared at the back of Jim's head as he ran; he'd been doing that a lot since he'd called Bill. It was totally, ridiculously, heinous that they suddenly had to look so alike, it'd started messing up his dreams. Even though Jim's hair was darker than Bill's, he supposed to his mind it didn't really matter because he wanted Bill to be here. ' What would ' ve happened if Bill had come here too ? Bill would be pretty good at this running, seeing when Missy first started dating Mr. Preston he took to running around to keep his mind off it. He could ' ve just gone to the range with me, we could ' ve talked then … Jim and Maria might be interested in Wyld Stallyns, but I miss being able to really talk about it. ' Jim was doing better at the running than him. Nearly everyone was, but, he'd gotten a lot better in the last three weeks, his body had stopped hurting after every run and course so, it was a start, at least. Lately, it had started raining a lot and this morning it had started to snow a bit. Behind him Sergeant Smith snarled, \"Another lap, Logan.\" and he took a deep breath, before he ran past Soren, Jim and Maria as his friends stopped by the gatehouse. ' I told the sergeant when it happened and, again, last week that I didn ' t mean to do it. Those fighting lessons are radical and he did sneak up on me, so I ended up hitting him. It ' s partially his own fault he got hit. Ugh, I ' ve been doing this for what a week ? Sucks that S. Bill disappeared and I haven ' t seen rabbit Bill … hey ! It ' s rabbit Bill, aw crap, eagle ! ' He threw himself on the ground as the white eagle, that'd been hanging around the academy for some reason, flew inches over his head. As he raised himself up, a bit of stinging told him that he'd scraped his palms on the still thawing gravel. Sergeant Smith exclaimed, as the old man stopped beside him, \"Logan ! Why are we getting dive-bombed by a fucking bird ?\" As he rubbed his palms on the back of his shirt, he replied, \"Sir, I don't know, sir.\" \"That's fair enough. Now, go to the infirmary, get cleaned up and then finish your lap.\" \"Thank you, sir, I swear I will, Sergeant Smith.\" The white-haired man nodded and gestured him away, so he started on his way back to the gatehouse. Maria, Soren and Jim were waiting, Maria wondered, \"What're you doing back so soon, Teddy ?\" In response, he raised his palms, \"Well, Wilful, I nearly got brained by that eagle. I've got to get cleaned up and finish the lap.\" Jim winced, \"That looks painful, I'm just surprised he let you go first.\" Soren nodded, patted his shoulder and urged him toward the infirmary. When he got inside the white tilted and plastered room, Sergeant O'Hare was there sitting on one of the beds. The green-eyed man raised blond eyebrows, \"What are you doing here, Cadet ?\" \"Almost got attacked by a white eagle, sir. Can I ask about you ?\" When Sergeant O'Hare tilted his head he saw the darkening bruise, \"Mmhm, you see Logan, Gate Officer Monroe decided he didn't like me, anymore, and I got punched for it. So, what'd you do to get attacked by an eagle ?\" That made him chuckle, \"I saved a little rabbit from it the day I arrived. It reminded me of my friend Bill, since it had kind of curly, blond fur. I guess it wanted to get back at me for that.\" \"Hmm, is it a cute rabbit, at least, apart from that ?\" ' Did he just, does he ? Can I … could I tell him ? I mean, I haven ' t even told Jim, Maria or Soren. ' He blushed slightly as he admitted, \"Yeah, it totally is.\" \"Does the rabbit know about that ?\" \"No, sir and my dad doesn't want me to admit that I like the rabbit.\" Sergeant O'Hare shook his head, \"It's a shame that is, some people are really quite understanding. Well, if it doesn't work out for some reason, there's plenty of nice rabbits around.\" \"Hmm, well, I'm hoping it won't come to that.\" A nurse walked in and made small talk while she cleaned the sergeant's bruise and his palms. When he finished his run for Sergeant Smith and got to the mess hall, he noticed that everyone was waiting. The graying dark-brown haired colonel raised an eyebrow, \"Why are you late, Logan ?\" He looked down into the colonel's gray-eyes as he answered, \"Sir, Sergeant Smith and I were dive-bombed by an eagle. I got scraped and had to go to the infirmary before finishing my run, thus resulting in my being late, Colonel Oates, sir.\" The shorter man nodded, \"Eat something, Logan, considering you've all been doing well for starting out. I've arranged an outing to a near-by town by bus. Yes, even for you Cadet Logy.\" ' Yes, thank you, Colonel Oates. No walking today ! I wonder where rabbit Bill went ? I didn ' t see him when I was finishing the lap. Did the eagle get him while I was in the infirmary ? That ' d be heinous, I hope the little dude ' s okay. Aw man, I forgot to tell Deacon about rabbit Bill. He would ' ve thought it was awesome. ' Time blurred as he ate and then he, Jim, Soren and Maria were sitting on the bus, waiting to leave the academy.[Chapter 6] Town Some instinct had made Ted wander away from Jim and others, past a white-skirted, black-trimmed pawnshop into a litter-strewn, but otherwise clean alley. ' I wonder if Rufus is anywhere around here ? I mean I ' ve felt bad for weeks since I said he lied to us. Okay, whoa, that guy ' s huge. ' Said man was probably about 6'5, still with tanned-skin despite the slew of clouds/rain/drizzle lately, the man's hair was shoulder-length, deep brown and sort of wavy/fluffy, while the man's eyes were a cold, dull-brown. Found himself cringing away as the man loomed over him. Seconds later, the man almost seemed to, was the guy sniffing him ? As it started to snow, there was a gravelly rumble, \"You smell like rabbit…like food.\" ' Ah, I don ' t like this. I don ' t like this at all, S. Bill where are you ? ' \" Just run, dude, run like hell. I don ' t want you getting eaten by some cannibalistic dickweed. \" A hand landed on his shoulder and then, \"Ted, I think we should be leaving now.\" \"Rufus…ah.\" The tall, short graying, blond-haired time-traveller was suddenly pulling him backwards so fast he nearly fell. It was only when Rufus had neared a little coffee shop that they stopped. After he was released, he turned and said, \"I'm sorry I got mad and called you a liar Rufus.\" Rufus nodded, \"I know, it's just too bad you have to wait until Christmas while everyone else gets to visit home earlier. Well, you'll have a nice present at least.\" He grinned, \"I know, it'll be awesome when I finally get to see Bill again. Rufus…why did, how could he tell that I smell like rabbit ? I can't smell it, so how could he ?\" \"I'm sorry, Ted, but you're going to have find that out yourself.\" ' Rufus knows what that was about ? So, it ' s got something to do with the future then ? ' Figured that he must have said it out loud because Rufus answered, \"Yes, yes, it does. Now, you should go down the street and turn right you'll run into Maria. That's all the help I can give you for now. Good luck, Ted.\" \"Thanks, Rufus.\" After he said thanks, he half-turned to see Rufus swiftly walking away from him to disappear into the swiftly thickening snow. Since he knew he could trust the 'traveller, he followed Rufus' instructions and Maria, literally, ran into him as he turned the corner. His red-haired friend looked relieved, \"There you are Teddy, we've been looking for you. Where'd you go ? It's time for lunch.\" \"Oh, yeah, I wandered off and ran into this totally heinous, huge, grizzly bear-looking dude. This one other guy helped me get away, but then he like disappeared into the snow. Where are we going ?\" \"A place called Warren's Diner, apparently they've got elk burgers from what Major Mann said.\" Major Mann was the light-blond, brown-eyed woman who would start teaching them survival classes on Monday and eventually start arranging survival exercises. \"Maria, what's an elk ? Is that like a fruit or something ?\" \"It's like a deer, but bigger and with more antlers, they're also white and brown-furred.\" That didn't help anything, \"What's a deer ?\" \" It ' s brown-furred and got four-legs, it ' s like, like a really big dog. \" ' Oh, you mean veal ' s or was it venison ' s ? My mom used to make those when you ' d come over for supper, remember ? ' \" Dude, that was awesome. What happened to your mom anyway ? \" As he followed Maria down the street, he answered S. Bill, ' I don ' t know, my Dad doesn ' t like talking about it. Whenever I ' d ask he ' d get mad and send me to my room, so I stopped asking. ' \" What if she was like a bodacious super secret spy babe or something and she had to leave to keep you guys safe ? I bet she was hot if you look anything like her. \" It was a weird thing/messed-up comment for S. Bill to 'say' and it still got an odd blush from him. ' If only real Bill would say something like that. Well, not that, but … ah, well, uh, something like it. Damn it, Ted, shut up you ' re not supposed to think it either. Well, Dr. Freud could ' ve tried to help me with it. ' Maria and he had entered a huge, dark-brown wood panelled diner with cracked, dark-blue seat covers. ' Ooh, shiny, focus, focus, man. You ' re getting really weird S. Bill and shut up. ' \" Sorry, Ted. \" At one of the longer center, tables Soren ran a hand through his dark-brown hair and nudged Jim before calling, \"Glad you made it back, Teddy. Jim move your chair over would you ?\" \"Sure, I will buddy. Grab a chair, will ya ?\" ' Soren sure has gotten a lot more confident since we met the first day, hasn ' t he ? ' Soren's dark-olive skin was a nice contrast compared to the cold and snow outside as he grabbed a chair from an empty table, then sat between his friends. Major Mann walked around from the other side and up to him, the slightly shorter woman asked, \"Are you all right, Cadet Logan ? According to your friends you were gone for a while.\" \"I'm fine, thank you for asking, Major.\" He did end up trying and liking the elk burger, leading him to wonder if Bill would like it too. Though, of course, eventually they had to go back to the academy, still it was a nice day overall.[Chapter 7] Survival Ted sighed as he let the pack fall into the deep snow, before he started scooping out a hollow and pulled some paper scraps to put in the hollow along with two stones to strike over it. Pulled off his gloves and started hitting the stones, after a while there was a tiny spark and he started blowing on it. They'd gone from open plains/tundra to a bit of a pine forest yesterday, so the fire would have to be watched more than ever. Around him, the others settled their packs as Major Mann was making the camp radius, while an owl, who was likely waking up, hooted somewhere near-by. It was only Soren, himself, Maria and Major Mann who were allowed to participate in the exercise now. Maria had 'broken' her leg 'falling into a burrow'. As for Jim - he was 'dead', he'd been 'killed' by a fall into a stream and hitting his head on a rock. While Jim and Maria would be camped on the outer ring, Soren was getting out the dead birds that Maria had caught this morning. Currently, they were two days out from the academy. ' I don ' t think I ' d be really be willing to eat if she ' d caught a rabbit, it ' d look too much like rabbit Bill. Huh, I wonder how many of Sergeant O ' Hare ' s group are still alive ? Probably more than ours, Sergeant Smith will have even more than the most of ours. I wonder if old Oates misses doing exercises like this, it seems like something he ' d enjoy doing. ' He'd just got the fire going when the major barked, \"Logan, your hand is burned by the flames. You're down to your left hand and your feet, you've got morning watch and Soren's got evening.\" ' Oh no, my hand it burns, it burns. Oh god, I am totally ridiculous, suppose I might as well practice wrapping with my left hand. ' \"Yes, Major.\" Maria muttered playfully, \"You're dead next Teddy.\" A pair of birds flew by overhead and he replied, \"Your birds got away again, go and get 'em, Wilful.\" Maria chuckled, \"Too much like work, I'm almost 'dead', you ass. Soaring, go get Teddy your nuts won't you ?\" Jim broke in, \"Ah, that's too much work, he can just have mine with those birds o' yours.\" They all laughed, even Major Mann, as Soren dug out some nuts they'd found buried in the snow at lunch along with a few herbs he'd managed to dig up at the same time. It was hard practicing bandage wrapping with his less coordinated hand, it was even harder un-doing and laying out his sleeping bag for later. Since the town outing four days ago, S. Bill had stuck around to keep him company again. ' Birds, nuts and herbs, what ' dya think of that S. Bill ? ' The chuckled response from S. Bill, \" You ' re all nuts, dude, completely and utterly nuts. \" Mentally he sighed and wondered, ' How much time till I get back to real you, S. Bill ? ' \" Way too much thyme, if you ask me. \" That made him chuckle to himself as, once again, he wished he was home. Hell, he missed everybody so badly; he wouldn't even have minded seeing his dad just for a second. When he finally managed to get the wrap right, the stars had already come out and supper was ready. After he unwrapped his hand, he ate listening to the others talking quietly about home - Jim was from Louisiana, Maria was from North Carolina and Soren was from South Dakota. The next topic they got to was music and Soren asked, \"Ted, didn't you say you're in a band ?\" Major Mann raised an eyebrow as he answered, \"Yeah, Wyld Stallyns, with my best friend Bill. Though, we're not quite so good at the music part yet. Bill's going to start teaching me what he learned in guitar lessons at Christmas.\" Conversation moved to favourite books and he let himself drift out of it. It was a good supper, but he would be glad to start heading back for the academy tomorrow morning. ' Dear God, it ' s almost Christmas, I can almost see Bill again, soon. Deacon too, can ' t forget him … I wish I could take rabbit Bill home to show actual Bill; he ' d find it weird too. ' Something happened when he lay down in his sleep bag - it was like he suddenly merged with the ground underneath him; something shifted in a hidden burrow, while at the same time he twitched his ears at the loud sounds above him, and his fur brushed against the walls. Still, as he fell asleep it merged into one of his, lately very weird, dreams. He shuddered and cowered into the grass as something impossibly huge and dark-blue/green roared past him. It was too loud, far, far too loud and then he felt more vibrations through the ground, then saw along with heard something huge above him. Talons wrapped around his stomach, lifting him as he squealed in panic. The hawk pulled him against its stomach, then one foot released and started…petting him ? It was a gentle movement, then softly rumbled words, \"Ssh, that thing's not going to hurt you, Bill's not gonna let it hurt you.\" The warmth faded away slowly and then he woke up missing Bill terribly. For a half asleep second, he sensed that Soren stood over him, gently shaking him as he opened his eyes. So, he got out of the sleeping bag to sit by the fire. It was rather quiet except for the owl for a long time, then as Maria was murmuring in her sleep and Jim's snoring got louder a white snowshoe rabbit popped up from under his sleeping bag to eye him warily. ' First I have bogus dreams about being a rabbit and now another one comes up to me. Mm, maybe it ' s one of rabbit Bill ' s little friends. Look at that, it ' s got red eyes, I don ' t think I ' ve seen one with red eyes before. As long as it ' s not crazy like that eagle it ' s cool. ' Then the rabbit slowly crept up to sit down beside him until it was daylight and then disappeared back into its hole under his bag. He somehow knew it didn't want him to show its hole to anyone, not that he would have. ' Finally, time to start back to the academy. ' Three days later, he sighed in relief as he sat down on his bed; leaned over to pull the brown suitcase from under the bed to put his gloves away and get out a fresh towel for his shower. After he'd put the gloves on top of everything else, he dug for the towel and pulled it out to see a letter with 'Theodore' written across it in fancy handwriting settled at the very bottom. ' How did I miss this when I got the suitcase out for the first time ? ' \" Ted, you were pretty heinously angry/stressed out then, no one would ' ve thought you ' d see it. C ' mon man, let ' s see what it ' s about. Open it, open it, it ' s probably from your mom ' cause I ' ve never seen your dad use girly handwriting. \" ' Maybe it ' s about why she left, maybe she couldn ' t handle dad ' s strictness. Maybe she knew I ' d need help dealing with dad. ' His hands shook slightly as he moved to sit back against the wall and carefully opened the letter: My dearest little Theodore, I know you probably won't have seen me for a long time when you read this, but I hope you're doing good. You might notice that you're easily distracted some times, can't hold a thought for long or become overly paranoid if you feel threatened or scared - there's a reason for that. You're little brother/sister will be here soon, and in my family it's tradition to tell the 'family secret' to the oldest first so that if they have siblings they can explain it later. Now, you've probably gone through some weird things growing up like - empathizing with animals, or more importantly merging with the nearest animal. Normally, the animal you merge with is the one that you can shift or transform into. With my family it's normally rabbits, your father's family as far as we know is just normal without shifting blood. In case you have any…odd troubles if you run into any eagles of any kind, they're normally a very loosely connected family, but some of them will shred you if they don't like you just because you've got prey blood. I've had a bit of trouble with a family of eagle shifters in the past, it's because the eagle's great-grandfather went back on a deal with your great-grandfather and then blamed him for it. I've managed to evade Morton Smith for about three or four years at a time, I've kept really quiet so I'm hoping to be able to raise your sibling for a little bit before he gets too close for our safety. When he does, I'll leave and your dad will protect you as long as he can to keep Morton from finding you. Your father's more strict with you not only because of Morton, but because your first shift, if you do shift at all, if your emotions and such aren't in control, can happen any time, anywhere and you could be stuck for days or months on end in animal form. If you get stuck unless you find a safe place or someone to take care of you, you'd be in great danger for the above reasons. That's why I'm hoping that if you do end up being a shifter that it's only after you're done high school. There are some other shifter families in San Dimas, but I don't know their human names, we didn't talk much about human things - one of them's a family of scorpions and another's a family of goshawks. You might even know them and not know it at all, there may even be some that I don't know. Either way, I wish you the best luck with your life, Mom In shock, he closed it and went to put it away, he'd dropped the envelope on the floor. Slowly, like an out of body experience, as he picked it up, he noticed a photo it was of his dad, mom and himself as a baby while mom held him; he was holding the worn black rabbit plushy that dad had never gotten rid of, even when Deacon had nearly ripped it's head off at age four. In it, his mom had long, wavy black-hair, pale-skin and dark-eyes, she wore a long, black dress with purple swirls on it. ' This … how can this be real ? B-but it has to be real, there ' s no reason mom would lie to me, she ' s not around so she wouldn ' t get anything out of it. D-did that eagle attack me not because I saved rabbit Bill, but because with my hair at shoulder-length I looked so much like mom ? Is that white eagle really Morton Smith ? Is he trying to get at me because he can ' t find her ? It does explain some of dad ' s curfews and stuff like that, so there he really was just trying to protect me, doesn ' t explain why he ' s so against me telling Bill how I feel though. I suppose there ' s not an answer for everything, but if we do save the future Bill and I can make it not matter anymore. The letter explains why that rabbit sat by me and felt like it could trust me, why I felt like I could understand it. Still, now that I know this … is rabbit Bill just a regular rabbit or is rabbit Bill a relative of actual Bill ? How do you tell the difference between a regular rabbit and a shifter rabbit ? ' Soren asked, startling him into dropping the photo that Soren caught and looked at for a second, \"Is that a picture of your family ? Your mom looks like she's really nice.\" He looked up running a hand through his hair as he replied, \"Yeah, except my little brother Deacon wasn't born yet, but I don't really remember my mom.\" Green-eyes turned sad but also curious as Soren handed the photo back, \"Oh, did something happen to her ?\" Gently, he tucked the picture back in with the letter and tucked it back in the suitcase, \"She had to leave because she got in a fight with someone over an old family feud and they wouldn't leave her alone.\" Soren suddenly slammed a fist into his open palm, \"Feuds are fucking stupid, Ted. When I tried stopping the one my dad had going with the Mason family, they live across the street from us, he sent me here to 'learn respect' for old things. It's so stupid and pointless, you shouldn't hate somebody just cause your parents say you have to, like my mom tried doing with me and Allison Mason. She said Allison had ruined my Gr. 2 art project, but when I asked Allie she said it was David Johnson who'd done it, not her.\" Since it seemed that Soren's rant was finished, he nodded and said, \"They really are, but I think I'm going to go take a shower now. Hey, are you going home for Christmas, since you went home for Thanksgiving ?\" As he got up Soren shook his head, \"Nope, I got the choice of going home for either Thanksgiving or Christmas, but not both. Are you going home for Christmas ?\" \"Yep, I can't wait to get home. Yet it's hard to believe we've been here for what a month, two months, three ? Something like that anyways.\" Excitement coursed through him at the thought, but as he remembered the letter and mom's warning about possibly shifting, he calmed down. ' I wouldn ' t want to get stuck as a rabbit all the way up here and try to find my way back home then. Holy shit it ' s back again. ' His excitement turned to fear as, when he walked into the barracks light-green bathrooms/ shower stalls, he saw the white eagle perching on the small window ledge outside. It flared its huge wings and hit the glass with its beak, obviously trying to shatter it and get at him. Jim wandered in with his own bathroom things, his friend looking at him was worried as his southern accent was more noticeable, \"Wha's the problem, Ted ?\" \"It's that heinously persistent eagle again, Jim. It just won't go away.\" The dark-blond started shouting, \"Ah, you old fa-therbag you go 'way, yer not wanted 'ere. Go awn, git your feathered ass outta 'ere.\" Morton or whoever it was had winged away from the window, smacked it with their talons and flown away with an angry screech. ' That thing has got to be Morton Smith or someone from his family, a regular eagle wouldn ' t go to this length to get at me. Feuds really are bogus, oh thank God, he ' s gone … for now. God I hope I can at least have Christmas without worrying about him. If he does show up, I hope dad shoots him or something. Ugh, enough of this I need to take a shower. ' So, he did take a shower and then he went to bed. He fell asleep, into a nightmare of his mom and Bill being attacked by Morton/the eagle. At least, they were until she shifted into rabbit form and ran off with the eagle close behind her, leading it away from Bill.[Chapter 8] Holiday For Ted the next few weeks flew by in a blur of classes, exams and exercises, interspersed with white eagle fly-bys and more scrapes. Seeming an instant later, he was saying a temporary good-bye to the last of his friends before getting off the plane. Said plane which had already been delayed by damage just before they'd taken off again in South Dakota, so the others would probably only get home really late or early on Christmas itself. He hugged Maria, \"See you in a few days, Maria. Stay wilful won't you ?\" \"Oh, I will don't worry, say hi to Bill for me ?\" They pulled away as he replied, \"Mmhm, tell your mom the same.\" She nodded and then he turned to the dark-blond as Jim clapped him on the shoulder, \"Don't get in too much trouble with yer old man, Teddy, I wanna see ya back on here.\" \"I'll try not too, but I can't promise anything. Tell Pa Moss I said hello.\" \"Course I will. See ya later, buddy.\" Again, he nodded and picked up his suitcase before walking out of the plane. 'It's odd not seeing any snow after getting used to it. Hey, there's dad, too bad Deacon's not here. I guess he's still with Bill, oh god, I can finally see him today or tomorrow.' Dad, still in his uniform, who'd been leaning against the car, walked around and opened the trunk for him. It was slightly awkward as he put the suitcase away because Dad kept staring at him like dad'd never seen him before. 'At least, if it was Bill it would make sense and it'd feel nice instead.' They got in the car as dad started the car and, again, looked at him, he finally muttered, \"Eer...hi, dad. So, uh, how've you been ?\" 'I know Deacon and Bill are good, besides the fact that I wouldn't tell Bill when I was getting home. I just couldn't ever phone dad and ask about mom/the shifting thing, because too many people were around to hear it.' The car started moving and he stared at the empty road for a bit before dad finally answered, \"It's odd not having you and Deacon around the house, since he's still staying at Al-Mr. Preston's house. The house feels weird when it's quiet without your...ah, music.\" \"Heh, radical. But, why'd you always call Mr. Preston that ? Mom always called Mrs. Preston, Daisy, but I've heard you call him by his first name.\" A hand brushed over the black moustache briefly, not doing a good job of covering a snarl. Another odd thought, 'He's gonna attack me, hide. Find some place to hide, safe place, dark place.' , and he found himself trying to push himself into the shadows of the passenger door. Meanwhile, dad had gone into a rant, \"Ironically, we were a lot like yourself and William, the best of friends, at least, until he tried to steal your mother from me, after she came back from Alaska with me. I didn't mind her going over to visit Daisy, but then they had their kids on the same day, at the same time, in the same damned room. After that I, foolishly, hoped that would be the end of it. Of course, your mother started planning play-dates and you and William were the best of friends. So much so that when she left I couldn't help you, only he could and then eventually you started doing even more things together. Then that, that band of yours started and it felt like William was trying to steal you from me like Allen tried stealing your mother, because I hardly ever saw you at all.\" 'Alaska ? Mom was from Alaska ? Is that why dad sent me to Oates ? Well, besides Morton, probably. I've never heard how dad met mom.' \"So, like, how'd you meet Mom in Alaska ?\" Dad nodded as the was pulled over to the side, \"I'd taken a week off to go hunting in the winter. I'd just seen a giant moose walk out of a bunch of trees. Suddenly, it bolted and I got attacked by an, I figured starving, old white wolf. The wolf got me real good in the leg and I couldn't feel it because it'd gone numb from the snow. I thought I was going to die in that clearing until this rabbit hopped to sit beside my head, I thought I was imagining it when the rabbit put its paws on my arm. Remember thinking my death was assured when the rabbit suddenly turned into a beautiful woman and back into a rabbit. Don't know how long I waited there, but then more rabbit's showed up and turned into people. When I woke up Emily quietly told me about how the old wolf had really been old Mr. Quentin, that she and her family were a bunch of rabbit shifters. It didn't seem real, so I still thought I was having a fever dream or something, except it wasn't, it was real.\" His heart was thudding in his throat and he felt dizzy as the letter was verbally confirmed as true. \"Mom's letter wasn't bogus after all. I really could've turned into a rabbit whenever for whatever reason ? Why didn't you tell me that was why you were always so strict ? Why didn't you ever tell me the range was probably as much because of, possibly, shifting as my being gay ?\" Nothing could have made him expect dad to unclip his seatbelt and turn to him. \"I thought if I didn't tell you that Morton Smith wouldn't be able to find you and Deacon. I didn't want to risk it, but you kept on hanging out with William and I thought if you shifted in front of him, he wouldn't be able to keep it quiet.\" That made him snort, \"Well, your plan went south and way past Bogusville to Fucked-up city.\", so he'd picked up a bad habit of actually swearing sometimes, it happened when one of your Sergeant's and your newer friends liked to swear, sometimes, a lot. An angry exclamation of, \"Don't you talk to me that, Theodore Logan, I'm still your father.\" Followed by, \"Wait, what ? How ?\" There was a loud thud as something slammed into the back windshield. 'How come I know who that's going to be ? Why can't the letter have explained that 'feud' of mom's family and the Smiths' ?' When he twisted, he was, of course, right. Still, he didn't expect dad to turn and snarl, \"Morton.\", in the coldest, angriest tone he'd ever heard his dad use. Neither did he expect dad to get out of the car and say, \"Ted go back home, now !\" \"How ?! I can't drive and what about you ?\" \"Driving's not that hard, plus I'm a cop I'm supposed to be able to deal with fuckers like Morton. Your Uncle Jack's dealt with worse than him, so why can't I handle one asshole ?\" That was punctuated by the echo of a gunshot and a screech of pain. 'Wahoo, go dad !' Quickly as he could he unbuckled his seat belt and slid to the driver's side, while dad helpfully called instructions. Despite that he only went a little ways away, until dad and Morton had disappeared from sight. 'Is dad gonna be okay ? I mean Morton's a fucking eagle with talons and a beak, but what if dad runs out of bullets ? It'd be heinous...why am I running ? I should be helping dad.' On that thought, he got out of the car and started running back. It was a lot easier running on bare pavement, than it was slogging through nearly thigh-deep snow in 22 degree weather. It amazed him that when he reached his dad, that Morton had flown off, blood drops peppered the way back toward the airport. Slowly, dad turned back around to look at him as the gun was holstered, Morton'd raked one of dad's cheeks leaving three shallow looking, but bloody cuts behind. Those cuts made him look at his hands, it was amazing how many scars, besides all the times he'd scraped himself on gravel because of Morton, he'd managed to build up in just a few months. Mom's letter hadn't made him clumsy, but apparently reading it had been a sign to the universe to make him have more accidents, the most asked about scar was the longest one he had, it was on his right hand and it was from the day before Thanksgiving. Flashback He looked over at Sergeant Smith both himself and the gray-eyed man had offered to help prep food for themselves and the others who'd stayed behind. There was the sound of something big hitting the roof. That, of course, made him startle, the knife slipped, and, somehow, nearly completely cut his palm open lengthwise. The sergeant must have heard his hiss, because the white-haired head turned to look at him. Surprisingly the first words weren't, \"You are a fucking idiot, Logan !\", no those were the second words. The first word was a simple, \"Infirmary.\", as the older man suddenly pressed a clean, cold and damp cloth into his palm. As they walked out of the mess hall, the sergeant said, \"You know Logan, I had something like this happen to me down in Rowanda.\", the man lifted his left hand, part of the tanned-skin was lighter because a thick horizontal scar spread across it, \"Of course, that wasn't an accident on those assholes parts. Me and my guys we got ambushed in this little hotel we were clearing - they were planning on torturing us by cutting us up. Damn glad those reinforcements got there before any of us died, well, I still nearly died because that knife was rusty and had old blood on it.\" 'Oh wow, what a thing to go through. Oh crap, fuck it's bleeding, like, a lot.' Pressed the cloth harder against the wound, more than slightly worried about all the blood that was soaking through and tried not to show it as he said, \"Oh, well...err, I'm glad you're all right, Sir. It would've been odd not having you here.\" \"No it wouldn't have, you wouldn't have known to miss me then. Just remember - keep it clean or you just might lose it.\" 'That doesn't sound very fun, that sounds extremely grody and henious. I'm not losing my hand just because of some accident. Gah, what was that ? There's a bear on the roof. Wait, how did a bear get on the roof ?' \"Dude, don't worry about how it got there, focus and fucking run !\" That bear ended up trapping himself, the sergeant and Nurse Mckay in the infirmary for hours without a useful weapon. Eventually, though it was Major Mann and Sergeant O'Hare who saved them by scaring the bear away with shotguns. End Flashback He couldn't help flexing his right hand which twinged slightly at the memory. Dad exclaimed, drawing him fully back into the present, \"What're you doing here ? I told you to go home ! \" \"I figured you probably needed help, you're gonna wanna go to the hospital when we get back so those don't get like majorly infected or something. That was the most badass thing I've ever seen you do, that was awesome ! Uncle Jack's never done anything like that, now you way cooler than him too.\" \"Heh, finally something I'll have over my little brother. I'll have to call him and tell him that. I'm guessing you want me to drop you off at Allen and William's ?\" His uncle Jack had been forced to leave with his grandmom when she'd divorced his granddad and married some guy named Mike Traven who lived up in L.A. Uncle Jack was a cop too, except that Uncle Jack was a S.W.A.T guy. They started back to the car as he answered, \"You can just drive to the hospital, I'll walk to Bill's house it's not that far after what I've done at the academy.\" For the first time ever, the silence between himself and dad in the car was comfortable instead of awkward or angry. By the time they reached the San Dimas hospital it was dark and the street lights were coming on. 'With this many lights it's barely even dark outside, this'll be easy.' It really was and he sighed in combined relief/nerves as Bill's house came into sight. The first knock was easy and seconds later Deacon was staring at him. His little brother had grown an inch or two but still grinned, \"Ted, Ted, you're back. Hey, B-\" Mr. Preston put a hand on Deacon's shoulder and ran a hand through his own red/brown-hair as he interrupted, \"Why don't you let Ted surprise him, eh ? Especially since Bill doesn't know he's here.\" Slowly, he walked into the white-walled house that was nearly as familiar as his own, up the dark-wooded stair case to stand in front of Bill's bedroom door. Quietly, he dropped the suitcase onto the floor, before he stared, briefly wrung his hands and took a deep breath before hesitantly knocking. A grumpy sounding, \"This Christmas Eve is heinously boring enough as it is, just like, go away.\" He called back, \"Unfortunately, Bill, my most wonderful of friends I happen to be stranded as the plane has already left and I'm so not walking back to Alaska. That'd be like the most compeletly and utterly bogus thing I've done in months.\" Muttered to himself, \"Besides, I'm totally exhausted as is.\" Academy instinct made him tense as the door flew open, then a much shorter blur flew into his arms with a happy shout of, \"Ted ! Dude, you're back.\" Comparatively, soft hands and arms slammed into his shoulder blades which prompted, \"Ted, my most excellent friend, you just hurt my hand and it's tingling radically.\" That made him laugh, then he shivered as pale hands drifted over his back and sides when the curly haired blond pulled away from him. Dark-brown eyes met his as Bill stared at him, before the warm gaze moved to stare at his hair which had finally really started growing again, but was still short. His gaze drifted down over his friend/love noting that Bill was wearing the same raggedly cut, pale and trim but not muscled midriff baring, white-shirt and gray sweater as when he left. It was odd that Bill looked exactly the same, but he was so different. As his friend moved past him to pick up his suit case, he walked into Bill's room. Because it was so much hotter in the house than it was outside, he ditched his jacket on the floor and sighed in relief. Then he eyed the guitar that was leaned against the wall by the closet, the one Bill would've used for his lessons. Suddenly tired, he yawned and stretched slowly. They sat down on Bill's bed, talking about random stuff after he remembered to tell Bill hi from Maria. Bill said giving him a look, \"Dude, it just doesn't seem real you having actual muscle.\" That'd made him chuckle, \"It's real alright.\", before pulled off his red jacket and his shirt. Being in the barracks had slightly dulled his sensitivity to seeing and generally being around naked people, since everyone'd been caught naked, at least, once during a surprise barracks inspection. Bill reached out slowly and, despite hugging him earlier, poked him as if expecting him to disappear in a puff of smoke. When he didn't disappear Bill's hand started sliding down his chest and trailed splayed fingers over his abs with a disbelieving, \"Dude, you're totally hard all over.\" 'I can't believe he just said that with a straight face. Doesn't he realize what that sounds like or is it only me that notices when he does that ?' He found himself trying to hold his breath, and not squirm, as Bill's fingers started back upward because it tickled even more. 'Well, he happens to be even more ticklish than I am.' A breathless laugh before with an evil grin he tackled Bill back onto the bed and as Bill hit the pillow he started his own 'attack'. Which got a gasped response of, \"No, ahh, Ted stop it ! Gah...dude, you're so ...not fair !\", as he easily pinned both of Bill's wrists in one hand when Bill tried to stop him. A cute pout before he released his friends hands, it didn't surprise him when Bill smacked him in the chest with an open palm, then, \"Ouch ! Man stop hurting me, my hand just went numb.\" Chuckled slightly as he rolled off to lay beside Bill and yawned, \"Well, if you do-n't hit me I can-n't hurt you can I ?\", and fell instantly asleep. Dream Mom looked down at him and asked, \"Should I tell you a bedtime story, Theodore ?\" \"Yeah.\" Mom folded pale arms over her chest, \"You forgot to say please. If you don't say it you won't get a story.\" \"Please, mom. Ooh, can Bill be in it ?\" A warm smile as she sat on the edge of the bed, \"Of course, he can, sweetie.\", and he lay down. Streetlamp light filtered through the curtains while mom started to talk, \"One day in the kingdom of Lapus where everyone could turn into bunnies, there was a little black-haired baby boy born to the King and Queen, his name was Theodore, Prince of Lapus. At the same time, in a kingdom close-by called Lume, a blond boy was born and called William, Prince of Lume. Years later, the royal family from Lume came to visit Lapus. While no one in Lume could turn into bunnies, they were great friends with the Lapa and the royal families even more so. The two families hoped that their respective sons Theodore and William would continue the tradition. They needn't have worried because as soon as the two saw each other they were the very best of friends. As they grew and learned they visited each other's homes frequently. One day as Theodore was visiting William word reached him that the evil sorcerer Raptus was trying to take over Lapus. After many days of travel and later a long battle during which nearly killed both princes they made an excellent victory and saved Lapus from destruction.\" \"You know what, Mom ?\" \"What ?\" \"Bill and me are gonna have tons of excellent victors.\" His mom's dimly heard reply of, \"Vic-tor-ez, Theodore, victories and you'll have many.\", as he fell asleep. End Dream In the morning, before he opened his eyes he thought, 'That was some dream of Dad saving me and stuff.' , or, at least, he did until he noticed a warm, snoring body pressed up against his. His nose was nearly buried in blond curls and the scent was besides musk, somehow, really kind of cinnamon-y. Slowly he got up and tried to move his arm from where it'd come to rest around Bill's chest, but then found Bill's arm had tangled around his during the night. He sighed softly and thought, 'Do I really have to wake him up ?' , then prepared to wake Bill up.[Chapter 9] Startle Ted leaned down and whispered, \"Bill, Bi-ill, dude, wake up.\", as he twitched his, now, sleeping hand trying to wake it up. Even asleep, Bill turned to answer him in mumbles, \"T...ed, g'way, seep.\", and proceeded to further strangle his arm's circulation by tightening his grip. Half-smiled, rolled his eyes and murmured, as sunlight started filtering through the window onto the white wall, \"Already told you I'm tired.\" 'Don't want to sleep in since I'll just have to get up at four or five in a few days anyway. I'll have to do my run some time today I can go check on Dad then. Shit, I forgot to tell Deacon what happened to Dad.' He was distracted from those thoughts at the response of, \"N-o, hot.\", along with the rush of heat and butterflies it brought with it. 'It's probably only a little what'd Sergeant Smith call it, \"Friendly flirting - the alternate and even more emotionally rocky version of friendly fire. Mainly it happens after someone's been gone for a long time and suddenly shows up greatly changed, in your case it would be physically and mentally, only to disappear when the 'newness' of your appearance wears off. If it happens to you, Logan, buck up it happens to everybody once.\", yeah probably just that...Hmpf, could I...try and shift ? If it would work would I get my arm back ? Not that I don't mind this, but I'm really starting to need to go to the bathroom. Why couldn't Mom have told me how to shift on purpose ? Then I could go and probably get back before he woke up.' Took a deep breath, then tried to imagine himself as a rabbit and the image that popped up was him still human just with a tail and ears. With that failure he managed an actual rabbit-self and waited for something to happen - a puff of smoke, carrot colored smoke ? could carrots smoke or did they just steam like hot springs ?, a flash of light, anything at all - it didn't. Just then blond eyelashes fluttered half-open to reveal pretty, sleep-hazed, dark-brown eyes, \"I just had the most heinous nightmare in, like, all of history that you left me. You wouldn't do that, right, Ted ?\" \"Not forever, Bill, not forever.,\" 'Oh god, that sounds so mushy and stupid I'm glad he's not fully awake yet.' Not wanting to give Bill too much time to realize what he'd just, he continued, \"Do you think I could get my arm back ? You're kind of, like, killing my circulation.\" At that Bill was looking far more alert and blushed in embarrassment before fingers slid over his arm releasing him, a stammered, \"U-uh...yeah, s-sure, well, I mean it is your arm after all, it's not like I have much use for it. Sorry, Ted.\" As he rolled off the bed onto the floor, he replied, \"Don't worry about it, I've had way worse stuff happen.\", then he crouched, opened his suitcase and got his supplies out before leaving the room and going down the hallway to the bathroom. Deacon emerged as he stopped in front of the door, his little brother stared at him just like dad had yesterday and then, \"You look funny now, I mean you look weirder than that guy you got to play Napoleon a few months ago. That guy was funny too, did you tell him to only speak French or something ?\" \"Uh, we figured it'd be more authentic if he did; and I think he was more comfortable that way, plus we passed so I don't think it really mattered. Oh, you know that eagle that was following me ?\" \"Yeah, what about it ?\" \"It attacked Dad yesterday after he picked me up, he's gonna have a few scars now, but he's okay...I think.\" Deacon tilted his head and then nodded before moving aside without further word. It felt odd to be by himself in the bathroom. 'It feels weird, I'm so used to being surrounded by noisy people and now it's just me.' His routine didn't take very long at all, compared to in the beginning when he, and nearly everyone, had gotten yelled at for taking too long. When he exited the bathroom, it was to see Bill standing in front of the door holding his shirt and staring off into space. 'I thought I was the only one of us who did that. Well, at least, I won't get punched like with Soren that one time...I hope.' He waved a hand in front of Bill's face, \"Dude are you okay ?\" Bill startled, jumping about a foot in the air, \"Don't do that, man. You're gonna like kill me if you do that too often. Uh, I'm guessing you want this now ?\" It almost seemed like Bill was reluctant to hand his shirt over, but the blond was distracted by seeing the underside of his palm and asking, \"What happened to your hand ?\" Took his t-shirt and pulled it on before he answered, \"Training, accidents, all sorts of stuff.\" Before Bill could ask him to specify, Missy called, \"Deacon, Bill, Ted, breakfast's ready.\" Deacon and Bill started racing down the stairs, just because he felt like trying to impress Bill, he walked to the top of the stairs and vaulted over to land in a now, by long months of training, hard-wired crouch. His brother and his friend both exclaimed, \"That was totally awesome !\" Mr. Preston asked, \"What's awesome ?\" \"Dad you totally should have seen what Ted just did ! He, like, jumped over the railing just like in one of those action movies.\" Mr. Preston nodded, \"Well that does sound impressive, Ted. I'll bet you boys are hungry as anything, well go on, sit down. We'll do presents after everyone's done.\" They all walked into the dining room/kitchen and he, of course, sat down beside Bill. 'Wow, I haven't seen this many types of food on one table in months. Did I bring the carvings with ? Oh, yeah, Maria reminded me too. Thank God for Maria.'[Chapter 10] Author's Note: Thanks to KayeFitzen for the favourite/follow. Thanks to my guest and Bill Fan 1 for the encouraging reviews. Sorry for the stall, I got distracted by other fandoms. Presents Ted felt Deacon and Bill staring at him as he finished his third piece of french toast and sixth piece of bacon. 'I suppose I have started eating a lot more since I went to Oates. Hmm, rabbits do eat a lot too. I wonder what R. Bill is doing ? I probably wouldn't have been able to take him over the border. Well, I've still got that carving to give Bill.' Deacon shook his head and blinked, exclaiming, \"Did you turn into a black hole or something !? 'Cause I've never seen you eat that much.\" He answered, \"No, I don't think so, but that sounds totally awesome. Dude, we could totally do a song about that !\" It made him laugh when Bill finished the sentence with him. Mr Preston chuckled too, \"Well, Deacon, I think you've got to eat more when you've muscle. Should we finally go open presents ?\" Quickly, he excused himself and raced up-stairs to his suitcase. Carefully, he pulled out the brown-wrapped carvings a rabbit for Bill, of course, a wolverine for Mr. Preston and a songbird for Missy. The last one he pulled out was the one animal that Jim hadn't been able to teach him how to carve fully was the little elk for Deacon. 'When I go to the hospital, or will Dad be at home by now, I'll give him the wolf. Considering Mom was a rabbit like me, he's not going to get mad is he ? After shooting that Morton he totally fits the whole wolf thing. Wouldn't it have been ironic if Mom was a rabbit and Dad was a wolf ? Would I have ended up being like a wolf with giant rabbit ears or something ?' The thought made him burst into laughter. When he calmed, with presents in hand, he went back down the stairs and turned into the living room. The walls were white and trimmed in what now looked like light-oak to him. Against the far wall was the dark-orange couch which Missy and Mr. Preston sat on. In front of the couch was a giant, dark-wood, coffee-table that had the presents on top. Bill and Deacon sat opposite Missy and Mr. Peston. As he walked to stand beside Bill to put his presents down they looked plain compared to the others, all the others had been brightly-wrapped. It surprised him when Bill pulled him down and he ended up crashing into Bill's lap. Unconsciously, his eyebrows furrowed when Deacon burst out laughing. Then his gaze flicked sideways to the smooth stomach that was perfectly at eye-level. Resisting the urge to lick his lips and glad for his poker-face training, he picked himself up, seemingly collected, before brushing himself off. Bill muttered, \"Sorry, Ted. I thought you're supposed to expect stuff like that ?\" 'D-did Bill's eyes just change color ? They just went from grey to brown back to grey. Weren't they brown earlier ? Either, I'm going crazy or the rabbit-stuff is making me color-blind.' \"Well, considering that I am basically at home. I was hoping I wasn't going to get attacked here. Dad and I got attacked by that eagle yesterday evening, but Dad's fine or he should be.\" That news made Bill frown and Mr. Preston said, \"Maybe I should call him after, see if he's home by now.\" Missy broke in with, \"Why don't you open your presents first, Ted ?\" Before he'd even agreed, Bill was thrusting the first present into his arms. For a second, he looked over the small box it was wrapped in dark-gold paper with a dark-green bow on top. Scrawled on a little paper was, \"To: Ted. From: Bill.\" When he opened it, he gasped in surprise and with shaking hands slowly lifted out the cd. The f-first Van Halen cd and it was... his head jerked up to look at Bill. \"F-for real ?\" It made Bill grin and the curly-haired blond proudly stated, \"Of course, Ted ! I watched him sign it myself. Is it awesome or what ?\" Impulsively, he grinned back and hugged Bill. Then he exclaimed, \"Yeah, it's totally awesome, thanks Bill ! You're like the best friend ever, man.\" Delighted, he turned to wondering if his carving would be enough. 'What if he thinks the carving is bogus ? I should have gotten him something else. Something shiny ? Well, it's better than nothing, at least.' After he let go of Bill and gently put the cd down in the box, Deacon gave him a medium-sized one with shiny, red wrapping. The light's reflection as he tilted the box distracted him, the way it moved and darted was so pretty. He shook himself and opened it to see a book on rabbits nestled inside. Deacon explained, \"You found that rabbit, so I thought if you wanted to keep it or something that would help 'n stuff.\" He put the book beside the cd and replied, \"Thanks, little bro. If he needs help I can actually do something about it now.\" Then it was his turn to give out presents and he, of course, gave Bill his first then gave out the others. Nervously, he said, \"I had Jim teach me how to carve stuff. I made everyone's, but Deacon's 'cause it had way too many little things to get right and I kept wrecking it.\" as Bill practically ripped the brown paper to shreds. Deacon, Missy and Mr. Preston were exclaiming over their carvings, but he wasn't paying attention to them. When Bill pulled out the little rabbit made of dark-pine he stroked its ears and smiled. An enthustastic, \"This is, like, the most majorly excellent gift ever ! I can't believe you made this yourself, it's awesome. While I was having guitar lessons you were learning carving. We should totally go to your house and start your first lesson today.\" 'He likes it, he really likes it. Huh, could I make a tiny guitar incase I ever manage an actual shift ? No matter what, today is going to be so awesome.'[Chapter 11] Trust Ted sighed in relief to see the cruiser parked in the driveway, just like Mr. Preston said that Dad said it would be. 'It's a good thing I brought the carving with.' Beside him, Deacon hummed, \"Well, it still looks the same.\" and walked up to the door. 'Something feels...unbalanced, like it's energy is completely out of whack. Did our leaving really change Dad that much ? Was it like this for the first while after Mom left to protect us ?' With a brief look at Bill, who looked weirded out too, he followed his little brother inside. It did feel different inside as he took off his boots - it felt emptier, but also angrier. Dad, who sat on the couch, looked up at them. The left-side of Dad's face from his jaw to his temple was lightly bandaged over Morton Smith's talon-marks. Dad greeted, \"Ted, Deacon it's good to see you boys home at last. Hello, William.\" still saying Bill's name in an annoyed tone that seemed reflexive by now. \"Hey, Dad.\" \"Sherrif Logan.\" Deacon asked Dad how he was and Dad replied that he was fine. 'As if Dad would really give Deacon any other answer, but that he'd be okay. He would've said the exact same thing to me. What happened to Morton ? If Dad killed him as an eagle does that count as murder ? I mean the dude's been trying to kill me for months and before he tried to kill Mom plenty of times. Wouldn't it count as self-defense since he flew into the back windshield and scratched Dad ? Holy crap, if he survived being shot, Morton's going to be pissed.' While Deacon turned down the hallway to the bedrooms and bathroom, Dad was looking over himself and Bill. Mostly, Dad was also looking at the guitar case on the dark-grey carpet at Bill's feet. Dad wondered, \"William, how are you going to practice in between shifts at your job ?\" Ted turned to look at Bill and exclaimed, \"No way, you got a job !? Like, when ? C'mon, spill.\" Bill shuffled his wieght and ran a hand through his hair. \"Last week. It was so majorly, freaking boring without you and Rufus wasn't showing up. So, I figured that may be if I had something to do time besides guitar lessons, heh, time would go faster. I was gonna tell you last night, but then we started talking and you sorta just fell asleep. I swear I was totally going to this morning, except Missy called for breakfast and you did that radical vault-thingy over the railing ! Seriously, that was so cool . I wish I could do that !\" Of course, Dad latched onto Rufus' name. \"Who's Rufus ? Why haven't I heard of him ? How old is he ?\" Bill raised his hands, \"Mr. Logan, sir, don't get, like, hinky and stuff, but he's thirty or something.\" Dad exclaimed, \" Thirty ! He could be a serial killer or a bank robber. I don't want either of you talking to this 'Rufus' character again.\" The look he was given suggested Rufus could be the reason that Smith had attacked them yesterday. 'Ah, do we explain it to him ? How does he know about shapeshifters, but he doesn't know about time travel ? I can't explain about time travel to Dad because then I'll start talking about the shapeshifters. Then Bill will think I'm, like, crazy or a weirdo or something. Wait, what if that's why there's peace in the future ? Everybody knows and doesn't feel heinously threatened by it ?' Still, he could also see that protesting Dad's decision wasn't going to do any good. Not with Bill's still being in the room, at least. Before he had to say anything, Bill shook his head, \"I'm gonna go tune up in your room, we'll be more comfortable in there.\" As Bill disappeared around the corner too, he noticed something. 'Bill's eyes just turned brown again. What the hell is going on with me ? His eyes are brown, they've always been brown. Except, now they're not, but they are, then they aren't. Man, just, like, fuck my eyes they've turned totally bogus. At least, if I was a wolf instead of a rabbit my vision would be fine, probably. Oh, wolf, right Dad's gift.' He crouched, putting the brown-leather suitcase on the floor and opening it. After carefully, moving aside Mom's letter and the picture, he took out the wolf carving. A few seconds later, Dad looked surprised as he held it. Ted chuckled as he said, \"When I made it, I didn't think the wolf would, like, actually mean something you know, but after yesterday it does. I mean, Rufus is pretty cool, but even before that he had nothing on you. I can't explain it because it's really confusing, but Rufus wouldn't give us up for anything. All I can say is he helped Bill and I with our project and he did a few other little things, but he's only around sometimes.\" The completely unintentional pun had him smiling. Dad ran a hand over his mustache, \"It sounds like you trust him, I still want to meet this 'Rufus' sometime to judge for myself. I don't want you to suddenly find out that he was in league with Morton and those Smiths' or that he was playing the both of you all along. William might not be my preferred friend for you, but he has made good progress with getting a job. With how much the goshawks have flown over lately and our being attacked yesterday, I don't want something happening to him that I could've stopped.\" 'Wow, he does care about Bill. Maybe Dad and Mr. Preston can make up after all.' Unconsciously, he found himself hugging Dad and replying, \"Thanks for trusting me, Dad. D-do you think that Mom's evaded Morton for the last few years ? Do you think she'll ever come home ?\" A deep sigh as Dad stated, \"I don't know, Ted. I haven't talked to her or her family since she left. I hope that sometime she'll visit, at least, once. I miss her and love her still, I just hope she's safe wherever she is. She would've been proud of how well you're handling everything. Go on, Ted, have some fun, you deserve it.\" Half-reluctantly, he let go with a short nod before closing his suitcase, then going into the garage to pick up his guitar as well.
