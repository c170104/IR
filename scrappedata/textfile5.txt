[{"Movie":"Never Been Kissed","Title":"Gullible, broken-hearted me","Author":"geckogirlwriter","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9287865","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Gullible, broken-hearted me… I only watched this film recently, loved it and felt I had to write about it. I love the whole Prom thing and wish we had one when I was at school. It follows Sam's thoughts and feelings just before Josie reveals her true identity and onwards from that.. I can't believe I asked her to dance, I can't believe she said yes, I can't believe I am holding her in my arms, I can't believe her fingers are entwined with mine. Glazing into her eyes I am lost…. this is so wrong but I can't help myself, I am drawn to her, captivated by her. I have to tell her how I feel about her, I know I shouldn't, but I must. They should have stopped me dancing with her; they must see the way I look at her. She's 17, I'm her teacher, I'm not that type of guy but she is not like any other student I have taught, not like any other person I have met. I have to keep a hold of myself, I cannot risk this, but I have to know if she feels the same way about me. Ok I will ask her about Dartmouth that's harmless enough. I don't understand why she doesn't want to go to college she is the most outstanding student I have ever had and she writes the most incredibly moving work, I worry that she has reached beyond my capabilities. Why wouldn't she want to continue that study she seems to love so much. She must have a good reason; I want her to tell me, I want to know everything about her. She wants to tell me something hopefully she has changed her mind about college although I can't bear to think of her leaving…..I have to tell her how I feel, maybe I could transfer to a school near Dartmouth if she wants to be with me. She wouldn't want to be with me I must seem like an old man to her but I am sure I feel that there is some connection between us. She seems happy I have something to say to her, here goes…. Wait a minute I have lost her attention, something has caught her eye and I feel the loss of her presence as she springs across the dance floor away from me. That's our Josie she saved the day, rescuing Aldys from humiliation and a horrible end to her prom. Kids can be so cruel. The princesses call her a loser for standing up for her friend but she stands up to them. The pride I have for her swells up in my heart along with the love I am trying to deny that I feel for her. She tells them she doesn't care about being prom queen, but she looked so happy when I called out her name. I was desperately wishing I could be 17 again and could be her prom King and whisk her round the floor like Guy did. I have never been so jealous of anyone in my life. I can't believe I stayed with Lara so long I didn't know I could feel this way about someone until I met Josie. Wait, what is she saying? Am I really hearing her right? She is 25 and a reporter from the Chicago Sun-Times, how could this be, this can't be true, not Josie. She has been lying to me… she has been lying to us all about herself. Who is she? I don't know her at all. I can't listen to any more of this I have to leave. I had to get out of there, I can't believe this she has fooled us all and me the biggest fool of them all. I thought she was the sweetest, kindest, most honest person I had ever met and it was all a lie. I never want to see her again. I hate myself as a small part of me is ecstatic that she is not 17 and not really a student. I want to go to her and tell her how I feel about her because I now can. But she is not the person I thought she was. The person I fell for was good and sweet and honest I didn't think deception was in her nature, poor gullible me. Here she comes and the situation is even worse, a final dagger through my heart, she was after a story on me, she was trying to ruin me although she denies it, she says that she couldn't do that to me, I want to believe her but I cannot with all the other lies. She is pleading for me to stay, she is killing me, I want to but I can't, my heart says yes but my head says no I am not going to be screwed over. She's pleased I was attracted to her, that she got me to have feelings for her. Yes she doesn't want me to go, as she is probably just desperate for her story and I am her story so of course she doesn't want me to go. I will never trust anyone with my heart ever again. I can't even look her in the eyes; I can't look at her at all. I don't want to see her ever again. I just can't look at her the same way, I have to go. That's it I'm leaving Chicago to start a new life I can't go back to that school with all the memories of her. I should have never broken up with Lara… no I don't mean that it was the best decision I have made in a long time and I should have made it ages ago but I didn't realise I could feel so much for someone until I met Josie. At least I have that to thank her for as well as ripping my heart in two. I can't go home I have to make a plan or I will just fall apart, everything feels pointless now. I thought my teaching and my sports were enough to fulfil me in life but I was wrong. Maybe I will go and live with my sister for a bit there are lots of good schools in New York and I trained their so they know me. My sister is always complaining she never sees enough of me. I can't believe this is happening. Who is this girl really? I just have to forget her. I can't get over what she has done to me. All I can hear in my head is that song 'erase and rewind'. That's what I would like to do with this evening. A few weeks later: My move is today, I really should have packed up everything already but something is delaying me. I know what is holding me back even after everything she did I don't what to leave the City she lives in, but I have to go for my sanity. I have to get away from any reminder of her, I don't even know if I am going to cope teaching Shakespeare any more. I haven't got much more to do just wrap up my trophies in this paper that I have not had the heart to read especially as it is her paper, the Chicago Sun-times. Oh no the movers are here already I'll just shove the rest of the paper in the top of this box. Settled in with my sister in New York I thought I would unpack a few boxes. Most were in storage until I found my own place but I had brought my trophy box as I thought I could put a few out to try and cheer me up plus my sister wanted to see them. She had been so supportive as I knew she would be. I could always count on her and she on me. She said I could stay as long as I liked but I didn't want to be under her feet forever and I was sure she would get fed up of a miserable brother moping round the house. I called her into my room so she could see my latest hockey trophy from Chicago but as I opened the box I nearly dropped to the floor. There was Josie's face staring up at me, I couldn't believe it. I had driven 12 hours, about 830 miles and I couldn't escape her beautiful face, taunting me at what I had lost. My sister walked in the room at that moment in response to my call and was concerned that my face had turned white and I showed her the picture. I couldn't believe it, Josie had written a story about the school, what dirt had she found on me?, I didn't want to read it but my sister started reading it and then insisted that I read it too. My head was in a whirl. There was no dirt on me in the paper, only the story of a terrible high school experience that had scarred an incredible woman and that woman thought that she was in love with me. The truth about Josie Gellar was laid out in front of me, could I believe that this was all true? I hoped it was, not that I hoped that she really went through that pain and humiliation in high school but it was plausible from her struggles to fit in when she joined high school the second time around. I asked my sister what I should do? And she said I must follow my heart, but what if this is just a way of selling more papers, I can't put myself through that hurt again? But then I will never know if this is real, I have to take this chance. I know what I must do….. The paper says I need to meet her at the state championship baseball game with the South Glen South Rams game 5 minutes before the first pitch if I accept her apology. The flight is 2 ½ hours and the game is in 3 hours but luckily Chicago is 1 hour behind New York. I have to try to get there; I have to know if this would work. My sister drove me to the airport and I caught a taxi from the airport to baseball field. The traffic was terrible and I was scared I wouldn't get there in time my heart was pounding in my chest, my mouth was dry. Was I doing the right thing? I raced into the stadium and saw her standing in the middle of the pitch and I knew I had done the right thing. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen and she was waiting there, putting herself on the line for me. The stadium was silent I knew I had to get her, people saw me and started cheering I ran across to her and looked into her eyes and I knew she really loved me. I held her in my arms and kissed her as I had dreamed of doing for a very long time now.

He doesn't tell anyone how angry it makes him, that she was using him, or how guilty he feels later, when he realizes that maybe he deserved to be used. That maybe he deserves a lot worse. But the most important thing Guy Perkins doesn't tell anyone is how he felt for that minute and a half he was dancing with Aldys. It was the song, he tells himself. And it was the way she'd let her hair hang loose for once, and she wasn't wearing her glasses. And God, it was that slightly metallic skintight blue bodysuit. (Guy thinks that all girls should probably start wearing slightly metallic skintight blue bodysuits, especially girls who've got bodies like that. ) He tells himself all this, but he doesn't really believe it. (Okay, it was probably a little bit the bodysuit, but not totally.) Really, Guy knows, it was the way she moved her hips, and the way he moved his against her. The way she's a head taller than him but they still seemed to match up just right, arms and legs and fingers and necks in all the right places for once in his life. Because another thing Guy doesn't really tell people is the fact that he's never actually had a girlfriend, never even really kissed a girl. At first, it was like a mark of status, another mark among all the other marks that made him cool. Guy's always been cool, and no girl was ever cool enough for him, and all the girls knew it. Even Kirsten, Kristin, and Gibby never tried to make a move, no matter how crazy the party or how drunk they were. And so that was the problem, really, because if they weren't cool enough for him, no one was, and by the time he hit sophomore year, Guy Perkins really just wanted to do someone, anyone. Like really. But everyone would have known about it the second he did, and Guy knows all the rules of being cool: the way it only takes one person to think you're in to make you cool, but it only takes one person to think you're out (one ugly chick at one party) to leave you in the dust forever. Which is why Josie's ascension to cooldom was a dream come true, the kind of dreams Guy had every night without ever really knowing if he was dreaming them right or not, because there's only so much porn can really teach a guy. A new girl, a cool girl, a girl he could get his lips all over without it doing anything but raising his stock. He almost kissed her that night in what turned out later to be her old bedroom, almost leaned the four inches forward to make their faces touch after he asked her to prom and after she said yes. But as soon as the thought, the I-could-actually-do-this thought made its way through his brain, Guy could feel his heart fluttering and that choking feeling in his throat that was definitely not cool at all. So he just smiled, and leaned back, and nodded, and walked out the door. He thought for sure they'd make out at prom, if not do the deed itself, because didn't girls cream at the idea of having sex on prom night, with the hotel bed full of rose petals and all? Guy would have done it. He would have gotten the hotel room except for all the shit that went down that night that made it actually a good thing he never did. Because even if the truth about Josie hadn't come out, Guy knows he never would have been able to go through with it. Because as soon as his hand settled on Aldys's hip, he felt something he'd never felt when he was dancing with or smiling at Josie, something he'd never felt when drunk, horny freshmen pushed up against him at parties. He doesn't know how to describe it in a way that's not distinctly uncool, doesn't know how to describe it at all except to say that it was like fire, burning hot and clean and then warm and bright, making him want to push Aldys up against the wall and pull that magnificent bodysuit down off her shoulders and then just stand there looking at her for the rest of forever. Of course he didn't get the chance to even really contemplate that before the girls were covered in dog food and Josie was throwing down her crown, and the whole world (or at least most of Chicago) knows how that turned out. And now they're here, watching Josie stand on the pitcher's mound as the clock counts down, and Guy thinks, it's now or never, and if he hasn't learned a lesson about what it really means to be cool by now then he probably doesn't deserve any chance at happiness ever. So it's now or never. \"Hey man, where you going?\" Jason calls as he swings his legs up over the bleachers and starts pushing through the row behind them, and \"You're totally gonna miss it!\" Gibby adds, but suddenly the fire's there again, burning through Guy and making him sure that this, this is something that he's got to do. She's sitting with her nerd friends, all the way across the stadium, and there are only two minutes and twelve seconds left. He makes it there in one. \"Aldys?\" he says, panting, coming up at the end of her row, next to that guy who's always hunching over and giggling, and Guy spares half a second to think that he should probably learn his name or something before his mind snaps back to her. She twists her head to look at him. Her lips tighten, and she flips it back around. She's back in the overalls, but he notices that she's left her hair loose again. \"So you do know my name isn't Alpo,\" she says coolly. \"I wondered.\" He can't quite get past the guy between him and her and so he puts his hands in his pockets to hide the fact that they are shaking in the most loserish way and shrugs and says, \"I'm sorry,\" and wonders how to make her believe it. \"Look,\" he tells her, and she's still not looking at him, her eyes fixed on Josie down there on the field. Forty three seconds left. \"I meant what I said. At prom. I wanted to put it all behind us. I was an jerk, and I'm sorry.\" \"But you knew about the dog food thing,\" she cuts in. \"Very unoriginal. Not that I would expect anything else from you and your lemmings.\" \"Look,\" he says again, and then, \"Excuse me, could we just, like, switch places here?\" and the guy between them puts up a finger and says, \"Technically we could , but would we is an entirely different—\" But Guy just pushes past him, because there are thirty seven seconds left and he doesn't have time for this. Now he's standing entirely too close to her, can see the nervous darting of her eyes and her fists clenched tight in her overall pockets, and he says, \"I'm sorry,\" again, because what else is there to say? There's everything else to say, and no more time to say it. \"Hey,\" he says, and grabs her shoulders. \"Will you just listen to me for half a second?\" She shakes him off, crosses her arms. \"Give me one good reason why I should. You're an ass, Guy Perkins.\" This is as good an opening as he's going to get. Guy takes a breath. \"I've never been kissed,\" he says, and then, finally then, she looks at him. Her mouth is slightly open now, all the defensiveness gone out of her face and replaced by disbelief. \"You?\" she says, \" You've never been…\" \"No,\" he says. He sighs and the crowd sighs with him, and he knows there must be something going on down on the field but he can't look away from Aldys. \"I haven't. And I want it to be you. I want to kiss you, I mean.\" He's stammering now. Guy Perkins never stammers. \"But…me…why?\" He's never seen her speechless, never seen her anything but guarded and closed and hurt, and he hates himself even more than he's been hating himself all week when he sees that guarded look start to shutter down her eyes again. She thinks this is just a repeat performance of prom, finishing the job, and that's all his fault and he doesn't know how to make her know that that's not true. That that's not him anymore. So he does the only thing that makes sense, the only thing he can do. For once in his fucking life, Guy Perkins tells the truth. \"Because I think I might be in love with you or something,\" he says, and then he kisses her. Her mouth is still open a little bit when his descends on it. Well, okay, if he's honest with himself, there's no descending, because he has to lift his chin to reach her mouth. But that's okay. Everything's okay once their lips touch, hers soft and giving wherever his press. She exhales half a breath into his mouth, and Guy thinks there's never been a better feeling than this. And then she jerks away. \"What the hell was that?\" Aldys asks, and she has to yell over the sudden cheering all around them. But neither of them looks down. Neither of them looks away. \"My first kiss,\" he says, and he knows he's smiling and he knows he's ridiculous, but suddenly, Guy Perkins can't find it in himself to care. Aldys shakes her head. \"You're really not lying.\" \"I'm really not lying.\" \"You're really not about to pour pig's blood all over my head?\" He laughs. \"I'm really not.\" Her mouth twists again, but her eyes are bright, and she's taken her hands out of her pockets. \"I still don't trust you,\" she says. A pause, and then, \"But I'm willing to try that again. For the sake of experimentation. And…science.\" Guy smiles then, and he feels the fire, this time soft, light, warm, spreading through his chest. \"I never thought I'd be thanking science for anything,\" he says. \"But I'll take it.\" His hand finds her hip through her overalls, and to his surprise, her arms come up around his neck, shaking only just a little bit. In the end, Guy doesn't see Josie get her first kiss. He's too busy getting his.

Magnus, 'Turbo' Samuel Coulson had a problem. As a teacher and, if he could say it without being considered egotistical, a decently attactive man, he was used to being the subject of student crushes. The situation he was facing now, however, was much different and quite possibly a lot worse. He had never thought that he would be the one attracted to one of his students. When she had walked into his classroom, his first thoughts were annoyance at being stuck teaching yet another bottled blonde - did she really think no one saw the darker roots? - whose only real experience in literature was reading whatever the current popular supernatural romance series was and arguing over which of the prospective suitors of the female lead she would most like to be with herself. That lasted only until she raised her hand and opened her mouth, then he was hooked. He had never cared for fishing and now he probably never would since he now wondered if this was how a fish felt after it was hooked, being pulled unavoidably to its doom. The problem was that the metaphor broke down when he thought about it and realised that at least the fish would fight, he wanted it and that was part of the problem. He wanted it and he shouldn't. He knew he shouldn't. She was his student, ten years younger than him. Despite the current troubles in their relationship, he already had a girlfriend. And, of course, there was the fact that she was his student; he had to keep reminding himself of that fact as it was the more important one of them all. She was his student, she was ten years younger than him, she was seventeen, she was underage. No matter how he phrased it in his mind, it couldn't change one simple fact; he was smitten. Lovestruck. Enticed. Entranced. Entangled. He was all this and more and it was all because of one girl. Josephine 'Josie' Geller. It was almost enough to make him cry. When he was getting his teaching degree, he had sworn never to be one of those teachers that gave the profession a bad name, one of those teachers that made the six o'clock news by sleeping with their students or their students' parents, or their own co-workers or bosses. He intended to have more respect for himself and for the job than that. Where had he gone wrong? He knew the answer to that question, in his own classroom, roughly three seconds after she had defined and given the etomology of the word 'pastural'. It awoke something in him that he had begun to think was dead. A long-abandoned hope that he might someday find someone who loved the written word as much as he did, who didn't need something to involve celebrity gossip or court motions to want to read it, but instead would want to read it simply because it was there to read; someone who didn't care about the legal precedent or the effect it would have on a television show, just that it was good literature. Literature, books, reading, words, that was a large part of what it all came down to. All the way back to when he was younger, the books he read that involved the hero - battered, bloodied, but unbeaten - leaving the site of the final battle to return home to the woman he loved, usually followed by a scene with the two of them talking about where they would go and what they would do in the future now that the world had been saved and lovers had finally found each other. Even more recently, the sappy romance novels that he had enjoyed as a guilty pleasure while in college, story after story with the same plot, but he had read dozens of them. As a teacher, he might need to be a realist to get students to listen and understand that literature wasn't dead words on paper pages, but something that was alive and around them every day; but, as a person, he was a romantic, he wanted to believe in two people meant for each other, to believe in 'happily ever after' and 'love conquers all'. As a teacher, he was not supposed to feel this way for one of his students. As a person... Sam walked around the living room of his apartment, not sure he wanted to finish that thought, not sure he wanted to deal with the truth he'd have to confront if he finished that thought. Idly as he walked, he ran his hands across the spines of the books on his bookcase, each one a story he had read and enjoyed, a book he loved to read and reread whenever the mood took him. Suddenly, Sam stopped and turned his eyes to the bookshelf. As his eyes focused, he saw one of the books on his shelf and reacted in anger, pulling it from the shelf and physically throwing it across the room to hit the wall. The name of the author and title of the book glaring accusingly up at him from the floor where it landed. 'Lolita' by Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov.

I somehow stumbled across Guy/Aldys fiction on here, which I had no idea was a thing... but I can totally see it. And I love it. So much that I was inspired to write my own! It's complete coincidence that I happened to finish this fic just the other day, but then it seemed silly not to post it around the 4th of July. If there's anyone out there still reading Never Been Kissed fics, hope you enjoy! It's a sticky Wednesday in June, and Aldys is at work at her summer job in a local independent bookstore. She's been coming here for as long as she can remember and has contributed a great deal of her spending money to the store's coffers, so it seemed only natural that the owner, a middle-aged woman named Marjorie, would eventually offer her a job. It's ideal, really; she even gets a discount. Besides, she needs something to occupy her time – other than babysitting her sister, which gets old rather fast – until she heads to Northwestern in the fall. She's already excited about it. The bell jingles as the door creaks open. Aldys glances up, but the greeting dies on her lips as she realizes who has just stepped into the store. She would never in a million years have pegged Guy Perkins as the bookstore type; she fervently wishes he hadn't decided to start now. He hasn't looked her way yet, so she quickly disappears behind the book she's been reading. Maybe if she's very quiet… \"You know, it's not very nice to ignore your customers.\" Well, so much for that. Aldys lowers the book just enough to make eye contact with Guy over the top. He doesn't appear surprised to see her, and he's smirking. \"Can I help you?\" \"Hm.\" He appears to consider, crossing to where she's perched behind the counter. Oh, how she wishes he would just go away. Marjorie has stepped out for lunch, so it's just the two of them in the store. \"What are you reading?\" \"Dostoevesky. Crime and Punishment.\" Aldys tucks her bookmark in place and sets the book down, giving up on quiet reading time for the moment. \"Hey!\" she exclaims next, for the book has no sooner hit the counter than Guy has snatched it up. He glances up at her, still smirking. \"Don't worry, I'll give it back.\" Aldys glares as he takes his time reading the back, but – true to his word – he then sets her book back on the counter. He takes two steps backwards, spreads his arms and glances around. \"Any recommendations?\" Aldys frowns. \"You're looking for a book?\" He raises an eyebrow. \"Well, I am in a bookstore.\" He turns, casually strolling between two shelves. \"So come on,\" he challenges, his voice drifting back to her from amongst the books. \"You've must've read, like, all of these.\" Aldys rolls her eyes, getting off her stool. \"That's a bit of an exaggeration.\" He doesn't respond, and Aldys peers cautiously between the rows of books. He's not there. She can't physically stop herself from glancing behind her, feeling a bit ridiculous when she's only met with the empty store. But who can really blame her for expecting to be ambushed with dog food or whatever else whenever Guy Perkins is around? She hasn't seen him since their graduation two weeks earlier and hasn't exchanged a single word with him since prom. After their surprisingly enjoyable dance was interrupted by the dog food incident and Josie's confession, he'd disappeared into the crowd. He'd left her completely alone in their final few days of high school, which was no small miracle. So why was he here now ? The sound of a book scraping against a shelf catches her attention, and she rounds another row to find Guy with his nose in a book. Maybe he does read. Who knew? She's about to quietly back away when he glances up, noticing her. \"So?\" He sets the book back in its place and turns to her. \"Any suggestions?\" \"I have no idea what you like to read,\" she protests, still struggling with the idea that Guy Perkins might actually like to read. Or maybe he's just messing with her. That's probably more likely, although to what end, she can't figure out. \"I'm up for anything,\" he replies, glancing around with a shrug. \"Well, most anything.\" Aldys eyes the nearby row of books. She's harbored a suspicion for some time now that Guy is actually considerably more intelligent than he lets on. I mean, after all, he graduated high school without having ever appeared to do much work (although, admittedly, she has no idea what his actual grades were), and he did pop up in honors classes from time to time. Honors history, for example. She pulls a book free from the shelf and holds it out to him. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 . \"Have you read this?\" Guy shakes his head and takes the book from her hand. \"Not yet.\" Aldys generally likes picking books for people, but – in this case – she's desperate for this interaction to end. \"You should. It's a classic.\" And she flees back to the relative safety of the counter before he can say anything else. Guy follows at a more leisurely pace, reading the back of the book as he walks. At the counter, he hands her the book and retrieves his wallet. \"I'm taking your word for it, Aldys.\" Momentarily startled that he's using her actual name, Aldys nonetheless manages to ring up the book and take his money. It's not until he's out the door that she allows herself a sigh of relief. A week later, Guy makes a reappearance at the bookstore. Aldys is reorganizing shelves, Marjorie at the counter, when he materializes at her elbow. She nearly drops the book she's holding. \"Hey.\" Aldys eyes him suspiciously. \"What do you want?\" Guy smirks. \"No need to be so hostile, Aldys. I just came to say thanks for the book recommendation.\" Aldys blinks. He must be joking. \"You read it?\" He rolls his eyes. \"Yes, I read it. It's good.\" \"Glad you liked it,\" she says, rather noncommittally, gathering up a few books and turning away. \"Have coffee with me.\" This time, it's truly a miracle she doesn't drop anything. Aldys safely sets the books down on a nearby open shelf, before turning to face her former classmate. \"What?\" \"There's a coffee shop next door,\" he points out. \"Have coffee with me.\" \"I'm working.\" \"So when you get off, then.\" \"Where are your lemmings?\" She questions. \"Have coffee with them .\" \"Lemmings?\" He chuckles. \"And I could, but then I wouldn't be able to talk about Catch-22 , seeing as none of them have ever even heard of it.\" He wants to talk about the book with her? What kind of alternate universe has she fallen into? Or maybe he's just really bored. \"You expect me to believe that you actually want to have coffee and talk about Catch-22 with me?\" \"Sure,\" Guy shrugs. \"Why not?\" Okay, maybe he's not quite as bright as she suspected. \"Aldys.\" He steps closer when she doesn't respond, drawing out her name ever so slightly. \"Have coffee with me.\" She's a bit uncomfortable with him standing quite so close, but Aldys is absolutely not going to take a step back. \"You're paying,\" she challenges, after another moment of consideration. He smirks. \"Done.\" She nods. \"Okay.\" If he has anything nefarious up his sleeve, she supposes she could always dump a cup of coffee on his head. The idea has merit. Guy smiles. \"What time do you get off work?\" He finally takes his leave, once they've agreed to meet next door when her shift ends at four. Aldys makes her way back to the register, where Marjorie looks amused. \"So who's the young man?\" she queries, smiling at the teenager. \"Absolutely no one,\" Aldys says with feeling. \"Uh huh,\" Marjorie retorts knowingly, and Aldys shakes her head. What is she doing, going out for coffee with Guy Perkins? She still doesn't have an answer two hours later, when she leaves the bookstore and heads for the coffee shop. Aldys is almost entirely convinced that he won't be there, or that he'll be accompanied by the lemmings, all waiting to laugh at her misfortune in believing that he might actually want to spend time with her. Well, not that it matters. She doesn't particularly want to spend time with him , so that would simply give her an excuse to get out of it. Much to her surprise, she steps inside to find Guy already occupying one of the small tables, alone. He gives a sort of half-wave in her direction, and she crosses the room to join him. \"You actually came,\" he comments. Maybe Aldys wasn't the only one questioning intentions. \"I'm as surprised as you are,\" she retorts, and Guy actually laughs, getting to his feet. \"What can I get you?\" She insists on accompanying him to the counter – nice gestures aside, she so does not trust Guy Perkins with anything she's planning to consume. True to their agreement, he pays, and Aldys lets him. He owes her a thing or two, after all. \"Why'd you tell me to read Catch-22 ?\" He asks, once they're seated across from each other. She shrugs. \"It's a classic.\" Guy gives her a look. \"So are a lot of other books.\" She wonders how many of them he's actually read. \"It happened to be on the shelf right where we were standing. And… I remembered that you were in honors history, so I thought you might find the subject interesting.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"You remembered that?\" It was junior year, after all, but Guy Perkins in honors anything was noteworthy for its infrequency. She tells him this, and he snorts with laughter. She'd half expected him to be glaring daggers at her. \"You really don't hold anything back, do you?\" \"Neither do you,\" she counters pointedly. He inclines his head in apparent agreement, and they momentarily lapse into silence. \"Well, you were right,\" he acknowledges, after a minute. \"I do like history, and the book was great.\" \"I enjoyed it, too,\" she agrees. \"Although, you've never really struck me as the summer reading type.\" \"How would you know?\" He challenges. Aldys supposes he has a point. She does her best to avoid Guy Perkins and his cronies during the summer and has generally been pretty successful. Until now. \"I guess I don't,\" she shrugs. \"Well, I need something to keep me entertained,\" he replies. \"What, the Court not enough for you these days?\" She admittedly doesn't really know what Guy's life is like, but certainly doesn't imagine it to be boring. Guy shakes his head. \"It's not possible for you to say that with any more disdain.\" Aldys raises an eyebrow. \"Can you blame me? It's basically the epitome of everything I disliked about high school.\" And everyone , remains unspoken, but no less clear. He shrugs. \"I thought we made a little progress at prom…?\" Progess? Is that what that was? \"You mean, before your friends -\" she says the word as though it leaves a bad taste in her mouth, which it does – \"tried to dump a can of dog food on me?\" Guy looks momentarily startled. \"I had nothing to do with that. You know that, right?\" \"And I'm supposed to believe that, after you spent four years making fun of me at every opportunity?\" Truthfully, Aldys thinks that he's probably telling the truth about the dog food – he'd looked as surprised as everyone else. But she certainly isn't above making him squirm a bit. Much to her surprise, he does actually look a bit chagrined. \"I suppose that's fair,\" he admits. \"But I really didn't know about it. My intentions were honorable in asking you to dance.\" She nods. \"Well, then, thanks for the dance, since I didn't get to say it then. And I'm sorry your prom date turned out to be a twenty-five year old reporter.\" They both laugh at that, and it breaks some of the tension that has settled over the table. To her shock and consternation, Aldys realizes that she's actually not having a terrible time. \"It's fine.\" Guy laughs it off. \"It was fun while it lasted.\" Aldys wonders if he means it, or if he was at all bothered by what happened with Josie. She assumes he, like the rest of the town, was at the baseball game and is up to date on latest Josie-Mr. Coulson developments. She debates whether or not to ask him, but he speaks first. \"So you're going to Northwestern?\" Aldys nods. \"Yes. I'm really looking forward to it.\" \"You know I'm going there, too.\" \"I know.\" And they're not the only two from South Glen South who are. Aldys has been operating under the assumption that, at a school that size, she won't ever have to interact with Guy. Although, if he continues to behave the way he's behaving currently – as in, treating her like an actual human being – running into him on occasion might not actually be so terrible. Maybe. That Saturday, Guy is waiting outside the bookstore when Aldys finishes her shift. He's apparently taken it upon himself to figure out her schedule, and Aldys isn't sure if she should be flattered or worried. She raises an eyebrow in greeting. He smiles. \"Hey. Coffee?\" Which is how she finds herself, for the second time that week, having coffee and making actual conversation with Guy Perkins. She doesn't let him pay this time; she's a bit concerned about being too indebted to him, even if it is only a few dollars. \"Do you have any plans tonight?\" He asks, and Aldys eyes him suspiciously. \"Not really,\" she answers truthfully. She often sees her friends on the weekends, but no plans have yet materialized for this particular Saturday night. \"Well, do you wanna do something?\" Guy says then. \"Like, see a movie?\" Aldys is sure she looks as shocked as she feels. Is Guy, of all people, asking her on a date? \"I thought you'd be at the Court,\" she retorts, although it isn't quite as heated as her usual commentary about said locale. He rolls his eyes. \"I don't spend all of my time there,\" he objects. \"Although, we could always go there, too. If you want.\" If she wants? He must still be operating under the misguided belief that her life is incomplete without nights at the Court. \"Okay, now I know you're messing with me,\" she retorts. Guy shakes his head. \"I'm not.\" Aldys snorts. \"I seem to recall you telling me that I'm not cool enough to hang out at the Court. And now you're suggesting we go?\" \"You're cooler than I was giving you credit for,\" he admits, and Aldys struggles to keep her mouth from falling open in surprise. Not that she has particular aspirations to Guy's definition of cool, but it's still an unexpected thing for him to say. \"I don't think your friends would agree,\" she points out. \"Doesn't matter,\" he shrugs. \"If I say it's fine for you to be there, then it's fine.\" While she doesn't doubt the validity of that statement, an evening spent being merely tolerated because Guy said so doesn't sound extremely appealing. \"I'm so glad I have your approval,\" she retorts, not exactly trying to keep the sarcasm out of her tone. What is she even doing here?! She moves to get up, but Guy stops her with a hand on her arm. He retracts it just as quickly, as though uncertain if it was a good idea. \"Wait, Aldys.\" He looks surprisingly earnest. \"No Court, then. Okay? Let's just go to a movie or something.\" Aldys considers. \"You're really serious,\" she observes. He nods. \"Why do you even want to spend time with me?\" She asks. \"I thought you hated me.\" Guy shakes his head. \"I've never hated you.\" \"Could've fooled me,\" she retorts. \"I like you, Aldys,\" he persists. \"You're really fun to hang out with.\" Aldys is convinced there must be a catch. Or that she's now living in some kind of alternate reality where Guy Perkins isn't a complete jerk. She supposes there's only one way to find out. It's the 4th of July, and it seems like the entire town has turned out for the annual fireworks. Aldys is weaving her way through the seemingly endless crowd, hot on the heels of none other than Guy, whose fingers are entwined with hers. She still honestly doesn't know what to make of that fact. Their movie date a week prior went surprisingly well. He took hold of her hand about halfway through, and she'd been too shocked to object. Afterwards, they'd gone out for a bite to eat, and Aldys was yet again astounded to realize that she actually enjoyed talking to him. When he's not calling her names and ridiculing her general existence, Guy is actually a reasonably decent conversationalist. And now, as they make their way across the park, he's holding her hand again. As the crowd thins a bit, she catches sight of a few of the Denominators, who are staring at her in…unmitigated shock. Not that Aldys can blame them. She tugs on Guy's hand, and he turns to face her. Aldys inclines her head in the direction of her friends. \"I'm gonna go say hi,\" she tells him. \"Do you want to come?\" It is one hundred percent clear from the expression on Guy's face that he does not want to come. \"Do you have to now ?\" He replies, not quite managing to keep the disdain out of his tone. \"I told the others we'd be right there.\" By \"the others\", he means his lemmings, whom Aldys is about as keen to spend time with as Guy is the Denominators. She nearly tells him this, or maybe she should just point out that she only intends a quick hello, and not an hour-long detour. Instead, she merely sighs, glancing back and forth between him and her friends. \"Okay, fine,\" she concedes, offering the Denominators a wave and a shrug. \"Let's go.\" As the lemmings come into view, Aldys is suddenly struck by a wave of nervousness. Why did she even agree to this? Guy made it sound like his friends knew she was coming, but she isn't sure if that's true, or – if it is – if she should expect to be greeted with a can of dog food. Based on the expressions she's met with as they approach, Aldys suspects the \"we\" was pretty vague. \"Why'd you bring Alpo?\" Kristen questions Guy as soon as they're within speaking distance, shooting Aldys a dirty look. Aldys waits to see if Guy will correct his friend. He doesn't, and it hurts more than she'd expected. \"She's with me,\" is all he says. Aldys would like to give him the benefit of the doubt – maybe he didn't hear Kristen properly - but isn't sure that she should. \"Why?\" This time it's Gibby, and her displeasure couldn't be more apparent. Guy's shrug isn't remotely satisfying, and Aldys is rapidly coming to the conclusion that this was a colossal mistake. His response apparently doesn't satisfy Gibby either, as the other girl promptly turns to Aldys. \"Don't you have fellow nerds to be bothering?\" The girls, as well as Jason and Tommy, laugh at that. Guy doesn't, but nor does he say anything. Aldys levels her gaze at the smaller girl. \"Trust me, I'm not any happier about this than you are.\" Guy shoots her a look, and she arches an eyebrow at him. If he doesn't expect her to give as good as she gets, then he's clearly forgotten whom he's dealing with. Truth be told, Aldys is a little bothered that he's expecting her – and only her – to play nice, but there's no way in hell she's going to let him know that. \"Well, then, run along,\" Kristen waves a dismissive hand. \"I don't know why Guy brought you over here, but you have to know he's just messing with you. Right? I mean, you're not welcome here.\" They're all staring at her, except for Guy, who looks uncharacteristically uncomfortable. Aldys waits a beat, hoping that he'll say something, anything , to correct Kristen. He doesn't, and that tells her everything she needs to know. \"Right.\" She stares at Guy until he meets her gaze. \"My mistake.\" His eyes widen at her words, but Aldys doesn't wait to see if he has any further reaction. She turns on her heel and walks away, the sound of the lemmings' laughter echoing behind her. She shoves her way through the crowd, crossing the park in record time, the hot prickle of traitorous tears in her eyes. How could she be so stupid? She knew from the start this would only end badly, and yet let herself get caught up in it all the same. Aldys furiously wipes at her eyes. No. She is not going to cry over Guy Perkins. She instead focuses her attention on figuring out how she's going to get home, her interest in watching the fireworks gone. In yet another stupid decision, she allowed Guy to drive her over here, and it's really too far to walk. \"Aldys!\" His voice reaches her as she approaches the far side of the park. If she's at all surprised that he's come after her, she doesn't show it. She doesn't even slow down. \"Aldys, wait a minute.\" He grabs her arm and she spins to face him, thankful she got the tears under control. Guy looks a little bit upset, but she doesn't care. \"Where are you going?\" \"Home.\" She spits out. \"Look, I'll take you after the fireworks end,\" he offers. \"No thanks.\" She starts to walk away again, but he stops her with a hand on her arm. A hand she promptly shrugs off. \"Aldys, don't be like that.\" \"Don't be like that?\" She hisses at him. \"Do you even- no, just forget it.\" \"I'm sorry, okay?\" Guy tries. \"I didn't mean for them to upset you.\" Aldys closes her eyes and prays for patience. \"It wasn't them, it was you, you idiot,\" she snaps. \"They're always like that, I wasn't expecting anything else. But you've been different lately, and I was stupid enough to think that might continue.\" \"You're not stupid,\" he objects. \"And it is – I mean, it will continue. I wasn't making fun of you.\" \"But you weren't exactly sticking up for me, either!\" Aldys retorts. \"You didn't say anything when Kristen called me Alpo, or when they laughed at me, or even when she point blank said that you were just messing with me. And when I suggested we say hi to my friends, you looked like the thought made you physically ill, which I can sort of understand, because I feel the same way about yours. Your friends hate me, and I'm not going to wait around until you remember that you do, too.\" Fireworks begin to explode overhead, but neither of them pay any attention. Suddenly self-conscious about blurting all that out, Aldys turns to leave once again, but is stopped by Guy abruptly closing the distance between them and taking her face in his hands. \"I don't hate you,\" he insists, and then he kisses her. Guy's lips are warm and soft, and the sensation sends a thrill up her spine. Aldys has never kissed anyone in her life, but she instinctively kisses him back. That is, until her brain catches up to what is happening, and she abruptly pushes him away with her hands on his chest. \"You can't do that,\" she gasps once they've parted, a little breathless. Guy looks a tad chagrined. \"Why not?\" Aldys shakes her head. \"You can't treat me like you did tonight, make me so angry at you, and then kiss me like that .\" He smiles. \"So you liked it then?\" \"That's not the point,\" she retorts, hoping he can't see her blush in the darkness. \"It doesn't change anything.\" Guy sighs. \"Aldys, I'm sorry about before. I really do like you.\" \"But you can't only like me when it's just us,\" she points out. \"You can't be nice in private, but treat me like crap around your friends. Or let them treat me like crap. That's not okay with me.\" He inches closer and slides his arms around her waist. Aldys lets him. \"You're right,\" he murmurs. \"I didn't know what to say to Kristen and Gibby, I guess I kind of hoped they would just accept you being there with me and drop it. But I should have stood up for you, and I'm sorry I didn't.\" Meeting his eyes, Aldys thinks she believes him. But just to be sure… \"You're going to have to prove it to me,\" she tells him. Guy nods. \"I will.\" Aldys eyes him suspiciously, although she's beginning to relax. Just a bit. \"Kissing me does not count as proving it to me.\" He grins. \"You sure?\" Then, more seriously: \"I know, Aldys. I'll talk to them.\" \"You will?\" \"Yes.\" His eyes are serious as they hold hers. \"I promise.\" Aldys decides she'll give him a chance. Maybe just the one, though. \"Okay.\" \"Okay.\" Guy smirks then. \"Any chance I can kiss you again in the meantime?\" Aldys rolls her eyes, but nods, and finally puts her arms around his shoulders. His lips meet hers once again, as the fireworks go off overhead. Aldys and Guy are standing near the edge of the park, hand in hand, when the lemmings drift by on their way to their cars. Aldys, who is still mentally processing her first kiss with the most unexpected of partners, tenses as they approach. \"Seriously?\" It's Kirsten this time. \"You ditched us for Alpo?\" \"It's Aldys,\" Guy corrects, still holding her hand. \"And she's my friend – maybe even my girlfriend, actually, if I'm really lucky.\" He shoots a sideways glance towards Aldys at that. She's sure her eyes are as wide as Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby's. He turns back to the trio. \"So if you say or do anything unkind towards her, you'll answer to me. Got it?\" The girls are frozen in place, mouths open, gaping at this unexpected development. Aldys offers them a shrug and tries not to laugh. \"Got it?\" Guy repeats, and that snaps them out of it. They nod and hurry away, whispering amongst themselves and glancing back at Guy and Aldys over their shoulders. \"Wow,\" Aldys manages, as Guy turns to her. \"I wasn't expecting you to say anything to them tonight.\" \"Well, they conveniently walked by,\" he points out. \"And I did promise you I would.\" She smiles. \"Thank you. It means a lot.\" He inclines his head in acknowledgement, and they turn to head to his car, still hand in hand. Guy eyes her slyly as they walk. \"So what do you say, Aldys? Do you want to go out with me?\" Well, what an unexpected summer this is turning out to be. ","Summary":" I recently watched this movie again after many years - I'd forgotten how much I love it!

Rolling into bed in the wee hours of the morning following the ten year South Glen South High School reunion, both were exhausted when the sun rose seemingly moments later, and with it, their two children. Sam spooned his wife, his hand resting on where their third child grew. \"Josie?\" he asked, not moving. \"Nrgh?\" she replied, equally prone. \"Next time we get an overnight babysitter.\" Quiet was out of a reach, but they did manage to remain undisturbed for another half an hour, drifting in and out of sleep. Until they suddenly realised they could hear nothing. \"It's very quiet.\" \"Too quiet.\" Sam kissed his wife, threw back the sheets and left the bedroom in his boxer shorts. Josie openly ogled the form of her husband before swinging her own form out of bed. Leaving the bathroom, she headed for the kitchen. Stopping in the doorway, she covered her mouth at the sight before her as she struggled not to laugh. For before her on the floor were their four year old and three year old happily occupied making mud cakes with dirt and rocks. Her husband, sensing her arrival, turned from his position kneeling on the floor. She couldn't hide the grin. He responded with a wry one of his own. Entering the room, she eased down onto the floor. Propping her back up against the cupboard, she smiled as Tennyson offered her a plate. \"Eat up,\" he ordered. \"It's good for you!\" Play eating, she thanked her eldest with a smile. Not to be outdone, Eden handed her father a plate piled high, dirt dropping off the sides. Josie grinned as Sam balanced the concoction. \"Thanks sweetheart.\" Their kids now happily pottering around in their \"kitchen\" again, Sam turned to his wife. \"Thank God they're playing in here.\" Josie nodded. \"Could you imagine cleaning the carpets?\" He groaned.

Josie Geller walked up to the cake table at the South Glen South Prom after her first dance as Prom Queen. \"Is this chocolate?\" she asked the server. She nodded her thanks and was just about to take a bite when she heard a voice next to her. \"Hey.\" She looked up to see Sam smiling at her. \"Hi,\" she chuckled somewhat awkwardly. \"You know, Josie, you make a really beautiful Prom queen,\" Sam said sincerely. \"Really?\" Josie asked, flustered. No one had ever called her beautiful before. \"Thanks, so do you.\" Wait, what did I just say ? She looked away in embarrassment. Luckily for her, Sam just chuckled. \"You know, I always feel like kind of a goofball in these penguin suits... Like I'm at my own wedding or something.\" With the mention of penguins and weddings Josie suddenly had a vision of Sam in a tux waiting for her at the end of an isle, looking at her with such love and affection that it made her heart hurt. Her thoughts were interrupted when Sam asked, \"Do you wanna...?\" He gestured toward the couples dancing. Josie smiled brightly. \"Okay.\" She set her cake down and Sam led her to the dance floor. They danced in silence for a few moments when Sam said, \"You know, it's funny - Proms always make me a little sad. They're so final, you know - graduation, everyone scattering and moving on.\" But I'm not going anywhere , Josie thought. She tentatively asked, \"Is your... girlfriend here?\" \"No... no, no. I'm alone,\" Sam replied. \"In fact, um, we... we broke up last week.\" \"Really? That's funny, because you know, actually 'Prom' comes from 'promenade' and you can't promenade alone, can you?\" Sam chuckled at her joke. \"You're amazing, Josie Gellar.\" Josie's breath hitched. She couldn't keep lying to him. She had to tell him. Now. \"Have you thought about Darthmouth any?\" Sam's eyes searched her own. Josie nodded. \"Yes, and... umm... there's something that I want to tell you.\" She removed the hidden camera from her dress and disabled it. This was between her and Sam only. Gus and whoever else was watching from the office weren't going to be privy to this conversation. \"There's... There's something I want to tell you too,\" Sam said nervously. Josie glanced over at Guy dancing with Aldys and nodded as the song ended. \"Let's go somewhere quiet so we can talk.\" Sam led her outside to a secluded gazebo around the side of the building. They sat on a bench and Sam took her hand. \"Josie, I -\" \"Wait!\" Josie blurted. \"Before you say anything, let me go first, please.\" If you say what I hope you're going to say then you need to know who I really am. She took a deep breath. \"I haven't been completely honest about who I am. I'm... I'm not really seventeen.\" Sam shook his head, his eyes widening slightly. \"So you're what, sixteen? Because none of that matters-\" Josie shook her head. \"Please, just let me get this out.\" She took a deep breath. \"I'm not really a seventeen year old high school student. I'm actually a twenty-five year old reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times. \" \"You're... what?\" Sam said in disbelief and dropped her hand. \"A reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times ,\" Josie repeated, relieved to finally have told Sam the truth. \"I was initiallly sent undercover to write a story about today's high school students. As I got to know you better and we started talking more, my boss eventually wanted me to write an exposé on teacher-student relationships, but I couldn't. I couldn't do that to you - not when I'm not actually a student. I care about you too much.\" ' Cause let's face it, you haven't been 'Mr. Coulson' since my second day of class , she added silently. Sam sat in stony silence, staring at his hands. Josie reached out to touch his arm, then thought better of it and dropped her hand. \"I'm so sorry, Sam.\" Sam suddenly ran his hands through his hair and stood up. \"I can't believe this, I just can't - I need -\" He started toward the steps. \"Sam, please don't walk away,\" Josie said tearfully, standing to go after him. \"I hated lying to you - I just couldn't do it anymore.\" She cut off as Sam stopped and turned back to face her. \"Was everything -\" He swallowed thickly and tried again. \"Was everything you told me a lie? Was I just a story to you this whole time? Is Josie even your real name?\" Josie's heart broke at the pained look on his face. She shook her head adamantly. \"No, you were NEVER just a story and most of what I've told you is the truth. My name really is Josie Geller - the only things I lied about to you about were my age and the fact that I graduated from Northwestern with a dual bachelor's degree in English and journalism. Everything else I've told you has been the truth.\" \"You're not really in high school.\" Josie shook her head. \"You're twenty-five. You're not seventeen.\" Josie laughed tearfully. \"I can even show you my driver's license to prove it.\" Sam breathed a sigh of relief. \"Oh thank God.\" \"You're not angry with me?\" Josie asked hopefully. \"Oh I'm plenty angry,\" Sam said, \"but honestly I'm just more relieved that I'm actually allowed to be attracted to you.\" \"Wait, you really ARE attracted to me?\" Josie's heart leaped. \"Damn it, Josie, of COURSE I'm attracted to you. How could I not be?\" Sam stepped closer to her. \"You're the most beautiful, amazing, intelligent woman I've ever met. You're a brilliant writer and you can quote Shakespeare off the cuff. After getting to know you these past few months, I was willing to throw away my entire teaching career for the chance to be with you.\" \"But you don't have to,\" Josie protested. \"Can't we just start over?\" Sam shook his head. \"I can't do that, Josie.\" Josie's heart broke. \"Why not?\" \"Because if we started over, then I wouldn't be able to do this yet.\" Sam closed the distance between them and captured her lips with his. THIS. This was what being really kissed was like. Josie melted against Sam and wrapped her arms around him. Everything else disappeared except for the two of them. They broke apart and Sam rested his forehead against hers, their panting breaths intermingling. \"Josie... I'm in love with you,\" he said softly. \"I tried to fight it - I swore I'd never be one of those creepy teachers that hit on their students, and believe me, that was always easy to avoid until the day you walked into my classroom. Not only did you correctly define 'pastoral', but when you also gave me the origin... My life changed that day. You're beautiful and kind-hearted and funny, and you've made my life so much better just by being part of it.\" Josie beamed, then kissed Sam again. A cough interrupted them and they quickly broke apart. Rob stood alone on the gazebo steps, looking sheepish. \"Hey, uh, it's -\" Sam started. \"It's ok, Sam. He knows,\" Josie said, giving his hand a squeeze. \"In fact... Sam, I'd like you to meet my brother, Rob Geller.\" \"Your brother? Rob's your brother?\" Rob waved awkwardly. \"I guess I, uh, don't have to call you 'Mr. C' anymore, huh?\" He chuckled. Sam looked skyward then back at Josie. \"Is anyone else undercover here?\" Josie shook her head. \"No, it started out as just me, but then Rob came to help. Although 'Pam' from the sex ed class was actually my friend Anita, but that wasn't planned.\" \"Uhh... Jos... Sorry to interrupt, but I just wanted to let you know that Guy is looking for you.\" He pointed back toward the building. \"I offered to come look for you out here in case you were, you know... busy.\" Josie shot him a grateful look. \"Thanks. I guess we better head back inside.\" She turned. \"Wait,\" Sam said quickly. Josie turned back toward him. \"Actually, do you want to get out of here? Maybe go have a coffee or something?\" Josie smiled. \"I'd love that. Let me go say goodbye.\" She found Guy, told him that she wasn't feeling well, said goodbye to Kristen, Kirsten, & Gibby then made her way back outside where Sam was waiting for her. \"Ready?\" he asked, guiding her towards his car. Josie nodded. I've been ready for this my entire life, she thought. ","Summary":" Prom, Reimagined (What if the \"Alpo\" incident at Prom never happened?)

It's just a one-shot for now, but I always wondered if anything ever changed between Aldys and Guy after the prom. I'm thinking of continuing this because I like the pairing... let me know what you think! Totally Rufus Aldys stood in the stands, cheering loudly as Josie and Mr. Coulson finally shared their first kiss. \"Go, Josie!\" she yelled out, grinning with pride for her friend. Josie had finally gotten the kiss she had always wanted – and she truly deserved it. I guess this is what a fairy tale ending looks like, Aldys thought to herself, growing more subdued as she noticed the other couples around her. Adults and teens alike, it seemed as though everyone had found love tonight – everyone but her. She sighed. I'll have my moment someday, she tried to assure herself, knowing she had no right to be jealous of popular airheads like Kirsten or Gibby or Libby or whatever their names were just because someone had found them attractive enough to kiss. But despite the fact that she knew all of this, Aldys was still hoping. Even Matt and Shelby, two of her friends from the Denominators, had revealed their feelings for each other tonight. Despite her happiness for everyone else, Aldys had never before felt so isolated and alone. \"I'm going to grab a slushie,\" she said suddenly to her friends, getting up from her seat. Josie and Mr. Coulson had finally moved off the pitcher's mound, and now the baseball team was bursting onto the field. She moved quickly out of the stands. Guy stood at the concession stand, shelling a crisp bill out of his wallet as he took his Coke off the counter. \"Thanks,\" he said to the volunteer cashier behind the counter, nodding as he found a bench nearby to sit down on. The past few weeks had been strange for him, to say the least. First, he had found himself falling for Josie Gellar, the brainy new girl who rocked his world, and then he learned that she was a twenty-five-year-old undercover reporter who had the hots for their English teacher. Could things get any less Rufus? Now he was at the championship baseball game, where everyone in the school seemed to be hooking up except him. Guy could easily get any girl he wanted, but after dating Josie, he knew that the typical cookie-cutter girls he had gone out with in the past wouldn't be enough for him anymore. He needed someone different , someone to break the monotony, and he wasn't sure who that would be. \"Cherry slushie, please?\" Guy heard a girl's voice at the concession stand, and he looked up to see Aldys, her back to him. Aldys. He had tried to make amends with her at prom, and of course everything had gone horribly wrong. Deep down, he felt horrible for what his friends had tried to do to her. They had all (himself included) tried to make the girl's life miserable since Day One – and they couldn't even let her have the prom to herself. She turned around, taking a sip of her slushie before noticing Guy. She groaned. \"Aldys!\" Guy called out, getting up to approach her. \"Listen, Aldys – can I talk to you for a minute?\" Aldys rolled her eyes. \"What do you want this time?\" she asked, a tone of annoyance in her voice. \"Let me guess… you've got some Eukanuba to go with last week's Alpo?\" Guy sighed and shook his head. \"Aldys, I wanted to apologize for prom,\" he told her sincerely. \"I really did want to make things right, you know? I had no idea they were gonna pull that prank.\" Aldys raised her eyebrows. \"Of course you didn't,\" she said sarcastically. \"I mean, really, you've never tried to ruin things for me before that, right?\" Good point, Guy thought to himself. \"Okay, so maybe I don't have the best track record,\" he conceded, \"but lately I've been feeling really bad about all that. I wanted to end things on the right foot.\" Aldys scoffed. \"I don't need your pity , Guy,\" she retorted. \"Besides, just because every other girl drools all over you doesn't mean you can trick me.\" However, despite saying this, Aldys couldn't help but notice how deep Guy's eyes actually looked right now. A part of her had always wondered if there was something beyond the surface. \"Why would I try to trick you?\" Guy asked. \"I'm already having a shitty night as it is. I'm really not in the mood to ruin someone else's.\" Noting the hint of sadness in his voice, Aldys decided she believed him. Why else would the most popular boy in school act the way he did tonight? Her expression softened. \"What could possibly be so bad about your night?\" she asked him, genuinely curious. \"You're the king of high school. Is anything less than perfect in your life?\" Guy laughed at this. \"You're asking the guy who just watched this totally Rufus girl he liked make out with our teacher?\" He took a sip of his Coke. \"Yeah. Sometimes, things really suck.\" Aldys was touched by this. Even though she knew that Josie and Mr. Coulson belonged together, she actually pitied Guy for not winning her heart first. She hadn't realized that Guy actually cared about her friend until now. \"I'm sorry,\" Aldys said quietly, sympathizing with Guy for the first time ever. \"That's probably hard to deal with.\" Guy nodded. He never realized that Aldys was so easy to talk to. \"Well, it wouldn't have worked out between us even if she was seventeen,\" he explained. \"She was light-years ahead of me, anyway.\" \"I don't know,\" Aldys said with a shrug. \"Maybe you're not as bad as you think you are.\" Guy couldn't help but grin at this. \"Are you okay, Aldys?\" he asked. \"I thought you considered me your sworn enemy.\" She bit her lip and revealed a small smile. \"I can be nice to the enemy once in a while, can't I?\" As she said this, she wondered what she was doing. Was she flirting? I hope I'm not flirting, she thought to herself, praying she wouldn't start blushing as well. \"Maybe there isn't really a word to describe what we are,\" Guy resolved, taking a last sip of his Coke before tossing it in the nearest trash bin. \"After all, you did seem to enjoy dancing with me at the prom.\" Aldys shrugged. \"I'm a good actress,\" she joked, again wondering if they had crossed some sort of boundary. She had to admit, Guy was cute – she'd had a crush on him years back, long before she'd realized that she would never fit in with his crowd – but he was clearly not interested in a nerd like her. Why would he be, when he could have any other girl in the world? \"Well,\" Guy said, this time more quietly, \" I enjoyed it. Up until the Alpo part, that is.\" This time, the blushing was undeniable. Aldys' cheeks were redder than Kristen's natural hair color, and the two of them remained silent for a moment until Guy spoke up again. \"So,\" he began, hands in his jacket pockets as he shuffled around somewhat nervously. It was crazy – Guy had more female admirers than he could count, but there was something about Aldys that caught him off-guard… and for him, that was a good thing. \"Where's the rest of your double helix?\" Aldys shrugged. \"They're watching the game,\" she told him. \"I doubt if they know I'm gone. I only came to support Josie.\" Guy hesitated again before speaking. \"Listen, Aldys… you wanna ditch the game and go catch a movie or grab a bite to eat or something?\" Aldys's eyes widened in shock. Is Guy Perkins asking me out? She wondered, resisting the urge to pinch herself to ensure that she was awake. \"Sure,\" she answered slowly, smiling at him. \"That would be...\" She fished for words before settling on the right one. \"... Totally Rufus.\" And as Guy took her hand and they walked out to the parking lot, Aldys couldn't help but think to herself about just how Rufus this night was becoming. A/N: Good? Bad? Stupid? Is it worth continuing? Let me know!

BY:nMargaret Kowalski Part I R unning,nrunning, then I start to pace myself. I look back and see nothingnexcept large trees and leaves on the ground, covering dirt andnbranches. Then suddenly I hear a crack, more like a branch breakingnfrom a man with large feet. Then I saw in the corner of my eye anshadow running behind one tree to another. I knew it was him. See,na day ago I was kidnapped by two men one was a tall mysterious man,nwith brown hair and blue eyes, and had a leading voice with a rednecknaccent. I never saw the other man all I heard was his voice. I don'tnknow why I was taken, but for whatever reason it was there must havenbeen a good excuse. I mean I've never done anything thing wrong,nwell I have but nothing really bad. I've snuck out a couple time tonhook up with this guy, but that's it, and I don't think anyone isnmad at me. I didn't hurt anyone. Hmm… Instop and pause for a second, then suddenly he grabbed me from behind,nlocking his arm around my neck and holding my waist tightly. I triednto break free, I really tried, but he was just to strong. I'mnserious, you should have seen the muscles on this guy, but he alsonhad me at a good angle. Henyelled rite in my ear, \"What the heck is wrong with you?\" \"WhennI tell you to do something, you better do it!\" Then he pinned me tonthe ground, \"Stupid girl, you never listen!\" I still was tryingnto get away. \"Hold still,\" he shouted, as he tied my hands backnwith electrical tape. Afternthat he picked me up onto my feet and said in a contemptible voice,n\"Get going!\" To be honest I was scared. Getting back to thenhidden cabin, with part of it being underground, he took a pair ofnhandcuffs and cuffed me to the table which was bolted down to thenfloor. He looked at me in the eye and just stared at me for a moment,nthe he took a deep breath and walked away. He sat on the couch andnturned the television on. \"Why are you doing this?,\" I askedncalmly, but deep down I was terrified. Henjust ignored me and kept watching TV. I shook my hand thinking thencuff would break. \"Settle down,\" he said, while walking up to thencounter, and pulling a frozen item out of the fridge, putting it intonthe microwave. Just dead silence….. BEEPPP!!!! \"Here eat up,\"nhe said tossing me a plastic tray with mash potatoes, peas, a roll,nan corn. Trusting, him I actually started eating it, I was starvingnanyway I didn't eat in almost two days. Then he tossed me a glassnof ice water. I just sat there examining it. \"Its not poisoned, Indon't need to kill you yet.\" My heart started racing, and thentelephone rang, I jumped up suddenly, because it startled me.n\"Settled down,\" he yelled. \"Hey, Josh,\" \" yeahnits all ready to go,\" mmhm, mmhm. Ok see you later.\" Justnwondering what that phone call meant, I was also thinking, about whynI was here. \"why are you mean like this, kidnapping me andneverything, why?\" I said in a confused voice. \"Look I was tryingnto be nice, but you push it to far. I now know that you are morencapable of things, you know a lot and understand more than Inrealizes,\" he said quickly and loudly. \"THIS IS NICE?\" Inyelled, but he just looked away. Thennhe unlocked the cuff and took me down stairs. There was a bunch ofndoors and he took me to the 4 th one on the right side, witch was the very last one in the hallway.n\"Sit down,\" he told me, while brining his handcuffs out. \"Again,nwith the cuffs, come on now that's getting a little old,\" I saidnwith a stubborn attitude. Then he said while locking them to me andnto the bed post, \"Locking the door ain't good enough.\" \"Intold you before, I know you can get out, if I don't.\" I lookednout of the small window, that was about 8 or 10 inches high, and sawnthat the sun was about to set. Being late summer in northernnCalifornia, I knew that is would be cold. BANG!!!nBANG!!! BANG!!! A loud noise on the front door occurred. \"Open up,nits sheriff Rogerson.\" \"Help!! Help!!!\" I yelled. \" Shutnup!\" Slap!!!! Rite across my face, I could feel a red marknoccurring. I was trying to break free, and then he took a long piecenof duck tape and put is across my mouth. Five minutes later I saw thensheriff walk away. Then stomp, stomp, stomp, I heard big feetnwalking down the hallway. He opened the door, and said \"Well Mr.nBigboy and his snooty tooty uniform asked me if I seen this girl.\"nAnd he held up a picture of me with the words missing at the top ofnthe page. \"And you know, I told him a pretty little lady like that,nno not in these woods.\" Then he laughed and walked out locking thendoor behind him. PARTnII T hennext morning I heard a gunshot, I knew it was pretty early becausenthe sun barely started coming up. Bam! Bam! Two more gunshots. I wasnstill laying in bed, tied up, with my mouth duck taped. SLAM! Thendoor opens and all I see is him and a 49\" double shooter. ThennBLACKOUT. Inwoke up untied in the bed with covers over me, but I knew nothingncould of happened. I thought to myself I need to get out of here. Thendoor was still locked and the window was nailed closed. There was nonway out. This started reminding me of Josh and Jason. We once playednblackout in this big mysterious house, that no one lived in, and theynlocked all the doors and there was no way out. They tried to scare menat any chance they got.. Injust sat there thinking of someway to get out. And then it hit me.nThree hours later, maybe around seven or eight in the morning, I wasnjust laying in bed waiting for them to come in. Creeaakkk! The doornopens and two men walk in, I closed my eyes to fake asleep. \"Wow,njohn how hard did you hit her?\" A man that was about 5'9 and hadnmid-large muscles and brown hair said. \"Uhmm…I didn't think Inhit her that hard Josh.\" Wait then itnhit me this was the other man. Josh is the other guy that kidnappednme. \"God she's hot,\" Josh said. \" Yeahnshe is kinda cute,\" John then muttered. \"No John I don't meannlike that. She looks sick.\" Then they both came around to the othernside of the bed, farthest from the door. Then I startedncrawling to the door, but John grabbed my foot and pulled me back.nThen I kicked him in the face, but that didn't stop him. He jumpednon top of my back and pinned my head down and said \"Stupid Girl.\"nHe never called me by my name, just said stupid girl. He grabbed mynhands back and tied them to the back board. Slap.. \"Stupid Girl.\"nThen I spit in his face and he punched me in the mouth. Well thatncertainly shut me up. Sp..Sp..Sp..Ssp, the two were whispering. \"Letnme go,\" I yelled. \"Shut up,\" John said. Then he left the room. nJosh then said, \"So.\" But I just glared at him. \"What's thatnlook for?\" And I turned my head. \"Look I know this is hard fornyou.\" Then I said angrily, \"Then why are you doing this?\" Butnhe looked at me for a second then looked away. Opening the doornquickly john came in and said, \"Lets go.\" Sitting therenfor about two hours, I started thinking that I'm never going to getnout of here, and then I had a tea run down my face. I take a deepnbreath un to calm by self down. Suddenly I smell smoke, I looked bynthe door and there was smoke coming from under it. I knew the housenwas surely on fire. I was so terrified. \"Help!!!\" \"Help!!!\" Inshouted even though I knew no one could hear me out in the middle ofnthe woods. I was still tied up and kept yelling. \"Help!!!\"n\"Help!!\" WHAM!!! The door opens and its Josh. He jumps onto thenbed and pulls out a hand knife and cuts the rope. Then he pulls mynarm and throws me over his shoulder and ups the stairs and throughnthe door. Henran about 20 yards away from the house and puts me down on thenground. I cough about two or three time then I get up and start tonrun. I knew this was my chance to getaway. Running as fast as I can,nwith John and Josh chasing me from behind, I realized I have no cluenwhere I'm going, but I didn't care, anywhere is better thannthere. Then suddenly John catches up to me and pushes me to thenground, but I got up as quickly as I could and started running again.nRunning on the side of a hill, Josh grabbed me from be hind and wenboth started rolling down the hill. Once we get to the bottom, Instarted crawling, but he got hold of me and straddled over me havingnmy back face the ground. \" What isnwrong with you,\" he said. \"I just saved your life and you run.\"nI didn't answer. I just kept struggling. \"Hold still,\" hensaid while shaking me. \"You don't give up do you?\" He said,ncalmly. He then helped me up. \"Ouch!\" I shouted. \"What'snwrong?\" he said quickly. \"My ankle.\" \"Oh God,\" he said. \"Oknlets get you to the car.\" Part III \" Y eanJosh, Josh you goter,\" John said excitingly. \"Yea um, he John.\"n\"What's wrong Josh?\" \"I think her ankles broken.\" Johnngave him a puzzled look. \"So!\" John said. \"What do you meannSO…?\" Josh said copying his tone. \"This is bad John.\" \"Thenhouse is burnt down because of that stupid pizza you left in the ovennand she has a hurt ankle. She needs to see a doctor, TODAY.\" \"Ok,nOk,\" John said interrupting Josh. \"We'll take her to thenhospital.\" So we got into the truck and had the trailer connectednto it and went to the nearest hospital. Once we got there Johnndropped me and Josh off at the front door and John looked me in theneye and said, \"No funny business, you better keep your mouth shut,nor I'll kill you.\" \"Alright, gosh,\" I said, with the biggestnattitude. Whennwe got inside Josh told me to wait here and he went to the frontndesk. \" Shensaid it might be an hour or two.\" He called John and told him.n\"So,\" then a pause. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked me.n\"Umm…sure,\" I said. There was a snack machine on the other sidenof the room, so he went and got a few things then came back. Henbrought back two Kit Kat bars, two Reeses Cups, along with somencokes. 15nminutes later , a lady with gray hair and was about 5\"3 came outnand called us in. \"The doctor will be with you in a moment,\" shensaid with that calm old lady tone. Well rite after she said that thendoctor came in. \"So what's the damage? I'm Doctor Herbert.\"n\"Well doctor we were just playing soccer in the yard and there wasna hole, my dog dug up and I guess we didn't see it,\" Josh toldnhim. \"Hhmm..a hole huh?\" \"Yes sir,\" Josh said with courage.n\"Well lets take some X-rays and see what we got,\" the doctornsaid. Afternseven x-rays were taken the doctor spoke with us again, \"Well itsnnot broken, its just a rolled ankle, which isn't as bad a sprainnjust hurts a lot more. It should be better in a day or two, just trynto stay off of it.\" \"You will have to come back tomorrow, for annappointment.\" \"Oh,\" Josh said. \"Well were out of town ritennow and we are leaving tomorrow morning.\" \" Excusenme sir, if you don't mind me asking, what is this girl to you?\"nthe doctor asked with a questioned look. And Josh said, \"she's myngirlfriend.\" \" Hownold are you mam,\" he asked me. \"Fifteen.\" I said. \"And younsir.\" \"seventeen,\" Josh said. \"Well since you're leavingntomorrow, you really need to see a doctor for a check up, I will givenyou crutches.\" \"Thanks doc.,\" Josh said, and we walked out ofnthere. Johnnmet us by the door, we got in the car and he said, \"So?\" \"Justna rolled ankle,\" Josh said. \"Ok we already know where we'rengoin, lets just get there,\" John said. We drove for thirteen hours,nthen stopped at a hotel and once again John gave me that big lecturenabout, \"behaving.\" Once we got inside and checked in, we went tonthe room which was a suite. I sat on the couch and then John pullednout the hand cuffs. \"No, no more cuffs,\" I told him, whilenthreatening to hit him with my crutch. \"Yea, John give her a brake,nwhere is she going to go, she has one leg.\" \"Thanks,\" I saidnafter, with a smart tone. Then Josh whispered in my ear, \"Sorry.\" Thennext morning the guys woke up about 6 or 7. John then said, \"Comenon Josh, it open in two hours, and we need to get there to plan thisnout if were gunna do it.\" I looked t Josh and said, \"Do what?\" Henthen looked at me and said, \"sorry but this is one thing I can'tntell you just yet.\" While they were both by the sink, John pullednout a rope and handed it to Josh, then John pulled out hisnhand-cuffs, and they both walked toward me. Inwas sitting on the bed, and cuffed my hands together and tied my legsntogether, but not where it was hurt. Then they took electrical tapenand put it over me, taping me to the bed. I then said, \"Ya'llncan't just leave me hear.\" \"We'll be back in four or fivenhours,\" John said. Then he turned the TV to a comedy channel andnleft the suite. After that Josh said, \"Don't worry, just do me anfavor and don't scream, or John will probably kill you.\" Hensmile then walked away. Oncenthey left I fell asleep. When I woke up it was about one o'clock innthe afternoon and Josh and John were back. PartnIV T hennext day, we got in the car a drove another hour or two and got intonanother hotel. That night Josh was gone, and John had me tied up, tona chair. By this time my ankle was feeling a lot better. John came innfront of be and pulled out a rag that had something in it. Then henstarted unfolding it, it was a knife. He put the tip of it by mynface, then he started stroking my face, but light enough not to makena cut. \"Please don't kill me,\" I said with a fright. \"Chillnout,\" then he cut the rope. I paused for a second, then I ran fornthe door. It was locked, I jiggled it, but couldn't get it open.nThen John turned me around and grabbed my wrist, pinning them to anwall. He said, \"The door is locked, but you could try the windows,nbut that would be dangerous and might hurt a little because I wouldntake a bullet and shoot it rite through you head.\" My eyes gotnlarge, \"o-o-ok,\" I said stuttering. \" s-s-sorryyy.\" Henthen let go and then Josh came in. \" SonI guess tomorrow is the day.\" \"Yup!\" John said. I wanted tonknow what was going on, but none was telling me. Thatnnight John slept in the main bedroom and Josh and I slept in thenother room. It was late, but I wasn't tired and Josh and I justnstarted talking. He kept asking me questions about my life. I wasntalking to him like I would talk to one of my friends. It was reallynweird, but I enjoyed it, he seemed like somebody I could tellneverything to. \" Thenway life is, its terrifying sometime,\" I said. \"Yes, it is butnthat's why they say life is full of surprises,\" He told me. Thennthere was a silence and he leaned toward me and we KISSED. Oh my God,nI thought to myself am I really kissing the man that helped kidnappednme!?! But to be honest I enjoyed it. We slept together that night. Inknew why he was protective of me now, and knew why he stuck up fornme. Thennext morning, we all woke up, John didn't know what happened thatnnight and I think Josh wanted to keep it that way. We drove about tennminutes to Wells Fargo and Company, which is the nations 6 th largest bank, and California's largest. \"This is why younkidnapped me? To help you rob a bank?\" I said. \"No, actually wenwere worried we wouldn't have hostages so we took you, your cutenand no one wants a cute girl dead,\" John said with confidence. Inlooked a Josh. He looked at me and looked away, with a disappointingnlook on his face. So they put there black jackets on and get theirnbook bags and putt guns in them that supposedly only had one bulletnin it. John grabs me out of the car, holding the gun to my head. Wenall walk into the bank and John fires one shot at the ceiling.n\"Everyone on the ground!\" He yelled. Most of the people ran outnwhen he shot the gun, but there was still five or six of us in there. Joshnjust stays quiet and looks at me every second or two. \"Open thenvault!\" John told a accountant. So the man got up and opened it.nHonestly it was the biggest vault I've ever seen. Thenman opened it, and there had to have been millions of dollars innthere. I looked at Josh and he just looked at me with thisndisappointed face again. Then something strange occurred, I've seennthat look before. I then said, \"Josh,\" He then looked at me.n\"Josh Jamison?\" I said questioning. He gave me a positive look.n\"I thought you moved to Germany?\" I said. \"I did, but now I'mnback.\" He told me. SeenJosh and I dated in 9 th grade, he was my everything, my true love, but then he moved. We keptngoing out, but I didn't like the long distance relationship. It wasnweird the guy that kidnapped me was my 9 th grade sweetheart. I thought I was going to spend the rest of my lifenwith him. I now knew why he was somewhat protective of me. \" Joshnlets go!\" John yelled at him. He pulled out some bags and startednputting money in it, and Josh did it too, but slower than John. \"Whynare you doing this? I thought you were different.\" I said shoutingnto Josh. \" Shutnup!\" John said while pointing his gun at me. \"Get on the floornand keep your mouth shut.\" Joshnstop putting money into the bag, and paused. Then he said, \"She'snright. I'm better than this.\" Then he looked at John and said,n\"I'm done.\" And he walked out of the vault. I smiled then Johnnsaid, \"Like hell you are!\" and shot him. I ran as quickly as Incould to get to him. \"Josh, Josh, are you ok?\" \"Say somethingnto me.\" \"Please.\" I kept saying in a frighten voiced. \"I'mnok.\" he said. John shot him in his left shoulder. I took a jacketnthat was on the chair beside me and put it under his head. Johnngot done filling the bags, and walked over to us. \"Silly Josh, yournsuch a sucker.\" He pointed the gun at me. \"Don't shoot her,\"nJosh said to him. John pulled the trigger, but as soon as he did thatna bullet hit his hand. The SWAT team had come in and the copsnfollowed. Theyncuffed John and put him in the cop car. Everyone else got out safelynexcept me and Josh who were shot. The paramedics came and took me andnJosh to the hospital. The bullet in his arm broke three bones, butnthe one that hit me just broke my arm. Johnnwent to jail for 28 years for kidnapping, robbery, and attemptednmurder. Josh only went to jail for 6 month for kidnapping, since henwas a victim the judge gave it to him easy. And I went home to mynfamily, I moved with my grandparents, and worked on the ranch for anwhile. When Josh got out of jail, we moved in with each other,nbesides he didn't have a family to go to. He was 18 when he got outnand I was 16. We lived in an apartment near my grandparents, and henworked at a shipping factory. When I was eighteen I went to collegenand he decided to go with me. I got PHD and started working at annearby hospital, and was an x-ray tech. He got his PHD also, but wasnjust a regular check up doctor. We had two boys, Aaron and Sean.nEventually we started are own doctor business in Susanville,nCalifornia. Wenknew are past was bad, but we excepted it, and it got us where we arentoday. We all lived are life, we made bad chooses, but eventuallynrealized it. We can't change are past, but we can always make arenfuture brighter, by making better chooses. Lifenisn't about trying to stay alive, its just about living life. Badnthings may happen, but you just need to make the best of them. Expectnthe unexpected and just except it.

He'd gotten to her apartment nearly twenty minutes ago, and he was greeted by a scene that was not so dissimilar to what he was seeing now. The only difference was that the piece of paper she'd had clutched in her hands was currently littering the floor. \"Josie, you need to breathe.\" She stopped in her tracks, turned towards him and put her hands on her hips, making a show of taking said breath. \"Any more bright ideas? I breathed. I'm still freaking out. I swear, whoever invented high school reunions is probably behind the iron maiden. \" Sam gave a snort of laughter, and he stood up extending his arms and pulling Josie against his chest. She wrapped her arms around him, her head resting on his chest and she took a deep breath, his combined scent of spice and grass calming her down. \"Ok, maybe that breath was a good idea\" she mumbled. Sam lifted his hand and rubbed slow circles across her back. \"Jose. You're not a high school student anymore. You are talented, beautiful, smart and one of the best writers the Chicago Sun times has seen in the past decade. You have nothing to be nervous about.\" She nodded her head slightly and mumbled against his chest. \"You'll go with me, won't you?\" She looked up at him, her eyes bright and wide and he gave her a gentle smile. \"Of course I will. Josie, you know I'd do anything for you.\" She smiled and stood on her toes, kissing him gently. \"But you really don't have to be that nervous. I mean, from what I saw at South Glen, you managed to fit in.\" Josie looked up at Sam and quirked an eyebrow at him (or at least she attempted to). \"Sam, I was 25 years old. I was a little more adept at fitting in. Emphasis on the little.\" She looked up at Sam, who stayed silent, but she could feel his curiosity. His silent encouragement spurred her on. She took a deep breath and gathered her thoughts as she rested her head on his shoulder. \"It was never easy for me, Sam. I was the laughing stock of the school. Literally. People would follow me around and decorate my bag with toilet paper and stale fries... it was all just a condition of being known as Josie-Grosie. They were merciless. But I went back every day, because I told myself that it would end one day. And it did, just not the way I'd hoped.\" By then they'd sat on the couch and she rested her head on his lap. He was toying with her hair and she smiled up at him, feeling unselfconscious and loved – feelings she couldn't honestly say she'd have learned without him. \"By the time I started working for the Chicago Sun Times, I'd blocked things out, and I could barely remember any of it. Until I enrolled to South Glen South, and things kept coming back to me full force. Prom night in particular. I was so happy Sam.\" She looked up at him, and the shadow of self-doubt in her eyes had him tightening his hold on her waist. \"You've already read about how I was asked to the prom as a joke in the Article, but you never got the whole story. Lana, one of my friends, had told me Billy Prince, the most popular boy in school, was asking me to the prom. The days leading up to prom were a complete blur. I went dress shopping with my mom, and I felt like a princess. And as I stood on my front porch, Billy came riding up in his limousine, looking for all the world like my Prince. The next thing I knew I was covered in egg yolk and egg shells and I spent the rest of the night hiding in the bushes. I was so ashamed; I felt like an idiot and worst of all I felt I deserved it. When I finally worked up the courage to go back into my house, I managed to sneak past Rob and my parents. I never told anyone what happened that night, and I never felt the need to.\" She took a deep breath and rested her head on his chest. \"But if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing. Except maybe wash my hair more often. Because regardless of what I went through, anything I've done has led me to you. To us. And I don't regret a single moment.\" \"Josie...\" She heard his sharp intake of breath and sat up straight. He looked her straight in the eye, and smiled at her. \"Jos, you are the most amazing woman I've ever met. Your capacity at finding light at even the darkest corners of your life is just so -\" he stopped short, noticing the tears that had built in her eyes. She gave him a watery smile and he smiled back, leaning in to kiss her. \"How is it you always know what to say to make me feel better?\" \"Because I love you\" He said, unnecessarily, kissing her on her forehead. \"I know. I love you too. And I don't think there's anyone else in the world I could have shared that with. The reason I find light is because you help me to, Sam.\" She kissed him lightly and laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Wow – I feel like such a sap! I sound like a Hallmark card.\" \"Well, you're my Hallmark card. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\" \"Is that so? Well how's this: Roses are red \" He cut her off with a kiss, and she smiled into his mouth. She broke the kiss to peck him lightly on the mouth, and then slowly trailed soft kisses down his neck. His breathing grew ragged and he let his hands run down her sides and up under her shirt, slowly caressing her skin. He lifted her up and she laughed out loud, before he claimed her lips with his own once more and carried her into her bedroom, kicking the door shut behind him. ---- Josie felt like she'd been dragged to what to have been the one hundredth store in the span of one hour. When she'd told Anita that she was going to her high school reunion, a manic gleam came to her eye and never had Josie been more fearful of her enthusiastic friend and the rather threatening way she'd said we're going shopping! \"Is all this shopping really necessary, Nita? I mean the dress at the last store was fine!\" Anita threw Josie a look and simply kept walking to the dress aisle. She was just about to sit when she heard her friend give a (rather dramatic) gasp. \"Yes! This is it. Josie, this is the dress. The one dress.\" One dress to rule them all Josie thought to herself with a smile. But as she set eyes upon the one dress she couldn't help but agree. She shuffled into the dressing room and slipped the dress over her head, letting the smooth silk slide down her body. She took a deep breath and couldn't help but smile at how good she felt in the dress. It was long sleeved and it had a deep V-neck and it reached down to her knees. It was navy blue and there was a red ribbon that tied under her bust. As she walked out of the dressing room, Anita nodded her approval and even the salesman stopped short at the sight of her in The Dress. \"You know, I think this is the first time I can sincerely say that a dress was made for one of my customers\" he said, and Josie blushed. As she put her jeans back on, she couldn't help but wish she was still wearing her dress. \"Alright, now that the dress is taken care of, time for accessories!\" Josie bit back a groan at her over-enthusiastic friend and followed her to the shoe shop, this time without complaint. ---- \"Josie?\" Sam called as he walked into her living room. They had exchanged keys 7 months into their relationship and she had to admit it came in handy on the (rare) occasion when she was still getting ready. In truth, she was a nervous wreck. The thought of going back to her old high school and facing the people that had made her life miserable was daunting and quite frankly scary. Don't be silly. You have Sam, he'll be there the whole time. Now stop panicking and go greet him. She walked out of her bathroom and greeted Sam with a kiss. \"I just need to get dressed, I'll be ready in 5 minutes.\" \"Ok. Take your time – it's a clear night so I doubt there will be much traffic.\" She walked into her bedroom and stripped out of her bathrobe. She slid the dress on for the second time, and slipped on the red pumps that Anita insisted (and rightfully so) were made for her dress. She twirled once in front of her mirror, satisfied, and walked back into the living room with her clutch and wrap in one arm. She cleared her throat and smiled, waiting for Sam to turn his attention to her. As he laid eyes upon her, he nearly dropped the Eurythmics CD he was holding. She smiled coquettishly and sauntered over to him. \"What do you think?\" She whispered into his ear, making him shiver. She smirked in satisfaction. Being with Sam had given her an incredible amount of confidence, and she was liking it. \"I think I forgot what I was here for\" he whispered back, huskily. It was her turn to shiver as his hand ran down the middle of her chest, his breath blowing sensually across her skin. Combined with the feel of the silk dress she really couldn't wait for the night to be over. She leaned up as if to kiss him and stopped short to whisper against his lips. \"Well, Mr Coulson, you're quite the charmer. But I'm afraid we have somewhere to be\" And with that she turned abruptly away and sauntered towards the front door. She heard his intake of breath and turned back expectantly. \"You're cruel, Ms Geller, you know that?\" As they walked to his car, she giggled and shook her head lightly. The drive to her old high school was interspersed with idle banter, but as they neared the old familiar route to her school, the butterflies in her stomach started to turn into dragons. She glanced around, and through the remaining light of the sunset she could see the parking lot was starting to fill up with cars – Mercedes, SUV's and the occasional Porsche. Sam parked his own car, and before Josie could get her bearings to get out of the car, Sam had beat her to it, opening the door for her and holding out his hand. She smiled as she took his hand, paying attention to what he was wearing for the first time that evening. He was wearing black slacks and a burgundy shirt, with the top collar left undone. He had a black blazer slung over his arm and the overall effect took Josie's breath away. As they started walking towards the familiar swinging doors, she turned to him, resting her head on his shoulder. \"You're looking quite dashing tonight\" \"You think so? I was worried the pants made me look fat.\" He smiled at her and she laughed, the sound echoing off the walls of the main corridor. A couple of old students turned to look at her, and she placed them as Zara Lennons and Karl Richards – they'd always sat behind her in French class. She turned to hide her head in Sam's arm, but he placed his fingers under her chin and made her meet his gaze. \"Just remember, no matter what happens, I'm here for you. I love you.\" She took a deep breath and nodded to him, before turning to gaze around her surroundings. She marveled at how the old stone walls still hadn't changed. The only difference was that where before there was a wooden door marking the entrance to the school's administration offices, now there was a glass paneled one. As she and Sam followed the signs leading to the cafeteria – where the Casino-themed Alumni reunion was to take place - she felt like she had no control over her neck muscles. Her head kept swinging back and forth and she felt like she was 17 again. Awkward and small. The institutional feel to the old hallways, with the standardized gray lockers and white walls made her feel as if principal Maynor was going to come out and start handing out detentions. The warm weight of Sam's hand in her own was the only thing that kept her from running back to the car and high-tailing it back to the comfort of her bed. \"Oh God – I forgot what it was like, walking down these halls every day.\" Sam squeezed her hand, a concerned crease forming between his eyebrows. She lifted her hand to his forehead, smoothing away his worry line, but his look of concern still didn't fade. She wanted to tell him that she was fine. She wanted to tell him that she wasn't feeling intimidated, nauseated and sick . But something about being back at her very own hell on earth made her feel like any thing of the sort that she could have said would have been a complete lie. They'd entered the cafeteria by that point, and she paused to take in the sight. There were blackjack and poker tables littered about the room, including an enormous buffet and a champagne fountain. In the middle of the large room there was a makeshift dance floor and the light string of an old power ballad was playing. As she walked around the room, she was instantly recognized by her old teachers. Almost every teacher she spoke with greeted her with some variation of \"Josie! Josie Geller ! Dear, how are you? And who's this handsome young man?\" She had to admit, it was nice to see her old teachers. And they didn't hesitate to inform Sam of how she was \"one of the best students to walk the halls of Holy Trinity High.\" \"...and you should have seen the look on Dean Leonard's face! When Josie – 17 year old Josie – started talking to him about semiotics. I think that that conversation alone guaranteed her place in Northwestern.\" Josie was looking down, blushing wildly and Sam was laughing right along with her old English professor, who was telling him about the day Northwestern's Dean had visited her High School. They were soon joined by other alumni, and after a few minutes of idle conversation, Sam and Josie broke away from the crowd. They walked onto the dance floor, where I've had the time of my life was starting to play. \"I do believe this is your favourite song\" Sam said, a smile playing on his lips. He led her into a turn and twisted her around so that her back was to his chest, and then with another flick of his wrist he turned her so that she was facing him, her hands resting gently on his shoulders. They swayed to he music and she was feeling quite calm and content. And best of all, she was happy. \"Josie!\" Josie turned her head and laid eyes upon Lana Turner. She couldn't help but smile as she broke away from Sam and threw her arms around her old friend. \"Josie! Oh my God, how are you? I almost didn't recognize you!\" The two had lost touch after they left for college, but as she saw the kind smile on her friend's face, she couldn't help but feel like she was on familiar grounds, finally. \"Oh Josie, I'm doing great! Tell me everything!\" Josie laughed at Lana's old catchphrase, shaking her head in amusement. \"You first! I think I see a ring on your finger... when did that happen!?\" Lana giggled and waved over a tall, handsome man. He walked up to her and smiled politely, and Lana made short work of the introductions. \"Josie, this is my husband, Luke Burnham. Luke, Josie Geller.\" Josie shook his hand and as Luke turned to Sam, she took it as her cue. \"Luke, Lana, this is Sam Coulson\" As the men exchanged pleasantries, Lana mouthed a very enthusiastic good work at her. She laughed at her friend's exuberance and pulled her aside, catching up with her. She soon discovered she was a manager at the bank, and that Luke worked for the Government. She and Luke had met at a bar two years ago, and Lana announced she was pregnant, which resulted in very enthusiastic squeals and hugs. \"I see Lana's told Josie she's pregnant\" Luke said to Sam. Regardless of the slight humour that was belied in his voice, it was impossible to miss the joy and pride he was showing. He kissed Lana on the forehead and Josie felt like she was about to burst from joy for her friend. \"Oh, but enough about me! I have to say, I read your article in the Sun Times and it was honestly one of the most romantic things I've ever read. And I make sure to keep up with your column – you always have the most amazing things to say.\" Josie blushed shyly and looked over at Sam. He glanced over at the same time and she smiled tenderly, feeling shivers run down her spine as he gazed at her with unmistakable love and desire. \"I have the right inspiration\" she said, only taking her eyes off Sam when she felt Lana start to shake with excitement. \"You two are just so cute ! Tell me more! And let's get something to eat. You boys want anything?\" She asked, turning to Sam and Luke. \"Punch would be nice\" said Sam, Luke nodding his head in agreement. Lana hooked her arm into Josie's and the two walked to the buffet. \"I'll be right back – I'll go bring them their punch.\" Josie nodded and perused the selection, looking for what she wanted – chocolate. \"Ah ha!\" she said softly to herself, and lifted the cake to her mouth. She couldn't help but close her eyes in satisfaction. If nothing else, chocolate was always the one thing that was right in the world. When she reopened her eyes, she noticed that she had an audience. She felt her heart drop into her stomach as she recognized the blue eyes and dirty blond hair of the boy who's tortured her all through high school – Billy Prince. She frantically wondered where Lana was already, when he started to speak. \"Hey there\" he said with confidence and a little bit of swagger. She looked upon that cocky smile, the one she recognized from all the times he'd laid it upon the cheerleaders in school, and she realized he was flirting . Billy Prince was flirting with Josie Geller. She furtively looked at the roof of the school and wondered if the sky was falling yet. She would have laughed at how preposterous the situation was, except all she wanted to do was hide her head like a turtle. Or maybe even punch him in the face. She settled for being polite. \"Billy Prince. How are you?\" He looked shocked that she knew his name. She could practically see the wheels turning in his head, trying to place her. It was obvious by the awkward look on his face that he was embarrassed, and she mentally shook her head. It was obvious he was still living in High School. Asking for someone's name that one hadn't seen in ten years wasn't a crime. \"Josie Geller, Billy.\" The look of shock on his face made her wish she had a camera, if only because it looked as if the Pope has just announced his life long ambition to be a can-can dancer. \"Josie-Grosie? No way. Dude, that chick was all kinds of scary. And you, baby, are way too fine. Where's the hidden camera?\" He placed his hand on his arm and adopted a cocky swagger. Before she could even express any kind of shock at what he'd just said – really, she couldn't quite believe she ever had a crush on him – or push his hand away, she heard a resounding crack, and the next thing she knew, Billy Prince was on lying on the floor. She saw Sam, breathing heavily and looking for all the world like her knight in shining armor. He had a fiercely protective look on his face, and when he turned to Josie, he bowed his head a little. \"I'm sorry, Josie... I decided to come over when I saw him talking to you, and then I heard what he said a-mmph!\" She cut him off, kissing him fiercely. \"Don't apologize. While I don't want you ever hitting anyone – least of all for me - I was about to do the same thing.\" By that point, Billy had stood up. \"What the hell , dude? I'm going to punch your lights out, asshole.\" But then, someone started clapping their hands together, and soon she saw most of her old classmates applauding. The old \"cool\" gang (and the teachers, of course) didn't encourage the humiliation, but she had a feeling things would have escalated into a brawl if Billy hadn't stalked away to have his girlfriend nurse his wounds. She didn't think she would ever condone violence, but as she remembered her traumatizing heartbreak, she couldn't help but feel that she finally had closure. ---- The night was starting to wind to a close, and what had started out as a nerve-fest had slowly progressed into a relatively pleasant evening – regardless of the small mishap. The crowd had started to dwindle, but with a graduating class of nearly one hundred students, plus their dates, there was still quite a few people left. Luke and Lana had already left, since she was feeling the pregnancy exhaustion, but they made a date to grab dinner later in the week. She and Sam danced in slow circles, as she mused over how glad she was she'd decided to confront her demons. \"So, was it as horrible as you thought it might have been?\" Sam asked, teasingly. She smiled and shook her head pecking him gently on his cheek. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but instead his Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed rather nervously. \"Jos-\" he stopped short and spun her away from him, for what must have made a comical sight. One of the most romantic dance moves, and she looked like a confused squirrel where as Sam looked like someone had just asked him to swallow turpentine. As she, gracefully, reclaimed her earlier position, with her arms around his neck, Sam seemed to have finally worked up the courage to spit out whatever it was he had to say. After a few minutes of silence, however, she was about to chalk it up to it being a passing bout of gas, or something. \"Sam? Are you ok?\" Sam looked at her and seemed to finally take courage in what he saw in her gaze. \"I just love you, is all. Josie -\" He paused, and she could hear the tremble in his voice, and it made him seem incredibly vulnerable. The tenderness in his smile and the way he was looking at her – a combined look of desire and pure, unadulterated love, made her go weak in the knees. If he hadn't been holding her, she was sure she would have revisited her old clumsy ways and skinned her knees on the floor. And then his lips parted and Josie didn't know how she managed not to faint. \"One half of me is yours, the other half yours, mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, and so all yours. Josie Geller, you're the one woman I ever met that manages to keep me sane and drive me crazy all at the same time. You make me laugh when I want to scream and whenever you're away from me I feel like a part of me goes missing.\" By that point he'd dropped to one knee and had pulled out a velvet box. He opened it, and nestled in its folds she could make out through her blurry eye sight a single diamond surrounded by two sapphires on a white-gold band. \"Josie, will you be my other half, for now and always? Will you marry me?\" Josie started nodding her head at an almost frantic pace and she barely gave Sam the chance to stand up and place the ring on her finger that she yelled out \" YES !\" and kissed him, pouring all her love and emotions that she could into that one kiss. She could feel the happiness and relief radiating from Sam. As she broke away and looked at him, a blazing smile on his face she was sure was reflected on her own, she didn't think she could ever frown again. And there, amongst an audience of almost strangers, she was dimly aware of the fact that she'd finally gotten her just rewards. A/N: And I know this was sappy, but I make no excuses! It was based on chick flick, for the love of Shakespeare. And we all love our sap.:D Oh and speaking of Shakespeare, One half of me is yours, the other half yours, mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, and so all yours are actually his words. And to be honest, I do believe that's the first marriage proposal I've ever written! Ever! And for the sake of plot advancement, they don't believe in name tags at Holy Trinity.:P I hope you enjoyed this, and I hope you did so much that you feel compelled to leave me a lovely review? :D Thanks for reading!:) ","Summary":" Revenge is a dish best served unintentionally.

My name is Josie, and I suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. You know I can never say that during my \"ptsd\" sessions. But I guess it's so much easier to say it to you. Some of the people at that place are crazy. But I'm not anything like them. I don't think I really have a problem with anything about me, whether it is external or internal. You know? But there is one thing that I just can't figure out. Why did my classmates hate me so much? I thought I was nice. I never bothered any body. But the sharks that were my peers only saw me as succulent prey. Why? The more I think about it, the more it angers me. And the more it angers me, the more my heart is filled with rage. And the….whoops! Nosebleed. It's been six months since my world was turned upside down because of the reoccurrence of high school. I have gained a considerable amount of weight. Some people don't even recognize me anymore. And after that amazing, life altering experience I thought I was over with high school. But little did I know that fate had a name. Ashley Miller, the head leader of the whore squad during my first years of high school, and my enemy. I saw her at Wal-Mart one afternoon. When I walked into super the center and as I grabbed my buggy, I noticed the baked goods that were lined up on the right-hand side of the entrance as if they had waited for me all day. Untouched. Unblemished. I picked up each container one by one, and began to guzzle down every sugary crumb. Collecting the empty containers so as to pay for my brunch, I smelled the bitter stench of sin clouding my surroundings. I turned to my left and I saw her. The tramp was pregnant. She didn't see me. But I watched her wobble to and fro like a penguin. She still had the same look about her as she did back in school. I positioned myself so I wouldn't be seen. I stood at the beginning of check out aisle number one pretending to read a magazine. She made eye contact with me instantly and made haste towards me in a sly manner. I tried to walk away but I turned around and body smacked the snack stand beside me.\" Josie Gross-….I mean Josie Gellar. What a pleasant surprise.\" She snorted. \"Like wise Ashley. So, how are you? Bloated?\" She looked at me as if she was studying my mind through my eyes. \"No. Actually I feel very content. My husband is a very successful entrepreneur, and I am 8 months pregnant with his second child. But it seems to me that from our current location you're just having a ball.\" She grunted. \"Well I am successful in my own right, Ashley. But I understand that there is no amount of success that God has given me that could ever amount to the stretch marks of family hood and body deformation that He has given you.\" I retorted. She looked at me with loathe. \"Well Josie, it looks as if God doesn't have to help you with constant weight gain. It seems to me that you've got that part of your life perfectly and absolutely under control. Now if you asked me, and only if you asked me, I'd have to determine that most of your success derived from a pork chop eating contest that never came to be due to the pre-contest late night ramblings of a three hundred pound mastodon devouring every piece of swiney goodness.\" She said with haste. \"Well...well...you're a...you're a bitch!\" I replied. \"Now hold on one second...

I kissed you remember\" Josie pleaded. \"I know,nbut, since I'm older I should have stopped you, instead, I returnednit\" \"You'rennot older than me!\" \"Yes, Inam\" \"No! Inam an undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun Times; I'mntwenty-five years old!\" Josie whispered. \"What?\"nSam asked. \"I'mntwenty-five\" Josie repeated. \"Youncan't be…\" Sam began. \"I am.nSo you can kiss me\" Josie cut him off. \"I know,nso all this time I was actually allowed to be attracted to you?\" \"Younwere attracted to me?\" \"Yes,nyes I was…a…am\" With that he leaned over and kissed her again,nthis time with more passion. As his lips touched hers she felt ansudden heat rush through her body. She felt something warm and wetnagainst her lip, subconsciously she opened her mouth. It was then shenrealised that the warm, wet thing was Sam's tongue. Her tongue metnhis in a dance of passion. This wasnJosie's first real kiss. Scenen2; Looking for music for the Prom Josienpicked up a CD and showed it to Sam, he shook his head. \"Here,ntry these\" he said as he sat a box of LP's on the table. \"Ok\"nJosie replied. She blushed. Theynboth reached for the same record. Their fingers touched, sending anheat wave through both of their bodies like an electric shock.nNeither was willing to pull their hand away, so Sam took Josie'snhand in his. Then, it was like his mind lost control of his body,nand, before he knew it, he was kissing Josie's hand. He pulled herncloser to him and captured her lips with his. He knew that it wasnwrong, but, it felt so right. Here, in a room where no-one couldndisturb them, Sam and Josie kissed. Scenen3; Talking about Dartmouth \"Oh, Inalmost forgot. I got you a meeting with the admissions guy fromnDartmouth\" Sam said. \"Dartmouth?nBut, um…I wasn't gonna go to college\" Josie replied, nervously. \"No, no,nI…I pulled a few strings and, uh, I got him to look at your writingnand he agreed to meet with you\" \"Younbelieve in me that much?\" \"Ofncourse I do, Josie, you, you owe it to yourself, to your writing tongo to college. You are a great writer; you just have to find yournstory\" Sam persisted. Their faces were so close; he could feel hernbreath on his skin. He couldn't help himself. He leaned in andnbrushed his lips against hers. She returned the kiss. Neither of themncared who saw them. She knew that she was legally of age, but,nunfortunately, Sam didn't. She broke off the kiss. \"Sam,nthere's something that I need to tell you\" \"Ok, I'mnlistening\" \"It'snjust that…urg! There's no easy way of saying this so I'm justngonna come out with it. I'm twenty-five years old and an undercovernreporter for the Chicago Sun Times\" Josie blurted. \"You mustnreally hate me now\" \"No, Indon't\" Sam said, and to prove his point he kissed her again. Scenen4; Dancing at the Prom \"Younknow, it's funny, proms always make me a little sad. They're sonfinal. I mean graduation and everyone scattering off and moving on\"nSam said as he danced with Josie. \"Is yourngirlfriend here?\" Josie asked. \"No, no,nI'm alone, in-fact we broke up last week\" \"Really?nThat's funny because you know actually prom comes from promenade,nand you can't promenade alone can you?\" \"You'renamazing Josie Geller\" Sam said, and with that he kissed her.nEveryone on the dance floor saw it. \"Havenyou thought anymore about Dartmouth?\" Sam asked as soon as theirnkiss ended. \"Yes,nand, um, there's something that I want to tell you\" Josienreplied. As she replied she pulled the winged brooch off. \"There'snsomething I want to tell you too\" \"Ok,nplease don't be mad at me, but, I am twenty-five years old and annundercover reporter for the Chicago Sun Times, I was sent here tonwrite a story about teenagers of this day and age, but now I have tonwrite a story about you\" \"You'renwriting a story about me?\" \"Yes!nBut I don't want to! My boss is making me\" \"Inunderstand. I'm sorry, Josie, I have to go\" and with that SamnCoulson walked away. Later thatnevening Josie was sitting at home reading a book when the door bellnrang. She got up and opened the door. There on her doorstep was SamnCoulson. He didn't say anything, but, took her into his arms andnkissed her soundly. \"I neverngot to say what I was going to tell you\" he said, as they pullednapart. \"Yeah,nand what were you going to say?\" \"I wasngoing to say that I am falling in love with you.\" Josiensmiled and threw her arms around Sam. \"I lovenyou!\" She cried. \"I lovenyou too!\" Sam replied.

Ok...not mine and all that jazz. This takes place in the two seconds from when Sam talks about his suit to asking her to dance. OK...ALSO...one of the quotes isn't in the movie, but from the original script which can be found here online at geocities. \"I always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. Like I'm at my own wedding or something.\" He'd let it out. It was gone without a second thought. Freudian slip. Mistake anyone could make…right? 'Penguin suit.' He inwardly groaned. Penguins. Sam had been hell-bent on avoiding that topic around Josie; he almost laughed. Almost. Penguins weren't usually a banned topic of conversation. '… Adele penguins spend their whole lives looking for that one other penguin and when they meet them, they know. And they spend the rest of their lives together.' Sam wasn't stupid. He knew he was falling for her; of course he knew. How could you not know? But she was a student…and yet, no matter how many times he told himself this it never quite clicked. She certainly didn't act seventeen. Seventeen. He was twenty-seven. He was seventeen 10 years ago. He met Lara five years ago. Josie was seven 10 years ago. He broke up with Lara one week ago. Josie almost kissed him one week ago…or he almost kissed her…he wasn't quite sure on this point. It had been the damn penguins again. ' Our penguin, right?' ' Do you think you'll find her?' ' Yeah, actually I do.' He remembered how bad he'd wanted to kiss her; hadn't he also been sure that she wanted to kiss him? He thought he had. He had thought he was a well mannered, law abiding, man…but the closer he looked at Josie the more he felt his resolve failing…like he might tell her that she was his penguin at any moment. Dangerous business, penguins. He would've never thought that flightless, artic birds would give him so much trouble. He wasn't sure if he minded this trouble…because, for trouble, it wasn't very troubling. He shouldn't think that. She was a student. Off limits. …with a protective bubble of laws and rules surrounding her. He wanted so bad to touch her. Even for just a moment. He could ask her to dance. Should he ask her to dance? What was the worst she could do? Say no? Sam liked that possibility less than not touching her. He wasn't sure what he would do if she said no. The quick image of her backing away with a horrorstruck face flashed in his mind. She wouldn't do that…would she? He didn't think she would. She had certainly surprised him on many occasions…although none of those had been unwelcome surprises; though perhaps maybe they should be. He wanted to tell her he loved her. He wanted her to call him Sam. He wanted her to be older than seventeen. He wanted to pull her close…and he was sure that if he did that he wouldn't be able to let go. He remembered hearing once a man, describing himself as violently in love, say that he wanted to freeze time, watch his beloved for longer than forever. Sam meant no disrespect, but he could never see himself wanting that; Josie was the most beautiful girl in the world, and he felt like he could look at her forever, but what kind of a love was that? Admiration…maybe. Lust. Desire. But love? He thought there was a little more than that to love. He wanted to know her…not just look at her. He hoped she wanted to know him. He hoped she would dance with him. He hoped his evening would end on a happy note. He hoped she hadn't noticed him say 'Penguin suit.' \"You wanna…?\" Sam gestured to the dance floor; he was proud of himself, he'd nearly managed to say a full sentence.[Chapter 2] I was looking through all the reviews...and I was like...\"YA KNOW? . . . I'll write more.\" Sooooo...here ya go. Josie's POV. Still don't own. \"I always feel like such a goofball in these penguin suits. Like I'm at my own wedding or something.\" She'd heard it; she was sure…but then again he could've just been talking about his suit, and besides that he had Lara…right? 'Penguin suit.' She inwardly grinned. Penguins. She didn't think he would remember; perhaps he didn't…but Josie could hope. '… Adele penguins spend their whole lives looking for that one other penguin and when they meet them, they know. And they spend the rest of their lives together.' Josie hated her babblings; she never seemed able to turn off…she wasn't quite sure how she'd managed to stay 'seventeen' for this long. She'd made a decision; she would tell him before prom was over. Sam was a good man a deserved to know…even if he didn't return her feelings. Oh God…she hoped he returned her feelings. He was dating. He was moving. He was perfect. She was in too deep. Josie almost kissed him one week ago…or he almost kissed her…she wasn't sure if this happened the way she remembered. It had been those wonderful penguins again. ' Our penguin, right?' ' Do you think you'll find her?' ' Yeah, actually I do.' She remembered how her heart sank at those words before she noticed him leaning in closer to her; hadn't she also been sure that he wanted to kiss her? She thought she had. The more she thought about it the more she wished she could talk to him sooner; tell him everything…like that he was her penguin. Wonderful animals, penguins. She would've never thought that flightless, artic birds would give her so much hope. She wasn't sure if she should hope…he had seemed so happy with Lara. Perfect blonde Lara. She was a lying to him. He would hate her. …or even if he didn't there was no way he could…love…her…was there? She wanted so bad to know . Even if it wasn't the answer she wanted. She could ask him to talk. Should she ask him to talk? What was the worst he could do? Say no? Josie didn't think he would…he was always so nice. Too nice. She didn't think he should be that nice…not to someone like her. She remembered how he would explain things to the class…never be to condescending. Smiling…caring…he loved his job and the students. He had the same passion for literature that she had and the love for sports. She just hoped he could forgive her. She hoped he felt the same way she did. She hoped he would understand why she did it. She hoped to be held close…but she was sure that if he did that she wouldn't be able to let go. She remembered the love stories in all her favorite books, being described as living through the ages, crossing worlds and surviving all. She wanted a love like that; she'd waited for a love like that. She thought that maybe she'd found it in Sam. She hoped it was jealously glinting in his eye when he looked at Guy. She shouldn't think that…but she did anyway. She hoped he would talk with her. She hoped her evening would end on a happy note. She hoped he'd meant to say 'Penguin suit.' \"You wanna…?\" Sam gestured to the dance floor; she was so happy, now she wouldn't have to drag him away to talk.

There had always been something haunting about them, something beautiful people often overlooked. Mathilda recalled how the lighthouses could be built in the 1800s and still stand today just as strong as they had before. It didn't matter the weather, didn't matter what nature threw at it, and time meant nothing to the never aging stone. It was incredible, she never could understand how structures like a simple lighthouse could withstand time and nature when buildings down the street were being destroyed every day. When she met Léon, he resembled a lighthouse to her the more she got to know him. His eyes were always far away, gazing upon some horizon that Mathilda wished she could see but knew she'd never be able to, like sleeping with one eye open, she supposed. It was always to stay focused, to get the job done. No questions, no thoughts, just work. The sands of time could scratch at him, leave its mark, he could be splashed with the cold reality of life and chilled to the bone with the truth; yet nothing could make him bend or break. Nothing got in the way of his focus. Mathilda often wondered if she was at the horizon at all, or if it was merely the men he killed or had to kill. His silhouette in the chair made her believe it was the latter, though her intuition told her otherwise. As long as he stood the way he did, she would be by his side whether he liked it or not. She would never break his focus, or take his horizon away from him if it really is all he knew. Mathilda would be there to withstand time with him, live on with him, be there to protect his stone outside if it meant breathing the light of life back into him herself...and more importantly, help him see the rainbow and sunset after every storm that hit. Because she loved him.

Todo de Luc Besson. Prompt: #001 [Los Cuervos de las Navidades Pasadas; Fandom Insano] 1 C aminas por aquel estrecho pasillo que aparenta ser eterno. La luz te da de lleno en los ojos y estos te duelen, debes esforzarte en no cerrarlos y rendirte. Rendirte para con todo y dejar de mover mecánicamente los pies, directo a la salida del edificio. Hay personas que gritan y ordenan que evacuen rápido, los oyes sin oírlos y sólo curvas tus labios en una media sonrisa al pensar que ella está entre toda esa gente arremolinada en el exterior. Que te espera, así como fue capaz de esperar al tocar el timbre apremiantemente mientras te rogaba «Abre la puerta, por favor por favor, abre» con su vocecilla de cordero asustado. Y es insólito, pero tienes el impulso de extender el brazo y acariciarle el pelo y enjuagarle el llanto, asegurándole que todo está bien, que escaparán —juntos— y no tiene que perder a nadie preciado otra vez. Ninguno de los dos. Aunque sabes de sobra que ella no está ahí, contigo. Es todo una fantasía. Y te acercas a las puertas abiertas de par en par, y casi puedes sentir el aire fresco. Los pájaros cantando. Un abrazo de Mathilda. Los rayos del sol. Sentir una vida al lado de ella repleta de tardes donde se disfracen de personalidades famosas y tomen un vaso de leche fresca y te sonría (Léon, creo que estoy enamorada de ti). Te brilla la mirada, sólo unos pasos más. Anda, tú puedes. Te apremias. Porque toda tu mente es Mathilda, Mathilda, Mathilda. Ya voy por ti . Y la piensas tanto que no notas el disparo que te perfora, únicamente tus piernas doblegándose. Incluso desde el piso embarrado en sangre, tu sangre, el pasillo sigue igual de eterno. 2 Y resuena la tormenta al ritmo de las notas de Beethoven y sus sinfonías, esas que tanto te fascinan y vuelven de cabeza al mundo. Avanzas sin vacilaciones, con la pistola en la mano, bajando más y más hasta quedar junto a tu bolsillo. De ese traje que compraste en una tienda fina para clientes con gustos finos. Te permites regodearte un minuto, observándole tirado en el suelo. Con los últimos vestigios de su existencia. De aquel tipo serio que tantos problemas te ha ocasionado. Haces una mueca inconsciente y te arrodillas. Pronto la partitura se verá afectada y se volverá lenta y aburrida. Pero no ahora, ahora es el apogeo y el éxtasis, ambos tuyos. Para tu deleite. Tarareas para tus adentros, y él te ve. Tranquilo, muy tranquilo. Demasiado. La fragancia de la victoria te enceguece. Sabes que es cuestión de tiempo para salir y encontrar a la niña. Te recreas igual que a un Padre atento a la confesión del pecador. Te escucho, hijo mío . Y no percibes nada raro en que te coja la mano con tanta intensidad y tus dedos se hinchen, tornándose purpuras. Es la mejor parte. Los instrumentos se tornan violentos y arrebatadores en tu memoria. — Esto es… de parte… de Mathilda. No entiendes, no de inmediato. Es tu graso error. Observas las granadas, maldiciendo para tus adentros. «Oh, Beethoven, buen amigo, hasta aquí llegamos». Quedan doce segundos y la bomba estalla. 3 Y todavía lo recreas. El impasible y cruel Boom llenando las calles cercanas, tus dedos temblorosos aferrándose con ímpetu a la maceta en tu costado, las lágrimas incesantes cuando te percataste de que Léon rompió su promesa y está muerto, tan muerto como tu hermano menor. Yo también te quiero, Mathilda . No obstante, tratas de no olvidarlo, de acordarte que solía usar unos lentes negros y un gorro si iban a limpiar , que le costaba mucho leer pero aprendió de a poco gracias a ti, que era cálido su cuerpo al abrazarte antes de que huyeran del departamento policiaco y siempre parecía muy solo. Y te acuclillas en el pasto mientras las demás chiquillas del instituto ríen y platican del muchacho que les gusta. Te abstraes, mirando con fijeza las hojas que son mecidas por el viento, las de la planta que no tiene raíces, o al menos, no las tenía. Y te gustaría decir que los recuerdos prevalecerán, que toman la forma de tu corazón y eso es más que suficiente porque el amor para una niña de doce es imperfecto. Más las palabras que surgen no son esas, sino un quedo y dolido «Léon, estamos en casa». Entonces sacas un cigarrillo de tu cajetilla y exhalas el humo. Con la certeza de que aunque él se ha ido, continúa allí. ","Summary":" Renuncia: si la peli fuese mía, al final Léon y Mathilda huirían montados en un unicornio.

Turn Your Face El invierno había llegado a la ciudad como cada año, aunque de igual manera, con cada año que pasaba se sentía más frío que el anterior. Quizá solo era el frío de la soledad que aumentaba con el pasar de los años. Tomó un trago a la humeante taza de chocolate caliente que tenía en las manos, la dejó en la mesa de al lado y tomó el control remoto que se encontraba ahí, encendió el televisor y cambió de canal y dejó uno al azar, era el programa de dibujos animados que veía hace años. El fugaz recuerdo de ella en el departamento de León el día que asesinaron a su familia se implantó en su mente. Como si no fuese suficiente, revivió cada uno de los momentos que vivió a su lado como si de una película se tratará. Ese maldito de León, a final de cuentas, nunca le importó nada de lo que le pasara a ella. Tras lo pasado con Stan, él apareció frente a ella de la nada, corrió hacía él y lo abrazó con todas las fuerzas que tenía. Si se trataba de otra mala broma de su mente, no importaba, se sentía tan real, que tampoco le importó que desde el último día que le vio, ya habían pasado varios meses. León nunca correspondió a su abrazo. Se limitó a permanecer estático en su lugar, sin embargo Mathilda lloró hasta que no pudo más, cuando descubrió que no era una alucinación producto de sus ganas de volver a verlo, le asaltó con preguntas, y solo hacia pausa para decirle lo mucho que lo había extrañado. Pero León no respondía nada, parecía más una estatua que hombre. Tras apaciguar su euforia, Mathilda le recordó lo que le había dicho antes de que la obligara a salir del edificio y le exigió cumplirlo con una tierna sonrisa en sus labios; sonrisa que borro cuando León se limitó a decirle que se alegraba de que estuviera sana y salva. Se dio la vuelta y sin decir nada más, se alejó ignorando los gritos de Mathilda llamándolo y suplicando que no se marchara otra vez. Mathilda se derrumbó sobre el suelo y lloró con más fuerza. Desde ese día se prometió no volver a llorar por León. No lloró más, pero con cada día que pasó, lo extrañó más que el anterior. El nudo en el estómago que alguna vez tuvo, volvió junto a una gran sensación de vacío. Se acostumbró a vivir con ello. Cuando tuvo la edad suficiente de conseguir un buen trabajo y vivir de el, dejó de visitar a Tony. Vivía en un pequeño apartamento en un quinto piso, rodeada principalmente de familias que le recordaban a la que alguna vez tuvo. Alguien llamó a la puerta, apagó el televisor y se dirigió hasta la puerta. Miró a través de la mirilla de la puerta y no vio a nadie. Tomó un viejo palo de golf y con cautela abrió la puerta sin quitar la cadena. Para su sorpresa, ahí, frente a su puerta estaba un decaído León; era evidente que los años habían hecho mella en él. Ninguno de los dos decía algo, solo se miraban el uno al otro. Era injusto que tras abandonarla, años después apareciera de nuevo frente a ella. Sentía como todas las lágrimas que había guardado durante estos años, luchaban por salir. — ¿Mathilda? —fue lo único que se atrevió a decir León. Cerró la puerta, y se apoyó en ella, las piernas le temblaban y su corazón estaba a mil por hora. No era nada justo. Solo quería que él se diera la vuelta y se alejara como lo había hecho hace años. Este pequeño escrito lo tenía desde hace meses, de un día que volví a ver la película y terminé abatida como me pasa cada que la veo, pero bleh.

Las personas van y vienen felices, pues todos sabían quién sería el ganador. Al menos así lo pensaba Jason Kellogg, el aspirante del partido republicano. -¡Cariño! ¿Porque esa cara?- Decía el hombre gordo, calvo y viejo de 60 años a su esposa joven, de al menos 30 años, lo decía enfrente de los compañeros políticos de campaña de forma simpática -Estoy cansada Jason, necesito dormir un poco -¡¿Dormir?! ¡¿En las elecciones?! ¡No tenemos tiempo para eso!- El hombre tomó las dos manos de su mujer. La dama que era de piel blanca, cabello cobrizo y ojos verdes se estaba desesperando de la actitud de su esposo. Odiaba que la prensa estuviera justo afuera de su casa, parecían zombies, esperando tomar una fotografía -¡Venga! ¡Vayamos con la prensa y hablemos! -Estoy cansada- Se levantó la mujer -Me iré a mi habitación- Sintió una presión en su mano izquierda, la que no veían los compañeros políticos, la que no veía la prensa, la parte que nadie veía entre ellos dos -Amor, sólo hoy y te prometo que serás libre ¿Esta bien?- Una sonrisa se dibujo en la cara de ese hombre, una sonrisa que ella conocía, que sabía que si no haría las cosas como el pedía, habrían consecuencias. -Kellogg, déjala ir a su cuarto- Llegó Frederic, uno de los compañeros del candidato -De cualquier forma los resultados serán hasta casi la media noche -Bueno, te dejaré libre unos momentos ¡Pero regresarás en la tarde!- Dijo el hombre desesperado. La mujer subió las escaleras de su casa, llegó a su habitación y empezó a llorar ¿Es que siempre tendrá que tener esa sensación de encierro? ¿Siempre se sentirá acorralada ante ese hombre? -Maldito seas padre- Se decía con rabia, mientras secaba sus lagrimas. Pronto se quitó el vestido rojo que tenía puesto y los tacones negros, se puso unos jeans con una blusa gris de botones y converse blancos, se recogió su cabello y se puso unos lentes oscuros. Una de las sirvientas de su mansión se había vuelto su cómplice para salir de su hogar cuando su esposo se encontraba distraído u ocupado. El jardinero también lo era, la acompañaba a la calle para conseguir un taxi. La mujer llegó a un restaurante estilo italiano. Entró al lugar y se sentó en una mesa, estaba esperando a cierta persona en especial. -¿Necesita ayuda?- Se acercó a ella una mujer, tenía el cabello negro, de largo a los hombros, delgada, alta, con ojos color castaño claro. La señora Kellogg encontró a quien buscaba -Sí... necesito su ayuda...- La chica se sentó enfrente de Kellogg, la miró fijamente -Tengo condiciones -¿Que tipo de condiciones? -Ni mujeres ni niños -No es una mujer ni un niño, es mi esposo- Se acercó un mesero a pedirles la orden a ambas mujeres, la Sra. Kellogg no pidió nada, la misteriosa mujer pidió un vaso de leche -¿Jason Kellogg? -Sí...- Volvió el mismo mesero con un vaso de leche para Mathilda, el mesero entró a cocina, dejando a ambas solas. -¿Por que razón?- La Sra. Kellogg se quitó sus lentes, sacó de su bolsillo un paquete de toallitas desmaquillantes, empezó a pasar una de esas toallas por toda su cara, miró de enfrente a Mathilda, tenía ambos ojos moreteados, enseguida, como el restaurante se encontraba vacío, se quitó la blusa y mostró los diferentes golpes alrededor de su cuerpo. -Por esta razón... ni hablar de todas las noches... todas las noches, antes de dormir con él, se vuelven una pesadilla, una pesadilla antes de dormir...Y además de eso, hace un par de años me golpeo lo suficiente como para tener un aborto, tenía 6 meses, le dijo a mi familia, a sus conocidos y a la prensa que fue un accidente... no lo fue, claro que no lo fue...- Volvió a ponerse la blusa -Y es lo que quiere que ocurra, ¿No es así? ¿Un \"accidente\"? -No... quiero que parezca un atentado- Mathilda miraba fijamente a la mujer, mientras bebía un vaso de leche -¿Quiere que sea esta noche? -¿Esta noche? Pero no sabemos si ganará o no -Sencillo: Si no gana, nos volvemos a reunir aquí al día siguiente, si gana hoy, se hará el trato -¿Podrá hacerlo? ¿A pesar de la seguridad?- Empezó a llorar la mujer -Puedo hacer cualquier cosa, procure estar algo alejada de su esposo esta noche si gana -¿Porque? -Jackie Kennedy estuvo a punto de ser atravesada por la bala también, para su fortuna, sólo su cara se cubrió de diversas partes del cerebro de su esposo. Si los de seguridad intentan protegerte, te dejas que lo hagan, y finge histeria, mucha histeria- La Sra Kellogg entendió, sacó de su cartera 4000 dólares y se los dejó en la mesa, salió del local. Mathilda miró el dinero, lo tomó y se dirigió a su departamento. Al llegar, lo primero que hizo fue prepararse, si sería en un evento donde iba a tener mucha seguridad, tendría que hacerlo rápido y preciso. Tomó un fusil de francotirador con silenciador, miró el calibre y consiguió las balas. desarmó su arma y los metió en una funda de violín. Salió de su casa y fue a algún edificio cerca de Time Square, donde sería la celebración de Jason Kellogg si ganaba. Encontró el sitio perfecto, se puso sus lentes, su gorro y espero al gran momento. -Lion...- Susurró Mathilda. Pronto se hizo de noche, el conteo fue rápido: Jason Kellogg era el nuevo gobernador de Nueva York. - \"Y muchas gracias a todos y todas por quienes confiaron en nosotros\"- Ensayaba una Sra. Kellogg enfrente del espejo, con un vestido azul corto con mangas -¿Estas ensayando cariño?- Entró el Sr. Kellogg a su habitación, y miró el color del vestido. Bofetada al instante -¿Eres acaso estúpida? -Lo siento, olvidé que tenía que ser el rojo -¿Olvidas el color del partido de su marido? Seguramente votaste por los demócratas, mujer idiota- Cerró de golpe. La Sra. Kellogg empezó a llorar, pero ella sabía que no viviría más pesadillas de noche antes de dormir. Mathilda observaba desde el tejado la gran celebración de los republicanos. A ella le daba igual la política, sólo le parecía perdida de tiempo y esfuerzo. -Lion...estoy aquí...- Decía nerviosa al cielo -Estoy a punto de hacer otro asesinato, y es la primera vez con un político- Miraba hacía abajo, hacía la multitud- Tu me dices como hacerlo, ya que no se como matar a un político- La gente estalló en júbilo cuando miró al ganador electo, tomado de la mano de su esposa. Mathilda se acostó en el suelo, empezó a armar el fusil -Te escuché Lion...\"En posición\" -¡Nueva York!- Empezó a recitar su discurso de ganador -¡Hoy no me queda decir nada más que gracias...!- La gente gritaba, era una fiesta total allá abajo, fiesta que Mathilda no quería interrumpir, pero tenía que hacerlo. -Estoy tranquila Lion- Decía Mathilda mientras apuntaba, el corazón le palpitaba a mil por hora -Lo tengo en la mira...- El hombre se movía mucho, estaba en felicidad total, había ganado las elecciones, y si ganaba las elecciones podría tener una oportunidad para poder ser el siguiente Presidente de los Estados Unidos, nada ni nadie podrían detenerle, excepto la chica que estaba al menos 1 Kilometro de distancia de él. -Imagino que estoy junto a él, que soy como su esposa, la del vestido rojo, puedo saber cual será su siguiente movimiento...- Ahora si lo tenía en la mira, sólo necesitaba estar segura, necesitaba esperar el momento perfecto para atacar. -Estoy calmada... - Se seguía diciendo Mathilda de esta forma, dejó de respirar por un momento -Lion... Tu dime cuando... \"Ahora\" Una bala atravesó el cráneo de Jason Kellogg, la noche de júbilo se volvió de terror para todos los presentes, la gente intentaba huir del lugar, la Sra. Kellogg estalló en histeria, no esperaban menos de ella, corrió a través de la tarima del lugar, se abalanzó a los brazos de un agente de seguridad para ser protegida, estos se la llevaron inmediatamente a su casa, los agentes empezaron a buscar inmediatamente en todos los edificios, en todas las casas cercanas, en todos los tejados al asesino del gobernador electo Jason Kellogg, pero para cuando esto pasaba, Mathilda ya se había retirado del lugar. La Sra. Kellogg fue resguardada en su casa, rodeada de miles de policías, agentes del FBI y de la CIA, entró a su habitación, necesitaba estar a solas, todos la comprendieron, una mujer que acaba de entrar a la viudez necesitaba tener espacio. Se miró al espejo -Tenías razón Jason... me dijiste que sólo hoy y estaría en libertad, tenías tanta razón Jason... La tenías...- Se estaba poniendo su pijama, preparándose para dormir sin tener pesadillas antes, durante y después de dormir. Llegó Mathilda a su departamento, calmada, dejó el estuche de violín en una mesita contra la pared a un lado de la televisión, la encendió. Todas las noticias hablaban acerca del asesinato, como era que buscaban en todo lados al asesino, que hasta creían que era un ataque terrorista. Mathilda dejó la televisión encendida mientras se acercaba con su vaso de leche a una planta que tenía en el balcón de su casa. Empezó a lagrimear, cada asesinato que ella cometía, por alguna razón le recordaba a él, a su mentor, al que la acogió cuando su más mínima esperanza de sobrevivir era nula, el hombre que le enseñó a matar, el hombre que le enseñó a ser brutal, de quien se enamoró, y sigue enamorada, el que le dio el más hermoso regalo que pudo haber recibido: la venganza contra Norman Stansfield, el hombre que le arrebató la vida a su pequeño hermano menor. -Lo he vuelto hacer Lion...- Dijo Mathilda mientras la acariciaba, dejó derramar un poco del vaso de leche a la planta -...he vuelto a matar, gracias a ti...- Dio un beso a una de las hojas de la planta -Te amo... gracias por enseñarme todo lo que sé...- ¡Segundo Fanfic que subo en esta plataforma!

New York, 1984. Somewhere in the crowded streets of New York, in one of the many filthy hostels; a place where any kind of feeling can become something else if you're not strong enough to deal with that. There lived an underclass family, the father was a drunk, drug addict troublemaker, the mother a prostitute, and 3 kids: a grown up teenage boy, a girl who wouldn't be aged more than 15 and a little child. Sometimes the man would wake up in the morning and whenever he had the hangover – or whatever the reason – it was indeed another terrific day to beat up his daughter. The girl's brother and mom pretended to be blind and deaf in order to ignore all the screaming and bruises. This killing routine was destroying her childhood as the days went by. After every beat she would go to the streets after having stollen a cigarrette from her mother's drawer. She seemed to care more about her brother than herself, trying to grant him the life she could never have, too bad her parents felt the opposite and couldn't care less about him. The only thing that was holding her hopes up was her little brother. At least, that was what she believed. One day when heading back home after running away from her father, she spotted 3 cars; one of them was a police car. Since her father had a lot of issues with many people, she opted to carefully enter the hostel. Her home's door was open and there were two tall intimidating men standing at the entrance guarding it. Before she could be seen by the \"guards\", she heard several gunshots. Those shots startled her so much she couldn't move. She could only standing at the corner of the hallway gathering her strenght from deep down inside. After a minute or two – which seemed to be an age or two – she calmly went past the door and the \"guards\". She had a glimpse of her father and mother laying down on the ground covered in blood, while hearing a shrill cry that was interrupted all of a sudden by another gunshot. One could not bear nor stand the agony and pain she felt in that moment. However, she assembled all of her courage and past through the door pretending to ignore the scene, since it was nothing really unusual in that kind of place. She walked to the door at the end of the hallway and ringed the bell while the accomplices of the murderers followed her with their suspicious eyes. No one answered the door. She ringed again. A few seconds later, the door opened enough for her to go in, and so did she. Right after she sneaked into the apartment, the door closed immediately and she was standing there a italian looking 40 year old man with black clothes, a black beanie and sunglasses with circular lens. At first, she was relieved because she was safe there, but on the other hand, she was in a small dark room with nothing more than a couch and a television on the living room, and plus, the frightening guy. She was just standing still there, quiet as a monk. So was he. What is your name? she asked not sure if she should do that. Leon. My name is Mathilda... Nice to meet you. She said with an hesitant voice. And silence was all the response she had from him. In the meanwhile, ices started to echo through the hallway, Mathilda headed to the door and while standing on her tip toes she took a glimpse of the hallwat through the peephole. She could see several men alike the ones guarding the door and a peculiar one wearing a white expensive suit and sunglasses. She then felt her legs heavy and her vision bluring gradually, she fainted shortly after while calling for Matthew – her young brother. She woke up in a bedroom with nothing more than a bed. Afterwards she realized she wasn't home anymore. She slowly got out of the bed while clumsily groping the walls trying to find something or nothing at all. The apartment was small, a few steps after leaving the room she got back to the living room. Leon was sitting on the couch with a bucket of water by his side and for her despair, over the table she saw a large set of knives, some of them covered in blood while he carefully cleaned all the blood stains from each knife. She wanted to run and scream, yet her legs couldn't do so. He noticed her and ran to her direction. She couldn't stand any longer and collapsed. Leon held her light body before it hit the ground while telling her not to push herself. Mathilda was so numb she probably didn't understand a word he said. He laid her down in the bed once again. As soon as the girl's eyes were open, they found Leon's staring at hers. After a brief moment of silence she took a deep breath and asked him with a peaceful voice such as those who have accepted their fate: Will you kill me? No women. No children. Answered him with a straight voice. Surprised with such unexpected statement, she didn't know whether to be happy or scared, after all, he was a hitman. She couldn't stop wondering about the living room scene. Here, you must be starving, said Leon handing her a couple of toasts with butter. Indeed she was. Not thinking twice, she fiercely devoured the toasts. Right after the breakfast she sat on the edge of the bed and looked deep into his eyes pronouncing these exact words: - Can you teach me how to kill? Leon choked on his own saliva not believing he'd ever hear such words come out from a girl's mouth. What nonsense! He yelled while abandoning the chair he was sitting on. Don't even think about that! He then disappeared in the darkness of the hallway. She stood in the exact same place bending her knees, burying her face beneath them and then crying quietly. He peeped into the room and saw everything. However, he didn't feel like he had to do anything. The following week he said Mathilda she should go away, she didn't belong with him. She started to whine and tell him about all the trouble she would face out there in the world all by herself. Since he was so awkward in social aspects, he didn't stand a chance against her crying baby face. Little by little she became a great helper; she started doing dishes, cleaning the floor while he was out on a job and other domestic tasks. Until one day he came back home in the middle of the night staggering through the hallway – that woke up the little Mathilda. She then faced Leon bleeding and panicked trying to find a way to be helpful. Mathilda, grab the suitcase under my bed! He sat in a chair in the living room and tore his shirt. He had been hit by a gunshot in his right arm. Mathilda opened the suitcase and asked what she should do. He ordered her to tie a strap on his arm and to pass him the forceps. She tied the strap with all her strength, even though she didn't have much. He grabbed the forceps with his left shaking hand, too bad he also was right-handed. No way he could remove the bullet like that. He dropped the forceps while agonizing in pain. I'll do it. Said Mathilda grabbing the forceps. No way! You can't do it. You can't either. Let me give a shot. He was too weak to object or to push her away due to all the bleeding. Mathilda tried to stick the forceps in the bullet hole, but all the blood was blocking her view. After she poked the wound for ten minutes, she reached the bullet and removed it. With a gauze she made a second-rate bandage. Leon then fainted. The next morning he jumped out of his bed and his eyes found Mathilda's. Good morning, Leon. I have to clean up the blood trail I left in my way here. He slowly tried to get on his feet. Don't worry, I cleaned it already. And here is your breakfast. Said Mathilda stopping him. He was stunned for a second or two. The little girl he had just saved was now his savior. What a turn of events. In the afternoon, Leon called Mathilda to the balcony. She promptly showed up. Open the case. He pointed to something that looked like a guitar case. She opened it and there she found several metal parts. Can you set it up for me? After 20 minutes, she had a sniper rifle in her hands. And fearing for Leon's health she said she wouldn't hand it to him. I'm not the one shooting it. Then who is? You are. Her eyes showed how much surprised she was. Still, she didn't hesitate a bit. As soon as my arm is healed, I'm going to teach you how to wield closer combat weapons. For now let's focus on long range weapons. Okay! She replied anxious. But remember, we do not kill civilians, women or children. For like 3 months, he taught her how to shoot from long range with different weapons. When his arm was healed, they moved to the countryside, so no one would be suspicious about it. Not much happened during the training, besides the huge improvement in Mathilda's assassin skills and body. Four years passed since they moved to the countryside. She was now a woman. And women are so independent. After the training she came back to the Big Apple. Leon's bond with Mathilda had grown so strong that he forgot about her past. And that was his worst mistake. A beautiful and dangerous woman was now armed and thirsty for revenge in the streets of New York. Leon retired as a hitman. He decided to give him some rest at the countryside. Maybe become a farmer. Who knows? He spent most of his days with a stray dog he adopted by his said and reading any book he could put his hands on. Nevertheless, peace was not meant to be for his kind of people. Three months after Mathilda's departure, he read in the newspaper about a serial killer striking in New York. The killer wiped out two whole gangs and some police officers and their families. The officer in charge of the case was Inspector Stansfield, a man he liked to wear white suits and sunglasses. Immediately a bell ringed in Leon's head. What have I done, he wondered. Not much later he took a train to New York in order to put some sense into the kid's mind. As soon as he got in NY, he went to his old house, and discovered it quite clean for a house that was inhabited for over 4 years. Leon taught Mathilda everything he knows about killing and hiding. So it wasn't that hard to track her down and reach her. At the night in an alley that was a gang's territory he heard gunshots. When he looked, he couldn't believe. Many corpses were all over the floor. Standing amongst them, a woman with dark hair smiling with her face covered in blood. Mathilda... Is that... You? Leon! She ran into his direction to hug him like they had just met in a park. Stop. He pushed her. – What are you doing? Justice. They are just having what they deserve. That's not what I taught you. What about the families? They had brothers just like you! Don't talk like that! They killed my family, I killed theirs. It was meant to be this way. This has to stop, Mathilda. You're not going further with this. Then go ahead and stop me. I will. I cannot allow this to go on. The memory of her smiling all covered in blood was burning in his head. That was so wrong, even though she was the only one dear to him, that could not go on. He turned his back on her. Goodbye Mathilda. She fired her gun against his legs and while he fell, he fired his gun in her stomach. She tried to stand and fire one more time, but she was all out of bullets and ended up going to the ground. Why, Leon? Why?! Pulling a knife from her boots she stabbed him in the eye and all over his arms while he tried to defend himself. She was running out of strength, and dropped the knife. I'm sorry, Mathilda. And one last gunshot sealed Mathilda's story. I have to go now. Said an old man with an eye patch. That story was so real. Did any of this really happened? Said a second man. - This city is a place where any kind of feeling can become something else if you're not strong enough to deal with that. You have to take care for things like that not to happen. Enjoy your youth, don't waste it. ","Summary":" Gabriel Curuja's Fan Fiction Based on the movie Léon: The Professional Murder your maker.

The Italian hitman called Leon felt almost high on the feeling of relief. He had made it out. Out of hardship, out of hell. Of course, he never knew he was living in hell until Mathilda had thrown herself into his life- until she showed him how beautiful the world really could be... But where was she now? Safe, the man thought affirmatively. But his thoughts now were not on the girl, but on the brilliant, blue patches of clear sky beyond the double-doors of the building. Thinking back, he couldn't recall a time when the sky looked so blue. He walked with a slight limp down the filthy hallway from the apartments, the lively streets glistening in sharp, white glares from the sunlight- speeding cars, and shattered glass bottles reflected from the rays. He blinked his dark eyes ahead, beyond the glass doors. He didn't realize his mouth was hanging open, nor did he seem to notice the pain of his shoulder where a bullet had been fired into him earlier. If he did, he really didn't care. He was free. The gas-mask had long before dropped from his hands, but the heavy suit of the police uniform stayed on, and made the wounds underneath the rough metal bleed more fiercely. His heart beat steadily under a set of solid ribs, and his lungs expanded slowly as he inhailed the clean scent of the promises of Tomorrow. I must rent a new apartment , he thought at length. One Mathilda and I can live in peacefully for awhile. His pacing had slowed as he neared the sunlight, his eyes intranced with the world as a newborn calf would be. For a long while , he added to himself. ... A man by the name of Standsfield had been waiting for this moment; to find and kill the Italian hitman known as Leon. How could he have gotten past the policemen? was Standsfield's first thought when he saw the man. But the gas-mask on the floor hinted exactly how he had done it. So his second thought was this: Kill him. Standsfield raised his gun, stepping out of the shadows of the apartmants. He walked a few steps, placing himself directly behind the other man. The shadow of a shadow. The scene before he pulled the trigger- how odd that it should remind him of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5! Standfield smiled calmly, and he felt his eyes dialate expectantly- waiting for the blood to spill. A small, gentle pull of the trigger- as gently as pulling a newborn closer to your chest- and the bullet flew forward in a bang of powder. Standsfield walked more slowly, but more confidently, forward as the man called Leon fell at an odd, pained angle, before falling on his side against the ground. Smiling softly, Standsfield approached the man with a near smug expression, yet he sympathized with the man's pain- since he himself took pills for that sort of thing. He moved Leon fully on his back, and stood on either side of the man. He wondered if he was dead. What the hell...? Standsfield noticed Leon was gripping something tightly with his left hand, and so he bent down to pry his fingers open, putting his gun into the back of his pants. The man on the ground stared up at him and- ... -wondered if he had the strength to speak. The pain in his back had opened up the other painful sensations in his body, making his vision darken with spots of red and black. The bright, clear sky made his eye sockets throb, sending white flashes in his brain. He struggles to recognize the man, so he asks, \"Standsfield...?\" ... With a short nod, and a sweet smile, Standsfield replies, \"At your service.\" He had planned to jerk the whatever-it-was out of the dying man's grip, but Leon moved his hand on top of Standsfield, drawing his curiosity. He watches as the other man lets go on what he was holding, and pushes something into his hand. ... As Leon grasped Standsfield's hand with both of his, his blood coating the other man's skin, Standsfield feels a sudden pang of remorse. He gave the hitman a questioning look. Leon was dying, but was he really seeking comfort..? But then Leon spoke, his voice gargled and stained. \"This is...f-from...Mathilda...\" he said. Mathilda? Standsfield was both surprised and mildly amused, so as Leon's grip fell away from his hand, he opened his now-bloody-fingers. ... The look on Standsfields face- the horror, the sudden shock of his gift- made Leon smile inwardly. It made Leon feel as if the world was finally going his way; the enemy was alarmed, but it was too late for him to run. Leon felt like laughing. Leon's mind blackened, and he quickly lost the ability to hear, taste, smell, learn, speak, and love. He died just as Standfield's hands reached toward him like God from above. ... After checking Leon's body briefly- discovering the dozens of fully loaded grenades strapped to his chest- Standsfield, his head glazed with a new sweaty dew, stood up straight, and just stared as he held a small, round metal object- a grenade safety pin. So he got me after all... Standsfield thought to himself, his eye brows raised slightly, eyes closing. He opened his eyes again. The pin was still there in his hand. \"Shit.\" he said quietly, as if voicing his opinion out loud would make him wake up from his sudden nightmare. But- after suddenly wincing after mentally counting off the seconds till explosion- the grenades did not explode. Standsfield didn't realize he was holding his breath until he let it out; he didn't notice his eyes were closed until they hurt from being shut so tightly. A wave of hot nausea swept over his body, waking him from his trance. One glance at Leon made a smile jerk on his lips. The grenade he had given him was a dud. The metal ring was slipped around his middle finger as he stood, and clapped his hands loudly once- twice- and gave a short, bark-like laugh. He pointed a finger at Leon, stepping lightly on his toes, unable to keep still after the addrenaline rush he recieved from his near-death expericane. \"You almost got me!\" he told Leon, his eyes glowing. \"You were so close- then...man...\" He put a hand to his chin, shaking his head. \"...so close...\" he muttered. Back to the drawing board , he told himself. That little brat still needs to say hello to Uncle Standsfield. Stepping over Leon's body, Standsfield walked out of the hallway, putting his blood-stained, shaking hands into his pockets. He drew out his iPod, putting in the headphones simotaniously. He joined the crowd in their steady walk to nowhere, while- behind him on the corner of the apartmant complex- policemen scurried all over the place, some going in-and-out from the building, all shouting and blowing whistles, large metal shields nearly hitting each other in the hustle. Standsfield walked in-step with Beethoven playing in his ears; a long dead musician playing on an unseen piano. The man was smiling. Above, the sun was shining. The sky was so very blue today, he mused, glancing upwards. Maybe I should stop for a cup of coffee before I hunt down the girl. His eyes scanned the area, and he found a building marked Cafe'. Walking more lightly as the music changed the tune, the man was in such a good mood, that he stepped out of character for a moment, opening the door for an elderly lady as she tried to enter the Cafe'. When she thanked him, Standsfield smiled warmly and welcomed her just as gratefully. By the time he was inside the Cafe', he was humming, tossing both pointing-index fingers in the air around him. ... \"...I'll be dead by tomorrow.\" was the first urgent excuse the woman had heard in years. But this girl sitting there in her office- this girl who looked like a torn up, stepped on, raggedy-anne doll- she was obviously not lying. She had received hundreds of children, all of which enrolled in school by their parents. She only turned down those who couldn't afford it, or if their child did not meet the qualifications of the school. Leaning back in her chair, she examined the girl. She called herself Mathilda, and it was clear to her she was an honest child- if she believed her trust was well-earned. So how could she not accept the girl? With a sad, sympathetic nod, she signed the papers and welcomed Mathilda whole-heartedly, then watched as the girl brightened up, thanked her, grabbed her plant, and skipped out of the room. Such an odd girl... She watched with weary eyes out the window as the girl passed by the other students, who socialized friendily on the front steps. But the girl kept walking. She must be going for a walk, thought the woman. I do hope she wont cause any trouble here... She looked down at her files, and began writing on a pink sticky-note pad. Had she still been watching Mathilda, she would have seen her started digging into the earth with a stick. ... Mathilda's hands were already raw from the day's torments, so the rough, splintery wood of the stick did not help much. Regardless, she beat into the earth, using it like a shovel until she made a hole deep and wide enough to put a potted plant in it. Or a small, dead kitten. But it was neither; Mathilda removed the leafy plant from the pot and burried it in the earth, near the large tree in the yard of the school. She moved the dirt carefully around the plant, blanketing it in. She briefly thought of watering it, but remembered Leon had only hours before. Leon... Big Tony claimed Leon was dead...but no. Deep inside her heart, Mathilda belived that a part of Leon still lived on; it lived in the things he loved. Inside the plant. Inside of her heart... Mathilda looked around herself slowly, pondering their situation. \"I think we'll be all right here, Leon.\" she said. Her eyes locked on to the sun as it glowed in green, transparent rain through the leaves in the tree. It was a beautiful day. Smiling, Mathilda looked at Leon, and stood up. She looked back towards the school where her future laid, where the students watched her with curious, guarded expressions. She smiled again, and waved. Brushing her hair back from her face, she walked towards them in an effort to move on. This was her life now. There was no going back. But Big Tony was wrong: Leon was not dead. Skipping lightly through the grass, Mathilda felt like singing because she had a secret that know one would ever understand; that Leon was still with her. ... The coffee was warm, and bitter. It made his neck itch. Standsfield scratched his neck, and tipped the waitress before leaving the Cafe', not even hearing the woman behind the counter call out desperately, \"Come again!\" as if that one cup of coffee made of her whole paycheck. Now where would she be hiding? thought Standsfield. He drew a cigerette out and lit it with his lighter, bringing both objects from his jacket pocket. He returned the lighter to the cozy darkness, and started walking down the sidewalk. Mathilda, Leon had called her. Mathilda wanted him dead. Standsfield smiled, the cigerette clinched loosely between his pale teeth. That little girl had guts, sure. But she couldn't kill him- she would sooner be strung up on the ceiling fan in a dozen pieces then taking one step towards him. He was too clever. But she's clever too ...he chided at himself. A spasm shot across his eye, and he head quite suddenly began to ache. Pausing on the sidewalk, people moving around him on all sides, he took out a retangular pill case and opened it as he began to pant. Just one , he reminded himself. He picked up a green and yellow pill and tilted his head to the sky like a chicken who has just taken a drink of water. He placed the pill between his teeth, a hot salavia building in his mouth, and he bit down on the pill, savoring its sharp, cooling burst of relaxation. He swallowed the rest of it with ease, and pocketed the case, feeling much better. He resumed walking, but his smile was gone. ... ","Summary":" 8/14/10 ...

By the broken front-door, lay the dead, bullet-ridden body of Mr Lando, lying face-down in a pool of blood. Stan half-kicked him as he stepped over the body. Faintly in the distance, Stan could hear his name being called. \"Stan?...STAN?\" The voice calling Stan's name became louder and had an urgent, frantic tone to it. The voice penetrated Stan's thoughts and he suddenly came round. There, in the corridor, stood in front of him was Grace; D.E.A. Officer Grace Pesci. His 'immortal beloved' and the woman to whom last night he'd made love. \"Hi babe,\" smiled Stan, with a glazed, far-away look in his eyes, like someone who was slightly drunk or as in Stan's case, high on incredibly strong analgesic drugs. Stan was addicted to painkillers. He had been prescribed them for most of his adult life, but now he had become physically and mentally dependent on them. The pills helped him to cope with the emotional and psychological aspect of his job, especially when he had to carry out drugs raids and kill people. \"Oh my God Stan, thank Christ you're OK,\" cried Grace, throwing her arms around Stan's neck and hugging him tightly, \"Malky phoned me and said that Lando had shot you.\" Grace was panting heavily from where she had just ran up all six flights of stairs. Stan felt Grace's body heaving against his, as she fought to get her breath back. Stan liked the sensation of it; Grace's bosom rising and falling against his chest with every deep breath she took. It reminded him of their passionate love-making twelve hours earlier. As a general rule, Stan hadn't had much luck with women. Actually, Stan hadn't had ANY luck with women, not unless you counted a couple of drunken fumblings with girls at the Police Academy in his younger days. Oh, and then there was the time when a trainee officer named Sandy had slept with him for a bet and had told him afterwards that in reality she wouldn't have let a Beethoven-loving odd-ball like Stan touch her with a barge-pole. Stan couldn't understand why women didn't like him. He was fairly good-looking, with his piercing blue eyes and short mousy-brown hair and although compared to most guys, he was a little on the short side, he was slim and impeccably dressed. \"It's just a scratch honey,\" Stan heard himself say to Grace, as he stroked her hair with his non-bloodied hand, \"You should see the mess I made of that son-of-a-bitch Lando.\" Since that incident with Sandy ten years earlier, Stan had been virtually celibate, which hadn't exactly been easy for him. Stan had used the services of call-girls on a number of occasions, but could never bring himself to have full sexual intercourse with them, opting instead for either oral sex or masturbation. So with relationships very much out of the picture, Stan had concentrated on his job and rose very quickly through the police ranks. At the age of thirty-five, Stan was now an extremely high-ranking officer in the D.E.A., but it was no wonder he got so wound-up and angry with his fellow D.E.A. officers. All those years of pent-up sexual frustration building up inside of him had to erupt in some shape or form. Grace released her grip on Stan and noticed the bullet hole in the upper left arm of Stan's jacket. Then she noticed the blood all over his left hand. \"Oh my God Stan, you're bleeding,\" gasped Grace in horror, \"I've got to get you to a hospital.\" \"It's OK angel. IT IS OK,\" replied Stan grinning, stroking Grace's cheek. Then six months ago, Grace came into Stan's life. D.E.A. Officer Grace Pesci was a year younger than Stan and was only one rank lower. Being of Irish/Italian origin, Grace was five feet, four inches tall, slim, with shoulder-length, dark-blonde hair and brown eyes. The decision for a female officer to join Stan's team had been made by his bosses and even though Stan was unhappy about this, he was not allowed any say in the matter. He saw Grace and this decision as a threat to his job. Stan did not want a female on his all-male team of D.E.A. officers and had told Grace as much on her first day. Stan also told Grace that just because she was female not to expect any special kind of treatment. If she stepped out of line or messed up, she would get her backside kicked just as hard as any of his male officers. And finally, Stan told Grace that if she was offended by 'men talk' and swearing, then she had best leave the team now. What Stan didn't expect was to fall in love with Grace and for Grace to fall in love with him. \"It is NOT OK,\" Stan heard Grace answer hysterically, \"You're bleeding all over the God-damn place and...\" \"But it's NOT my blood,\" interrupted Stan laughing manically, waving his hand in front of Grace's face, \"It came off one of the corpses in there.\" \"Jesus Christ Stan, that was NOT funny,\" cursed Grace, sighing half with relief and half with frustration at Stan's 'joke', \"I thought you were bleeding to death.\" Stan looked intently at Grace and said soberly, \"And if I was, would you care if I died?\" Stan didn't really have to ask Grace that question. He already knew that Grace cared deeply for him. She had shown him that over the past six months, from things like making him cups of coffee, listening to his problems and most of all, buying him a card and present on his birthday. Not even Stan's own mother had bothered to remember a single birthday of his. Stan's mother had never given a damn about him. He remembered the way she used to scream and hit out at him. In fact, Stan often wondered why he'd ever been born. It was no wonder Stan was so mentally damaged where women were concerned. Grace was the only woman in his whole, miserable life who really cared about him. She was kind, honest and trustworthy and nothing like all the other females he had encountered in his life so far. That was why Stan was in love with her. \"What sort of a question is that?\" Grace screamed back at him, \"Of course I'd bloody care! What on earth has got into you today?\" \"Sorry sweetheart,\" apologised Stan, \"I'm just a bit shell-shocked that's all. I did nearly have my arm shot off.\" \"I'm sorry too honey,\" said Grace, putting her arms around Stan's neck again and hugging him, \"I love you Stan. If you died, I wouldn't want to live either.\" \"I love you too babe,\" replied Stan, kissing Grace on the lips. The words of a song flitted like a butterfly into Stan's mind. Stan held Grace close to him, looked skyward and thought to himself, \"Was it just possible that his prayers HAD been answered? Had God really sent down Grace for him to love and to love him in return?\" \"What are you thinking about?\" asked Grace interrupting Stan's train of thought, as she noticed the distant look in his eyes. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you,\" replied Stan grinning, \"Come on, let's go and get some lunch. Willie can handle things here.\" \"OK,\" said Grace, taking hold of Stan's right hand. Stan and Grace both began to walk down the corridor together. Just as they were about to descend the stairs, Stan suddenly heard a tintinnabulation of bells ringing. \"Nah,\" he thought, shaking his head, \"It's just ringing in my ears from that shotgun being fired so close to me.\" Then out of the corner of his eye, Stan caught sight of a shaft of light appear in exactly the same spot where he and Grace had been standing. \"This is crazy,\" thought Stan, \"It's just sun-light coming in through the windows.\" But if Stan had looked properly, he would have noticed that there were NO windows in that part of the corridor.

El merlot se filtra por su olfato con suaves notas y cuando finalmente lo degusta el sabor se impregna en cada rincón de su boca, perdurando más en la comisura de sus labios. De nuevo está en ese restaurante Italiano, caro y con preciosa vista, bebiendo vino junto al hombre que la pretende desde hace unos meses. De pronto el camarero trae una nueva botella y el hombre de traje le sonríe divertido haciendo un ademán para que les sirvan la burbujeante bebida. Es champagne y Mathilda no puede evitar sentir que la sonrisa en sus labios pierde intensidad. Mientras las burbujas van en aumento como espuma de mar sus memorias también. La voz de esa persona enfrente suyo la alcanza sin llegar a hacerla espabilar del todo. Ella lo mira y lo ve gesticular palabras que no es capaz de entender. Sólo sabe que le están sirviendo champagne en una noche que se supone sería divertida y ella no bebe champagne desde los doce. Mathilda siente un nudo en la garganta cuando los recuerdos se hilan uno a uno en breves momentos que parecen una eternidad. A penas su copa se llena la toma entre sus manos y bebe la mitad de un trago. El hombre ríe suavemente. —Es la primera vez que te veo tan animada. —Es la champagne—curva los labios y bebe el resto con más calma—. Pensé que me haría reír. —Lamento decirte que no lo lograrás sólo con una copa—guiñó un ojo—. Necesitaremos más si queremos lograr ese efecto y reír a carcajadas. Mathilda aminoró la sonrisa y miró la copa vacía. —¿Sabes? Cuando tenía doce bebí mi primera copa. —¿Y cómo estuvo? —Bastante bien. Me reí hasta que el estómago me dolió. —¿Y ahora? ¿Crees poder reírte hasta que duela? Mathilda lo miró y sonrió tristemente. —No… no creo poder. \" Te amo Mathilda…\" \"… yo también te amo León\" El mozo le llena la copa de nuevo y Mathilda siente los ojos humedecérseles. …. Notas de la autora: Bueno, un pequeño drabble sobre este par. Simplemente el otro día me estaba acordando de la película y no pude evitar pensar en si Mathilde lo recordaría en el futuro.

Il traversa le couloir sans un mot, jusqu'à être arrivé face à une porte à la peinture sombre et écaillée. « Tu aimes Beethoven ? » Il ferma les yeux et leva délicatement la main droite, tenant entre ses doigts gracieux une longue baguette invisible. Le couloir était plongé dans un profond silence. La tête légèrement penchée vers l'arrière, il esquissa un sourire lorsque d'un geste brusque et sec du bras une musique jaillit !

But he did have a sense of morality, albeit a minimal one. He might be dangerous, cruel, maniacal, and a million other things that can't be mentioned, but he was still a human being. He still felt hurt, anger, although that one was obvious, he felt happiness, bliss, and love. Yes, Norman Stansfield, or Stan as he was called more commonly, had once been in love. Still was, actually. Meagan Finnegan was her name. She had spent most of her time staring at him like he was the best thing that had ever walked the earth. He didn't understand why, personally, but he supposed that he was attractive to some people. Maybe she was one of them. She was certainly beautiful, with her cool green eyes and dark brown hair. She was his secretary, funny enough, so that made it real easy for her to be near him. She gazed at him secretly, or so she thought. Stan was quite aware of her crush on him, although he had his suspicions that it was more than a simple crush. She mooned over him and practically worshipped him, although subtly, for about two years. And then, all of sudden, she stopped. Stan supposed that he should've been thankful that the foolish girl had finally got over him, but Stan also wondered why she had stopped and he found that he missed it. He missed her \"secret\" stares and gazes that he caught every so often, making her blush. And then one day, Stan found out why she had stopped fawning over him. And the reason made his blood boil. One day, he had been sitting at his desk, going over some piece of paper, when he just so happened to look up and out his window that connected his personal office to the room where Meagan's desk was situated. There stood a young man, holding her by her waist, kissing her. She left me for that prat? Wait a minute what am I saying? Left me? She was never with me to begin with! The man, who was much younger than him, Stan noted, was rather handsome, what with his blue eyes and black hair and his tall stature. Stan felt his anger level rise as he watched him kiss his girl, Stan's girl. Hey, whoa, whoa, hey; hold on second there, Stan. She is not your girl, and she has never been your girl. So, uh, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GOING ON ABOUT? \"I have absolutely no idea,\" Stan whispered to himself. Great, that's just what he needed. People thought he was ready to be carted off to the loony bin as it was. If people started hearing him talk to himself, they would sedate him and strap him into a freaking strait-jacket. No, Norman Stansfield had already been through that, and one time was plenty, thank you very much. But, upon focusing his easily distracted attention on to the couple, Stan felt something rise up from within him and made him want to kill the idiot who dared to touch his girl; his Meagan. There I fucking go again. Meagan is not mine, never was mine, and by the looks of it, never will be. He knew that he had fallen in love with the girl who had been crazy over him. Stan sighed and got back to his work, although now he found it utterly boring…much like Beethoven after his openings. About a month later, Stan came in one day, and immediately he noticed something was off. He chanced a look at his secretary and noticed that she was crying, or at least she had been crying. \"Hey. Meagan,\" he said. She looked up at him, surprise written all over her pretty features. \"Mr. Stansfield. Is there something you want me to do for you?\" Stan was a little taken aback at the shocked look on her face, immediately guessing that it was because she didn't think he knew her name. \"Yes, I want you to tell me why you're crying,\" he said. Normally, Stan wouldn't think twice of a girl crying but she was different. He loved her…even if he didn't want to admit it. \"Oh. Um, my boyfriend, Rickie, dumped me this morning,\" she said, sniffling. Stan nodded solemnly, although inside he was cheering. \"He's an idiot. Letting a girl like you go, he has to be.\" Meagan smiled at him shakily and said, \"Thank you, Mr. Stansfield.\" He nodded and was about to start walking on when he stopped and said, \"You know, Meagan, if you want you can call me Norman or Stan.\" She nodded and said, \"Ok…Norman.\" He smiled and walked on. He decided that she would be the only one that he would willingly allow call him Norman. Two months after that, a shooting broke out and Meagan was mildly injured. Although she was only clipped by a stray bullet, Stan still shot the guy that shot her in the head and back multiple times for good measure. You touch her, you die, thought Stan as he delivered the last shot. The medics arrived to assess the situation and Stan brought Meagan out to them. They sat her down and started to check her over for any sort of injuries, other than the obvious. Stan stood by her the entire time and when the medics left to go take care of the more seriously injured victims, he stood in front of her and helped her stand up. \"Are you all right?\" She nodded and said, \"Working for you is definitely isn't uneventful, I'll give you that.\" He chuckled and tilted his head at her. \"I've got a question for you,\" said Stan. Meagan raised her eyebrows as a sign for him to continue. \"Why did you fawn over me for two years?\" Meagan averted her eyes as a blush started creeping up her neck. Stan gently, which was surprising for him, placed a finger under her chin so that she would look him in the eyes. \"You noticed that, huh?\" Stan nodded and she continued. \"I admired your bravery, and your dedication and loyalty to those who are loyal to you.\" \"That's it?\" Stan asked, slightly disappointed that she didn't say that his looks were a part of it. \"Well, Norman, I mean, not only that, but I thought you were the most attractive man I had ever laid eyes on. I still do,\" she added quietly. Norman felt his pride and heart swell and he mentally slapped himself for getting so worked up. \"What about that prat, Rickie or whatever his name was, that you dated?\" Meagan got a little confused and said, \"Who? Oh him, he was a jerk. I never meant to fall for him. I only started dating him because I knew that you never would return my feelings.\" Stan nodded and took her hand and said, \"I'm not a good guy, Meagan. I could never give you what you deserve. I'm dangerous and volatile, and, quite frankly, I'm not completely sane.\" Meagan looked him right into his light blue eyes, and said, \"I know. But I still love you Norman.\" \"I'm not right for you, Meagan. As much as I wish that I was, I know that. As much as I love you, you wouldn't ever be safe with me.\" Meagan shook her head and said, \"Norman, we live in New York City; I'm not safe as it is. But I don't care.\" Stan searched her green eyes for any self-doubt and found absolutely none. She truly loved him, and Stan found that he was absolutely, entirely, and unequivocally in love with Meagan Finnegan. Slowly, he leaned in and pressed his lips to hers, waiting for her to respond. She did respond, almost immediately, and Stan honestly couldn't have imagined a more perfect moment. It was like nobody existed except for the two of them. Her arms went around his shoulders and he gently placed his arms around her waist, pulling her closer. When the kiss ended, Stan pulled her into his arms and just held her. I am the luckiest guy on the whole earth. Norman Stansfield, after years of solitude, had finally found his saving grace. ","Summary":" Norman Stansfield was not a sane man, by anyone's standards.

Todo pertenece a Luc Besson, a su productora y no sé a quién más. Dedicado a Gala. Y a Gary. Y a Natalie. No sabe si ha sido el cruce casual de las piernas, la minifalda ceñida a las caderas y a los muslos, o la mirada calma y a un tiempo atenta, o la forma casual de apurar la copa de champán. O quizá la peluca rosa que lleva, enmarcándole el rostro, subrayando la línea de sus cejas y de su mandíbula. Es absurdo que una chica guapa como ella recurra a semejantes esperpentos para hacerse notar. No es su pelo teñido, el cabello rosa tiene la consistencia y el brillo del plástico bajo la luz tenue del bar. Tal vez se esconde. Tal vez le gusta fingir que es diferente. A veces pasa. Desde la mesa, Norman Stansfield observa a la chica sentada en un taburete de la barra, sus piernas largas cruzadas, los botines negros de tacón acariciándole el tobillo y las medias de rejilla. Las medias la delatan más que la peluca. Al fin y al cabo, no es más que una de esas chicas de mala vida (bonito eufemismo, por cierto) que rondan por el barrio a esas horas. Lo curioso es que no está en la calle, esperando a que los coches se detengan, sino allí, en el bar, bebiendo una copa de champán que sólo Dios sabe de dónde ha salido en un antro como ése. Tamborilea con los dedos sobre la barra, tiene las uñas largas y pintadas del mismo rosa de la peluca. A ratos, cuando la luz matizada de humo incide sobre su rostro, el maquillaje se difumina y parece terriblemente joven. Desde su baluarte, protegido tras la mesa, aislado del ruido del bar por los auriculares que desgranan el Réquiem de Mozart, Stansfield, Stan para los amigos y quizá para los que no lo son tanto, siente algo. No el típico cosquilleo en las ingles del deseo sexual recién despertado, al menos no sólo eso. Es un deseo distinto. Como si ella, de alguna manera, le intrigara, le invitase a desvelar su misterio. Sí. Hay algo de misterio en ella, no sabe qué, pero lo hay. Se deshace de uno de los auriculares y echa mano al bolsillo. Ahí sigue, el viejo pastillero, compañero y amigo que nunca falla, como los otros. Necesitará calmarse y estar en plena forma si definitivamente se decide a acercarse a ella. Se mete una cápsula en la boca y siente el plástico con la lengua. Traga saliva y la cápsula que ha triturado entre los dientes, después echa la cabeza hacia atrás y desbloquea las vértebras del cuello. Sigue doliendo. Mejor dicho, ahora duele más. Ahora las pastillas se acaban a mayor velocidad que antes. Después de que aquel italiano hijo de puta intentara volarle por los aires, estuvo a punto de no contarlo, primero; y después de no volver a andar. Lesión sobre lesión, un poco más y no habría sido capaz de mover un dedo por sí mismo. Ahora duele, especialmente en días como hoy, cuando todo es humedad. Pero es bueno que duela. Significa que aún está vivo. Y en noches como esta, cuando hay chicas bonitas de pelo rosa en la barra del bar, merece la pena estar vivo. Respira hondo un par de veces hasta que todo se normaliza y empieza a sentir el efecto del analgésico recorriéndole las venas, calmándolo todo, incluso el ritmo al que el bar se mueve a su alrededor. Apura el contenido de su copa y se pone en pie. Tiene miedo. Miedo a ser rechazado, a sentirse decepcionado, a medida que se aproxima a la barra. Ni el efecto del medicamento puede evitar que su corazón se dispare, latiendo como el de un maldito yonqui con síndrome de abstinencia. Pone la mano sobre la barra y se sujeta al borde de ésta con todas sus fuerzas, tratando de contener la sensación que se está apoderando de él. Está nervioso. Asustado. Intenta articular una sonrisa, y entonces es ella quien le mira y sonríe (tiene una sonrisa perfecta, amplia y luminosa, limpia, de alguna manera; no es como la sonrisa de otras putas que ya tiene su punto de lascivia antes de que se la pidas). Esa sonrisa le golpea y le noquea, le deja sin fuerzas, pero a la vez le hace sentir algo más seguro. Correspondido, al fin y al cabo. -Hola. Ella apoya el codo en la barra y gira su cuerpo hacia él, mostrándole atención. Stan siente que las manos le tiemblan, así que oculta una en el bolsillo y con la otra sigue asiendo la barra. Durante un segundo, se pregunta qué demonios ha visto esa chica en él. En un subidón de autoestima, piensa que aunque el tiempo haya pasado sigue sin estar mal del todo. A las mujeres suelen gustarle sus ojos, que son de un azul indefinido, y atribuyen su obsesión por la música clásica al hecho de que sea un romántico. Exhala lentamente, por la nariz, el aire que siente que ha retenido, y decide jugar su vieja faceta de seductor, que espera que no esté tan oxidada como sus vértebras. Se vuelve hacia el camarero con un ademán de superioridad. Le conoce. Conoce a todos los mierdas del barrio, y a Don, especialmente. Sobre todo porque lo tiene bien aleccionado, utiliza el bar para pasar droga de tapadillo, una vez intentó colársela y Stan mandó a dos tíos a romperle las piernas. Sólo le rompieron una, pero desde entonces no ha vuelto a intentar nada. -Don, otro Jack Daniels y también otra ronda para la chica. El camarero asiente rápidamente con la cabeza y se pone manos a la obra. Tiembla casi tanto como el propio Stan, aunque por razones muy diferentes. La chica ha enarcado las cejas ante su demostración de poder, divertida. Recibe una segunda copa de champán, se humedece los labios en ella y la deja sobre la mesa, acariciando el cristal con las uñas. -Gracias.- deja caer. Sólo eso, gracias. -De nada.- escruta el rostro de la joven, calmo de una manera extraña, inescrutable. De repente, entiende qué es lo que le ha llamado tanto la atención de ella. Tiene algo que se la hace familiar, aunque no sepa exactamente qué.- ¿Nos hemos visto antes en alguna parte? Ella hace un gesto de indiferencia. -No lo creo. Me acordaría.- vuelve a beber de su copa, apenas un sorbo.- Nunca olvido una cara. Yo tampoco, piensa en decir él, pero entonces recuerda los rostros que ha olvidado, personas insignificantes que acabaron mal o bien un día y cuya imagen se difumina sobre un montón de coca, unas sábanas revueltas o una bañera donde se mezclan el agua y la sangre, y decide no mentirle. Al fin y al cabo, es poco más que una gilipollez. -Vaya. Estaré perdiendo facultades, estaba seguro de que te había visto alguna vez. Ella se ríe y sacude la cabeza, y Stan supone que ella estará pensando que no es más que un estúpido truco para ligar. -Lo dudo. Soy nueva en la ciudad.- clava en él sus ojos oscuros, grandes, impenetrables. Por Dios, juraría que conocía esos ojos, y sin embargo...- Vengo de Jersey. -Entiendo.- él juega con el vaso de whisky entre sus dedos, el cristal frío es agradable. Mira al hielo y huye de la penetrante mirada de ella.- ¿Esperando cumplir algún sueño en la gran ciudad? -Algo así. Se lleva la copa de champán a los labios y se bebe todo el contenido, de un trago, metódicamente. Stan sacude la cabeza, con admiración. -Nunca había visto beber champán a nadie así.- confiesa, una débil sonrisa esbozada en su boca. Al ver que ella no responde, y temiendo que la conversación pueda estancarse, echa la mano al bolsillo y busca un paquete de tabaco. No lo encuentra. Se palmea los bolsillos y masculla un improperio entre dientes. -¡Don! El camarero se yergue, apartando la vista de la televisión, que da un programa deportivo, aunque a las horas que son, pronto empezará a emitir porno; total, es lo que la clientela quiere. -¿Tienes un par de cigarrillos?- le pregunta Stan. -Que sea uno.- la muchacha le detiene, y se encoge de hombros a modo de disculpa.- No fumo. Una puta que no fuma, lo que hay que escuchar. Una chica difícil. Stan se lleva a los labios el cigarrillo que Don le tiende y busca el mechero, sin éxito, aunque hace un segundo lo ha visto sobre la barra. Feo plástico azul con publicidad del bar. Se gira y descubre a la chica acercándole la llama. Se deja hacer, cohibido de alguna manera, y trata de evitar que la cálida sonrisa de la joven termine de cautivarle. No tenía previsto hacer ese gasto esta noche. -¿Entonces qué?- pregunta.- ¿Cuál es el sueño que te trajo aquí? Espera que la mirada de ella se oscurezca, pero al contrario, una especie de rayo de decisión, de fuerza, recorre los ojos de la joven. Aún así, ella tan sólo suspira. -Prefiero no hablar de ello.- comenta, seca. Si supiera de qué palo va, seguramente Stan habría sido capaz de atar cabos y descubrir por qué la cara de esa chica le resulta tan condenadamente conocida. Pero al parecer, no está muy dispuesta a abrirse. Lástima. En fin, quizá con tiempo. Hace un movimiento indefinido de cabeza y bebe un poco. -Lo peor de los sueños es que no se cumplen demasiado a menudo.- sentencia. Después, con el ademán más casual que logra reproducir, se vuelve de nuevo hacia ella.- Por cierto, ¿tu nombre era...? -No lo he dicho.- una sonrisa de lado, apenas una mueca, se forma en los labios de ella.- Susan. Susan suena bien, y demasiado poco provocativo para ser un, digamos, nombre artístico. Stan la mira y piensa y qué, tiene aspecto de zorra, pero en el fondo no es más que una chica de Jersey con un sueño roto y una peluca rosa, perdida en estos barrios de mierda, tan lejos de la Quinta Avenida y todo el pijerío correspondiente. Siente pena por ella, y a la vez ese deseo roto, incontenible, que hace que la ame y la odie a la vez, que se sienta atrapado por ella y le repela la sensación que tiene de ser capaz de hacer cualquier cosa si ella simplemente se lo pidiera. Se muerde la lengua hasta que siente el sabor metálico y caliente de la sangre, y como si el dolor le despertase del letargo, se acaba su whisky de un trago, dejando que el alcohol le escueza en la mordedura. -Encantado, Susan. Yo soy Norman.- olvidemos los apellidos por esta noche, piensa a la vez que se inclina hacia ella e intenta besarla a modo de saludo. El contacto de su mejilla ya habría sido lo suficientemente inquietante, pero ella gira el rostro y el beso hace impacto en la comisura de su boca. Sabe a champán y a maquillaje, y a expectación, y un poco amargo, aunque eso quizá sea la mezcla de la sangre y el sabor amaderado del whisky que a él aún le reverbera en la boca. Cuando se separa, sobrepasado, ella trata de ocultar una breve sonrisa. -¿Otra copa?- pregunta él, intentando disimular su azoramiento. -Yo estoy bien, gracias. Pero él si necesita otra copa, le hace un gesto a Don para que vuelva a servirle. El camarero, como siempre, se apresura a hacerlo, y Stan se apresura a sentir la influencia calmante del alcohol antes de que ella le haga perder los nervios de nuevo. -¿A qué te dedicas tú, Norman? -En realidad, yo también preferiría no hablar de ello.- Si le cuenta la verdad sobre la DEA y todo ese rollo acabará espantándola y no quiere. No cuando siente este dolor físico ante la sola idea de separarse de ella. La chica parece molesta y él suelta una risotada seca, casi una tos.- Es justo. Tú no me hablas de tus sueños, yo no te hablo de mi trabajo. Además, creo que es mejor para los dos no saber... demasiado. Cuando no sonríe, cuando los ojos oscuros de Susan permanecen fijos, quemando, es cuando más le recuerda a ese alguien que no consigue saber quién es. Siente un nudo en el estómago, su memoria parece querer recordar y no poder. Está bien, no beberá más por esta noche. Necesita saber quién es, y sólo podrá lograrlo sobrio. No sabe por qué sus ojos, cuando no están velados por la sonrisa, son tan duros, tan decididos, por qué le intimidan tanto. -Está bien. Nos gustan los secretos. A los dos. Pero sigue sin sonreír. Y ha tardado demasiado en pronunciar esa frase. Stan suspira, no querría estropearlo cuando parecía que iba tan bien. Finalmente, pasa el brazo por los hombros de la chica y se acerca a ella. Tiene un perfume especial, suave, pero también hay debajo de él ese peculiar aroma de los que mienten. Le miente. Le está mintiendo, desde el principio. No es más que la zorra que aparentaba ser. Siente asco y ganas de apartarla de un empujón, pero al fin y al cabo es tan guapa, y ya la ha invitado a una copa, y quiere averiguar por qué coño le miente. Qué es lo que tiene que ocultar. -Venga...- él iba a decirle la verdad, pero no se la merece. Acerca sus labios al cuello de ella y habla muy cerca, exhalando el aliento sobre la piel tras el lóbulo de su oreja.- Sólo es una noche, Susan. Mañana, ni siquiera nos acordaremos el uno del otro. Ella aparta la cabeza bruscamente, se escapa de su abrazo deslizándose hasta el borde del asiento. Stan cierra infructuosamente los puños, como si quisiera atraparla. -Ya te he dicho que yo nunca olvido una cara.- replica Susan, una nota de altanería y de rabia en su voz, a la vez que se levanta y firme sobre sus tacones, echa a andar hacia la salida del bar. Stan la observa. El balanceo de sus caderas, la forma de caminar. Se ríe de él. Se burla de él. Ha jugado con él. Pues se acabó. Nadie le provoca, nadie le pone, nadie le reta de esta forma y se larga así como así. Termina su tercer Jack Daniels y la ira le hace apretar el ajado vaso dentro de su mano, hasta que estalla. Maldice al sentir el líquido resbalando por su mano y manchándole el puño del traje, es un líquido frío y caliente a la vez, licor y sangre. Para entonces, ella ya ha desaparecido. No la dejará huir. Eso es lo que ella se cree. Alcanza un puñado de servilletas para detener la hemorragia de los cortes y sale del bar. La rabia le corre, caliente, por las venas. Anestesia y potencia el mundo exterior a la vez. El rumor de los coches, la gente y la música de los bares cercanos se amortigua, pero el sonido de los tacones de Susan se hace más fuerte entre la gente. Lo reconocería en cualquier sitio. Eso y el pelo rosa. Con el pulso palpitándole en las sienes, recorre el camino, sigue los pasos, las huellas que ella dibuja, invisibles, en el asfalto. Empuja a una pareja que viene en sentido contrario. No puede perderla. No puede permitírselo. No ahora. No cuando las imágenes quieren definirse y sabe que bastará con volver a ver su cara para terminar de ubicarla y reconocerla. Ahí está. Se ha detenido, junto a un callejón. No podía haber elegido mejor sitio. Se sitúa a su espalda, sigiloso. Ella no le ha sentido. Ahora podría hacerle lo que quisiera, piensa. Cogerla, abrazarla, hacerla girar, mirar a sus ojos oscuros y descubrir el secreto. Es ella quien se vuelve. Le toma de las solapas de la chaqueta y le atrae hacia sí. Busca sus labios y le besa. Primero suavemente, después con violencia. Juega con su lengua contra la de él y presiona las llagas que él se ha hecho al morderse. Stan intenta rechazarla, pero se da cuenta de que es inútil. Ella le causa dolor y no le importa, precisamente eso es lo que tiene de especial, si se le podría llamar así. Entreabre la boca y la muerde, él también quiere hacerle daño, juntar su sangre con la de ella. Al fin y al cabo qué, ella es una zorra, le habrán hecho cosas peores. Responde a su violencia con violencia, pero ni siquiera al sentir los dientes de él sobre la carne blanda de su labio inferior, ella se queja o se aparta. Tira de él hacia la oscuridad del callejón. Allí, las sombras difuminan el mundo y la oscuridad que vela ahora las facciones de ella aumentan su deseo, las ganas de aprisionarla contra la pared y hacerla suya allí mismo. Su respiración se acelera, toma y expulsa el aire a toda velocidad de sus pulmones, mientras ella le abraza y sigue besándole y le arrastra más y más hacia el fondo de la calle. Tropiezan con un contenedor, ella está a punto de perder el equilibrio, las manos de él se dirigen a su cintura y la sostienen antes de que caiga. Espera una risa, una disculpa, no la obtiene. Mejor, para qué perder tiempo. Introduce la mano bajo la minifalda, busca la tela de la ropa interior y trata de tirar de ella, de bajarla. Entonces todo se detiene, ella también se detiene, y ambos se miran en la oscuridad. -No.- Susan susurra, la voz tan ronca como la de él, de placer, desea Stan.- Aún no. Hay un instante de contrariedad y él piensa que debería mandarla al infierno y continuar con lo que está haciendo. Pero al final le da un voto de confianza. Tampoco hay prisa. Tienen todo el tiempo del mundo, en la oscuridad del callejón, en cualquier rincón del barrio y de la ciudad ella será suya, no importa el tiempo, ni el lugar, sólo que allí están, él y la chica misteriosa cuyos ojos parecen recordarle a alguien que no sabe quién es. -Deja que te vea.- dice, en un tono roto y suplicante, sin que su voz dé para más. Ella se detiene, la espalda pegada a la pared, recuperando el aliento. Le mira, y Stan lleva las manos a su cabello, a la absurda peluca rosa que no necesita, porque aun sin ella tiene algo que puede con él, algo que le obliga a amarla, admirarla y odiarla a un tiempo, y tira hacia atrás de la cabellera falsa, revelando una melena oscura y revuelta. El flequillo despeinado le cae suavemente, en desorden, sobre la frente, y ella adelanta la mandíbula inferior, enseñando los dientes, preciosa, desafiante, llena de ira y de fuerza. No ha sentido aún el cañón del arma en el estómago cuando la reconoce, y le cuesta no romperse en carcajadas amargas cuando descubre de quién se trata. Y el olor a mentira cobra un sentido insoportable, cuando descubre que la mirada rabiosa de Susan, de la chica de Jersey con un sueño por cumplir, es la misma de la niña de doce años que fue capaz de colarse en los baños del edificio de la DEA tanto tiempo atrás. Los mismos ojos oscuros, la misma expresión de decisión, matizada sólo por seis años y una fina capa de maquillaje. Cómo pudo ser tan gilipollas. -Mierda.- murmura, a la vez que intenta retroceder un paso. Es inútil, ella no deja de apuntarle. Tiene una nueve milímetros con silenciador, la empuña con una seguridad envidiable, y emerge de las sombras, siguiéndole. Sigue siendo ella. Lo ve ahora, cuando la luz ambarina de las farolas le roza el rostro. Dios, es tan parecida, cómo pudo confundirla, cómo pudo olvidarla, cómo pudo confiarse y dejar de buscarla, cuando esa niña de ojos oscuros e implacables era mucho más peligrosa que cualquier enemigo. Siente que el terror le paraliza. Aquella mirada, aquella arma apuntándole al estómago, y luego al pecho (una técnica depurada que debieron enseñarle, seguramente él), la manera en que sabe que no puede escapar, y que por mucho que quiera, no va a ganar la partida, no esta vez. Se le forma un nudo en la garganta. No querría morir llorando como una nenaza, pero las lágrimas de impotencia inundan sus ojos, la derrota duele mucho más que esa explosión o de lo que pueden doler las balas. Contiene un sollozo y se deja caer contra la pared, para después deslizarse, cayendo sentado al suelo. Llora de rabia. De miedo, también, pero sobre todo de rabia. Por haber sido tan idiota. Por haber dejado que ella llegue hasta el final, que le tenga donde quería. Joder. -No me digas que yo soy el sueño que viniste a cumplir.- escupe, luchando con la sonrisa amarga que esboza sin querer. -Algo así. Ella mantiene la calma. Le mira casi con indiferencia, apenas visible ya el rastro del odio en su mirada, tan limpia y decidida ahora como a los doce años. Ha bajado un poco el cañón de la pistola, ha cambiado el ángulo del disparo ahora que él está sentado. Stan se protege inconscientemente con los brazos. Por Dios. Que le dispare y acabe con toda esta mierda de una buena vez. -¿Te gusta vivir? Él levanta la mirada, confundido. No había imaginado que le saldría por ahí. No hay placer en quitarle la vida a alguien que no la aprecia, le había dicho él una vez. A ella qué más le daba. Él le había destrozado la vida, había matado a su hermano pequeño, a la única persona que le unía a este mundo, y después había matado a ese protector que ella se había agenciado, el italiano analfabeto ese. Le iba a matar de todas formas. -Dispara de una maldita vez.- la instó. -Contesta.- ella se acerca y le apunta más certeramente, esta vez a la cabeza.- ¿Te gusta vivir? Pero qué es vivir, después de todo. Vivir es música, pero es dolor, es miedo, es tener todos esos pensamientos en la cabeza, y no poder dormir, y sentir que le tiemblan las manos y temer y odiar y verse débil, verse amenazado, como ahora. Aunque también es un momento antes, es una chica con los ojos oscuros que le mira y que le besa, aunque huela a mentira. -Durante un momento, me hiciste sentir que me gustaba.- confiesa finalmente, con un hilo de voz. Y ya sí que no puede evitar que las lágrimas le inunden los ojos. Baja la cabeza, se hace un ovillo, no quiere morir y a la vez sí quiere, quiere que todo esto acabe y que no acabe. Pudiste haber sido mía, Mathilda, piensa. Pudiste haberlo sido muchas veces y sin embargo ha sido al contrario, siempre has sido tú el que me ha tenido cogido por los huevos, esperando a que ocurriera algo, sin saberlo. Hasta que ocurre, hasta que ha ocurrido. Hasta ahora. -Levántate. Él la mira sin comprender, y la joven le indica de nuevo con un movimiento de cabeza. -Levántate.- repite. Sobre sus temblorosas piernas, Stan se levanta, apoyándose en los desconchados del sucio muro que tiene detrás. Ella va a matarle, y se alegra de no orinarse encima, al menos, como ha visto a otros desgraciados hacer en situaciones similares, aunque en esas ocasiones, él siempre estaba al otro lado. Mathilda (porque es ella, no podría ser otra) clava sus ojos en los de él por un segundo. Después le apunta al estómago de nuevo. Sostiene el arma con las dos manos, los brazos extendidos ante ella. Respira hondo y aprieta el gatillo. El disparo emerge, acallado por el silenciador. Stan cierra los ojos. No grita. Se sorprende cuando no siente dolor. Baja la vista, desconcertado y trémulo, para ver la mancha de pintura roja estampada en su camisa, y estalla en carcajadas nerviosas cuando descubre el estúpido truco de niños al que ella le ha sometido. Casi le ha... casi le ha hecho creer que iba a morir. Se lleva la mano al corazón, intentando acallar el ritmo acelerado, la sensación de que corre tanto que tendrá que parar, y el siguiente disparo atraviesa la mano y el pecho. Ella tira el revólver. Stan cae sentado de nuevo, la sangre brotando entre sus dedos, imposible de contener. Cruzan una última mirada. Él siente ganas de toser. Le cuesta respirar, y siente el sabor acre de la sangre en la boca. Le gustaría decir a la joven que se aleja que no le olvidará nunca. Que su rostro moribundo no le abandonará nunca. Que como aquel tipo le dijo una vez, después de matar al primer hombre, todo será diferente. También, piensa con el último rayo de lucidez, si él recuerda después de esto, tampoco la olvidará nunca. Las últimas notas del Réquiem de Mozart resuenan en su cabeza. ","Summary":" Nada es mío. Todo pertenece a Luc Besson, a su productora y no sé a quién más. Dedicado a Gala.

So here is my tribute and my thanks. Please Let Me Know What You Think! O o o O o o O The end of the hallway was as a tunnel of light; a passing into a new life, old one falling away from him with each exhausted step he took. Leon saw the luminescence reveal possibilities of the happiness that awaited him, the girl who he knew would be there, beckoning him onward, outward. Mathilda. He knew her, saw her through the layers that she had painted on herself. She had slowly peeled them off one by one, at last baring her true skin. Her love was pure. Her love was sincere. Alas, the pain she endured, the world he himself showed her. They both were a kin to suffering and regret. It was something they would have to teach each other to let go of. He already had a taste of what it would be like, embracing her small frame in his arms. No more were the old ways. No more revenge, no more killing. They would live free, away from recognition, away from expectation. They would plant roots. Enjoy life, watch Gene Kelly, look out the window, enjoy the sunset without fear. He loved her. Of that it was sure. Leon knew she was not yet ready for everything that he was capable of giving, that he wished he could, were this another place, another time, another circumstance. As it was, indescribable, indefinable, his love was deep, his heart open, breathing the fresh air in a world it hadn't allowed itself exposure to. It took Mathilda to show it the way. Someday she would know. Someday he would be able to show her what she truly meant to him. When time had passed, when all sins were erased, he would thank her for saving his life. For bringing him to life. Someday he would take her face in his hands, overwhelmed with the knowledge of what she made him, and kiss her, just like she had once requested.

It's been my mom's favorite for a long time and I totally get why she loves it. Here's just a little idea about Guy and Aldys centered around my love of the prom scene. Enjoy! Aldys POV I straightened my glasses and shouldered my backpack before I looked at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I was trying not to fidget with the chain on my glasses, but it was hard not to. I was so nervous about starting high school. Junior high was a breeze: I floated under the radar, getting good grades and not making any enemies. But high school is-has-to be different. \"You can do this,\" I tell myself before walking out the door to face my fate. Whatever that may be. Guy POV I looked at myself in the reflection of my best friend, Tommy's, sunglasses. Light hair and a confident smile that would make me the top of the food chain at South Glenn South. Popularity is not a choice. You have to work for it, and I had built up the perfect reputation with the popular kids in junior high. High school is going to be perfect. \"What you need,\" Tommy started, snapping me out of my reverie. \"Is a girlfriend.\" \"What?\" I said startled. \"Where'd you get that idea?\" \"You holed up the entire summer at your house... reading . You need to get laid.\" I snorted, but didn't disagree. And pushed open the school doors to face my glorious fate. Aldys POV Freshman year was a disaster. The minute I walked out of that bathroom door on the first day of school, I was pegged as the biggest nerd in school. That first day at lunch, the cool kids-Guys' group-dumped the entire bucket of coleslaw on my head. Mortified, I ran out of the lunchroom in tears, and ditched the entire rest of school, crying in the school bathroom. To make matters worse, I developed the biggest crush on Guy Perkins. Thankfully, by the end of the year I had joined the Denominators (the schools' group of mostly upperclassmen nerds). And as I grew to be an core part of the Denominators, I forgot about my crush. But I never completely stopped crushing on Guy Perkins. Guy POV Freshman year was amazing. On the first day of school, Tommy took on his mission to get me a girlfriend and by lunch I was making out with a blonde girl named Celia. Don't let the name fool you, she is super hot! The best part about that first day was when that geek: Aldot or something, tried to sit near our table at lunch and we retaliated by dumping the entire bucket of coleslaw on her head. She looked so embarrassed, I almost went after her, but Celia practically sat on my lap and we got...wrapped up in each other again. By the end of the year, my friends and I were at the top of South Glenn South's popularity chain. But everyone knew that I was above all of them. I never fully went through with Tommy's prediction on the first day. Sure Celia had wanted to go that far but I wanted to wait. My friends would kill me if they knew that I really had a crush on a nerd. So the first couple chapters are just going to be pretty short, detailing Guy and Aldys's first couple years in high school. Senior year will be pretty in depth, following the basic plot of the movie, albeit with some minor (read, major :-)) changes.[Chapter 2] Hey so I know I'm basically writing this for myself, but I don't really care because I really want to write this story Enjoy if anyone's actually reading! Aldys POV I'd like to say that my second year at high school was better than the first. But it wasn't that easy. Lots of girls spend days-months!-planning their social life and first day of school outfits. Those girls become popular, liked, and held back. Sophomore year, all I was worried about was that Denominators met every day after school, and that looking pretty wasn't eve on my radar. I was taking two college-level classes and I didn't have the time to put make-up on or curl my hair. The weird thing was: I was happy. There was no one pressuring me to be someone I'm not...fake British accent and all. The kids who were popular seemed happy but with the entire school watching them, it was like there was no freedom to be themselves. Guys POV As expected, my second year of high school went without a hitch. But sometimes I really resented being popular. Don't get me wrong...I love the parties and the attention and girls' jealous stares when they see Celia and I making out. But there was no acceptance. If I answered a question right in class I got stares and questions if I was cheating. If I got higher than a C on a test my friends asked if something was wrong. The spotlight was on me 24/7 and nothing escaped its glare. The weird thing was: I was miserable. There were times at the Court or dances where I forgot about my misery and got to enjoy being a teenager for a time. But after every kiss, every party, I shut myself in my room and couldn't help but feel that this cocky, jerk of a popular kid isn't who I really am. So yeah, chapter two is done. Sorry for it being so short. I promise that I'll actually write out junior year instead of just a voice over-type thing. Anyhoo, read and review![Chapter 3] So here's the third chapter of my Never Been Kissed fanfic. I highly doubt that anyone is reading but I'm going to keep on posting because I love to write this fic! BTW I might make this two chapters but we'll see. Aldys POV The first day of junior year I felt like beaming or quite possibly crying Over the summer my dad practically forced me to take Tyke to the pool almost everyday. It's not that I didn't like hanging out with my sister, it's just that the pool was the place for all the \"popular\" kids to hang out when they weren't getting wasted at the Court. Everyday Guy, Celia, Tommy and the lemmings would insult, ridicule, and bully me in front of my sister. They even gave me the most horrendous nickname: Alpo. I couldn't walk into school without facing them and the torment they caused me. I couldn't even look at Guy throughout the entire summer. He had stood by while his friends destroyed me verbally. Courses of \"Hey loser!\" and \"What's up Alp?\" rang through the hallways as I practically ran to my advanced calculus class on the second floor. Sinking into an empty chair, I took a shaky breath and exhaled with my eyes closed, desperate not to cry. I regained my composure and opened my eyes. Students, mostly seniors and the entire Denominators team, filed into the room. I bent over to pull my notebook out of my backpack when the entire room fell silent. What the...? I thought, raising my head. \"You have GOT to be kidding me!\" Guy POV \"We could talk to the counselor,\" Celia whined, hanging onto my arm and using the crowded hallway to pull me against her. \"I'm sorry babe,\" I said, putting my arm around her. \"I don't know why we're not in the same classes. Those dolts at the office must've screwed up our schedules.\" I'll admit. I knew why we weren't in the same classes. I'd decided to take a few advanced classes that I knew my friends would never dream of taking. I needed to challenge myself but didn't need my friends giving me crap about being a \"nerd.\" \"Well, I'll see you in a while baby,\" Celia said, pushing a forceful, and lengthy, kiss. She only detached herself when the bell rang and she sauntered off to her first period. I waited until my friends were out of sight and dashed up two flights of stairs to my first period advanced calculus class. The room is filled with kids talking about whatever nerds talk about, but they all fell silent when I walked in. \"You have GOT to be kidding me!\" I heard a girl's voice exclaim. I scanned the room and saw Alp-Aldys's eyes flashing behind her glasses. \"Mrs. Karren, there must be some mistake!\" She stormed to the teacher's desk, shooting a death glare in my direction. \"You can't expect...him to be here!\" \"Well,\" Mrs. Karren said calmly, looking at her with an even stare. \"It appears that Guy Perkins is actually in this class so if there is an issue you need to sort out, I advise you to take it elsewhere.\" Celia POV I let myself enjoy the kiss with Guy before first period. But, honestly, I was bored with him. I mean sure he was a total babe and the guy to date in school but he couldn't commit. All of our kisses felt rushed and that is all he wanted to do. I tried to convince him to go further but he never would. A girl has needs you know. Anyway, I was glad Guy wasn't going to be in any of my classes because I wanted the time to scope out the prospects. \"Hey,\" a deep voice said as I walked into my chemistry class. \"Hey yourself,\" I purred, turning so that we were pressed together in the doorway. Aldys POV \"I cannot believe this,\" I muttered for the hundreth time under my breath. Not only had Guy Perkins crashed my favorite class...he was sitting directly behind me! The minute I had taken my first-row seat, Guy...ahead of everyone else...claimed the seat inches behind me. As much as I wanted to despise him, I'm not saying I don't hate him, I couldn't stop my stomach from fluttering when he brushed past and the scent of his cologne enveloped me for a few, precious, seconds. Snap out of it Aldys, I scolded myself. Focus. \"Um,\" a finger tapped my shoulder lightly. I rolled my eyes and turned around, finding myself face-to-face with Guy. \"What do you want?\" I whispered harshly. \"You know where I'll be in ten minutes, you can make fun of me then.\" I turned back around, shocking myself with the retort. MY heart sank a little when I heard him sigh and lean back in his chair. This is real life, I reminded myself. Not a fairy-tale where the popular boy is in love with the nerdy girl. It doesn't work like that. Guy POV The minute Aldys fixed me in her gaze I almost forgot how to talk. I know how to play it coy and arrogant for my friends, but one look at the hatred in her eyes and I knew that the \"cool\" persona wouldn't work on her. \"What do you want?\" she whispered scathingly. Before I could think of a response she spat: \"You know where I'll be in ten minutes, you can make fun of me then.\" I leaned back, stunned, as she turned back around and I was left staring at her golden-brown hair. I'll admit that I didn't think she had it in her. She wouldn't speak for herself all summer and I didn't think ner-girls like her had a backbone. I barely paid attention to the notes for the rest of class and when the bell rang, I practically lept out of my seat to catch up with her. Dang she is fast. I thought, skidding to a stop when I rounded the corner. She had managed to merge with the crush of bodies by the main staircase and was lost. Cursing under my breath, I turned around and walked the opposite way for my English class. I paid no attention when Tommy and Jason yelled at me from the back pf the room. I slumped into the seat between the two guys and stared blankly out the door for the rest of class. When it was ( finally! ) time for lunch, my group claimed our usual table and immediately started taking about the upcoming dance. \"You're taking me to the dance, right?\" Celia asked, sitting uncomfortably close. \"Because I already have a dress,\" she kissed me and lowered her voice. \"Or I don't have to wear anything, if you want...?\" I shook my head and leaned back. \"I'll find a great way to ask you.\" Celia pouted a bit but we tuned back into our friend's conversation. Aldys POV Lunch. The worst part of the day for a \"geek.\" I rushed past Guy's table of loudmouth lemmings and sat with the rest of the Denominators one table over. \"Hey Alpo!\" Guy's voice rang above the rest. All of his friends laughed while the Denominators looked anywhere but at me or Guy. \"What are you doing so close to us? Nerds sit over there,\" he pointed to an area near the trash cans, an arrogant smirk on his face. \"I can sit wherever I want,\" I said, staring back at him. \"It's not like we were disturbing your, like, super important conversation about dresses and dancing.\" I held back a smirk of my own when Guy's cheeks turned bright red and Celia gave me a look of pure disgust when they realized that I had overheard their conversation. I turned back around and looked at my friends. \"Wow,\" David said. \"That was...amazingly brave of you.\" He shook his head. \"Or perhaps incredibly stupid.\" \"We shouldn't let them walk all over us,\" I explained, my anger bubbling to the surface. \"Why should we listen to them? Because they're \"cooler\" than us? We should just be who we want and not be ashamed of it. In two years we'll be off in the world and the opinions of some stupid, conceited high school jerks won't be any more important than what we ate for breakfast. We should be confident in who we are and not be afraid of what we will become.\" I took a deep breath, looking at each of my friends in turn. You could practically hear crickets at our table. \"Marvelous speech, Alpo,\" Celia snorted, clapping her hands sarcastically. \"I didn't know you could speak a language other than homework.\" With that, the entire popular table broke out in laughter, followed closely by the rest of the cafeteria. The laughter rang off the walls of the cafeteria and covered the Denominators with their taunts. Abigail and Casey ran from the hall, tears running down their cheeks, while David, Carter, and Owen looked away, their faces red. I glared daggers at Celia but I soon felt tears springing up behind my eyes and had to look down. I turned around and wiped tears from my eyes. I sneaked a look back over my shoulder at the \"cool\" table: Tommy and Jason were laughing openly while Kirsten, Kristen and Gibby were clapping sarcastically to \"congratulate\" me on my speech. Once I saw Guy lean in to give Celia a kiss I stood up abruptly. So that was the kind of girlfriend he wanted. Cruel and vindictive. I had pined over Guy for years but now I had to come to grips with his real self. The anger and betrayal and hurt surged so powerfully through my system; I thought I would explode. \"I need to get out of here,\" I said softly, pushing away from the table. I sprinted through the crowd as everyone started chanting: \"Alpo! Alpo!\" I slammed the door to the girls bathroom and locked myself in. Taking deep, unsteady breaths I raised my head to look at my reflection in the bathroom mirror and broke into chest-wracking, uncontrollable sobs. The emotions from the summer, from my first two horrendous years in high school, from all of the insults and taunts come pouring out of me. I sank down, my back against the tile wall, tears rushing down my face with no signs of stopping. I cried until the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch. I swallowed the lump in my throat and listened to students pouring into the hallways for their first period after lunch. I desperately wished to be a part of them. To laugh and gossip and just to have fun with some friends. But then I realized: I loved everyone in the Denominators and I was overcome with loathing for myself for thinking I wanted to have different friends. I wiped my eyes and stood up. My eyes were red and puffy but I figured that no one would notice me, let alone my eyes. Great , I thought, turning the door handle. My backpack's still in the cafeteria. Five minutes until the late bell. How in the WORLD am I going to make it in time? But when I ran into the cafeteria I couldn't find my backpack anywhere. \"Perfect!\" I exclaimed, throwing my hands over my head. \"Looking for this?\" A smooth voice said, from behind me an a hand appeared holding my backpack. \"Thanks,\" I said, relieved and turned around slowly. \"Why are you here?\" \"But...I...\" Guy stuttered, his face losing its signature smirk. I looked anywhere but his eyes while I tried not to notice how close he was standing to me. \"Just leave. Me. Alone!\" I said, bitterly snatching my my backpack and pushed his chest to distance myself from him. \"Aldys!\" He called, jogging up behind me. \"Oh, it's Aldys now?\" I snapped, turning to face Guy. \"I didn't know you and your band of lemmings knew the difference. I thought that anyone not in your group were automatic trash?\" For the first, and possibly last, time in my high school career I got a sincere answer from Guy Perkins. \"I don't think you're trash, Aldys. You're smart and loyal and I wish your could see how much you mean to your friends.\" I was shocked at his words but I was even more surprised at the honesty and openness in his dark blue eyes. But I couldn't ignore the pain that had flowed out of me when I cried... had it only been five minutes ago? \"Just leave,\" I said, crossing my arms defensively. At first, I thought he was going to say something encouraging or sweet, but his face hardened and he spat. \"Nice knowing you Alpo !\" So this took me a while to get up, and I am going to break it into two parts. Just so this one isn't suuuuper long. Lost Girl out ","Summary":" So I just watched this movie twice in three days and I love it!

He quickly glanced around towards some of thernless-than-eager faces before him, and put his coffee on the deskrnalong with his briefcase. \"Good morningrneveryone,\" he cheerfully announced to the class, his eyes quicklyrndarting over to the girl that just walked in. She smiled at him. Withrna gently sway of her hips, she started heading towards an empty desk. Sam knewrnCaroline Jensen had a crush on him, but he had no intention ofrnseducing his student. The first day ofrnclass, Sam had noticed her right away. The dark unruly curls swayingrngracefully about her shoulders, lovingly framing deep sea-green eyesrnsurrounded by long dark lashes, the gentle curve of her invitingrnmouth as she smiled at him flirtatiously… Of course, he noticedrnher. She was quite attractive. \"Hi, I'm newrnhere,\" a voice came from the front, suddenly bringing Sam'srnattention back to the class. \"Hi\" hernreplied back, \"I don't think we've met. I'm Sam… Coulson. Forrnsome reason the school has this thing about letting you guys call mernSam.\" Sam Coulson introduced himself to the new girl who hadrnaddressed him. \"I'm JosiernGeller\" she replied. \"But I'm pretty sure the school willrnbe okay with you calling me Josie.\" Sam couldn'trnhelp but smile. At first impression, Josie certainly didn't dressrnlike a typical teenager. He had to suppress another smile at thernsight of the white feather scarf wrapped loosely around herrnshoulders. \"Right…rnso welcome to Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'\" and Sam walked uprnto the blackboard to write in big letters the word 'pastoral'. As Sam spoke,rnJosie found herself mesmerized by his voice. Typically, she'd bernthe first to take detailed notes of every word a teacher said, butrnhere, she could only sit and stare. \"Pastoral\"rnSam said sharply, turning to the front of the class. Josie's eyesrnfollowed him as he approached the front row. \"Can anyone tell mernwhat that means?\" Sam continued. An eager handrnwent up. \"Oh oh oh! That's what they do to milk!\",rnexclaimed a young girl named Sera. Josie smiled at the ditzy girl'srnmistake. \"No, that's pasteurize , Sera.\" Sam corrected. \"But close.\" \"Parakeet?\"rnSera tried, almost desperately. \"Okay,rnanyone else?\" Sam looked hopefully around the class. He wasrnabout to call on Caroline, when he noticed the raised hand in thernfront row. \"Josie?\" \"Pastoralrnmeans set in the country. Originally seen in the Eclogues of Virgil.rnIt comes from the Latin pascere; to graze\" Josie explained, andrnnoticed a smile appear at the corners of Sam's mouth. Sam was stunned. \"Are yournsure you're seventeen?\" he asked, not quite sure if he wasrnjoking or not. \"Y..yes,\"rnJosie replied hesitantly. \"I'm seventeen,\" she stammered, andrnrepeated \"I'm seventeen!\" Sam stared atrnher intrigued, before regaining his composure. He smiled broadly atrnher and Josie beamed at him. Her heart was beating really fast.rn\"Excellent answer Josie\" and Sam added, \"I think you're yetrnto become one of my most promising students\". Josie blushed arnpretty pink, and suddenly her silver-blue eyes found it hard to lookrninto Sam's piercing green ones, for he was still intently lookingrnat her. His gaze gave her butterflies. She bit her bottom liprnnervously and glanced down at her desk.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two Caroline Caroline stoodnoutside Sam's office, brushing a stray curl back around her ear.nShe kept wondering why Sam hadn't been calling on her in class. Itnworried her. She worked really hard on all her assignments to pleasenhim, and she considered herself his best student…up until JosienGeller came along. He was calling on Josie a lot now, and withngraduation being only 3 weeks away, she had hoped that perhapsnafterwards…she and Sam might have a chance to talk. She did, afternall, turn eighteen 3 months ago. \"Come in\" Samnanswered from behind the door at the sound of someone knocking. Caroline walked in,nclosing the door behind her. Her green eyes widened at the sight ofnSam behind his desk. She had never approached him like this before.nOnly now with Josie in the picture, she was suddenly overcome with ansense of deep jealousy at sharing any of Sam's attention. When Sam saw Caroline,nhe did have to compose himself. She was so ethereally beautiful asnshe stood there, long curls skimming down to her waist, big greenneyes…with something in them he could not quite decipher as shenregarded him. \"Hi Caroline,\" Samnsaid \"What is it?\" Caroline smiled coyly.nHow was she going to proceed? An idea suddenly occurred to her.nRaising her hand towards her forehead, she began to slump down, andnas she expected, Sam sprung from behind his desk towards her. Henwrapped his arms around her waist, catching her in time. \"Woah! Arenyou ok Caroline?\" Sam asked concerned. Sam's face was nownonly inches away from Caroline's. Caroline parted her lipsninvitingly and locked eyes with him. She then wrapped her arms aroundnSam's neck and kissed him. She held onto his neck tight to deepennthe kiss… KNOCK, KNOCK! A loudnknocking suddenly echoed through the office. Sam pushed Carolinenaway, as if burned, and took a quick step backwards. \"Who is it?\" henasked shocked, still looking at Caroline. \"Mr. Coulson, it'snJosie Geller.\"[Chapter 3] ChapternThree Thenpoem \"Josie, come in\". Josie walked in and wasnsurprised to see Caroline. Sam was sitting behind the desk. Josienthought they both looked a bit flushed, although the rosy cheeks onnCaroline only served to enhance her pretty face. Josie had noticednCaroline right away, even envying her. They had several classesntogether. Where Caroline was slender and extremely attractive, Josienwas slightly overweight and just average looking, she thought.nGranted, perhaps if she took better care of her appearance, it mightnbe different. Today with her brown Gaucho pants, cream buttonedndress-shirt, and braided hair, she suddenly felt less than sexy.nCaroline was very popular in school, especially with the boys, andnknew how to play it. Josie had never hadnmuch positive experience with the popular crowd in the past, but to nher amazement, Caroline was really nice to her. On her first daynduring lunch, Caroline had offered Josie a seat next to her at thenlunch table with Kristin, Kirsten and Gibby, the other popular girlsnat school. But, Josie didn't think Caroline really considered her anfriend. Josie remained standingnby the door, waiting for Sam and Caroline to finish whateverndiscussion they were having. \"Caroline, we need tontalk\" Sam said intently lookinh at Caroline. She nodded her head.n\"Please, stop by my office tomorrow.\" Caroline nodded again andnleft, her triumphant face still aglow. Sam ran his handsnthrough his hair, frustrated with himself and at what happened afternCaroline's departure. He had just been kissed by Caroline. He tookna deep breath to compose himself. Looking at Josie, henwalked around the desk towards her. \"What can I do for you Josie?\" Josie couldn't helpnbut notice the exasperated tone of voice Sam used to address her.nMisunderstanding, the coldness permeated throughout her heart. Shenwas about to inform him that she was actually an undercover reporternfrom the Chicago Sun Times, posing as a student to research a storynon teenagers. However, those wordsncouldn't come now. She WAS 25 years old,ngraduated at the top of her class, a successful copywriter, shenwasn't Josie Grossie anymore…but still, she couldn't shakenloose the feeling of insecurity about her looks as she faced Sam. Henwas so handsome. Would he even be interested in her if he knew shenwas 25 years old and available? She so wanted him to give her hernfirst real kiss. As she glanced at his lips, her stomach didnsommersaults. \"Oh, uh.. a..actuallynI just wanted to make sure that I had copied down the readingnassignment correctly\" Josie said softly \"it is pages 65-124,ncorrect?\" Sam, more calm again,nlooked at his notes. \"Yep, that's it. And don't forget the freenverse poem assignment that's due next week.\" \"Oh, I've alreadyndone it\" Josie said eagerly. \"I love writing.\" Then, Josienhesitantly added \"W…would you like to read my poem?\" her facenflushed bright red. Sam smiled at hernenthusiasm for writing. It was contagious. He found himself curious.n\"Of course Josie. Why don't you read it to me? Please sit.\" Josie smiled and sat onnthe chair across Sam's desk. Sam sat on the desk, facing Josie.nThis close, Sam was surprised to notice how beautiful her eyes were.nThey were a clear crystal blue with tiny flecks of gold. He couldnalso see the slight sprinkle of adorable freckles on her flushedncheeks. Josie's heart begannto beat nervously. Her voice quivered as she began: Does he notice me? Doesnhe hear my heart screaming his name? Sometimes it's sonloud that I think God must hear my pain His voice is sonmellifluous Amazing! the way henmakes me soar I haven't lived tillnmeeting him I feel his arms aroundnme And all I see is himnand me Forever and forever And although, I knownthat it's all in my head That I'm talking tonmyself instead There, I see his eyesnaglow with love If only real, mynpenguin from above. Alas, will he evernnotice? 'Cause I'm stillnwaiting – waiting to be his. Josie's voice trailednoff to a whisper at the last sentence. She couldn't hold Sam'sngaze and glanced down at her hands. Sam was pensive as henlistened to her. When she was done, he gently grabbed her chin andnraised her head so he could gaze deeply into her eyes. Softly, hensaid \"That's really well written Josie\". He was really touchednby her poem, and added \"Well Josie, all I can tell you is that whennyou're my age, guys will be lined up 'round the block for you.\"nHe suddenly felt uncomfortable at the thought of Josie with othernguys. Looking into Sam'snpenetrating eyes, Josie's blue ones suddenly became sad. \"Younhave to say that because you're my teacher\". Awkwardly, Sam glancednaway and said \"Actually, I shouldn't say that because I'm yournteacher.\" \"Oh…\" Josie said,nblushing. His gaze was on hernlips as she looked away.

It sort of stuck. He didn't mean for it to, but it did. \"Hey, common, im sure you can be more popular here.\" Josie sighed, \"Oh im sure, and perhaps ill fall in love and run off with one of my teachers.\" Rob smirked, \"Never know.\" \"Apparently I have English first, with a, looked around for Rob, who had apparently disappeared. She shrugged her shoulders and looked at the map she was given, and headed off to class. She came upon the door, and could hear chatter coming from inside, class hadn't started yet. So she just slipped in. The class went silent, staring at her for a moment, and then went back to their conversations. She looked around for an empty seat, and decided to sit by a bunch of math people. They had to be friendly she though. Anyone who could actually wear an orange sweatshirt with a \"Denominator\" symbol on it couldn't be that superficial. One of the girls smiled at her, and Josie smiled back. The class went silent again, and Josie looked up to see a handsome man walk into the room. He grabbed a notebook from his bag, and took a sip of coffee from a black mug. He looks around the room, giving his usual greeting. \"Morning class.\" Josie noticed his eyes fall on her, \"I don't belive we've met, I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam. Don't know why, but, eh, whatever.\" Josie giggled, and began to introduce herself. \"Im Josie Gellar, im guessing the school wouldn't have a problem with you referring to me as Josie?\" The teacher let off a smile, and Josie blushed. \"Well Josie, since your knew. I like to drink coffee during class. And because it would be unfair of me to drink and not let you do so, everyone is aloud to drink. No Matt, this still does not include beer.\" A boy from the back let out a groan, Josie couldn't help but let out a laugh at this. \"Well, welcome to shakespears \"As You Like It.\", Okay, how many of you actually did the assignment last night?\" Around five hands go up. \"FIVE? Really, I wasn't expecting so many. So how many of you spent more time eating than reading?\" The rest of the class raised their hands. \"Hmm, perhaps I should make eating part of the assignment then.\" Sam opened his book, and the girl next to Josie notices she has no book, and moves next to her. \"We can share.\" Josie almost let out a sigh of relief, someone was being nice, TO HER! \"'As You Like It\" is an example of a Shakespearean-- \" He turns to the blackboard and begins to write. \"Pastoral Comedy. Anyone know what this means?\" A girl, in the front row, jumped up and down with her hand raised. Josie couldn't help but think her answer would be less than right. \" Oh oh oh! That's what they do to milk!\" Sam looked at her sympathetically, did parents get high 17 years ago before they had children? \"That's pasteurize, Sera. But close. Same letter, three syllables...\" \"Parakeet?!\" Said the girl in a desperate attempt to find the right answer. The girl next to Josie rolled her eyes, \"There's a minute of my life I wont get back.\" Josie smiled. Sam look a bit upset no one knew the answer, Josie at this moment couldn't contain herself, \"Pastoral means set in the country. Originally seen in the Eclogues of Virgil. It's from the Latin pascere. To graze.\" Sam looked at her in shock. Finally he walks over to her, and gives her a handshake. \" Did I mention to the class I love our new student?\" At this, Josie turned beat red. A girl near Josie got an annoyed look on her face, \"Did I mention the class loves our new kiss ass?\" \"Now Gibby, where are we?\" She looked confused...\"A classroom?\" \"Correct, now what did Josie do?\" \"Answer a question?\" \"Now isn't this what you are supposed to do in a classroom?\" Gibby opened her mouth as if she was about to say something, and then quickly closed it. Sam had indeed stumped her. Josie continued to sit, her face burning.[Chapter 2] Josie is lookingnthrough lockers, trying to find her locker. She finally finds it, only to be face to facenwith a couple making out. She sighed, she didn't even want to attempt to breaknthrough. The loud speaker madenthe usual loud speaker clicky sound that you always hear before an announcement wasnmade. A overly cheerful voice, obviously put on, came through it. \"Hello, this isnAmy, your student council president, we currently do not have enoughnfunding for a music department--\" The hallway erupted inngroans. \"As for prom,nvoting on a current theme has finished, and the winning theme is, the Millennium!\" Most students lookednunphased, but a few began clapping. Clapping that shortly stopped after the announcement. She turned to hernlocker, to find the couple gone. She takes out a combination lock she had used on her oldnlocker, places a few books in it, and locks it. She had lunch, something she had beennwaiting for, basically all day. She made her way to thencafe, and to her surprise, the line was quite short. She picked up a tray and got tonthe back. Once she entered, she found that the food was better than she thought itnwould be. She grabbed a premade salad and allows herself to be pushed along until shenreached the cash register. She paid, and left. Now she had to find a table. The worstnpart. She sees Kirsten,nKristen and Gibby, not wanting to bother with them, shenlooks away. She had dealt with enough girls like that at her school, an anynexperiences she had with them were not fun at all. She started tonsweat, overwhelmed by thenlarge amount of people. She opens her salad, takes out a piece of celery, eats it, andnthen throws the rest out. She was so out of there. The rest of her daynwent basically how she imagined it, dull, and boring. Oh, apparently she was anDenominator now. Well, at least she had some friends. She finally learned the name of thengirl who let her share her book with her. Emily. Well, Emily, THANKYOU! She walked to thenparking lot, only to find her car gone. No, no no no. This wasn't happening. Her father'sncar, the first car she had ever been allowed to drive was gone. At this moment shenenvied Rob, too young to drive, so he gets the bus. An entire yellow school bus can'tnbe gone. She saw Emily running up to her, \"Sorry Josie, they do this to all the newnkids.\" \"Do what?\"nasked Josie curiously. \"Hide your car,nand watch you look for it.\" \"Oh.\" \"Come on, your carncan't be far, ill help you look for it.\" \"Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" \"Hey, after younfind your car, want to take a drive to Friendly's? Good food!\" Josie smiled, \"Yeah.\"[Chapter 3] Sam is sitting on hisndesk, and everyone is in his or her usual seats. Emily is standing up, reading from hernbook. \"All the world's anstage and all the men and women merely players.\" \"Does anyone knownwhat he meant by this,\" asked Sam as he got off of his desk. Hentook a look around, and nonone raised their hand. His eyes again fell on Josie, hoping that she would answer. Josie slowly raises hernhand, and Sam smiles. \"It's about disguise, playing a part. It's the theme of \"AsnYou Like It.\" \" Sam nodded, \" Cannanyone tell me where we see that?, \" He asked, looking over atnJosie again. \"Well, Rosalindndisguises herself as a man and escapes into the forest... \" \"Right. And it'snwhen she's in costume that she can finally express her love for Orlando. See,nShakespeare's making the point here that when we're disguised, wenfeel freer.

He looked over at her, trying to hid the fact that he too wasnalso feeling a bit smitten with her at this moment. \" Josie, why don't you read from Actn5, Scene 2, Rosalind's speech.\" \"Sure,\" saidnJosie as she picked up her book and headed to the front. \"No sooner hadnthey met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but theynsighed...\" It was almost as if atnthat moment the room faded away.

Matilda had waited for what seemed like hours, watching the door, waiting for Leon to arrive. Even when Tony had started to make noise about the possibility that he wasn't coming home, that it was over, Matilda had remained firm. Leon was coming back. He had to. They were going to have roots together. So she drank her milk and silently waited. The door to the restaurant was slung open and Matilda's heart stopped. He was there, right in front of her, clutching his side which was visibly bleeding. \"Leon!\" she cried, running over to throw her arms around him. He grunted in response, and too late she remembered his injury. \"I thought you were dead.\" \"So did I,\" he said in his deep accent. \"But we can't stay here. We have to go. I barely escaped Stansfield. Tony!\" he called out to the back of the room. Tony peeked his bruised face from around the door. \"Leon! Thank God you're alive.\" \"God had nothing to do with it, and neither did you,\" Leon grumbled. Tony winced at the reminder. \"Leon...\" \"Save it. Just give me my money. Now. We're leaving.\" \"It will take some time, Leon.\" \"Now!\" Leon shouted and both Tony and Matilda jumped. She had never heard him use that tone of voice before and instinctively she shrunk away, waiting for the violence that usually followed her father's outbursts. \"I've got to try to clean myself up,\" Leon said to her, motioning to the blood seeping out of the wound. \"I don't think I was followed, but watch the door just in case.\" Matilda nodded somberly as he passed by, snagging the first aid kit Manolo held out for him wordlessly and headed into the bathroom. By the time Tony appeared back, with a suitcase in tow, Leon was stepping out of the bathroom, seemingly patched up. Tony sat the suitcase down and flipped open the latches. \"I couldn't get it all today, but we can make arrangements to get the rest later.\" Leon eyed the piles of money inside. \"It's fine for now. I need my spare guns too.\" \"I thought as much. I took the liberty of sending Manolo to get them.\" He wiggled a finger and the silent Manolo brought another case. \"Where will you go, Leon?\" \"Away from here, that's all you need to know. We'll be in touch when this runs out.\" Leon snapped the case shut. Glancing up at Matilda, he said, \"Let's go.\" \"What happened?\" Matilda asked as she struggled to keep up with him as he turned and walked out the door without another word to Tony. \"I got out just in time. I saw Stansfield in the hallway. But they'll be looking for us. We've got to get out of the city.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"I don't know yet.\" \"But I'm going with you,\" Matilda said softly. \"I'm yours, right?\" Leon stopped walking. \"I saved your life and I am responsible for it,\" he said, quoting her. \"That's not what I meant.\" \"I know.\" He turned and looked at her. \"Let's get one thing straight. We are...partners. Partners do not mix business with pleasure. Tony taught me that.\" \"Bonnie and Clyde did.\" \"And they're dead, which is not what we want to be.\" He sighed. \"If you want to go with me, you will drop this. When you turn 18, if you still feel the same way, we'll discuss it again.\" \"I am 18!\" \"No, you're not. Drop it until you really turn 18, okay?\" Matilda smiled. \"Okay.\" Author's Note: Not sure where it's going, but had it lying around and finally decided to post it. Should it continue?[Chapter 2] Six Years Later... She was glad that this particular strip bar didn't require anything to dance but the willingness to get naked in front of a group of horny strangers. Dancers were paid under the table a bare minimum and were expected to split tips with the management. She didn't care. She wasn't in it to make money. Had it been a \"classier\" establishment and required Social Security numbers or a driver's license to ensure the dancers really were 18, she would have had a problem. \"You're late, Lolita,\" the bouncer growled as she passed by him. He didn't bother to check her bag, management didn't care if their girls were coked out of their minds in order to get through their sets as long as they got through them. But it wasn't drugs \"Lolita\" would have been concealing. \"Got held up in traffic,\" she snapped back. \"How's business?\" \"Best it ever is on a Tuesday night,\" the bouncer said. \"Lolita\" knew that Tuesdays weren't exactly the busiest night in the flesh trade. Guys didn't get horny and desperate enough to darken this establishment's doors that early on into the week. Wednesdays, maybe. Something about \"hump\" day really drove home the point that they were going to spend the weekend alone again, with only a porno or two to keep them company. That's when they came here, to oggle the real thing, live and in person. And for a few extra hundred bucks, you didn't have to just oggle. If she had been one of the dancers trying to make ends meet, she would have been pissed to be stuck with the worst shift possible. But Tuesday nights were the reason she came to work here in the first place. \"Lolita, where have you been, you're up next!\" Sugar Cane, one of the fellow dancers desperate enough to make a couple of bucks on a Tuesday night, greeted her in the bar area as the buxom blonde finished serving (or was that servicing) a customer. Sticking her tip in her g-string, she said, \"The boss is pissed.\" \"He'll get over it.\" \"Lolita\" cast a glance around the room. \"Is my favorite regular here yet?\" Sugar Cane gave her a knowing smile. \"He's been asking about you. He won't tip any of the rest of us, stingy bastard. Maybe tonight's the night you take your act to a private room, girl.\" She winked. \"Thanks, Sugar. I better not disappoint him. I'll go get ready.\" She made her way past the stage and into the curtained off section behind where the dancers changed. One of the other dancers, Carmen, barely looked up from the line of coke she was snorting to give \"Lolita\" any acknowledgment. That was good. The less people around here remembered her, the better. She changed out of her street clothes and into her costume – an indecently short pleated skirt, a cropped button-up white shirt and knee socks. It played up the \"Lolita\" name, the school girl fantasy many of the men that came here had. And the fact that she actually was underage only helped. Well. For a few more days anyway. Her eighteenth birthday loomed ahead. Matilda acted like she had forgotten Leon's promise about that day, but it never left the back of her mind. Soon they would have to revisit the issue one way or the other. The last six years had been good for their partnership. They had stayed off the grid and out of Stansfield's reach, never staying anywhere longer than a month at the most and taking jobs where they could find them. Despite what he had said about wanting to live in a house and have roots, they both new it was impossible with Stansfield out there, somewhere, looking for the little girl and the cleaner that had taken out his personal force. Matilda was Leon's roots now. At first, it had been like it was in the first days of their life together – Matilda would cook and clean while Leon did the jobs. But once Matilda's training had become complete and word had spread about the brand-new cleaner with the face of an angel that could go places most male cleaners couldn't, demand for her work had increased. Which had lead her to this hole-in-the-wall. A well-known gun runner was known to frequent the place on Tuesday nights. He was too well-known for his own good, however, and word was he was going to squeal to the cops on his customer-base for a plea deal. Matilda had been hired to make sure he never made that deal. She had attracted his attention right away, that wasn't difficult. At some point between 12 and now, her small frame had filled out to womanly proportions. Matilda, for wanting to stay under the radar, attracted male attention easily. Well, except for the one male she actually wanted, but that was going to change very soon. No, the problem with the job was the gun runner had a habit of being surrounded by his cohorts. He would watch her dance, he would tip, but he never would go anywhere alone with her. Matilda had been pushing for time in the \"champagne\" room, but he never budged. Maybe he had heard about the health qualities of most of the dancers here and didn't want to take his chances. He didn't seem like the type that would be above buying a woman, but maybe there was a boundary to his sleeziness. She doubted he suspected the truth – that she was a top cleaner trying to take him out. Leon had cautioned her about getting too close to the mark and wanted her to take him out at a distance, but she had refused, calling that amateur work and she was a professional now. The truth was, she liked seeing the hint of jealousy in his eyes as she got ready to bare all to strange men. That look was the only thing that got her through her sets. She called upon the memory of that look as she had called out, \"I'm going to work, I'll be back by four at the latest,\" as she walked out the door that evening as she stepped onto the stage to the grinding music. Many of the dancers tried to engage the men, but \"Lolita\" wasn't one of them. She moved to the music, shedding clothes behind provocatively, with a faraway look in her eyes, as if she wasn't seeing the crowd, but something else. Someone else. But her biggest tippers didn't seem to mind. She did what she usually did during her sets, run through how she was going to approach her discussion with Leon about her eighteenth birthday. She had dated boys her own age. Even tried to fall in love with a few of them. As far as her quiet partner knew, the subject had settled – she had moved on past her crush that had made things so awkward between them back when she was 12. He didn't realize she had been biding her time. The song ended and Matilda broke off her thoughts of Leon abruptly, turning her faraway eyes on the mark, who had at some point during the song, stuffed a few 20s down her g-string. \"Set's ended, daddy,\" she said in a breathy stripper voice she affected while here, along with a pigtailed wig of long brown hair and bright contacts-blue eyes. \"Unless you'd like something a bit more private tonight?\" The mark opened his mouth to say no and Matilda continued on. Her birthday was only days away and she wanted this miserable job behind her by then. \"My boyfriend's getting jealous of all the time I'm spending here. I might have to quit. This could be our last chance together.\" The mark's eyes darkened. \"How much?\" \"150. Just you.\" She cast her eyes around the table at his cronies. He eyed them. \"250 for all of us.\" \"I'm a one-on-one kind of girl.\" Matilda seethed inwardly. If this didn't work tonight, she was going to hide up in some parking lot and try to take him out from a distance, amateur or not. But she did her best to give him the big doe eyes, the innocent little girl that was too dumb to suspect of anything other than selling her body to get a buck. The planets aligned, God smiled down on her, however you wanted to put it. The arms dealer smiled. \"100.\" Cheap bastard! If she wasn't getting paid a hell of a lot more than that to kill him, Matilda would have been insulted. \"I'll go get ready, daddy.\" \"You're fine the way you are, baby,\" he said. \"You've got to get a 'show.' House rules. Keeps the cops away.\" She winked at him and went to get the key to the champagne room from the boss. \"I get half,\" the boss reminded her, handing her the key to the room Matilda had picked. It was actually the worst one, the one closest to the stage. But for Matilda, the best as behind one of the draped curtains was actually a locked door to the alley – a lock Matilda had broken weeks ago. Dressing again backstage, she gave a quick glance around the room to make sure none of the other dancers were watching her, and slipped something out of her purse and onto her person. Grabbing her bag, she headed to the room. His guards must have all ready checked the room, because the gun runner was alone. Walking over to the stereo system, Matilda put on some techno music that, combined with the music leaking in from the stage outside, made it impossible to hear anything going on inside the room. She got up on the table and started to dance even as the gun runner shed his clothes in anticipation for what was to come after. He didn't expect the silenced-gun and the two shots that followed – one for the kill, one for the insurance policy. Never in the face, the client must be able to identify the mark to get paid. Acting fast, Matilda rifled through his pants pocket to take his wallet – she was to send the driver's license as an extra procaution to her client and it made it look like he had been rolled for his money, shoving it and the small cheap champagne bottle into her bag. On the defense, she whipped aside the curtain and pushed the door open to the alley, making sure none of his cronies were waiting. Slipping down a side street, Matilda left \"Lolita\" behind with each step, losing the contact lenses, shoving the wig down into her bag to reveal her short dark brown hair and slipping on her skullcap and dark glasses. Another trip into a darkened alley and she was back in jeans and a black tank top, stripper clothes shoved down into the bottom of her bag to be burned later. \"Lolita\" was gone. Matilda remained. Many blocks later, she climbed the stairs to an unassuming apartment and knocked three times, once, and then twice. She blew a kiss into the peephole as she heard locks clicking and then the door opened to her, revealing a quiet, thin man with a long nose, graying rough facial hair, wearing all-black clothes. \"All done!\" she said, holding up her bottle of champagne victoriously as she walked inside the room. \"What's that for? We don't drink,\" he said in his heavy accent. \"It's for a special occasion.\" \"Killing a gun runner is a special occasion?\" \"No, but my birthday is. It's in a few days.\" She met his eyes directly. \"My eighteenth birthday.\" She let the stressed word hang in the air between them. He glanced away from her. \"Matilda...\" \"And we have a promise to discuss.\" \"I thought that you had forgotten about that.\" \"I didn't.\" The air was thick with tension between them. Matilda stared him down, waiting. He blinked first. Turning away, he said, \"We'll discuss it later then. Job's done. Get some sleep.\" He turned to go into the bedroom and closed the door behind him. She could almost swear she heard the locks turning. With a sigh, she headed to the foldout couch the meager room offered. \"Not sleeping on this damn thing much longer,\" she mumbled as she stripped out of her clothes, leaving on only her bra and underwear. Let him walk in on that in the morning. Going to the window, she opened it, reaching past the clothes she would destroy in a neighboring building's incinerator in the coming days, she grasped a pack of cigarettes and lit one. She sat on the windowsill, wafting the smoke outside so Leon wouldn't smell it and complain, and looked out into the nighttime city. Waiting. Many blocks away, a shady strip club had discovered the body of a patron in one of their private rooms and a missing stripper. The police had shown up, and unfortunately for them, no one seemed to know much about the girl. She was new, and the club wasn't big on record-keeping. \"Probably a john being rolled for his wallet,\" one of the cops said nervously to his partner. \"It's the only thing missing. Stripper had to have been packing some serious heat, though. Clean shots.\" Norman Stanfield looked at the body in front of him and smiled. He looked up at the young cop who had been assigned to him. \"Do you like Beethoven?\" Author's Note: Well, should it continue? And what about her birthday?

She didn't react at all and thenblonde man's eyes looked left and right nervously for a few momentsnbefore switching back over to her. \"I'm telling you girl, you'dnbetter give us your purse or we will kill you.\" The black mannmurmured. \"How pathetic. Two grown menntaking on an nineteen year old girl, threatening to kill her over,\"nthe girl took out her purse and opened it to look at the moneyninside, \"a measley thirty seven dollars.\" \"Bitch!\" the young blond guynslashed at her with his blade, angered by her obvious taunts. Quick as a flash, the girl kickednupwards with an expert scissor kick that broke the man's open armnon impact, shattering the bone, making him scream with pain and dropnthe blade. Instantaneously, she grabbed the handle in mid-air andntwisted her body around, grabbing the man and holding the blade tonhis neck. Inside her arms, the man whimpered as the pain from hisnbroken arm seared through his body and the blade pressed against thentender, vulnerable flesh of his neck. \"If you promise to leave nownwithout harming me or robbing me, I will return your friend to younalive and I won't tell the police about you two. However, if yountry to kill me or rob me ever again, I will do much worse than what Inhave done tonight.\" She said calmly. The black guy stared at her with anmixture of fear and respect in eyes. Slowly, he pressed the safety onnhis gun and placed it back inside it's holster. Then he held hisnarm out for the knife. She surrendered it. The guy flickednit closed and tucked it inside the pocket inside his jacket. Thenwoman released the man trembling in his arms. \"You'd better get him to anhospital.\" She replied. Without a word, the tallndark-skinned man nodded. He flashed her a quick smile and thenngrabbed his friend's shoulders and steered him out of the emptynalleyway into a quiet street. The girl shook her head and took outna fresh cigarette from her pocket, lighting it and inhaling the toxicnfumes. \"Mess with me and you get hurt.\"nShe said aloud to herself as she left the alleyway, unaware that ansecurity camera had recorded the entire ordeal. Unaware that at that moment, ansecurity guard was in his office swearing in anger at the sight ofnthe girl. Since being fired from his job sixnyears ago, being in jail himself for four, he'd finally gotten outnand found himself a similar job to what he'd had before.

Never able to get comfortable. Never able to slow his thoughts. The sun was rising once again when a woman came out to find him. \"Excuse me, is there any news for Ju- the Home Secretary?\" He jumped up, recognising the woman from earlier, knowing she'd have information for him. If there was any, that is. \"Sir, please calm down.\" The woman flinched at his raised voice, knowing fine well he probably didn't even realise just how loud his voice was. \"Sorry. I'm sorry, please. Is there any news?\" He pleaded with the woman, who simply nodded her head for him to follow. He followed her through different hallways and rooms. Each one had a different person, some were healthy and talking. Others looked like human corpses, only able to breathe thanks to machines. He prayed Julia was not the latter, he wishes she was up and talking. Smiling and laughing, he would walk in and see her. Her eyes sparkling. She'd hesitate until someone let them be alone for a moment before greeting him properly. He'd hug her until the sun went back down and they would sit and talk. It would be meaningless talk, nothing specific. Just as long as it was the two of them. But David knew the drill. He knew that, that was all impossible with the injuries she sustained. There was more chance of her being dead. Not that, that was a thought he welcomed. \"Okay, is this him?\" David looked forward, a Doctor in scrubs was standing before him. \"Yes, this is David Budd, the Home Secretary's P.P.O. He was the one that ran to save her.\" \"Me and Kim. She went as well. Kim helped too.\" David jumped in, not prepared to take all the credit. She deserved it too. Whether it was good or bad feedback they received didn't matter, he wouldn't forget Kim. \"Yes, anyway, I spoke with the doctors and they have agreed to speak with you as there is no family present. You also have a right to know, considering the circumstances.\" She moved back, but David was quick to stop her. \"Hold on, what do you mean circumstances?\" \"Well, you were her P.P.O for this specific incident and others. I assume there is a friendship there by now, apologies if I am wrong. I just made an assumption, you would have struck up some kind of bond. Not meaning inappropriately of course, but anyway. I just presumed you deserved to know.\" She smiled kindly at him, David nodding his head in return before turning back to the doctor. \"Okay, so she sustained very serious injuries. Her head gash was luckily not deep enough to cause damage, but there was a lot of internal bruising to her stomach and ribs. Luckily she did pull through, however that does not mean this is now an easy road. For either of you. We are hoping she will wake up within the next few hours, we cannot say specifically when though. She is breathing on her own so we would hope sooner rather than later. It's important you remember we cannot guarantee- \" \"You canny guarantee she'll wake up and be the same she was. I know. I've heard all this before.\" He cut in, but the doctor stood silent. \"Yes, sir, we cannot guarantee she will be the same if she wakes up. Now I must warn you, what you are about to see won't be pretty. It won't be the Home Secretary you know. If she wakes up ensure to stay calm and quiet, there's a possibility she won't have a clue what is happening and where she is. Are you sure you are ready to see her? It is understandable if you feel you can't\" David nodded impatiently, ready to push the man out the way to get to where he needed. The doctor walked a few doors down to a wooden door with a slit window. He walked away, leaving David outside the private room. He hovered for several minutes before finally looking up, feeling his stomach turn. Julia lay on the bed, hooked up to different machines. Bruising covered most of the visible parts of her body. Her right eye was swollen slightly, but her head wound had been covered up with a small patch on her forehead. He looked over her fragile body, padding covering her abdomen where most of the surgery had taken place. Pushing the door open, the squeaking of the hinges and beeping of the machines were deafening compared to the silence he was expecting. Her small breaths were barely audible as he made his way over to the bed. \"Hello, mam\" David smiled shakily, pulling the plush seat closer. This cream chair squeaked as he sat down, filling more silence. David sat for several minutes, unsure of what to say. He wasn't even sure if she could hear him. If she would have any clue he was ever there. It was then he felt the familiar sting in the back of his eyes. Tears began tumbling down his cheeks, burning their path down his face. \"I'm so, so sorry, love. I tried to get to you. I did.\" His head dropping to where his hand was holding hers. Her nails stained with blood and residue, his tears wetting her purpled skin. \"I will find them. I will find the bastards that did this, I promise. Please make it through. Please. You can make it.\" David held her hand there for close to an hour, sobbing quietly. He soon heard the door squeak open, a short grey haired woman walking in. \"Oh my apologies they didn't tell me someone was in here.\" The woman smiled, crossing over to him, placing a hand on his shoulder. \"Sorry, mam, I'll leave if you would like some time.\" He went to get up but her mother pushed him down slightly. \"No, no you stay too. She'll be happy to see you when she's awake. Dave, right?\" She sat in the chair on the other side of Julia's bed, holding onto her other hand. David noticed how she paused for a minute, taking in the sight of her hurt child. \"Yes, mam. I'm sorry the Home Secretary never mentioned your name to me.\" He looked up, still grasping onto her hand. \"Margaret. Don't worry, you don't have to use big H.S words. I know you two were close.\" David sat upright not sure what to think of what had just been said. \"Sorry?\" \"You were friends I mean, she mentioned your name once when I called. Said how you had been rather nice despite her being rude. And I know my daughter, she doesn't mention just anyone to me.\" The older woman smiled a small smile, her eyes giving away her sadness. \"Oh well yes, I suppose we have become close since I started working for her. She's an intelligent woman. Very intelligent.\" David smiled, feeling extremely awkward with the older woman. He knew no one else knew of their secret affair, so didn't want to give more away than necessary. \"I am not well myself. So I cannot stay long. My personal nurse, Danielle, she doesn't let me out for long periods of time alone. I need to be back in an hour or so\" ,she nodded sadly before continuing, \"I don't think I could cope seeing her like this for more than that anyway.\" \"Right, of course. I can give you alone time if you like. Run and grab you a coffee?\" He offered, despite not wanting to leave Julia's side. \"No, you're quite alright dear. I can't have the caffeine. You know, it isn't my place to say but my daughter spoke highly of you.\" \"She did?\" \"I may have held back slightly before, when letting on the amount she said about you. Last I spoke to her was several days ago, she was in the office. But I could hear the way she spoke of you, she likes you very much. Whether it's platonic or otherwise is not for me to say, but know she is fond of you.\" David sat up more now, acutely aware of the situation this could put both him and Julia in. But before he could respond, the doctor came back in. Asking to speak with her mother. \"Yes of course, can I ask what it is about?\" She went to stand, gently placing Julia's hand onto her stomach. \"It is to discuss further treatment and her medical history. Just to get more information. You don't mind?\" He watched as the Margaret placed a soft kiss to her daughters hair before following the doctor out without another word. Julia's mother was outside for quite sometime, David could hear faint talking but he was more focused on Julia than anyone else. He studied her face for several minutes, parts of her hair sitting over her forehead. He looked down her neck, where black residue sat grimly on her skin. His fingers traced down her face, gently brushing hair away, and along her shoulder to her arm. He rested his head back down onto their hands intertwined. Quickly letting himself slip into the darkness of sleep. ","Summary":" David sat in the waiting room for what felt like several days. Never able to get comfortable.

Atte. Belén UN AMOR PARA SIEMPRE \" Didn't we have the best of times when love was young and new couldn't we reach inside and find that world of me and you We'll never lose it again cause once you know what love is you'll never let it end\" (\"Didn't we almost have it all\" –Whitney Houston) Rachel Marron estaba pasando por la etapa más importante de su vida. Era la cantante del momento, la mujer más deseada y una de las más bellas del mundo según múltiples encuestas, su rostro aparecía en la portada de la mayoría de las revistas y al ser una de las artistas más rentables, todos tanto en la industria musical como en la cinematográfica la adoraban como a una diosa. Había logrado a sus treinta años ganar más premios de los que alguna vez soñara. Ya tenía en su colección todos los que con la música podía conseguir, algo que muchos ídolos con mayor trayectoria que ella no habían podido alcanzar y además de ello, la Academia de Artes Cinematográficas le había concedido el premio a la mejor actriz el año anterior, consagrándola así como la superestrella más influyente a nivel mundial. Tenía todo e incluso más de lo que en sus sueños de adolescente deseara. Éxito, fama, millones de fans que la seguían y alentaban en cada proyecto que decidía dar, estaba en la cima de su carrera y bien podía decirse que casi contaba con el universo entero a sus pies. Ella misma con orgullo lo reconocía… y sin embargo se sentía incompleta. La causa la guardaba dentro de su alma y nadie aparte de su exclusivo círculo de allegados con quienes laboraba directamente a diario y Fletcher, su pequeño hijo, quien era lo más lindo que de verdad tenía, la conocían con exactitud. Ni siquiera la prensa siempre pendiente de sus pasos en pro de develar sus secretos. …Se trataba de un amor perdido y genuino. Algo que la había atacado por sorpresa con intensidad para irse luego de manera muy repentina, por lo que ahora reposaba triste en el fondo de su corazón, convirtiéndosele en un martirio interior que intentaba disimular día a día en medio de hermosas sonrisas. Ese dulce tormento, respondía a dos sencillos nombres: Frank Farmer, quien fuese con anterioridad su guardaespaldas. Un año y medio había pasado desde que ganara el Óscar y del penoso incidente que casi terminara con su vida y la de él en pleno escenario. Un año y medio desde que un psicópata obsesionado había intentado asesinarla al igual que a su pobre hermana (1) y de que su inolvidable héroe la salvara, arriesgando todo por ella. Un suceso que le dolía recordar pero del que no podía librarse por mucho que quisiera, ya que al estar siempre en el ojo público no faltaba que algún medio en algún momento se lo terminara sacando a colación, siendo un tema que prefería eludir para no involucrarlo a él en farándula pero que por lo mismo se lo hacía recordar más. \" ¿Dónde estás Frank? ¿Qué será de tu vida?\" Eran preguntas que a menudo cruzaban por su mente mientras se reprochaba a sí misma el no poder olvidar y permitirse ser feliz como con su brillante vida, merecía. Erróneamente había creído en un principio que aquel dolor se disiparía con la velocidad en que giraba el mundo en el que se desenvolvía, debido a lo comprometido de su carrera, más las cosas resultaron al final diferentes y ese amor inesperado había crecido, echando raíces dentro de su corazón. Si bien la añoranza y la tristeza menguaron de intensidad con el pasar de los meses, éstas le solían volver a profundidad cuando veía algo que le recordaba a él, ya fuera una vieja película, un bar suburbano, algún título de un libro de los que había notado tenía en las estanterías de su pequeño departamento de soltero la noche en que durmieran juntos, cualquier cosa relativa a las artes marciales o cuando escuchaba alguna romántica y cursi canción country. Por ello, creativa y audaz como era, aprovechó de dichos sentimientos para transformarlos en inspiración. Casi no hubo noche entonces durante su gira mundial, después de sus multitudinarios conciertos, que no se encerrara en su habitación de hotel a escribir la letra o componer la música para futuras canciones, las mismas que al ver la luz meses más tarde no tardarían en convertirse en rotundos éxitos. Rachel reconocía que había cambiado. De alguna forma y sin darse cuenta, él la había cambiado. Había ido dejando de lado poco a poco su agitada vida fiestera de sus ratos libres para rodearse en lugar de ello de un ambiente de mayor calma, que al final le resultó más provechoso para su salud, tal como él con su sencillez le enseñara. El hombre que extrañamente con su simplicidad había conseguido conquistarla, y al que ni con todos sus caprichos o poder había podido retener a su lado… y no porque no la quisiera también sino porque sus mundos no encajaban. Su imagen de tipo bueno e ideal fresca en su memoria era su motivación para seguir adelante cada día y lo que no le permitía caer en la depresión o drogas, pues ante todo no quería que se decepcionara de ella. Quería ser merecedora de él, que la recordase exitosa y hermosa, como la mujer que en secreto había amado y que en retribución lo amaría por siempre, tal como le decía en su mayor éxito, una canción que en secreto le dedicara. Los rumores y chismes sobre si ambos tenían algo no se habían hecho esperar desde que el penoso ataque durante la premiación sucediera, pues nunca en la historia de la televisión se había visto una demostración de fidelidad tal. Era una prueba de amor gritada a los cuatro vientos que sin embargo ella se había encargado de eludir protegiéndolo, sin dar a conocer su identidad y su paradero, en retribución de lo que hiciera por ella, para evitar que los ecos de su agitado mundo le importunaran en su vida profesional... Donde esperaba le fuera bien. Quizá los dos diferenciaban mucho en cuanto a preferencia de ámbitos y personalidades, no podía dejar de admitirlo, no obstante, también sabía que aun así se atraían como las partes de un todo, como el día a la noche, o el ying al yang, complementándose… y anhelaba por ello que la tuviese presente tal como lo tenía a él, y la recordase con amor. Su Frank así, cada día se transformaba en solo un recuerdo, estando consciente de cuán alejada se encontraba de él, más era un recuerdo que estallaba con la fuerza de una explosión dentro de su pecho al momento de interpretar sus más reconocidos éxitos donde quiera que estuviera, otorgándole el combustible para seguir, donde sin máscaras se revelaba como la mujer apasionada y enamorada que era… tal como ocurrió esa tarde al estar parada en medio del escenario vacío en que por la noche le tocaría presentarse, durante el ensayo final del último concierto de su gira, después de la cual planeaba tomarse un largo descanso. Era una fecha especial pues tal como ella misma se encargara de planearlo, coincidía con su cumpleaños y en su ciudad natal, aparte de que era inicios del verano para aprovechar las vacaciones escolares de Fletcher. No podía ser más genial. Por ello todos suponían que ese día estaba contenta, tal como ella se encargara de aparentar. Sus colaboradores desde muy temprano se habían encargado de que todo fuese perfecto, desde despertarla con una serenata de mariachis debajo de su ventana del hotel, solicitar que le preparasen un pastel de varios pisos por sugerencia de Tony, su más fiel guardaespaldas u organizarle un espectáculo con malabaristas y mimos del Circo del Sol durante el almuerzo, por idea de Sy, su publicista, quien sabía que aquellos shows le encantaban y eso sin contar la gran fiesta que le esperaría ideada por el resto del staff al terminar el concierto. Detalles por los que se encontraba realmente agradecida. Por otra parte además, desde muy temprano no había recibido más que felicitaciones de sus amistades así como de autoridades en la industria de la música, o de la cinematográfica que esperaban su confirmación para tenerla dentro de los elencos de sus próximas películas, sumado esto a los tributos virtuales de sus millones de fans a nivel mundial y de los montones de cartas y obsequios de los locales que ni bien amaneciera empezaran a recibir en el hotel, pues sus entusiastas seguidores parecían a veces conocer más de sus actividades que ella misma. Aquel sinnúmero de muestras afectuosas aparte de exitosa le hacían sentir querida… También contaba con odiadores como es normal, pero a sus críticas prefería no hacerles caso, porque no era del tipo de mujer que se dejara avasallar con facilidad. Por último para terminar de hacer perfecto el día, había recibido la confirmación de su casa disquera de que su disco desde ya había sido elegido como el mejor del año, estando varias de sus canciones como hits en muchos países, y que adicionalmente perfilaba ella como favorita para arrasar en los siguientes premios Grammys. Todos motivos suficientes para colmarle de felicidad y por los cuales se sentía en deuda con la vida, con el cielo, con todos… más sus sonrisas no le provenían del alma, pues la persona que más le hubiese gustado que estuviera allí con ella compartiendo y festejando esos triunfos, se hallaba a kilómetros de distancia, laborando en otra ciudad. Con amor, Rachel se lo imaginaba a Frank como siempre, frío y concentrado, dando lo mejor de sí en su riesgoso trabajo que sin embargo resultaba relativamente más tranquilo en comparación al que tenía al enrolarse en su mundo… Le faltaba poco a esas alturas para terminar el ensayo y poder retirarse a descansar un par de horas (que más bien se le iban a ir en arreglarse) antes de la presentación, por lo que estaba esmerándose en ultimar detalles para que todo saliera perfecto, tal como le gustaba. Bill, su manager, se encontraba en esos momentos al piano en reemplazo momentáneo de un músico local amigo de ella, a quien había invitado para los números finales de esa noche y que estaba por llegar. Bill por cierto, todavía no le había dado ningún obsequio pero con su sola presencia desempeñando en su vida aparte del papel de su representante, el de un padre, era más que suficiente y siempre le estaría agradecida por ello. Él lo sabía. -Y bien, como saben ésta es la canción con la que cierro. En todo momento tienen que brillar luces azules hasta que después de mi pausa, cuando el estribillo tome mayor intensidad, cambien a blancas. ¿De acuerdo?- Se encargó de recordarles a las personas del staff encargadas de la iluminación y el sonido, las cuales de inmediato asintieron. La melodía a manos de Bill, quien aparte de profesional exitoso involucrado en el show business era músico profesional, empezó entonces a sonar con maestría, alentándola a proseguir con su interpretación de cierre, ante lo cual ella volvió sonriente al centro de escenario. …Y fue así como los recuerdos no tardaron de nuevo en aparecer, tal como sabía le sobrevendrían también después en el concierto, poniéndola nostálgica pero por otra parte haciéndole ganar a la vez elogios por la fuerza de su entrega. Punto a su favor, sin que nadie supiera que el secreto de su pasión era imaginar que Frank Farmer estaba allí presente en medio de la multitud asistente, pero no para verla cantar sino simplemente por querer estar con ella, porque era el hombre que la había llegado a conocer mejor que nadie y la quería tal como era en su interior, así como ella a él. Cerró los ojos unos segundos durante el clímax de la canción y lo visualizó en alguna de las cientos de butacas de ese inmenso auditorio oscuro, dedicándole su himno de amor desde lo profundo de su corazón… …Sin contar con que de verdad estaba siendo escuchada. Ni bien terminara, unos solitarios aplausos no se hicieron esperar, sorprendiéndola y haciéndola notar con asombro al mirar a su alrededor que todo su personal incluyendo el de seguridad que se encontraban hacía pocos minutos junto a ella de repente habían desaparecido. Bill era el único que quedaba, por eso lo miró sin entender. - Feliz cumpleaños Rachel - expresó éste con cariño, levantándose para abrazarla al tiempo que se encendían las luces, revelando entonces a aquel que había estado contemplándola por largo rato desde el anonimato y las sombras. Rachel se llevó en una reacción natural las manos a la boca impresionada, en tanto sentía como las lágrimas incontrolables acudían a sus ojos. Frank estaba allí con un gran ramo de girasoles, rosas rojas y velo de novias en la mano y comenzó a encaminarse hacia ella, pero su emoción fue tal que no aguardó a que recorriese todo el camino. Ya había esperado mucho para ello. Así que bajó corriendo las escalinatas del escenario para lanzarse a sus brazos y a sus besos, tal como había hecho durante su despedida, aquel lejano y triste día en un aeropuerto. No hizo falta que Bill explicara más, sus propias palabras confirmaban que había planeado ese encuentro con meses de anticipación, conociéndolo, para que pudiera concordar con sus horarios. Más para esos momentos también se había esfumado con la finalidad de dejarlos solos, sabiendo que ella en compañía de ninguna otra persona estaría más segura y después de otorgarle el mejor regalo que alguna vez le dieran en la vida. Frank y ella permanecieron abrazados largo rato. Rachel aferrada a su pecho, aspirando su varonil aroma que tanto había extrañado y él consolándola y acariciándole la espalda suavemente hasta que por fin en voz queda y emocionada decidió hablarle - Me alegro mucho de volver a verte- -¿Esto es real?- ella preguntó en medio de sollozos – Temo tanto abrir los ojos y darme cuenta que se trata tan solo de otro sueño - - Estoy aquí… contigo - se encargó Frank de corroborarle logrando que apartara la cara del nacimiento de su cuello para mirarlo de frente -Sí lo estás - expresó ella entonces sonriendo y procediendo a acariciarle el rostro, perdiéndose en sus bellos ojos azules que notó ya no llenos de frialdad e indiferencia sino del más puro afecto que alguna vez alguien le profesara, lo cual le hizo sentir, en realidad, la mujer más dichosa del planeta. Los besos en respuesta no se hicieron esperar, los empezó ella o él, o los dos al mismo tiempo, no se dieron cuenta, tan sólo que eran desesperados y estaban cargados de anhelo, así como de júbilo al dar por terminada su molesta separación. -Te advierto Farmer que esta vez no te dejaré ir - no perdió el tiempo de bromearle Rachel con su personalidad mandona ni bien tuviesen que apartarse un poco en busca de aire, a lo que él sin separar su frente de la suya y de manera poco usual dentro de su habitual seriedad, como sólo aquella vez en que se besaran en el jardín de su mansión le viera, le respondió de forma romántica -Pues yo venía a decirte lo mismo…- antes de que pudiera contestar le entregó las flores y luego para su sorpresa, extrayendo de uno de los bolsillos de su bomber unos pasajes de avión, que ella al contarlos rápidamente vio que eran tres, le consultó - ¿Te escaparías conmigo Rachel Marron?- Como demoró asombrada unos instantes en responder, Frank se dio a la tarea de explicarse, no queriendo que tomara como grosera y apresurada su proposición -No me gustaría que lo tomes como algo imprudente, sé que no nos hemos visto en largo tiempo ni nos hemos mantenido en contacto, pero me enteré que me echabas de menos tanto como yo a ti y decidí solicitar mis vacaciones ahora porque sabía terminaba tu gira. ¿Aceptarías que te llevara a ti y a Fletcher lejos de tu ajetreada vida por unos días?, Noruega es un buen lugar- Feliz de que empezara a abrirse con ella con esa soltura que sólo le viera durante su corta estancia en la casa del lago, Rachel le sonrió antes de colocarle los brazos al cuello - Pues no me importaría si fuera por toda la vida - - Mira que te tomaré en serio estas palabras - profirió él agradecido, contento de seguirle el juego. Ella no perdió la oportunidad así de acariciarle dulcemente la mejilla -Me hiciste tanta falta bebé. Todos los días rezaba para que estuvieras bien- -Así como yo por ti, mi malcriada, cabezadura y hermosa Rachel- tomando entonces Frank la iniciativa, la besó con tal intensidad que no hizo falta que le declarara en una frase cuánto la amaba. Esa noche Rachel brindó el concierto más especial de su vida, pues los dos hombres que más amaba se encontraban entre el público, alentándola en primera fila. Su pequeño hijo y su gran amor.

One doctor saids he needs to get into surgery now and we need that bullet out before he dies. So within a couple of hours after surgery and trying to save him a doctor comes out to inform Bill, Tony and Rachel the news and that we will be resting for a few hours. And saids \"he was lucky to come in when he did, the bullet was near his heart and I'm afraid if he was any longer he would be dead on the spot. Rachel then asks \"Can we see him\" The doctor saids \"for a little while and I will ask a nurse if you can have a bed rode so you can get out of those bloody clothes. She saids \"thank you. So after the doctor leaves Rachel asks Bill \"Do you think he's going to make it\"? Bill saids \"Yes he will don't worry. Then they head into Franks room and Rachel stares at him crying and worried. A few minutes later a nurse comes in his room and hands Rachel a robe and saids \"put this on\". Rachel saids thank you and goes into the bathroom and puts it on and then comes out and starts to talk to Frank. She tells him thank you for saving me no one has ever done that for me and I don't know how I could ever repay you. Frank saids quietly still in lots of pain \"you don't need to repay me you already have by standing by me for all of this and not giving up on me. She kisses his hand as we returns to sleep and asks Bill can you stay with him for a while I'm going to go call Sy and see how Fletcher is doing\"? He saids sure thing. While she's down stairs Franks heart rate is rising and Tony goes and gets the doctor and the doctor starts to worry and saids you both need to leave now and then Rachel comes back up and saids \"What's Wrong, What's Happening\". Bill saids we don't know all we know is that his heart beat is rising. The doctors and nurses decide to do an immediate surgery again but on the heart. Then after another surgery they come out and say he will be fine but he needs to stay here until he recovers and I am afraid cannot have any visitors today so why don't you go home and get some rest we will call you if there is another change. Rachel tells him\" I am not going home until I know my bodyguard Frank is ok and well and I am not going to leave him do you understand that I don't care I am not leaving him\". The doctor saids \"well then you are going to have to wait in the waiting room then\". So then she did until the next morning when he woke up and there was no one in his room. He called out to \"Rachel\" but she did not hear him she was passed out in the chair of the waiting room when Bill said \"Rachel he's awake and well and the doctor saids he can have visitors so let's go\". So she ran down the hallway to his room to find him awake and well and even cheerful from the medication they gave him. Frank saids \"Bill told me you were here all night and that you didn't want to leave this hospital without me\"? She saids \"that's true you are the only one I want to protect me and be near me\". Frank saids \"I know and I know you are going to be my personal nurse when we get home and I cannot wait for that. Rachel laughs and saids I will always be ready for that and I will always love you\". He saids I will always love you to\". Then they kiss and then the doctor comes in and saids \"Well I think you can go home as long as someone is willing to watch over you and take care of your needs for a while\". Frank saids \"doc I got it covered do you see my ex client over there she will be the one responsible for me\". The doc laughs and saids ok then you are free to go.

The young chauffeur had just finished peeling out of an alleyway in their limo, leaving behind a thick, angry mob of unsatisfied fans. It was dark, nearing midnight, and rain pounded steadily, audibly, on the windshield. He tried to keep his eyes on the road, a difficult feat with his employer still trembling in the backseat. Rachel felt every bit as frail and weak as she looked, her shoulders and thin arms shaking with each silent sob. Frank, her new bodyguard, could see the wet streaks on her face each time they passed a streetlight. He said nothing. Part of him wanted to yell \" I told you so! \" since he'd tried to stop her from going on stage. But, true to her stubborn ways, she'd blown onto the stage like a storm. And he knew that saying those words would accomplish absolutely nothing. Rachel Marron did what she wanted, when she wanted to do it. He had known that when he accepted this job. Had it not been for that one fan who wanted more, the performance probably would have been fine. The crowd had behaved themselves well for a few minutes, but a young, brazen man had thought he deserved more, jumping onto the stage and trying to dance with her. True to character, Rachel had thought she had it all under control. She still didn't realize the growing power of her own celebrity; in her mind she was still the young girl from the Pittsburgh suburbs who happened to be able to act and sing, taking the leads in community musicals rather than being nominated for Oscars and Grammys. The night's events raced through Rachel's mind over and over. She'd never been so scared, and she never would have believed it could happen. Her own fans, people who supposedly loved her, had caused her to feel afraid. This was new, and she hated it. She sniffled, trying to fight a new wave of tears. The safety she'd felt when Frank had pulled her up into his arms was like none she'd ever known before, and for the first time she'd realized he was more than just an overpriced, stuffy pain in the ass. Frank reached out a steady hand to place it on her arm, then thought better of it, pulling away before she saw. He instead wriggled out of his suit jacket, placing it around her shoulders in the hopes that it would calm her. Her head was still bowed, and she was wiping tears away, trying to hide her weakness. He didn't know what to say. Sure, some of what happened was her fault, but she had no way of knowing how it would end. That they would grab her and pull at her and try to tear her apart. He was lucky he'd even gotten to her in time; the reality is that it could have been much worse. With her headstrong attitude, he couldn't have stopped her any more than he could stop this rain, and yet he felt he'd failed her somehow tonight. He'd gotten there when it mattered, but it never, ever should have come to that. Not with someone so beautiful and so vulnerable. Not with his Rachel. He closed his eyes at that last thought, hating himself for developing an attraction to a client. He had trained and practiced for years to stay aloof and somewhat disinterested, and yet this woman, who in all honestly usually treated him with utter bitchiness, had awoken feelings in him that he hadn't had in years. As the limo slowed in the front circle of the house, Rachel tugged his black jacket tightly around her, wishing she could just disappear. On top of her understandable fear, she was also embarrassed. She hated being proven wrong. And she hated anything that could put even a tiny dent in her brave, devil-may-care facade; tonight had shattered nearly all of that for her. What was left of her? Killing the engine, Henry got out of the car, opening the back door for Rachel and holding out a hand for her to take. As shaken as he was, he was still on the job. \"You can go on in, Henry. I've got her.\" Frank's words were soft, yet left no room for argument. Normally she would protest, snarkily saying something about being able to take care of herself. But everything was different now. She brushed away the last of the tears on her cheek as Frank walked around the back of the car, then took her hand into his. The two looked at each other for a long moment then, her scared, dark eyes questioning his businesslike blue ones. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered almost inaudibly. If Frank only knew how much pride she'd given up just to say those two little words. She grasped his hand and stood up, and he pushed the car door closed with his foot. There was no way he could let on about his feelings toward her: an odd mix of annoyance, fear, and something growing closer to love every day. He saw a side of Rachel that almost nobody got to see. The way she treated her crew like members of her family. The pure love she felt for her son. The way she took every media criticism to heart, her eyes flashing with sadness and hurt before she put her brave face back on. She cared deeply about what others thought. Reading people accurately was a huge part of his job, and yet he was certain she thought that he saw her as only a stubborn, loudmouthed diva. His mind returned to the moment. \"For what?\" He showed no emotion. She didn't, couldn't, answer him. He led her quietly to the front door, his hand still wrapped tightly around hers. Reaching his free hand into his pants pocket, Frank pulled out his keys and then promptly dropped them. She noticed a slight, uncharacteristic shake in his hand as he let go of hers, bending down to retrieve the keys. It crossed her mind that maybe even Frank was human. He was usually unflappable, not cocky per se, but very certain of himself and his abilities. He sighed as he picked up the keys, wondering what he would have done if something had happened to her tonight. The thought was unbearable. He treated her almost with disdain more often than not, but it was only because he couldn't open up to her. It would never work out between them. Maybe if they weren't working together, maybe if there wasn't an overt threat on her life. So many maybes. None of them reality. In their current situation, it simply couldn't happen. Besides, he didn't think she shared his attraction. If she did, she had a damn funny way of showing it. The two walked in silence past the formal living room and kitchen, down the dark hallway to Rachel's bedroom. He opened the door and flipped on a small lamp. She took a few tentative steps into the room, then turned to face him. She was understandably exhausted, but she knew sleep wasn't coming, not with her brain going a million miles a minute. The bed creaked softly as she lowered herself onto it, looking down at her lap. Rachel was a beautiful woman, and she knew it. Hell, she prided herself on it. Years ago, she'd ended up with two dates to her senior prom, and ditched them both to make out with the homecoming king, and that was well before she was even famous. Rich, powerful, sexy men vied for her attention almost constantly, and yet she'd been single for over eight years. There had been a few flings, sure, but she always ended them before it became serious. She didn't like to be tied down, relishing the power and pride of knowing she could string along just about any man she wanted to. Her new bodyguard was one of very few straight men she'd ever met who didn't trip all over himself in her company. He was all business, all the time, and he seemed to be able to see through her bullshit, which somehow simultaneously irritated and intrigued her. Frank crossed the room to a window, pulling the blind closed. He turned back to face her just as she looked up, and she was surprised at the tenderness she saw in his eyes. It was an emotion she'd not yet seen from him; one she hadn't even known he possessed. Rachel looked away. He walked back over to her, pausing beside the bed. She wanted to expand on her earlier apology, but didn't know how. He had to realize how grateful she was, even if she was unable to show it. He had, quite literally, saved her life tonight. Sure, that was his job and had been for a couple of weeks now, but tonight was the first time Rachel had realized just how much she really needed him. She brought her eyes up to again meet his, seeing in a new light how attractive he really was. She'd noticed it in passing, as any woman would, but never gave it much thought. Her sister, Nicki, had brought up the subject more than once, and Rachel had just rolled her eyes, blowing it off like she did with lots of Nicki's comments. It seemed Nicki liked every man who came into the house. Besides, she couldn't date an employee. It would just be awkward. And the man had seemed to have no personality. Until now, anyway. Frank knelt down in front of her. \"Are you going to be okay?\" he whispered, his eyes probing hers for an honest answer. There was a new chemistry between them now, an unspoken bond that happens when you experience trauma with someone. For the first time since she'd known him, he actually seemed to give a shit about what she was going to say. Yet there was nothing she could say. Obviously, life was going to continue. It always did. She miraculously hadn't sustained any injuries, but she felt very far from \"okay.\" She felt like her life, and level of celebrity, was now going to be divided into two parts: what happened before this night, and what happened after it. Unable to move, she just continued to stare at him, watching as his hands eventually moved to the top of her knee-high boot. He unzipped it, pulling it down her leg and off, then looked up at her as if asking for permission to continue. Her breath caught in her throat, a quick, unsolicited wave of desire washing over her. She tried to put it out of her mind, acknowledging how inappropriate it was. Frank didn't know what had made him start undressing her. Only that she looked so helpless, sitting there all slumped over, and that she couldn't sleep in her stage clothes. His heart was pounding as he looked at her, hoping his eyes didn't betray anything. Whether it was in vain or not, he wanted her. But he couldn't let her know. Not now. This was just something that had to be done. A means to an end, so the poor girl could try to get a good night's sleep. Both of his hands reached back up, tugging down the top of her stocking. Rachel swallowed hard, her face flushing as his fingernails gently grazed her thigh while he pulled the nylon down her leg. He was slow and deliberate, and he again searched her eyes for either permission or a protest. She gave neither. Her exhausted mind was spinning in every direction as he pulled the rest of the stocking off her foot, discarding it into the floor, his eyes never leaving hers. She knew thinking of him in a sexual way was wrong, but yet, it somehow felt incredibly right. Her attraction to him was as strong as it was sudden. But she couldn't show him that. She pushed away the thought that he was somehow taking advantage of her in her traumatized state. Not Frank. He had way too much discipline. And yet, here he was undressing her, both of her long legs now bare against the room's chilly air. He paused for a brief moment and she saw his jaw tighten before he brought his hands up to her arms, pulling off one glove, then the other. She closed her eyes and shuddered as a cold chill ran through her, his warm fingers stroking down both of her arms and gently squeezing her hands. She could see raw desire all over his face for a brief second before he turned away, lying the gloves down on top of her boots and stockings. He stood up slowly, pulling his jacket from around her and draping it over the nightstand. Their eyes met; seemingly one last chance for her to put a stop to this, which she knew she probably should, but she didn't want to. Why shouldn't she go to bed with him? The few brief seconds that his hands had been on her were far from unwelcome. Sure, the timing was more than a little bit off, but that couldn't be helped. Her mind briefly flashed on Nicki and her little crush on Frank, but Rachel couldn't help that either. He definitely wouldn't be the first man she'd gone to bed with even though her sister was interested in him. Nicki should know by now that Rachel always gets what Rachel wants. Her heart picked up its pace as he sat down beside her on the bed, not making eye contact with her as he unhooked the front clip of her dress. Sitting there in now just her bra and a skirt, she felt vulnerable; a far cry from the power she usually liked to elude over men. Yet she wanted nothing more than to feel his hands on her, even though in this moment he held all the cards. A few seconds went by in silence, Frank's hands in his lap, his eyes now averted from hers. She breathed in, moving her hands to his shoulders and slipping her fingers underneath his black suspenders, tugging them gently aside and letting them fall. She placed both hands on his chest leaning up to press her lips against his, but he turned away at the last second. Every cell in his body was angry with him as he quickly raised his hands to hers, stopping her progress. He wanted this more than anything, but this isn't how he'd imagined it. He wanted dinner, and flowers, and laughter, and maybe even a little seduction. Some give and take. Something from the playful Rachel she'd shown him in their few moments alone together, when her guard was down and she wasn't playing the bitch role. Not some last-minute quickie because she felt like she owed him something. No, this wasn't the way their first time was going to happen. He met her gaze, any sign of want now completely gone from his expression. He was back to business. Standing up, he nudged her hands off of him. \"Frank? What's wrong?\" The question was so soft, she almost wondered if she'd asked it at all. \"Nothing.\" \"But I - \" \"Not now,\" he interrupted. \"Not like this. Lie down.\" She obeyed; he always had a way of commanding respect even without raising his voice. \"Don't you want to know why I behaved that way?\" He leaned over, pulling the thick white comforter up to her chin, essentially tucking her in. Even with three blankets on her, the bed felt cold. He turned his back to her, flipping off the bedside lamp. \"I know why. Good night, Rachel.\" She couldn't read the emotion in his tone as he slipped out the door, quietly closing it behind him. ","Summary":" \"I've never done that before,\" Henry muttered, wide eyed.

Yo solo me he tomado un tiempito para homenajear esta historia porque me encanta. Un agradecimiento especial a Kala79, que me permitió traducir al español este bello one-shot. Esta historia le pertenece. ¡Gracias a todos por leer! TENGO QUE VERLO \" Después de los eventos ocurridos en los Oscars, Rachel acompaña a Frank al hospital y ambos comparten un honesto e íntimo momento de sinceridad\" Rachel nunca antes había estado tan asustada en toda su vida… Tenía la respiración entrecortada, muy rápida, los latidos de su corazón inestables. Se suponía que esa iba a ser su noche. Ella era la estrella de la gala, punto que se reafirmó cuando escuchó desde el escenario: \" Rachel Marron por Reina de la Noche\" Por un corto momento permaneció estática; era su primer rol protagónico en una película, su primera nominación, su primer Óscar. Ella que ya tenía todos los premios que en la música se pudieran otorgar, ahora a la edad de 29 años, recibía el galardón más importante en el mundo del espectáculo. Ganar un Óscar es un sentimiento que solo pocas personas sabrían como describir, como sus oscarizados colegas actores, los deportistas al batir un récord mundial o los ganadores de lotería. Éxtasis puro y abrumadora alegría, capaz de hacer olvidar los problemas y tragedias de la vida diaria. Eso fue lo que le sucedió a ella. Su hermana había sido asesinada no muchos días antes, su acosador podía matarla en cualquier momento e intuía además que Frank no iba a quedarse por mucho tiempo a su lado, sin embargo se las arregló para olvidar todo en aquel rato de completa felicidad . Pero eso duró sólo un instante porque cuando recibió la estatuilla dorada, levantándola en sus manos en un gesto de victoria, algo inesperado y terrorífico ocurrió. Sintió como si estuviera presenciando una película en cámara lenta. Su guardaespaldas saltó al escenario derribándola en el acto y cuando ella pudo gritarle: - ¡Frank ¿Qué estás haciendo?!- …Escuchó un disparo. Todo después se volvió un caos. Las personas empezaron a gritar, estalló el pánico, Frank estaba todo cubierto de sangre pero aun así le disparó a alguien más. Rachel recordó suplicarle que permaneciera con ella, así como la desesperación que sintió al verle cerrar los ojos y pensar que lo había perdido para siempre. El corto camino al hospital le pareció muy largo. Bill su manager estuvo con ella en todo momento, sosteniéndola en un abrazo, diciéndole palabras calmantes para reconfortarla, en tanto Sy (su publicista), cuidaba de su Óscar y se ocupaba de la prensa. Tony, su otro guardaespaldas también estaba allí, listo para protegerla porque la amaba. Sólo él entre todos, sentía que ella se preocupaba por Frank mucho más de lo que dejaba mostrar. Tony siempre se daba cuenta cuando alguien estaba enamorado de Rachel y cuando ella se enamoraba de alguien . Usualmente se sentía un poco celoso aunque sabía que nunca contaría con la posibilidad de que la mujer de su vida pudiese interesarse en él. No obstante, quería que ella fuera feliz y temía pensar que algún playboy podría llegar un día y romper su corazón. Él percibió los sentimientos entre Frank y Rachel incluso antes de que ellos lo admitieran para sí mismos. Podía sentir de cerca la química entre ambos y supo que allí había algo más profundo que una simple atracción pasajera. Lo que le sorprendió fue el no estar celoso esta vez, porque en realidad quería que Rachel terminara con alguien como Frank… aunque claro en esos momentos ya no estaba seguro si Frank tendría alguna oportunidad con alguien de nuevo puesto que se encontraba en cirugía y ellos esperando con impaciencia los resultados. Rachel permanecía agitada, caminando en círculos por la sala de espera y nadie se atrevía a pedirle que se calmara. Cuando finalmente se sentó, escondió la cara entre las manos y Bill notó que estaba sollozando. El ojo de Tony había sido vendado luego de que le inyectaran analgésicos y el médico le dijera que debía enfrentar una operación dentro de pocos días, ya que era la única manera de salvárselo. Él insistió sin embargo, en ser dado de alta con rapidez luego de ello porque se sentía en la necesidad de estar al lado de Rachel, como entonces. Estaba sosteniendo su mano cuando se abrieron las puertas y la enfermera dijo: - Él estará bien - Para Rachel esas fueron las palabras más dulces y maravillosas que había escuchado jamás. Su cara se iluminó de inmediato, se levantó dándole una amplia sonrisa a la enfermera y como siempre impaciente, se apresuró para conocer los detalles. -¿Él está consciente? ¿Será dado de alta pronto? ¿Cómo está su brazo? ¿Será capaz de moverlo? ¿Le duele mucho? ¿Puedo verlo?- las palabras se catapultaban a través de ella como una ametralladora y Bill no pudo evitar sonreír. -Por favor señora, conserve la calma. La cirugía fue exitosa, removimos la bala y felizmente para el paciente, ésta no afectó ningún órgano vital, aunque va a necesitar fisioterapia para su mano, por supuesto y mucho descanso al menos por unos meses. Podría también presentar algún trauma emocional pero no lo sabemos aún- indicó la enfermera - No, él es Frank Farmer, el tipo más duro del mundo - respondió Rachel orgullosa – No me preocupo en total por eso último. ¡Estoy tan aliviada de que esté bien! ¡Necesito verlo!- -No puede verlo ahora señora, está muy débil- -Pero está consciente, ¿no?- Rachel estaba desesperada - Sí señora, pero supongo que debe estar durmiendo en estos momentos…Por favor regrese mañana durante el día, podrá verlo durante las horas de visita entre la una y tres de la tarde, a menos que sea su esposa o hermana, entonces sí puede venir en cualquier otro momento - La enfermera miró su tono de piel y añadió: - Supongo que usted no es su hermana ni su esposa o yo lo tendría en mis archivos. Su pariente más cercano es su padre y él ya ha sido informado acerca de lo acontecido, vendrá al hospital pronto. Disculpe señora - Rachel estaba a punto de llorar. Ella tenía que verlo antes que nadie más. Tenía que verlo en privado. Quería decirle tantas cosas y debía decírselas ya, antes de enfriarse y regresar a su habitual actitud arrogante. Comenzó a considerar entonces sus opciones. Quizá debía sobornar a alguien. No obstante, antes de que pudiera hacerlo, la enfermera le susurró de forma cuidadosa: - Señora, mi hijo es su mayor fan. Podría usted firmarme un autógrafo para él y yo veré lo que puedo hacer. Imagino que no habrá ningún daño si visita al paciente por un corto momento, pero por favor, recuerde que está muy débil y el doctor preferiría que no tuviese ningún cuadro emocional - Rachel le sonrió. \"¿Frank emocional? \", ellos claramente no lo conocían. Firmó el autógrafo y la enfermera la condujo al cuarto. Por suerte él estaba despierto cuando entró. Conectado a varios cables, muy pálido pero ya lúcido. La enfermera cerró la puerta detrás de ella y Rachel avanzó hacia la cama. Frank la miró durante todo ese tiempo y trató de sonreírle con debilidad. -Rachel… - susurró - Hola Frank - dijo ella de forma alegre, tranquilizadora. Tuvo que poner en marcha sus habilidades de actuación para no quebrarse viéndolo así – La enfermera dijo que estarás bien. Ningún órgano vital fue afectado, solo tu brazo. ¡Hombre, sí que me asustaste! - añadió animada, casi bromeando –Entonces, supongo que fue tu momento de fama, no el mío después de todo, ¿no es así? - tomó asiento a su lado, insegura de por cuanto tiempo podría ser capaz de seguir actuando, cuando sentía un nudo formándosele en la garganta – Bueno, ¡felicidades!. Estarás en las páginas de todas las publicaciones para mañana. Todos están hablando acerca del atractivo héroe que salvó mi vida en los Oscars… porque en realidad eso eres, un héroe - su voz se empezó a quebrar y comenzó a hablar más rápido mientras podía sentir las lágrimas agolpándose dentro de sus ojos, esperando para caer sobre su rostro -¡Demonios, tú me salvaste la vida y eso es más de lo que cualquiera ha hecho por mí…!- Fue lo único que pudo decir antes de que se derramaran incontrolables, mojando sus mejillas y la voz se le volviera un susurro. Frank estuvo mirándola todo el tiempo sin decir una palabra pero entonces tomó su mano entre las suyas y la apretó. Cuando habló, había debilidad, dolor y algo más en su voz que ella no supo descifrar. -Yo no estaba pensando en morir, Rachel, cuando recibí esa bala por ti. Todo lo que quería antes de cerrar mis ojos era estar seguro de haber acabado con ese bastardo para que no te hiriera más y cuando ocurrió, me sentí aliviado… Ya podía morir tranquilo, te protegí y tú estabas sosteniéndome en tus brazos. No puedo imaginar una muerte más hermosa que esa - Rachel lo observó sorprendida. ¿Qué le sucedía? - Nunca antes has estado tan abierto conmigo - dijo mirándolo directo a los ojos – Siempre has sido tan frío y distante. ¿Qué pasó?- quiso saber con curiosidad -Sabes que este capítulo en nuestras vidas ha terminado ¿cierto?, lo ves con tanta claridad como yo. No voy a pretender que eres solo un cliente para mí y que estoy simplemente feliz por haber cumplido mi deber. Estoy feliz de haberte protegido porque…bueno…me preocupo por ti. Mucho. Y sé que sientes algo por mí también… pero esto no va a funcionar, Rachel. Pertenecemos a dos mundos diferentes y yo no podría vivir en el tuyo, porque lo odio- Rachel tenía miedo de respirar y perderse una sola palabra de su diálogo. Parecía como si le hubiesen dado una poción de la verdad en lugar de analgésicos, pero sabía que estaba hablando desde el fondo de su corazón. -Yo…- él continuó – Estoy feliz porque estás viva y al mismo tiempo contento de haber aniquilado a ese bastardo… sabías quien era ¿verdad?- Su voz calmada se endureció un poco al recordar lo de Miami. Rachel se movió entonces más cerca para mirarlo de frente. -Frank, quiero que me escuches con cuidado, por favor. No sé cuánto tiempo nos queda para conversar en privado - comenzó - Es importante para mí explicarte todo…acerca de Portman, allá en Miami- Frank la observaba en silencio, su expresión facial había cambiado, estaba perdiendo la amabilidad . Rachel en cambio estaba ansiosa por contarle la verdad aunque no le agradaba recordar aquello. -Portman era el asesino, ¡maldita sea!, casi duermo con él y la única razón fue para fastidiarte… lo siento Frank… ¿me perdonas?- le pidió arrepentida a la espera de cualquier cosa, más lo que notó en los ojos de él fue una gran sorpresa -¿\"Casi duermes\"?, espera un minuto, ¿no te acostaste con él ?- la esperanza en la voz de Frank fue palpable. Rachel le sonrió con timidez -No, no lo hice. Fuimos a la habitación y cuando él empezó a tocarme y a besar mi cuello…- -Ok, ok, no necesito enterarme de los detalles - Frank le interrumpió tajante y Rachel pudo jurar que había indicios de celos en su proceder. - De cualquier manera, me di cuenta de que estaba yendo demasiado deprisa al querer hacer aquello y le pedí que saliera de la habitación de inmediato - argumentó -¿Y él simplemente estuvo de acuerdo con eso? Ese sería un Portman diferente del que yo conocía- Frank comentó con ironía -No, no lo hizo. Él trató de conseguir lo que quería pero yo fui más rápida. Él se comportó también un tanto brutal conmigo - Rachel sintió la débil mano de Frank apretar la suya con mayor fuerza que antes y vio sus adictivos ojos azules oscurecerse con furia. Recordó entonces asustada lo que la enfermera le había indicado – Pero no te preocupes, logré abrir la puerta y le pedí a Tony que lo sacara a patadas- agregó para calmarlo – Nada sucedió esa noche y es importante para mí que lo sepas- -Él podía haberte… y luego te habría asesinado ¡Maldición!- Frank estaba conmocionado pero Rachel le acarició la mejilla y eso pareció tranquilizarle un poco. -¿Estás bien Frank?- preguntó preocupada – Pareces molesto. La enfermera me dijo que no debía alterarte. Lo siento. Quizá no debí haber venido aquí tan pronto después de la operación y menos aún mencionarte temas tan complicados– las lágrimas empezaron a resbalar una vez más por sus mejillas y la expresión de Frank se suavizó. Sus hermosos ojos azules la contemplaron otra vez. -Estoy bien ahora, Rachel - le dijo – No fue fácil para mí verlos a los dos irse a encerrar en ese dormitorio allá en Miami, por muchas razones. La primera de todas, que no tenía control sobre lo que estaba pasando allí… Él podría haberte asesinado . Yo no tenía idea de que había sido él todo el tiempo pero ahora todo tiene sentido. Portman conocía donde vive mi padre. Segundo, yo estaba enfadado con tu imprudencia y mal comportamiento. Te comportaste allá como si realmente hubieses querido ser asesinada. Y por último… no quería pensar en lo que estaba ocurriendo detrás de esas puertas cerradas. Sabía por qué te habías ido allí con él y supe entonces también… que te había herido y que querías sacarlo, pero…- Frank se interrumpió y Rachel exhaló ligeramente. Había estado conteniendo el aliento durante todo el tiempo pero ahora necesitaba respirar profundo. Estaba impresionada de cuán increíble y brillante él era y de cómo había conseguido ver a través de ella, aunque era cuestión de suponerlo. Frank a esas alturas se había dado cuenta de que actuaba como niña y eso le había llevado a perder algo de su respeto para con ella. Por eso intuía lo que quería decirle, así que terminó por sí misma la frase: -…Pero fui infantil y estúpida portándome así y ahora tú debes haber perdido todo el respeto que tenías por mí- -Bueno, no en total- respondió Frank –aquello me enfadó y me frustró. Fue la primera vez que en realidad pensé en dejarte. No sólo eras tú comportándote de esa manera si no que a mí tampoco me gustaba mi reacción ante eso. Estaba perdiendo mi sangre fría. No actuando como fui entrenado. Siendo incapaz de bloquear estos sentimientos destructibles e inútiles. Estaba celoso… sí, lo estaba y me odié a mí mismo por ello… También a menudo me encontraba observándote rodeada y expuesta a un montón de gente y eso era peligroso… Entiendo por qué te convertiste en una gran estrella, tienes esa atracción que solo pocas mujeres poseen…por eso, ¿ahora entiendes cuán difícil fue todo esto para mí?... Pero el momento crucial fue cuando fuiste de compras con Tony sin decirle a nadie a donde ibas. Nunca había estado tan furioso en mi vida entera, hasta me desquité con un inocente tipo en la cocina del hotel que tuvo la mala suerte de estar en mi camino. Ese fue el punto culminante y decidí marcharme. -Entonces, ¿qué te hizo quedarte?- Rachel preguntó de manera calmada. Tenía un montón de información que procesar. -Tú. Me pediste que te protegiera a ti y a Fletcher… te he visto asustada antes solo una vez, la noche en que el concierto no salió bien…- -Y también me salvaste. Sí, supongo que fue comparable- Rachel agregó - Vi miedo en tus ojos y desesperación. Supe que me tomarías en serio desde allí y no quise dejarte asustada. Jamás me perdonaría a mí mismo si algo te sucediese, pero he decidido ser más cuidadoso esta vez y bloquear mis sentimientos hacia ti por completo - Rachel escuchó atenta. Ella ya estaba al tanto antes, de todo lo que Frank le había hablado… pero necesitaba oírlo de sus propios labios. Sabía que lo estaba volviendo loco, que había sido desconsiderada más de una vez y también se daba cuenta de que él guardaba sentimientos hacia ella, así como ella los tenía por él. Lo sabía ya en Miami, pero fue en aquella ocasión lo suficiente estúpida para actuar de forma infantil con el afán de molestarlo y lo consiguió. Notó eso también más no le satisfizo y en su lugar sintió miedo de perderlo y de ser asesinada encima de eso. Le dijo en el balcón que \" no le iba a suplicar\" pero ahora sabía que lo haría si debía. Estaba desesperada por él, no solo para mantenerlo protegiéndola, también quería que la respetara de nuevo, quería ver otra vez el brillo en sus ojos que tenía en el bar en su primera cita, cuando ambos bailaran escuchando esa música country chistosa. Quería redimirse a sí misma en su mirada. Pudo sentir esos sentimientos no hablados entre ellos en la casa de su padre; supo cuán devastado él estaba cuando perdieron a Nicky, culpándose a sí mismo por eso y por último vio ese brillo y quizá algo más en sus ojos cuando la besó apasionadamente en el jardín. Había tantos sentimientos sin nombres, sin mencionar entre ellos y comprendió que muchos permanecerían así. Estaba sorprendida entonces por el modo en que Frank se había abierto a ella esa noche pero también sabía que había realizado ese esfuerzo por su causa y se encontraba cansado. Él había tomado su decisión. Quería seguir adelante. Continuar con su vida sin llevarla en ella. ¿Cómo iba a soportarlo?, aún conociendo que sería lo mejor… Sus mundos eran muy distintos para que su relación funcionara, pero también sabía que lo extrañaría con el alma, de manera terrible. Rachel cerró sus ojos y le preguntó, manteniendo la calma: -¿Tuviste éxito en eso, Frank?- -No… todavía no, pero sabes que sería…- -Lo sé - le interrumpió ella, inclinándose hacia él y presionando su mejilla bañada en lágrimas contra la suya y así permanecieron por un largo rato, en completo silencio. Silencio que fue roto por la enfermera que interrumpió la intimidad. - Señora, me temo que debe irse ahora. El paciente está más pálido de lo que estaba antes y aún se encuentra muy débil- Rachel de mala gana se levantó y miró a Frank. Él la estaba mirando también como queriendo decirle \" Quédate \" pero no dijo una palabra, solo cerró sus ojos cuando ella se agachó y lo besó en los labios. - Quizá nos encontremos de nuevo Frank Farmer. De seguro en una vida futura… aunque presiento que podría ser en ésta también- Le vio entonces sonreírle con la dulce, amable y genuina sonrisa que no le había visto en largo tiempo, la cual extrañaría durante muchos por venir, como sospechaba… FIN ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER: Los personajes de la película \"El Guardaespaldas\" no me pertenecen.

Belén EN LA OSCURIDAD DEL JARDÍN DE RACHEL MARRON \" Después de la muerte de la hermana de Rachel, la tensión entre la cantante y su guardaespaldas es cada vez más palpable\" Frank necesitaba un poco de tranquilidad después de todo lo sucedido . Eran alrededor de las diez de la noche y no podía parar de pensar en los eventos de los últimos días. Le resultaba casi increíble cuanto podía cambiar en tan corto tiempo. Cinco días antes Rachel y él se encontraban en un lugar completamente distinto, alejados de la imponente mansión y de su dormitorio dorado; en la apacible casa de su padre, que se silenciaba con parcialidad debido a su vigilancia. Estaban en el fin del mundo y como era de esperarse, su padre nunca había escuchado hablar de una superestrella de la talla de Rachel Marron. ¿Qué podía salir mal? La llevó allí porque sentía que ambos necesitaban un descanso. Un descanso del constante miedo, del peligro, de los fans locos-obsesivos y de la atmósfera nerviosa que imperaba en la ajetreada y ruidosa casa de ella. Sin embargo, lo que ocurrió en el lago después, siempre lo recordaría como su más grande falla, mayor incluso que su fracaso al proteger al ex presidente Reagan del intento de asesinato. Frank estaba sentado en el césped cerca de la piscina, en el jardín de Rachel, mirando al frente, a nada en particular y exhaló un profundo suspiro. Había fallado. No había protegido a la familia de Rachel como debía y el resultado del viaje había sido desastroso. Nicky, la hermana de Rachel, había sido disparada por un desconocido e inteligente sicario, que la confundiera con la propia Rachel. La amenaza aún seguía allí afuera y el asesino conocía a esas alturas (como Frank lo adivinaba), que se había equivocado de persona. Ahora Frank había perdido la confianza de Rachel al igual que su fe en él y para ser honestos, había perdido algo de su propia confianza también. Su mejilla todavía le dolía de la bofetada que recibiera por parte de ella más temprano, no obstante, no la culpaba porque sabía que estaba enojada con él, así como dolida y triste por la pérdida de su hermana. Rachel era muy sensible y la muerte de su hermana no era algo que iba a superar pronto. Frank, la estaba evitando desde que todo sucediera, evitando tanto como podía, dado el hecho de que aún era su guardaespaldas y debía protegerla. Rachel nunca descubriría que había sido la misma Nicky, quien contratara al asesino. No iba a decírselo sabiendo lo doloroso que le resultaría conocerlo. Él sería la única persona en el mundo que sabría que el odio y los celos de Nicky, la habían puesto en su propia tumba. El guardaespaldas recordó con dolor las palabras que Rachel le dijera esa misma noche: -¡Tú, tú, tú…tú trajiste el dolor a mi casa!... ¡Y ahora estás aquí! ¿Dónde estabas entonces? ¿Por qué no la salvaste? ¡Era tu trabajo protegerme y ella murió haciéndolo…Era yo, ellos después y tú dejaste que la asesinaran!... Ella nunca le hizo nada a nadie…- Rachel le golpeó y le gritó pero él no trató de defenderse. Tomó la ira y frustración de ella para sí mismo. El dolor físico era preferible a lo que sentía por dentro. Lo que Rachel le había dicho… era tan solo en parte correcto, más la otra parte era verdad. Le había fallado no solo a su cliente sino también a la mujer que amaba. No pudo responderle y su silencio la hizo enojar más, hasta que finalmente paró de golpearlo y empezó a llorar. Terminando por sentarse en las escaleras. - Siento que no la amé lo suficiente…- susurró Frank quiso tomarla entre sus brazos y abrazarla, quiso decirle que todo estaría bien, que nunca le fallaría de nuevo, que la amaba, aun cuando estaba enojada con él… pero no le dijo nada por no estar seguro de si a ella le agradaría. Solo la miró por largo rato hasta que decidió continuar subiendo la escalera. Desde entonces no había podido enfocarse en nada, aunque pensó que tal vez un poco de aire fresco le ayudaría. Por eso se encontraba en esos momentos, sentado afuera bajo la luna de la luna, en una pequeña colina del jardín. De repente escuchó un débil sonido… .y no tuvo que voltear a ver para saber quién era. Podía reconocer sus pasos en cualquier lugar del mundo. -¿Te importa si me siento?- Rachel preguntó. El movió la cabeza. Ella trató de sonar casual, como si nada hubiese ocurrido. -¿No ha terminado aún, no es así? ¿Él vendrá de nuevo?- parecía muy serena entonces. -Puede ser- respondió él con tranquilidad -¿En los Óscars? - Ella inquirió un tanto asustada -Quizás- Rachel lo miró y notó que él estaba extremadamente triste. Era cierto que ella había perdido a su hermana, no obstante para Frank, aquello era igual de terrible. Sabía que le había fallado y eso le había llevado a perder algo de confianza en sí mismo. Finalmente, se dio cuenta de que sus palabras dichas en la escalera también le habían herido muy fuerte, por lo que enseguida quiso retractarse, decirle algo, cualquier cosa, sin embargo no era del todo buena para pedir disculpas. No lo culpaba en realidad por lo sucedido. ¿Quién habría esperado que el asesino la encontrara allá, en aquel paraje alejado?... Pero sabía que él todavía se culpaba a sí mismo por ello. Así que intentando aligerar el ambiente, comenzó a contarle una historia: -Sabes, cuando estaba en la secundaria, aposté con mis amigos cincuenta dólares a que algún día ganaría un Óscar. ¿Entiendes cuán importante es que ellos me vean arriba en el escenario si gano? Si les cobrara a cada uno de esos tacaños, podría ganar un montón de dinero- Rachel le sonrió, recibiendo de parte Frank una débil y extenuada sonrisa, que la hizo sentir aliviada. -Aun así pienso que es peligroso - replicó él calmadamente -No he conseguido este lugar en mi vida siendo siempre lo más prudente posible. ¿Qué hay de ti Frank Farmer? ¿Nunca te has salido del margen? ¿Acaso alguna vez no has hecho algo que no tuviera mucho sentido, solo porque lo sintieran en ti, en tu estómago?- Rachel inquirió mirándole a los ojos. Los suyos nunca habían brillado con tanta intensidad. Frank hipnotizado solo asintió en respuesta. Ella entonces continuó - Sé que lo has hecho porque nadie consigue ser lo suficiente bueno sin ello… y tú lo eres- El guardaespaldas sintió una mezcla de emociones. Todavía estaba triste y devastado por la tragedia ocurrida pocos días atrás pero permaneció estático, escuchando el raro cumplido, agradeciendo que ella no pensara que la había decepcionado al fin de cuentas y encima de todo, sentía un deseo secreto de tomarla en sus brazos y besarla de forma apasionada. Rachel se movió peligrosamente cerca de él, embriagándolo con su perfume. Desde la única noche en que habían pasado juntos, a menudo quería volver a hacerle el amor. El cuerpo de Rachel estaba casi tocando el suyo y tuvo que dejar de mirarla. Tragó en seco nervioso. Ese sentimiento en su estómago casi lo asustaba aunque también lo encontraba increíblemente fascinante. Sabía que era amor. Algo que nunca había sentido con tanta profundidad como entonces. Rachel podía hacer lo que quisiera con él... Sin embargo, estaba consciente de que ella no lo sabía y era feliz con eso. Él siempre era bueno escondiendo sus sentimientos. -Mira, no sé por qué me está sucediendo todo esto…- Rachel continuó, acercándose a su rostro -…pero sé que no es tu culpa… Espero que lo entiendas porque esta es mi manera de decir lo siento- Frank aún estaba evitando su mirada aunque podía sentirla contemplándolo con intensidad. Tenía miedo que en ese mágico brillo de la luna, Rachel leyese todo lo que sentía por ella y descubriera la verdad… que estaba total y profundamente enamorado suyo. Lo que no quería que supiera porque lo hacía sentir débil y en parte porque no estaba seguro tampoco si los sentimientos de ella eran tan fuertes como los suyos, aunque sospechaba que podía amarlo también. - Entonces…voy a ir a los Óscars a ver si gano y no me preocuparé en absoluto porque sé que vas a estar ahí y me protegerás ¿Cierto?- Rachel añadió, sus labios estaban muy cerca de los suyos. Frank levantó entonces sus ojos azules llenos de debilidad por todo lo que sentía. Le sonrió un poco y susurró - Cierto - Cuando las miradas de ambos por fin se encontraron, los dos sintieron un choque de electricidad. Fue un momento excepcional que supieron no sería eterno. Más en ese hermoso jardín, bajo los románticos rayos de luna, con tal tranquilidad rodeándolos, Frank casi llegó a creer que sí podía durar para siempre. Pero no podía ser. Ambos sabían que esa noche podía ser su última oportunidad para pasar algún tiempo juntos como amantes. Al día siguiente, con probabilidad todo cambiaría (e incluso uno de ellos podía ser asesinado)… No obstante, esa noche era de romántica perfección. Los dos compartieron esos pensamientos mientras se perdían cada uno en la mirada del otro. La tentación la reclamó a ella tanto como a Frank, que era más fuerte, y él ya no trató de luchar más contra eso. La atrajo hacia sí y la besó apasionadamente. Ella le correspondió y ambos quedaron atrapados en ese momento perfecto. Ese beso no fue como los que habían compartido en casa de él, la vez de su cita. Desesperados, salvajes, hambrientos, llenos de deseo. En esta ocasión fue diferente. Suave, delicado, muy tierno y lleno de cariño. Frank ansiaba hacerle el amor pero no quería echar a perder el momento. Quería mostrarle a Rachel que podía confiar en él, que estaba allí para ella y que la cuidaría por sobre todas las cosas y no solo como su guardaespaldas. Quería decirle tantas cosas mientras la recostaba en el suelo y colocaba su cuerpo encima del suyo más supo que no necesitaba palabras. Algunos cosas son inútiles de expresar cuando es mejor sentirlas. Fue un beso muy largo y profundo y cuando finalmente se separaron para recuperar el aliento, Frank notó que ella tenía lágrimas en los ojos. Aquello le conmovió a profundidad tanto como le preocupó. -¿Qué sucede?- le susurró al oído Rachel se enjugó las lágrimas y le sonrió con suavidad. Era en extremo hermosa, lo que le hacía a Frank rendirse y le dejaba sin palabras. Sabía desde ya que esa mujer tendría su corazón por siempre, a pesar de que tenían pocas oportunidades de un futuro juntos. Él nunca había amado tanto ni amaría a nadie como a aquella terca y arrogante cantante y estrella de cine, que era también por dentro débil, frágil e innegablemente sexy entre sus brazos, como entonces. - Desearía que esto durara para siempre, Frank- Rachel susurró mirándolo a los ojos y supo que él también anhelaba lo mismo. Vaciló entonces por un instante pero sabía que era quizás su última oportunidad para decirle la verdad, así que no lo pensó dos veces. -Te amo Frank- Era eso. Tres simples palabras dichas en voz baja en la oscuridad que le hicieron a él estremecerse y le llenaron los ojos de lágrimas. Ella lo vio y entendió por fin lo que sentía por ella. Más no necesitó que le confesara que le pasaba lo mismo porque sabía que no podía. En efecto, Frank en esos momentos era incapaz de hablar, su corazón latía a velocidad como nunca antes en su vida. Rachel lo amaba. El guardaespaldas acarició con ternura la mejilla de su protegida, secándole las lágrimas y le dio entonces otro apasionado, intenso y dulce beso, que le hablaba de todo lo que necesitaba saber acerca de su amor por ella.

It's of course another BSB song \"Lose It All\". I think the story is ok, could have been more. It was just another charity function that Whitney and Kevin were attending. Everyone in the ball room was having a nice time laughing, dancing, and drinking. Whitney's date for the night was her cousin Dionne and Kevin had brought his current girlfriend with him to the function. Kevin thought it was going to just be another charity event, nothing out of the ordinary until he saw her. It had been a few months since they had last gotten together, he didn't know that she was invited. It was perfect, tonight was to be the night that they would come together once again. Whitney was sitting at a table surrounded all eyes on her, Kevin wanted to be one of those people who were in awe of her presence. Just to be close to her was the only thing he wanted to do. But CB was right there by his side like always. Whitney looked perfect he thought to himself, just then CB pulled him in her direction that she was starting to walk in. She was in need of a glass of champagne and wanted to mingle with everyone who was anyone in that room. She had a purpose that night and she was going to make it known what it was. Kevin tried to break away but it was difficult for him. It wasn't until thirty minutes later when Whitney was told that Kevin was in the building. She and Dionne thought it would be nice to go and say hi and catch up a little. Whitney knew everything that was going on with him though, so she thought. \"Well hey stranger\" She said walking up to him. He and CB had their backs turned until Kevin heard a familiar voice, he wondered how long it would take her to come over \"Whitney\" he said giving her a hug, Kevin wanted to embrace her and kiss her but he couldn't, not in a room full of people who loved to gossip. \"Long time no see! Dionne getting more beautiful every day I see\" \"Hello to you too Kevin\" Dionne said blushing then giving a hug to Kevin \"Who do we have here?\" Whitney asked Kevin while looking at CB, Whitney knew full well who she was but they had never been introduced. \"Oh I'm sorry, this is CB my girlfriend, CB this of course is my dear friends\" \"They don't need an introduction Kevin I know who they are. It's nice to meet you two finally, Kevin has told me so much about you guys\" \"Well did he now\" Dionne asked the young girl and she looked back at Whitney. CB was young too young for Kevin. She must be good at filling up his time when Whitney can't be there. Whitney thought she was an easy lay and that must have been the reason why Kevin kept her around for so long. \"He sure does\" CB said back to Dionne and Whitney \"Well Kevin why haven't we met her sooner?\" \"Well I…\" he started to say, he knew he was being put in a rough spot. His official girlfriend and his unofficial girlfriend were meeting for the first time, that is not what he wanted to happen. If he had known Whitney would be here CB would be elsewhere tonight. \"We've been pretty busy lately planning everything\" CB said \"Planning? Planning what exactly?\" Whitney asked. Kevin couldn't believe what happened next. \"Were engaged! Isn't it gorgeous?\" CB said as she thrust her left hand into Whitney and Dionne's face Dionne looked at the rock on the girl's hand and she turned her head slightly to see what Whitney's facial expression would be. Whitney felt sick to her stomach, Kevin watched her face change in a matter of seconds. This was the worst night ever. \"It's lovely Dionne said\" trying to pick up where the conversation had left off since Kevin and Whitney were not saying anything. \"I love him so much\" CB said as she pulled Kevin in for kiss. Whitney felt herself getting angry and jealous. Then she had to see her kiss Kevin, that almost pushed her over the edge. She had to refrain herself for taking the young \"child\" outside and whipping her ass. \"Wow well congratulations\" was all she could muster up and left without another word. Dionne follow Whitney out of the ball room and into one of the private rooms next door. Kevin knew she was mad because he stared at her the whole time. This was not how he wanted her to find out.. \"CB I thought I told you not to say anything to anyone about our engagment just yet.\" he said to her a little angry \"Why not? I want the world to know that we are getting married.\" she said eyeing her ring A few minutes later Kevin left his fiance in search for Whitney. Dionne was already back in the ball room without with out her. He spotted her and she pointed him into the right direction to find Whitney. \"I know she is mad\" he told Dionne before heading off \"Ya think\" \"I know D, but I need to talk to her \" he said then made his way to the private room. TAKE WHAT YOU NEED, CAUSE I CAN'T HOLD MY BREATH SAY WHAT YOU FEEL, CAUSE I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT When he got there Whitney was standing in the corner looking beautiful as can be, but sadness was written all over her face . Kevin closed the door and walked towards her. \"I should have known that this would eventually happen\" she said more to herself than to him \"I am sorry about that, this isn't the way I wanted you to find out.\" he said standing in front of her. She didn't say anything directly to him yet. \"I want to explain\" he said \"You don't have to\" she cut him off \"I'm sorry Whitney\" \"So am I\" \"Why are you sorry?\" \"Why are you? You didn't need my approval?\" \"No because I wanted to tell you myself. What are you feeling right now?\" Kevin said to her to feel her out \"How do you expect me to feel? My lover is getting married Woo Hoo!\" she rolled her eyes and walked away from him to sit down on a chair \"Then your not ok about it\" he told her going over \"Why do you want to get married to her so quickly?\" \"Well for starters I am not getting any younger and I need someone in my life\" \"And what am I to you?\" \"My true love\" he said \"So why are you getting married to someone else if I am your true love?\" \"Because you and I are never going to happen. We are never going to be together, and as much as it kills me I have to move on\" he said to her, it hit home for both of them. Kevin never expected that to come from his mouth. It stung her deeply I MADE A PROMISE TO MYSELF LAST NIGHT. I'M GONNA KEEP IT IF IT'S WRONG OR RIGHT \"I always promised myself that if this was to ever happen…\" she couldn't speak \"What did you promise yourself?\" he asked \"Not to let it upset me, or be mad at you\" she was looking at him \"But I can't help it\" \"What did you expect me to do Whitney? I can't wait forever for you to leave him, I've been waiting for you even before you got married. Now you know how I felt when you did\" he said \"So this is to spite me? Your getting back at me for what I did over ten years ago\" she asked getting angrier \"No that is not it, you know I would never intentionally hurt you! The way you are feeling right now is the way I felt when you said I do. Whitney I love you with all my heart but I need to move on. We need to move on with our lives\" AND IF I LOSE IT ALL THERE BE NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE AND I WOULD TAKE THE FALL. CAUSE KNOWING YOU ARE OUT THERE BREATHING IT'S SO WONDERFUL. IT'S A CHANCE I TAKE EVEN IF I BREAK IT I LOSE IT ALL. IF I LOSE IT ALL, WOULDN'T MATTER ANYWAY \"So that's it for us? Were breaking up?\" she asked him He didn't want to tell her no and he dreaded telling her yes. \"I still want you in my life\" he answered \"I refuse to share you with another woman!\" \"I had to share you with another man, which you can't even call him that because he is not here\" \"Leave him out of it please, this is about you and I\" \"You are married yourself so why are you jumping on my case\" Tears were falling out of her eyes as she wiped them away \"Because I don't want to lose you Kevin! Everything in my life is falling apart, my dad passed not long ago, Robyn isn't here anymore, and now you want to leave me too. Why is everyone that I love leaving me?\" It pained Kevin to see her cry, especially if it was about something he did. Kevin and Whitney loved each other dearly but they couldn't hold on to each other forever not like that. He begged her so many times to come with him but she refused. \"I'm sorry that I can't change that, but I can and will always be there for you\" Kevin was on his knees telling her this, he held her hands as tight as he could DON'T CHANGE A THING PERFECT AS YOU ARE. TIME HAS A WAY, TIME IS ALL I'VE GOT. IF MY HEART SHOULD SHATTER WATCHING YOU. THERE'D BE ONE LESS THING I'D HAVE TO DO Whitney had composed herself, and think about Kevin's feelings. It was hurting him more than she ever knew. \"I'm sorry for acting like this\" she said to him \"No baby I understand\" \"Kevin\" \"Yes?\" \"It may not seem like it now, but one day I will be able to say that I am happy for you. I hope she will bring you lot's of joy and treat you the way you are supposed to be treated. I hope she will treat you better than me.\" \"No one will ever take your place in my heart I promise\" he said \"Mines as well. So I guess this is it huh?\" \"I guess so\" \"I'll Always Love You\" \"And I Will Never Stop Loving You!\" he went in for a hug and she embraced him. They stayed stuck in the moment and finally broke apart when they heard a few people passing by in the hall. \"We should probably get out of here, I'm sure your fiancé is looking for you\" \"Maybe\" \"Bye Kevin\" Whitney made her exit out of the door \"Goodbye Whitney\" his eyes had finally started glistening. He held it all in to be strong for Whitney. Kevin was hurting for her, hurting by the decision he had made. But he made it for the best and now there was no going back on his commitment to his future wife. AND IF I LOSE IT ALL THERE BE NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE AND I WOULD TAKE THE FALL. CAUSE KNOWING YOU ARE OUT THERE BREATHING IT'S SO WONDERFUL. IT'S A CHANCE I TAKE EVEN IF I BREAK IT I LOSE IT ALL. IF I LOSE IT ALL When Kevin got back to the ball room his eyes scanned the room looking for his love. Not long after CB appeared behind him. \"Kevin honey, where were you?\" \"I'm sorry I went to the rest room and then ran into a couple of producers I worked with. We chatted for a little bit\" he said still scanning the room \"What are you looking for?\" \"No one, just noticing that some more people have arrived\" \"Do you want me to go get you something to drink?\" \"Yes please\" after CB left Kevin went walking through the crowd looking for Whitney. She had to be around there some where. He searched that whole room and still didn't see her. He noticed a lady that was sitting at her table and walked up to her. \"Excuse me miss is Whitney Houston still here\" Kevin asked waiting for the right answer \"No you just missed her, she left like not even five minutes ago. Said she wasn't feeling well and call it a night\" \"Oh alright thank you\" Kevin walked away, he definitely needed a drink. Much later into the night Kevin stepped out of an elevator onto the 15th floor. he had a little too much to drink and was stumbling every so often. When he found the room he was looking for he didn't knock, banged on the door. \"Whitney!, Whitney open the door\" he kept banging until some one answered \"What the hell, Kevin! OMG what are you doing here and at this time of night?\" \"I need to see Whitney!\" he said to Dionne \"She isn't here Kevin\" \"Where is she\" \"Kevin come inside, you look like your fixing to fall over\" \" I need to see her and tell her I'm sorry. I need to fix this\" \"Kevin lay down on this couch and let me school you a little bit. Come on just lay there\" Kevin put his head on the pillow and tried to listen to Dionne. Dionne gave Kevin some great advice, but he ended up falling asleep on her. So she left him there. The next morning she woke him up and drove him back to his home. \"You think I made a mistake?\" Kevin asked Dionne while they sat in the car just outside of the gates around his house. \"Do you think you made a mistake?\" she flip the question onto him \"I don't know D, I love CB, but I am In Love with Whitney. But we both know that I won't ever get to have her like that.\" \"So what do you want to do?\" \"I don't want to break anyone's heart\" \"A little too late for that\" \"Maybe I should call her\" \"No don't call her right now, give her some time and I garuntee she will contact you first trust me\" \"The moment she asks you to get in touch with me, do it\" \"You know I will\" \"Thanks Dionne for everything you have done for us\" \"Your welcome, I love you guys.\" Kevin got out of the car and walked up the long drive way to his front door. CB car wasn't there so he had the house to himself. He dreaded being alone now because Whitney would be the only person he would think of. He was desperate though and wanted to hear her voice, he needed to hear her. Make sure she was ok, that they were ok. Maybe he was fooling himself with this whole marriage thibg because that was the last thing on his mind. Until CB started pressuring him, and he finally caved in.

I hope you'll like the story. This time no proofreader...hope no terrible mistakes...well, this is sort of a pre-quel to my story Bodyguard - what happened later. Have a nice read! Rachel has never been scared like this in her life before... Her breath was very shallow, quick, the rhytm of her heartbeat very unsteady. It was supposed to be her night. She was the star of the evening, right to the point when she heard from the stage: ' Rachel Marron for Queen of the Night! '. For a short moment she was ecstatic; her first movie role, her first nomination, her first Oscar. She has had all the possible music awards already and now, at the age of 29, she received the most important one in the whole show-business. Winning an Oscar is a feeling that only few people know how to describe – like her fellow Oscar-winning colleaques, sportsmen beating a world record or lottery winners. Pure ecstasy and overwhelming joy lets you forget about all the problems and tragedies of an everyday life. That's what happened with Rachel. Her sister was killed not that long ago, her stalker could kill her any minute, she had a feeling that Frank will not be with her for long now– yet she managed to forget all about that just now, in this moment of complete hapiness . But it was indeed a brief moment – when she grabbed the golden statuette, raised her hands in a victory gesture, something very unexpected and terryfying happened. She felt like watching a movie in slow motion. Her bodyguard jumped at the stage, made her fall on the floor and just when she managed to shout: 'Frank, what are you doing?!' she heard a gunshot. Everything after that was a blurr – people were screaming, panic arose, Frank was all covered in blood and he shot someone. She remembered begging her bodyguard to stay with her and her despair when he closed his eyes and she thought she'd lost him forever. Short way to the hospital seemed very long to her. Bill was holding her in his embrace, telling soothing words of comfort, while Sy took care of her Oscar and the press. Tony was there too, always ready to protect the woman he loved. Only him of all of them felt that Rachel cared for Frank much more than she let show. Tony always knew when someone was in love with Rachel and when she was in love with someone. He usually felt a little jealous, even though he never really counted on a possibility that the woman of his life could be interested in him. Instead, he wanted her to be happy and was scared to think that some playboy may break her heart one day. He saw the feeling between Frank and Rachel even before they had admitted it themeselves . He could nearly feel their chemistry with each other . He knew it's something much more profound than simple crush. What surprised him, though, is that he didn't feel any jealousy this time. He actually wanted Rachel to end up with someone like Frank. But right now it was not sure whether Frank will ever have a chance with anyone ever again. He was in surgery and Rachel, Frank and Tony were impatiently awaiting results. Rachel was very agitated – she kept walking in circles in the waiting room and nobody dared to ask her to calm down. She finally sat, her face in her hands and Bill noticed that she was sobbing. Tony's eye was already bandaged, painkillers injected and he was told that he will face the operation in few days because only this can save his eye. He insisted on being immediately released though – he felt like he really needed to be with Rachel right now. He was holding her hand when the doors opened and the nurse said: - He will be fine. This were the sweetest, most wonderful words that Rachel has ever heard in her life. Her face lit up immediately, she got up and gave the nurse a broad smile. Always impatient, she had to know all the details immediately. - I s he conscious? Will he be released soon? What about his arm? Will he be able to move it? Is he in a lot of pain? Can I see him? - the words were catapulting from her like from the machine gun and Bill couldn't help but smile. - Please, madame, calm down. His surgery was succesful. We've removed the bullet and luckily for him it didn't demage any major organ. He will need a physiotherapy for his hand for sure and a lot of rest – at least for few months. He might also have some emotional trauma, we don't know that yet – said the nurse. - No, it's Frank Farmer, the toughest man in the world – said Rachel proudly – I'm not worried about this last thing. I'm so relieved that he is alright. I need to see him. - You can't see him now, madame. He is too weak. - But he is conscious, yes? - Rachel was really desperate. - Yes, madame, but I guess he is sleeping now...Please come back tomorrow, during the day, you can visit him during visiting hours, between 1pm and 3pm, unless you are his wife or sister, than you can come some other time... She looked at her skin tone and said: - I guess you are not his sister, nor his wife as I would have it in his files. His next of kin is his father and he has been informed about what happened. He is coming to the hospital shortly. Sorry, madame. Rachel was close to tears. She had to see him before anyone else . She had to see him in private . She wanted to tell him so many things and she wanted to tell it now, before she cools down and be back to her normal, arrogant self. She was considering her options – maybe she should bribe someone? Before she was able to do that, though, the nurse whispered carefully: - Madame, my son is your biggest fan. Would you sign an autograph for him and I would see what I can do? I guess there is no harm in you visiting him for a short while. But please remember he is very weak and doctor would rather not see him emotional. Rachel smiled at her. Frank emotional? They've clearly never met. She signed the autograph and the nurse walked her to Frank's room. Luckily he was on his own in his room, attached to all the cables, very pale, but already conscious. The nurse closed the doors behind her and Rachel walked toward Frank's bed. He was looking at her all the time and tried to smile weakly. - Rachel... - he whispered. - Hi Frank – her voice was very cheerful, soothing. She has put her acting skills in motion so she wouldn't break down seeing him like this. - So the nurse says you'll be alright. No major organs damaged, just your arm. Man, you've scared me – her voice was still very cheerful, nearly jokingly kind – So I guess that was your moment of fame, not mine after all, right? - She was sitting by his side now, but very unsure how long she will be able to act this way as she could feel the lump forming in her throat already – Well, congratulations. You are on front pages of all the magazines in this country tomorrow. Everyone is talking about the hero, who saved my life at the Oscars and you are a real hero – her voice started to crack, so she started to speak really fast right now. She could feel tears just waiting to fall down her face. - Damn, you've saved my life and it's more than anyone has ever done for me... - that was all she could say as tears were falling uncontrollably down her face, her voice was barely a whisper. Frank was watching her this whole time, but didn't say a word. Now, though, he took her hand in his and squeezed it. When he spoke, there was a weakness, pain and something else in his voice, what Rachel couldn't really decipher. - I wasn't thinking about dying, Rachel, when I took this bullet for you. All I wanted to be sure of, before I closed my eyes, is that this bastard is shot dead and will not hurt you anymore. When it happened, I was relieved – I really could die then. I protected you and you were holding me in you arms. I cannot imagine more beautiful death than that. Rachel looked at him with surprise – what's happened to him? - You've never been that open with me before - she said, looking him straight in his eyes. - You've always been so distant, cold. What happened? - she asked with curiosity. - Y ou know that this chapter in our lives has ended, right? You see that as clearly as I do. I'm not going to pretend that you are just a client to me and I'm simply happy I fulfilled my duty. I am happy that I've protected you because...well...I care about you. A lot. And I know that you feel something to me, too. But it's not gonna work, Rachel. We belong to two different worlds and I couldn't live in yours, I hate it . - Rachel was afraid to breath as she didn't want to lose a single word of his speech. They must have given him some truth elixir instead of painkillers. But she knew he was speaking from the bottom of his heart. - So ... he continued - I am happy that you are alive and at the same time happy I've killed that bastard...you know who that was, right? - his soothing voice hardened slightly as he thought about what happened in Miami. Rachel moved closer to him and looked in his eyes. - Frank, I want you to listen to me really carefully, please. I don't know how much time we've got in private. It's important for me to explain everything to you...about Portman, there, in Miami. Frank was looking at her in silence. His facial expression has changed. It was now less welcoming. Rachel was anxious to tell him the truth. She didn't like to go back to these moments. - P ortman was my near-assasin. Damn it! I've almost slept with him and clearly the only reason for it was to upset you...I'm so sorry, Frank! Will you forgive me? - she looked at him expecting everything but what she saw: a huge shock in his eyes. - 'Almost slept'? Wait a minute, you didn't sleep with him? - the hope in his voice was palpable. Rachel smiled at him shyly. - No, I didn't. We went to the room and when he started to touch me and kiss my neck... - Ok, ok, I really don't need to know all the details – Frank interrupted her harshly and Rachel could swear she could hear a hint of jealousy in his voice. - Anyway, I realised what I'm doing soon enough and asked him to leave the room immediately. - Did he simply agree to do this? That would be a totally different Portman than the one I knew – said Frank ironically. - No, he didn't. He realy tried to get what he wanted, but I was faster. He was kind of brutal with me – Rachel could feel Frank's weak hand squeezing hers with more strenght than before. His addictive blue eyes darkened with fury. Rachel got scared because she remembered of what the nurse said to her. - Don't worry, I managed to open the doors and ask Tony to kick him out. Nothing happened between us and it's important for me that you know that. - He would f...you and then he would kill you. Damn it – Frank was clearly moved. She touched his cheek and it seemed to calm him a little. Rachel looked at him with concern and asked: - Are you ok, Frank? You seem upset. The nurse told me that I shouldn't upset you. I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have come here so soon after the surgery and maybe I shouldn't have been bringing up such difficult subjects – tears started rolling down her face again and Frank's face expression softened. His beautiful blue eyes looked at her again and he said to her: - I'm ok now, Rachel. It wasn't easy for me to watch you two go to that private room there, in Miami. For many reasons...first of all, I had no control over what was going on there – he could have killed you. Unfortunately I had no idea that it was him at the time. Now it all makes sense – Portman knew where my father lives. Second of all, I was really annoyed by your recklesness and silly behaviour in Miami . You behaved like you wanted to be killed. And then... I didn't like the thought of what was going on behind these closed doors. I know why you went there with him, I knew it then too. I knew that I hurt you and you wanted to act out, but … Frank interrupted and Rachel exhaled slightly. She was holding her breath that whole time, but now she really had to take a deep breath. She was surprised how incredibly brilliant he was and how he had seen her through, even though she should know he would. He knew she acted childish then and that she'd lost some of his respect then. She knew what he wanted to tell her, so she finished the sentence: ... but it was childish and stupid, behaving like that...I know that you must have lost all the respect you've had for me then . - Well, not all...it made me angry and frustrated. It was the first time I seriously thought of leaving you. Not only you were behaving that way but also I didn't like my reaction to this. I was losing my cold blood, I wasn't acting like I was trained. I was unable to block these feelings that were destructable and unhelpful. I was jealous...yes, I was and I hated myself for that... I also often found myself looking at you instead of a people surrounding you and it was purely dangerous. I understand why you became a big star, you have this appeal that only few women have... So you understand how difficult it was for me. But the turning point was when you went shopping with Tony without telling anyone where you go. I've never been that furious in my whole life. I got revenge on an innocent guy in the kitchen who had a bad luck to be on my way...It was a turning point and I've decided I'm leaving. - So what made you stay? - Rachel asked quietly. She's had a lot of information to process. - You...asked me if I could protect you and Fletcher...I have seen you that scared only once before. It was that night when that concert went wrong... - ...and you saved me. Yes, I guess it was comparable – Rachel added. - I saw fear in your eyes and despair. I knew you would treat me seriously from that moment on. And I didn't want to leave you scared. I'd never forgive myself if something happened to you. But I've decided to be more careful this time and block my feeling towards you entirely . Rachel was listening carefully. She knew everything he was saying before, but she really needed to hear it from him. She knew she was driving him mad; she knew that she was reckless more than once; she also realised that he had feelings towards her just like she had feelings towards him. She knew it even then, in Miami, but was stupid enough to act childish just to make him angry. And he was angry – she saw that too. It didn't make her satisfied, though. Instead, she was scared she can lose him forever and be killed on top of that. When she said to him then, at the balcony, that 'she wasn't going to beg ', she knew she actually would if she had to. She was desperate for him not only to keep protecting her she also wanted him to respect her again, to see this sparkle in his eyes just like when he was looking at her in this dodgy pub where they were dancing listening to this 'funny' country song. She wanted to redeem herself in his eyes. She could feel these unspoken feelings between them in his father's house, she knew how devestated he was when they've lost Nicky and that he blamed himself; she finally saw this sparkle – and something else maybe – in his eyes when he kissed her passionately in her garden. So many feelings was unnamed, unspoken between them – and she knew that many of them will stay like that. She was actually surprised how open he was with her tonight – but she also knew he made this effort for her and it made him really tired. He's made his decicion – he wants to move on . Move on with his life without her in it. She'll have to live without him. How can she manage that? She knew it will be for the best – their worlds were too different to make this relationship work – but she also knew that she wil miss him terribly. She closed her eyes and asked him quietly: - Did you succeed in that, Frank? There was a moment of silence and finally Frank said: - No...I didn't. But you know it will be... - I know – she interrupted him. She pressed cheek, full of tears, to his and they were lying like that for a longer moment in complete silence. The silence was broken by the nurse, who interrupted this intimate moment. - Madame, I'm afraid you have to go now. He is paler than he was before and is still very weak. Rachel reluctantly stood up and looked at Frank. He was looking at her like he wanted to say:'stay' . But he didn't say a word, only closed his eyes when she kissed him in the lips. - Maybe we'll meet again, Frank Farmer. For sure in the future life, but I have a feeling it might be in this life too... She saw him smiling with this sweet, kind and genuine smile that she hadn't seen for such a long time and which she will be missing for many years to come, she suspected... ","Summary":" Hi guys! I hope you'll like the story. This time no proofreader...hope no terrible mistakes...well,"},{"Movie":"Bodyguard, 1992","Title":"In the Darkness of Rachel Marron's Garden","Author":"kala79","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8277308","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok, The Bodyguard fans! Here is my take of what happened by the pool ;) Thanks so much - again - to marvellous Kittie Darkhart for her hard job proofreading this story :) I really hope you enjoy it! Frank needed some quiet time to think everything through . It was around 10 P.M., and he couldn't stop thinking about the events of the last few days. It was almost unbelievable to him, about how much could change within such a short time. Five days ago, he and Rachel were in a completely different place—far from her towering mansion and gilded boudoir. It was the peacefulness of his father's house that partially silenced his vigilance. Well, they were at the end of the world, and, rather unsurprisingly, his father had never even heard of a huge star like Rachel Marron, what could possibly go wrong there? He took her there because he felt that they both needed a break—a break from the constant fear, danger, crazy-obsessed fans, and the nervous atmosphere of her busy, loud house. What happened at the lake he would forever remember as his biggest failure, though. Bigger even, than his failure to protect Reagan from his failed assassin. As Frank was sitting on the grass by the pool in Rachel's garden, he looked forward—at nothing, in particular—and heaved a heavy sigh. He'd failed. He hadn't protected Rachel's family as he should have, and the result of this trip had been disastrous: Rachel's sister, Nicky, was shot by an unknown, very clever assassin, who'd mistaken her for Rachel. The threat was still out there, and the killer knew, just as Frank did, that he'd gotten the wrong person. Frank had lost Rachel's trust and her faith in him. To be honest, he'd even lost some of his own confidence, too. His cheek still hurt from the slap he'd received from Rachel earlier. He didn't blame her, though—she was very, very angry with him, very heartbroken, and grieving for the loss of a much beloved sister. Rachel was very sensitive and the death of her sister wasn't something she was going to forget any time soon. He was avoiding her since it all happened—avoiding her as much as he could, given the fact that he was still her bodyguard and had to protect her. She'd never found out that it was Nicky that hired the assassin. Frank wasn't going to tell her; that would be far too painful for her to ever know. He was the only person in the world who knew that it was Nicky's own jealousy and hatred that put her in her grave. The bodyguard painfully remembered Rachel's words from earlier that evening: - You, you, you... You brought this pain into my house... Now you're here! Where were you then? Why didn't you save her? It was your job to protect me and she died doing it... It was me they were after. And you let them kill her! She never did anything to anyone... - She'd hit him as she'd shouted that, but Frank hadn't even tried to defend himself, merely took the embodiment of her anger and frustration onto himself. Physical pain was so much better than this pain he felt inside. What she'd said…She was only partly right, but part of it was true nonetheless. He'd failed not only his client, but also a woman he loved. He wasn't able to say anything to her then—what for? His silence had made her even angrier with him, but she'd finally stopped hitting him and started to cry. Then she sat on the stairs and whispered: - I didn't love her enough... - Frank wanted to take her into his arms and hold her. He wanted to tell her that everything would be fine, that he would never fail her again, that he loved her, even when she is angry with him. But he didn't say anything; he wasn't sure she would like that. He watched her for a long while and then continued to climb upstairs. He still hadn't been able to focus on anything, though. Maybe some fresh air would help him? So here he was, sitting by himself in the moonlight on the top of the small hill in Rachel's garden. Suddenly he heard a quiet noise . He didn't have to turn to know that it was Rachel. He would recognize her steps anywhere in the world. - Do you mind if I sit down? - she asked. He shook his head. She tried to sound casual, as if nothing had happened. - It isn't over yet, is it? He'll come again? - She seemed very calm now. - Maybe, – he replied quietly. - At the Oscars? - she asked, slightly terrified. - Maybe . - Rachel looked at him and realized that Frank was extremely sad. Yes, she had lost her sister; however, for Frank it was something almost equally terrible—he knew he'd failed her, had lost some of his confidence. And, finally, she sensed that her words on the stairs had hit him especially hard. She wanted to apologize, to say something, anything—however, she really wasn't all that good at apologizing. She didn't really blame him for what happened—who would have expected an assassin to find her there? But she knew he still blamed himself for it. Trying to lighten up the mood, she started to tell the story: - When I was back in Squirrel Hill, I started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday I'd win an Oscar. You can understand how important it is that they see me up there if I win. If every one of those pikers comes through, it could add up to a lot of money. - Rachel smiled at Frank and managed to receive a very weak, faint smile in return. She was relieved. He replied quietly: - I think it's still dangerous. - - I didn't get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time. How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out there on the edge...Did you ever do something that didn't make too much sense, except maybe inside you? In your stomach somewhere? - Rachel asked, looking him straight in the eye. Her eyes never shone more brightly. Mesmerized, Frank only nodded in answer. Rachel continued: - I know you did because nobody gets good without it. And I know you are good. - The bodyguard felt a mixture of emotions. He was still sad and devastated because of the tragedy that happened a few days ago; ecstatic hearing Rachel's rare compliment; grateful that she didn't think he'd failed her, after all. On top of everything, he felt a secret desire to take her in his arms and kiss her passionately. She moved dangerously close to him; her scent was overwhelming, and since the only night they'd spent together, he often thought of making love to her again. Rachel's body was almost touching his and Frank had to stop looking at her. He swallowed somewhat nervously. This feeling in his stomach…was as almost as scary—yet was also incredibly fascinating. He knew it was love—something he had never felt as deeply as he did now. She could do whatever she wanted with him. He knew she didn't know that, though, and he was happy with it. He was always very good at hiding his feelings. - Look...I don't know why all this has happened to me...- she continued, very close to his face and nearly touching his lips - ... but I do know that none of it is your fault. I hope you can hear me, because this is how I say I'm sorry... - Frank was still avoiding her gaze, yet could feel her looking at him intensely. He was scared that in the magical glow of the moon, she would read all his feelings for her and discover the truth: that he was deeply, well and truly, in love with her. He didn't want her to know that, since it made him feel weak. Frank wasn't sure whether her feelings were as strong as his, even though he suspected that she might love him, too. - So... I'm going to go see if I win an Oscar. And I won't worry about it at all. Because I know you will protect me, right? - Her lips were now very, very close to his. He lifted his eyes, full of weakness for what he felt for her, smiled a little, and whispered: - That's right... - When their eyes met, they both felt bout of electricity. It was an exceptional moment that they knew wouldn't last forever. In this beautiful garden, in this romantic moonlight, in such quietness surrounding them…he was almost ready to believe that it could, perhaps, last forever. But it couldn't. They both knew that tonight might be their last chance to spend some time together as lovers. Tomorrow, everything could possibly change—one of them could be even killed—but tonight was the night of pure romantic perfection. Both shared these thoughts while gazing into each other's eyes. The temptation to claim her as his was very strong, and Frank wasn't even trying to fight it. He pulled her closer to him and kissed her passionately. She returned the kiss, and they both were mesmerized by just how perfect this truly moment was. It wasn't like the kiss they'd shared at his place—a wild, animal-like, hungry kiss, full of unstoppable desire and passion. This was a different kiss—soft and delicate, very tender and caring. Frank wanted to make love to Rachel very much; however, he didn't want to spoil this moment, either. He wanted to show her that she could trust him; that he was there for her and that he cared for her deeply—and not only as her bodyguard. He wanted to tell her so many things, as he laid her down on the grass and moved his body over hers. He knew they didn't need words. Such things were pointless. It was a very long kiss—when they finally broke apart to breathe—Frank noticed that Rachel had tears in her eyes. Deeply moved, but also worried, he whispered in her ear: - What happened? - Rachel wiped away her tears, smiled at him softly. She was so extremely beautiful that it rendered Frank speechless. He knew this woman would have his heart forever, despite the fact that they have very little chance of a future together. He'd never loved and would never love anyone quite like this stubborn, arrogant movie star, who was so weak, fragile, and undeniably sexy in his arms right now. Rachel whispered: - I wish it could last forever, Frank...- she looked in his eyes and knew he felt the same. She hesitated for a moment, but maybe this was her last chance to tell him the truth. - I love you, Frank . - That was it. Three simple words, said quietly in the darkness. It made him shiver and his eyes slightly brimmed with tears. She saw it and knew what he felt for her. She didn't need him to tell her that he felt the same. She knew he wouldn't. Indeed, Frank was unable to speak; his heart racing like never before in his life. She loved him. The bodyguard touched her cheek, wiped her tears, and placed another passionate, strong and caring kiss that told her everything she needed to know about his feelings for her.

Her, Josie Grossie, thernmost picked-on, shunned kid in high school the first time around, wasrnnow one of the most popular in her second go-round. It was amazing;rnit was surreal. She had to fight the urge to pinch herself; afraid itrnwas all a dream. She couldn't believe that her job had given herrnthis unique opportunity to change what had so affected her past. The only down side tornher current assignment was her hopeless attraction to her Englishrnteacher Sam Coulson. His unwavering support and belief in her and herrnwriting ability meant more to Josie than she could say. He'd beenrnkind to her when no one else was and had continued to be a guidingrnhand in her life ever since. He was so incredibly sweet andrnwonderful, and had been from the very first day she'd met him. The problem was that hernwas also so incredibly taken …not to mention that, even if hernwasn't, to him she was only seventeen and his student. Not thatrnit matters. Someone as wonderful as Sam would never notice someonernlike me anyway …Josie reasoned before bringing her thoughts backrnto the present. They passed by Jason,rnBrett, and Tommy, who all greeted them. \"Hey Jos; heyrnRobster,\" Jason said, waving his hand as he walked by. \"Looking good, guys,\"rnBrett chimed in, giving Josie in her clingy white and blue wrap dressrnan appreciative once-over and a smile. Tommy slapped Rob onrnthe shoulder and smiled at Josie. \"Hey Jos. Rob, rufus kegger,rnman!\" Rob chuckled as he andrnJosie turned the corner, heading for the doors that led to the schoolrncourtyard. Josie had to put a hand over her mouth to stifle arndelighted giggle. \"Rob, this is so unbelievable. I mean…\" She and Rob reached outrnto push the double doors in front of them and step out into the warmrnlate spring sunshine. \"..I spent my wholernlife wanting to fit in, and now….I finally feel like I do.\" Rob put his hand acrossrnJosie's shoulders and gave his big sister an affectionate squeeze.rn\"You do fit in, Josie…you do.\" Off to their right, Robrnnoticed Tracie rushing over to meet them. Giving Josie's arm arnparting squeeze, he nodded toward Tracie, indicating to Josie wherernhe was going, and walked off in that direction. But Josie wasn'trnalone for long. Moments later, Gibby and Kirsten ran up to her. Gibby asked, \"HeyrnJosie…who did Archie date: Betty or Veronica?\" \"Both,\" sherninformed them, biting back a smile. Gibby turned tornKirsten, hands on her hips petulantly. \"See? Told you…\" Kirsten shook her headrnruefully as they walked off. Obviously another prom idea shotrndown …Josie thought to herself, amused. They're both goingrnto be wearing trash bags to prom at this rate… From just behind her, arnsoft, warm voice whispered conspiratorially, \"I always liked Bettyrnbetter…\" Josie closed her eyesrnfor a split second, savoring the way the sensitive skin at the backrnof her neck tingled from the feel of Sam's breath against it as hernspoke. Despite herself, she felt her heart skip a beat and then beginrnto race as she recognized the earthy scent of his aftershave. Not aware of the prettyrnflush that colored her cheeks, she turned, flashing Sam a delightedrnsmile. \"Really?\" she asked, her voice trembling slightly. Sam fell into step withrnJosie as they ambled toward the area where the prom props were beingrnstaged. \"Oh yeah…\" he continued with mock-seriousness, \"Bettyrnwas so fun and spunky. Sure, Veronica had the great legs…but shernwas too moody. Very high maintenance.\" Josie laughed softly,rnand Sam joined in. They meandered onward, with no specific path orrndestination in mind, not needing to speak as they kept each otherrncompany. Suddenly, Sam placed a staying hand on Josie's elbow.rnStopping, Josie turned and looked at Sam in confusion, but he justrnsmiled and put up one finger, indicating for her to wait. Then, withrna mischievous glint in his eye, he jogged off in the direction theyrnhad just come. A moment later, Samrnreappeared, cradling something between his hands. Josie's browrnfurrowed in amused confusion as she watched Sam jog back toward her,rnstopping just in front of her. A bit out of breath, but smilingrnwidely, Sam opened his cupped hands, revealing a beautiful pale peachrnrosebud in bloom. Sam grasped the flower at the stem and held it outrnto her. \"For you,\" he saidrnsimply. Josie sucked in arnbreath; her mouth formed a perfect O as she fought the crazy urge torncry. \"Really?\" she asked in wonder. Sam's green eyesrntwinkled as he directed his crooked grin at her and nodded. Josie reached out torngrasp the stem reverently, sucking in an involuntary breath as herrnfingers grazed Sam's. Immediately, their eyes connected andrnlingered as Josie slowly lifted the rose to her nose. Breathing inrnthe sweet fragrance, she sighed, her gaze with Sam never wavering,rn\"It's beautiful…\" Again, Josie felt thatrnthing…that inexorable pull of connection, an electricity thatrnseemed to spark whenever Sam was near that she felt powerless tornfight against. She found herself wishing for perhaps the millionthrntime that her feelings for him weren't unrequited. Finally, she was ablernto break the spell and cast her gaze downward toward the rose. Thisrnsimple act had to have been one of the nicest, most romantic thingsrnanyone had ever done for her. \"Thank you,\" she said, her voicernchoked with emotion. Sam's smile widenedrnas he answered, \"You're very welcome, Josie.\" Putting a softrnhand to her elbow again to direct her, they continued their wanderingrnpath. A moment later, Serarncame from around a backdrop and made a beeline for the pair. \"Josie,\"rnshe asked once she was in front of them, \"were Tweedledum andrnTweedledee a couple?\" Josie glanced sidelongrnat Sam as he did the same. She noticed his lips twitch just slightly,rnas if they were sharing a private joke. It was such a minute reactionrnthat most likely no one else would have noticed, yet Josie foundrnherself having to bite the side of her cheek to keep from giggling inrnresponse. \"Well…in the strictest sense, no.\" Josie watched asrnSera's face fell and was quick to add, \"But for prom…sure.\" Sera beamed, bouncingrnup and down in her excitement. \"Thanks, Josie!\" she enthused,rngiving Josie a spontaneous hug before racing off to find her promrndate Brett. As Sam watched Serarnwalk away, he complimented Josie, \"You're really doing a greatrnjob here, Josie. Your \"can do\" attitude is very refreshing.\" Josie blushed and bentrnher head, hoping her hair would hide her cheeks. She studied the rosernin her hand before peeking at Sam from beneath her lashes. \"Thanks.\" Silence stretched onrnbetween them and soon Josie found herself babbling nervously. \"Theyrnweren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they?\" she asked. Sam's brows furrowedrnin confusion as he tried to follow Josie's train of thought. \"Tweedledum andrnTweedledee…\" Josie clarified. Immediately, Sam'srnsmile returned. He tapped the side of his face as if in thoughtrnbefore replying good-naturedly, \"Maybe distant cousins. They didrnhave that egg shape in common.\" A shadow of melancholyrnflitted across Josie's face as the two of them stepped up onto arnsmall wooden bridge that would be spanning a fake moat at the prom.rnWhen they reached the middle of it, Josie stopped and turned so thatrnshe was leaning her forearms on the railing. \"Well, at leastrnTweedledum and Tweedledee had each other. Humpty Dumpty was allrnalone,\" she said sadly. Sam stopped also andrnstood next to Josie, mimicking her stance at the railing. He lookedrnas if he was trying to gather his thoughts. Wistfulness crept intornhis tone as he answered, \"Yeah…that's sad, isn't it? He hadrnto sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.\" \"I think that'srnwhat we all need,\" Josie responded. \"Someone to sit up on thernwall with us…\" \"Yeah,\" Sam agreed.rn\"to watch the world go by…\" \"…and put us backrntogether when we fall,\" Josie finished. Their eyes met and heldrnfor a long moment before Sam looked back out over the sea of promrndecorations. Then he playfully nudged Josie with his elbow to get herrnattention. When she turned her head toward him, his crooked grinrnreturned. \"Our penguin, right?\" Josie nodded and staredrnat her arms resting on the railing, biting back a huge grin. Hernremembered! She couldn't believe he still remembered thatrnconversation of hers he'd overheard from weeks ago. Leaning closer to her,rnSam murmured in Josie's ear, \"You're not the only one whornremembers what people say…\" And now, despiternherself, Josie smiled in delight, her eyes sparkling. Sam noticed the changernimmediately. \"Aha!\" he said, ducking his head so he could makerneye contact with Josie. \"There it is! I knew that smile was inrnthere somewhere.\" Josie turned toward himrnso that her hip was now resting against the railing. Sam turnedrntoward her as well. Neither one of them seemed to notice that theyrnwere standing closer together than a teacher and student normallyrnwould. Josie studied Sam'srnface; his eyes. He seemed to be doing the same to her. Finally, withrnher voice quietly earnest, she asked him, \"Do you think you'llrnfind her?\" Sam stared at her forrnso long without answering that Josie feared he didn't know what shernmeant. \"Your penguin, I mean,\" she clarified awkwardly; suddenlyrnmortified that she'd even asked. After all, he had a girlfriend; hernprobably thought she was his penguin. Otherwise, why would hernhave stayed with her for so long? Sam's expression grewrnsoft as he replied, his voice barely above a whisper, \"Yeah…actually,rnI do.\" Sam's eyes metrnJosie's and time seemed to stop. She had no idea how long they hadrnstood there, but she felt entranced. She knew she shouldn't berndoing this, but she also knew she didn't have the willpower to lookrnaway. Of their own volition, Josie's eyes skimmed lower, studyingrnthe sensual curve of Sam's lips; imagining how they would feelrnpressed against hers… No longer able to fight the fantasy she wasrnensnared in, her eyes slid closed. Even though she couldrnnot see it, she swore she could sense Sam's approach. Ever sornslowly, she felt his body weight shift, felt him lean toward her,rnfelt his staccato breaths as they splayed across her cheeks.rnCloser…closer… \"Oh, my God!\" Sam's voice was sornquiet that Josie could easily have missed what he'd said had he notrnbeen so close to her. But it was his alarmed tone that brought Josiernback to Earth fast and hard. As her eyes flickered open, she foundrnthat Sam had moved back a step to put more space between them and wasrnno longer looking at her. Josie felt so off-balance by the suddenrnchange in gear that she had to grasp the handrail with both hands tornkeep from falling over. God, I am so stupid! Josie raged internally as her cheeks burned bright red inrnmortification. What the heck is the matter with me? Shernrealized that whatever reciprocation she'd felt moments ago mustrnhave been only in her mind. But before she couldrneven open her mouth to form an apology, Sam turned to her as if nothing had happened andrnexclaimed with suppressed excitement, \"Oh, I almost forgot!\" Hernplaced his hand lightly at the small of Josie's back and motionedrnto two white iron benches just beyond them. \"Here, come on and sitrndown for a moment.\" It seemed clear tornJosie that either Sam hadn't noticed her momentary loss of control,rnor else he was too much of a gentleman to mention it. Either way, shernwas very relieved to not have to try to explain herself. She sat atrnthe edge of one bench as Sam sat at the corner of the other. As hernturned to her, he seemed to notice how close together they werern(their knees were almost touching) and he moved away slightly,rnapparently so she wouldn't feel crowded. \"What did you want torntell me?\" Josie asked, wincing internally at how breathless shernstill sounded. Sam beamed. \"I gotrnyou a meeting with the Admissions guy from Dartmouth!\" Josie's mouth fellrnopen in alarm. \"What? But…\" she stammered, \"I wasn't evenrngoing to college…\" In response, Samrngushed, \"No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look atrnyour writing, and he agreed to meet with you.\" Excitement glowed inrnhis eyes and smile. As touched as she wasrnthat Sam would go out of his way to do such a thing, right now thernonly emotion she felt was sheer terror.rn\"Oh…yikes!\" Sam apparently mistookrnJosie's panic as nerves. In an obvious attempt to calm her down, hernteased, \"Yeah…I told him, 'If I'm wrong about this girl, yourncan take away my teaching certificate!'\" Stunned, Josie leanedrnforward, closer to Sam. \"Wow…\" she breathed in amazement, \"Yournbelieve in me that much?\" She could hardly believe that he would gornthrough all that trouble just for her. Now it was Sam's turnrnto move closer to Josie. \"Of course I do, Josie,\" he respondedrnsincerely. \"You owe it to yourself…to your writing…to go torncollege. You're an amazing writer. You just have to findrnyour story.\" Their eyes met andrnlingered. Sam smiled encouragingly, yet Josie felt that thread ofrnpanic flutter back through her. Sam made it sound so easy, yet he hadrnno idea how true his statement was. She still needed to \"find herrnstory\"…and after 2 months at South Glen South, she was startingrnto believe it would never happen. Josie looked downrnmiserably, watching her fingers as they twisted the rose he had givenrnher around and around. \"I don't know how to find it,\" shernadmitted hoarsely. Sam slid down the benchrncloser to Josie, so close that their knees now touched. He reachedrnout and put a curled knuckle under Josie's chin, tilting her headrnup to meet his eyes again. \"Of course you do,\" hernencouraged. Josie shook her head inrndenial. \"Yes, you do,\" Samrninsisted, giving a lock of Josie's golden hair a playful tug. \"Yourndo it all the time in my class.\" \"That's different,\"rnJosie protested. \"You give us the topics. How will I write whenrnit's just me? When I have to come up with my own ideas?\" \"That's simple,\"rnSam replied encouragingly. \"To write well, you have to write whatrnyou know. Always start with you, with what's inside of you. If yournuse that as a starting point, Josie, you can't go wrong.\" \"I know I have onlyrnbeen teaching for three years, but I've seen enough to know yournhave a special gift. All you need is a little confidence. If you canrnjust learn to believe in yourself, you'll find that your talentrncould take you anywhere you want to go.\" Josie's eyesrnglimmered with unshed tears. \"You really think so?\" \"Uh-huh. You can dornit; I know you can,\" Sam replied. He smiled at her, and this timernJosie returned it. The moment was brokenrnby a voice behind them. \" There you are, Josie!\" exclaimedrnGibby. \"I've been looking all over for you.\" Self-consciously, Josiernshot to her feet and turned toward the girl. \"What's the matter?\" \"Nothing…I justrnneed your help with something,\" Gibby said, momentarily glancing atrnMr. Coulson before returning her gaze to her friend. \"Can yourncome?\" Josie looked awkwardlyrnbetween Sam and Gibby. \"I, uh…\" She looked back at Samrnquestioningly. \"That's fine,rnJosie,\" he answered for her with a reassuring smile. \"We canrndiscuss this more another time.\" Shooting him a gratefulrnsmile, she said, \"Okay, lead the way.\" As she and Gibbyrncrossed back over the bridge, Josie turned and peeked over herrnshoulder at Sam, shrugging one shoulder and giving him a quick wave.rnHe waved back and then blended into the milling crowd of students. Turning back to Gibbyrnwith an internal sigh, she asked, \"So, what did you need my helprnwith?\" Gibby linked her armrnwith Josie's and confided, \"Oh, nothing. I just noticed that Mr.rnCoulson seemed to be monopolizing your time and I wanted to give yourna chance to escape. I know how long-winded teachers can bernsometimes…\" \"Yeah,\" Josiernagreed wistfully, already wishing she were still sitting and talkingrnwith Sam. \"Hey, let's gorntouch up our makeup, and then maybe I can round up Kristen andrnKirsten and we can head to the mall,\" Gibby suggested. \"Yeah…sure,\"rnJosie agreed, although not very enthusiastically. Luckily, Gibby didn'trnnotice. She simply waited by Josie's locker as she retrieved herrnpurse and then followed Josie into the girls' bathroom. At thernmirror, Gibby opened her purse on the counter, pulled out herrnmascara, and began primping. Josie stood next to herrnand set down her bag. But before she could pull out her lip-gloss,rnshe heard a beep. Josie knew what that was; her cell phone wasrntelling her she'd missed a call. On a sigh, Josie dug in her pursernto extract the phone, and then blanched when she saw who it was. \"What's up?\"rnGibby asked, now applying a new coat of lipstick. \"Oh…it's my…Mom,\"rnJosie fibbed. \"I'm gonna need to call her back and find out whatrnshe wanted.\" \"Okay, sure,\" Gibbyrnagreed, zipping up her purse and slinging it over her shoulder. \"I'llrnjust wait outside for you.\" \"Thanks.\" Once Gibby had left thernbathroom, Josie quickly peeked underneath all the stalls to makernsure she was alone, and then dialed the familiar number. \"Geller!\" Gusrnbellowed into the phone without preamble. \"I want to see you in myrnoffice right away. Make your excuses and get your butt in here!\" \"Uh…\" Josiernstammered, \"ah…okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.\" Gus hung up before sherncould say goodbye. Dropping the phone into her purse, Josie foundrnthat her hands were shaking. Now what had she done? Sticking her head outrnthe bathroom door, she tapped Gibby on the shoulder. \"Looks likernthe shopping trip is off,\" Josie said, trying to look as upsetrnabout that news as possible. \"My mom needs me to come right homerntoday.\" \"That's so totally not rufus …and on a Friday night, too!\" \"Yeah, it reallyrnstinks,\" Josie agreed. Gibby stood there for arnmoment, and then shrugged. \"Well, maybe we could go tomorrowrninstead? After all, we still have to get our costumes.\" I already have myrncostume, Josie thought, but said aloud, \"Sure, sounds like fun.rnCall you around 11?\" \"Yeah, sounds good,\"rnGibby agreed. \"After all, I so totally sleep in on Saturday. See yarnlater, Josie!\" she said as she walked away. \"See ya,\" Josiernanswered, stepping back inside the bathroom and shutting the door. She looked in thernmirror and announced quietly, \"Okay everyone, show's over forrnnow; I need to use the facilities…\" Then she reached up andrnturned off the switch for the hidden camera. Leaning over the sink,rnJosie turned on the cold-water tap and splashed her face. Patting herrnface dry with a paper towel, she turned and went into a stall,rnputting the toilet lid down and sitting on top of it, locking therndoor behind her. She leaned over andrnburied her hands in her hair, trying to make sense of everything thatrnhad happened in the last two months, especially what had happenedrnwith Sam in the past hour. Mr. Coulson, shernthought furiously, he's Mr. Coulson to you, not Sam. That'srnwhat gets you into so much trouble. Josie admitted tornherself that--no matter how hard she tried--she just had a difficultrntime thinking of him as anything other than Sam. The fact that theyrnhad become friends of sorts over the last two months didn't helprnmatters. When she was with him, it seemed that remaining in the guisernof a seventeen-year-old student was a struggle. It doesn't helprnthat you've fallen in love with him either, she scolded herselfrncrossly. It became exponentially harder with each passing day torncontain the things she felt for Sam, even knowing that he was herrnteacher, that he thought she was underage, that he had a girlfriend.rnNothing seemed to sway her foolish heart where he was concerned. Sam Coulson hadrncertainly turned a \"simple\" assignment into an incrediblyrncomplicated one. When she was in his presence, she seemed to forgetrnwhat it was she was supposed to be doing; she lost track ofrneverything but him. And now things wererngetting worse. While she appreciated Sam's support and belief inrnher writing ability more than she could possibly put into words, hernhad unwittingly put her into a nearly impossible situation. How couldrnshe possibly fly out to New Hampshire and continue this ridiculousrncharade for yet another innocent person? But yet, how could she letrnSam down when he'd gone so far out on a limb for her just to getrnher this chance? Josie rubbed herrnfingers against her temples and blinked back tears of frustration.rnWhile she hated lying to everyone the way she'd been doing the lastrn2 months, she loathed lying to Sam. Sam's friendship feltrnlike a precious gift that she was defiling every time she opened herrnmouth. Seeing that she onlyrnhad two more weeks until her assignment ended, Josie knew thatrnrelatively soon the truth about her would come out. Everyone wouldrnknow that she had been lying all along, and the thought that people would think badlyrnof her was tough to deal with. Yet, as hard as that thoughtrnwas, what was really tearing up her insides was thinking about Sam'srnreaction to the news. She truly felt that shernand Sam had made a connection, had forged an unlikely closeness evenrnin these bizarre circumstances. She thought that, out of everyone, hernwould feel the most betrayed by her revelation: not necessarilyrnbecause she had pretended to be a student, but that, after all theyrnhad been through, she still hadn't trusted him enough to share the truth with him. Add to the mix that Samrnhad gone to a lot of trouble to help her get into college. Herrnrevelation would likely make him look foolish, if not to otherrnteachers at South Glen for championing her cause, then certainly tornthe man from the Dartmouth Admissions office to whom he'd pleaded her case. That certainly didn'trnbode well for the status of their friendship, nor the state ofrnJosie's conscience. Gus had warned her thisrncould happen; that she needed to remain cool and detached whilernundercover so she could keep an impartial point of view. But he'drnnever told her how difficult that would be to accomplish. It was justrnin Josie's nature to care about people; she couldn't help it. AndrnSam Coulson was such an amazing guy…how could she not carernabout him? Without knowing how shernhad gotten there, Josie realized she'd reached her breaking point.rnHow she handled this moment would determine the course of her life for months or years to come. Did she keep her secret and her jobrnat the cost of her conscience and heart, or was she to break herrnsilence and jeopardize the career she'd worked for years to obtain? Reaching deep withinrnherself for strength, Josie came to a decision. She rummaged in herrnpurse and pulled out a pen and a small pad of paper that read \"Fromrnthe desk of Josie Geller\" at the top. Once it was balanced upon herrnknee, she began to write.[Chapter 2] BreakingnPoint Chapter 2 SamnCoulson walked among the prom decorations without seeing them. Hisnmind was fixed firmly on a certain petite, blonde student of his. Innfact, lately it seemed as if his mind were always fixed onnJosie. Sam wasn'tnsure how it happened…or when. But, as much as he loathed admittingnit, he'd fallen for one of his students…and fallen hard . It wasn'tnas if he'd never been the subject of a schoolgirl's crush before.nHe knew that, as an able-bodied, decent-looking young male teacher,nit was par for the course. He'd always been careful to maintain anprofessional distance with his students, and let his admirers downngently whenever the need arose. But thisntime was different. She was different. JosienGeller was unlike any student he'd ever worked with. It was amazingnhow bright, charming, and mature she seemed compared to, well, everynother student in the school…or every other student he'd everntaught. She was sweet, shy, and unassuming…a beautiful young womannas much inside as out. And she was an incredibly talented writer,nalthough she seemed not to have realized this fact yet. But whatnhad ultimately woven its spell around him was how very much theynseemed to have in common. They both loved the written word and readnavidly with a wide range of interests. They'd spent many afternoonsnduring tasks for the Prom Committee discussing all things literary,nand he had yet to bring up a book or poem that Josie had not alsonread. He hadnbeen surprised to discover that Josie shared his love for baseballnand hockey. Based on her love of the sport, it was no longer a wondernthat she'd known who Gordie Howe was when no one else had. Add tonthat their shared taste in food: both their favorites were Chinesenand Italian, and certainly neither would turn away a hot dog withneverything on it. And despite the difference in their ages, they evennhad similar taste in music. Moreover,nJosie had a way of making Sam feel immediately at ease in hernpresence. She was just so easy to be around, so fun to be with. Henthought back to their fateful ride on the Ferris wheel at NavynPier…and how Josie had been able to calm his fear with just thentouch of her hand on his arm. Her voice had been soothing, her eyesnunderstanding. Samnstopped short as he recalled their conversation. Even then, weeksnago, he'd realized Josie was special…and she was someone that,nunconsciously at least, he knew he wanted in his life. Henrealized in retrospect that from the moment he'd told her thatnsomeday men would line up around the block for her, he had begun toncompare Lara to Josie…and found that Lara kept coming up short. Lara didnnot understand Sam's love of literature or his desire to share thatnlove with others through teaching. She hated sports on principle,nmuch preferring more \"cultured\" activities like cocktail partiesnand operas at the Met. Lara liked sushi and French high cuisine andnwouldn't be caught dead near anything that used ketchup or mustardnas a condiment. It didn'tnbother Sam so much that he and Lara liked so many different things;nit was more that Lara saw his interests as a problem, like they werenthings to be fixed instead of being able to accept him as henwas. She always insinuated that he needed to change, and after fivenyears of hearing it, he'd actually started to believe her. It hadntaken meeting Josie, finding someone who didn't treat him like henwas damaged goods, someone who made him feel good about himself as henwas, to realize that he'd been settling for less than he'dnwanted. It wasnthis pervasive feeling that finally led him to break things off withnLara. When he'd called her last weekend, he'd expected anknockdown, drag-out fight, but was relieved to discover that Laranagreed with his decision. It turned out that she had noticed thengrowing emotional distance between them in the last couple months andnagreed that their parting was probably for the best. But nonlonger having a girlfriend brought a host of other problems in itsnwake. While Sam had been attached to Lara, he'd been able to pushnhis growing attraction to Josie aside, reasoning that he was takennand had no right to such thoughts. But now, he had no such excuse tonhold those thoughts at bay, and the strain of trying to control hisnfeelings was definitely starting to show. He frownednas he passed by the small bridge that he and Josie had stood upon notnlong ago. God, he'd almost kissed her. Here, in the schoolncourtyard, with the entire senior class milling about, he'd almostnkissed Josie, consequences be damned. Sam raisedna shaking hand and threaded it through his hair. He shut his eyes tonblock out the image of the bridge, but instead saw the moment playingnon the back of his eyelids like a movie on a backdrop. Slowly,nJosie had turned toward him and their eyes had met for a longnbreathless moment. Then her stunning blue eyes slid lower, and a looknof yearning filled her features as her gaze centered on his lips.nThen Josie's eyes had slid closed and she'd leaned in, closernthan he'd ever been to her… PerhapsnJosie hadn't known what kind of message she had been sending, butnSam had read it loud and clear. This was a woman who wanted to benkissed. Correction: this was a woman who wanted him to kiss her. His heart rate had tripled as he stared at her, as henfelt her longing weaving its seductive spell around him. Samnknew he was the one who needed to keep a level head, the one whonneeded to remain in control…but the moment Josie's eyes had slidnclosed and she leaned in toward him, his willpower had ebbed away.nHere before him was a beautiful young woman that he cared about farnmore than he should, who obviously wanted to be kissed by him as muchnas he wanted to kiss her. It was seductive and powerful, and too muchnfor Sam's already taxed self-control to bear. The world had fallennaway around them as he felt himself rock forward inch by inch untilnthey were barely a hair's breadth apart. He could already imaginenhow her petal-pink lips would feel against his own, how soft hernblonde curls would be as he ran his fingers through them…whennreality burst through his consciousness in icy waves. Openingnhis eyes, he stared for a split second at how close he had come tontaking advantage of his favorite student's apparent crush on himnand couldn't stop the words whispering past his lips, \"Oh mynGod,\" before leaping back as if he'd been burned. Poppingnhis eyes open and swallowing a large lump of self-loathing, Sam couldnstill see the fleeting look of loss and disappointment crossingnJosie's face just before hiding her mortified blush from him. He nownknew what he should have said then, what he should have done. Thatnwas the moment when he should have spoken up and put a stop tonJosie's feelings for him, whatever they were, once and for all. Butnhe knew deep down that, even if he had thought of it in thatnmoment, he wouldn't have had the heart to do it; especially whennanything he would have said to her would have been a lie. Havingncircled the edge of the staging area once, Sam found himself standingnin front of the very benches he and Josie had occupied. Taking hisnseat once more, he rested his head in his hands, trying to make sensenof his jumbled thoughts. Just lastnnight, he'd placed a call to his most trusted friend and advisornfor all things female: his older sister Abby. For weeks, he'd heldnhis growing attraction to Josie inside of him, afraid to admit itneven to himself, let alone anyone else. But now that things had endednwith Lara and Josie just never seemed to leave his thoughts, he knewnhe needed some help. Massagingnthe worry lines on his forehead, Sam replayed the conversation in hisnhead. Thenphone rang several times before a groggy female voice answered,n\"Hello?\" \" Ab?\"nhe'd said, even though he'd recognized his sister's voice. Thenwoman yawned into the receiver before replying, \"Sam? Is that you?\" \" Yeah.\" \" Sam,ndo you know it's…\" another yawn punctuated the sentence, \"12:30nin the morning? That means it's…2:30 there… What's thenmatter?\" \" Whatnmakes you think something's the matter?\" Sam evaded. Hencould almost see the glare he felt sure Abby was giving him all thenway from San Francisco. \"Well, seeing as you don't normally call me at 2 am…I figure something must be up.\" \" Oh.nYeah. Well…\" Sam let out a very deep sigh. \"Ab…I think I'vengot a problem. A big problem.\" Samnheard rustling on the other end of the line, as if his sister hadnsuddenly sat up in bed. \"Okay…\" she said, sounding much morenawake now. \"What's going on?\" \" Well…I,num…well, I broke up with Lara,\" Sam hedged again. \" Andnthat's a problem?\" Abby joked. \"Personally, I think we shouldnthrow a party to celebrate…\" \" Hey,nyou're the one who set us up,\" Sam reminded her. \" God,ndon't remind me,\" Abby moaned. \"Temporary insanity. That's mynstory and I'm sticking to it…\" She paused a moment, and whennshe spoke her voice was somber once more. \"But I don't understandnwhy that is such a problem that you needed to call me in the middlenof the night to talk about it.\" \" It'snnot. It's why I broke up with her that's thenproblem.\" \" Okay…\"nAbby said, confusion coloring her voice. It was clear she couldn'tnfollow his line of thought. \"And that was because…\" She trailednoff, waiting for her brother to finish the sentence she'd started. Takingnanother deep breath, Sam plunged forward before he got cold feet.n\"…because I'm in love with someone else.\" \" But,nSam…that's wonderful!\" Abby exclaimed with delight. When Samndidn't immediately agree with her, she asked, \"Isn't it?\" \" Yes…\"nSam agreed, \"and no.\" He paused a moment before blurting out, \"Tonbe honest, Abby, it's killing me, and I don't know what to do.\" \" Uh,noh…unrequited love is it?\" his sister sympathized. \" I'm…notnsure. But I don't think it is…that's part of the problem…\" \" Okay,nI'm still not following, Sam…\" \" Abby…requitednor not, I can't be with her.\" \" Anmarried woman, then? That doesn't sound like you…\" Samnclosed his eyes, wishing the situation were only that easy. \"No,nnot married…\" \" Thennwhat?\" \" She's…\"nSam took a steadying breath, leaning his head against the backrest ofnhis chair to fight off a sudden bout of lightheadedness beforenwhispering miserably, \"she's one of my students.\" Therenwas a long, heavy silence on the other end of the line. Then, \"Oh,nGod…Sam…\" \" Yeah,\"nSam agreed miserably. \" But…but…how?\"nAbby finally gasped. \"How could you let this happen?\" \" Indon't know. I didn't mean to, Abby, I swear it! I didn't evennknow it was happening until I was already in over my head.\" \" Thengirl…how old is she?\" \" Seventeen,\"nSam replied. \"She one of my Senior Lit students.\" \" Doesnshe know? Have you told her?\" Abby asked. \" I…don'tnthink she knows. I certainly haven't said anything to her aboutnit.\" Veryngently, Abby said, \"You can't tell her, Sam. You know that, don'tnyou?\" Samnclosed his eyes in despair. \"I know.\" The words came out as anstrangled whisper. After anlong pause, Sam admitted something else. \"Ab, I think…I thinknmaybe she has feelings for me, too.\" Abbynlet out a sorrowful sigh. \"Sam…she's your student. You know youncan't let this happen.\" \" Itncan't happen…but it has, Abby! There's something differentnabout Josie…something special about her…\" \" Sam,nlisten to yourself! You're not making any sense!\" Abby declared,nher voice full of worry. \" Inknow it sounds insane; really I do. But if you could just meet her,nif you could just see…you'd understand.\" Anothernsigh issued from Abby's mouth. \"All right, Sam. Explain. Tell menabout her so I will understand. I can't promise I will; but I willntry.\" Samnspent the next twenty minutes regaling his sister with stories aboutnJosie: how sweet and kind she was, how bright and talented, howncaring and thoughtful. He told her about Senior Nite, her brillantnsave of the prom theme, their many conversations as a result of herninclusion on the Prom Committee. When henhad finished, another long sigh, this time of resignation, issuednfrom Abby's lips. \"Sam…I, I must admit that she sounds prettynwonderful.\" \" Shenis,\" Sam agreed. \" Perfectnfor you, in fact,\" Abby went on. \" Inthink so, too…\" Sam sighed wistfully. \" But …\"nhis sister interjected, \"She's still seventeen, Sam.\" Samnscrunched his eyes shut and massaged his furrowed brow. \"I know.\" Mutterednhalf under her breath, Abby said, more to herself than to hernbrother, \"I can't believe I'm saying this…\" Then she asked,n\"Sam…when does she turn eighteen?\" Startled,nSam sat up straighter in his chair and wracked his brain, trying tonremember if Josie had ever mentioned her birthday. \"I…I don'tnknow.\" \" Well,nperhaps it isn't that far away…Maybe you should find out.\" Fornwhatever reason, Sam hadn't considered this. His world seemednsuddenly brighter, like perhaps there was a light at the end of thentunnel after all. \"Yeah, I should do that.\" \" Still,nSam…\" Abby cautioned. \"Even if she does turn eighteen soon,nthere's still a lot of complications. She's still your studentnfor the next two and a half weeks. No matter what, nothing can happennbefore then…\" \" But,nAbby,\" Sam interjected, \"I need to know how she feels about me. Inneed to know if what I think I'm seeing is just a crush or if it'snmore than that.\" \" Younreally should wait until after she graduates,\" Abby insisted. \" Indon't know if I can . It seems harder andnharder to contain how I'm feeling with every day that passes. Indon't know if I can make it another two weeks, Ab…\" \" Look,nSam,\" Abby said flatly, \"I don't want you pressuring this girlninto something she might not want. I know you wouldn't do it onnpurpose,\" she hurried to add, \"but you can't expect a seventeennyear old girl to know her own heart, no matter how mature she seems…\" \" Inwould never pressure Josie,\" Sam vowed. \"I…Injust need to know if I've even got a shot withnher, you know? I mean…the most popular boy in school is taking hernto prom…what chance do I honestly have against that ?\"nBitterness made Sam's words seem clipped. \" Don'tnsell yourself short, little brother. From all you've told me aboutnJosie, she doesn't sound like the kind of girl who gets her headnturned easily for the wrong reasons.\" \" Maybe…\"nSam said doubtfully. In his mind, Guy Perkins was a formidable rival.nAnd it was obvious--to him at least--that Guy was quite smitten withnJosie. \" Sam,nI know it's tough for you right now, but you are going to have tonwait on the sidelines…at least for two more weeks. You can do it; Inknow you can,\" Abby encouraged. \" Well,nthat makes one of us…\" Sam muttered. \" Look,nSam…\" Abby began, annoyance lacing her voice. \"If you'renseriously considering the possibility of a future with Josie, thennyour life is going to be all about waiting:nwaiting for her to grow up. If you can't even wait two weeks…\" \" That'snnot what I meant. Of course I'm prepared tonwait. I just meant…\" His voice dropped to barely above a whisper,nas if he didn't even want to admit it to himself, \"What if shenfalls in love with someone else because I waited too long to tell hernhow I feel?\" \" Thennshe was never yours to begin with, Sam. It's as simple as that.\" Samnsighed, feeling the truth in his sister's words, yet not reallynwanting to accept it. \" It'llnbe all right, Sam. I've got a feeling about it.\" \" God,nI hope you're right…\" \" You'llnsee,\" Abby encouraged. \"Now, you go and get some rest. You mustnbe exhausted.\" Atnthat, Sam stifled a yawn with his hand. \"Yeah, I guess I am…'Night,nAb.\" \" Goodnnight, Sam. Talk to you soon.\" Samnhung up the receiver and stared into the dark of his living room forna long time, lost in thought. He hadnnever in his life been this attracted to a person, and it was anwildly exhilarating feeling. This was the loventhat sonnets were written about, the feeling that inspired poets andnplaywrights to create their best works. Until now, a part of him hadnthought this kind of enduring, overwhelming feeling was little morenthan a cliché. But now that he had experienced it? He nevernwanted to let it go. Samnfelt his resolve hardening. Abby was right. If there was any chancenof making a relationship with Josie work, he was going to have tonwait. And if it meant waiting on the sidelines, playing the part ofnteacher, mentor, and friend until Josie had grown up enough to knownher own mind and heart, then that's what he would do…even if itnkilled him. Sam wasnpulled out of his reverie by a tap on his shoulder. Shaking his headnto clear it, he turned to look over his shoulder and smiled. \"Whatncan I do for you, Sera?\" He asked politely. Sera stucknout her hand and held out a folded piece of paper. \"Josie asked mento give you this.\" Sam'snheart thumped against his ribcage. \"She did?\" he asked, graspingnthe paper and pulling it toward him. \"Uhnhuh,\" Sera replied. \"See ya later, Mr. Coulson.\" Sera hurriednaway, leaving Sam alone once more. Steelingnhimself for what might happen next, Sam unfolded the note and begannto read. - Josienpeeked around the corner of a high hedge and watched as Sam unfoldednher letter and started to read it. Her heart was pounding, and shencould barely breathe. As she watched, several unreadable emotionsncrossed Sam's face as he read. When he'd finished, he looked upnsharply, scanning the crowd of students, trying to find her. Josienducked back behind the hedge and placed a hand to her heart, willingnit to slow down. What shenhad done terrified her, yet there was really no other choice. Thisnwas what she needed to do, had to do. Now allnshe could do was wait.[Chapter 3] BreakingrnPoint Part 3 - A/N: Sorry it's taken me SO long to update. I still haven't given up on Snowbound (for any of those who were wondering). I'm just at one of those places where I know where I want the story to go, but can't quite figure out how I want to fill in the parts to get there... Besides that, I started a new job in August that I work a ton of hours weekly at, which leaves me almost no time at all for writing. But I plug along with a line here and a paragraph there, and eventually it pays off... (And for those who asked, my mother is doing better, thanks!) I hope you all like where this story is going, and I will continue to try to update as my little free time allows. Thanks a lot for your comments and support! I can't tell you what it means to me. :) - As Serarnwalked away, Sam took a deep breath in a vain attempt to calm hisrnthrumming pulse. He couldn't explain it, but for some reason, hernfelt as if whatever he was about to read would change his life; thatrnsomehow this was Josie's way of reaching out to him to answer thosernquestions that were burning in his mind. Sam'srnfingers trembled, making him clumsy as he unfolded the paper, afraidrnto see what Josie had written, yet also desperately needing to know. The momentrndid not disappoint. Dear Mr. Coulson: This is probably the most difficult letter I'vernever had to write. For a while, I have wanted to talk to you aboutrnsomething very, very important, but I just haven't been able to getrnup the courage. That is, until now. Don't get me wrong; I'mrnstill terrified, but what I have to say just can't wait any longer,rnnot even another day. Therefore, I am hoping against hope that yournwill agree to meet me at the Wildcat Café on North McClurg atrn5:30 this afternoon so we can talk privately. I know that what I am requesting of you isrnhighly irregular; and not something a student should ask of arnteacher. But, right now I am not looking for a teacher; I'm lookingrnfor a friend, and you're the only one I trust. I wouldn't ask if it weren't absolutelyrnnecessary. What I need to tell you cannot be said at school. Once Irnexplain, you'll understand why. I promise. Please…please come. I'll be waiting. Josie So manyrnemotions threaded through Sam's veins that he hardly had time tornrecognize one before it would be replaced by another: curiosity,rnelation, triumph, anxiety, fear, anticipation. As hernfinished reading her words, Sam inexplicably felt Josie's eyes onrnhim. Somehow he knew she was there, somewhere, watching him as hernread her words. He glanced up suddenly, training his eyes on thernmilling students to no avail. With arnmental shrug, wondering if he'd simply imagined it, Sam bent hisrnhead to reread the note. Upon first glance, he'd thought it wasrnobvious that Josie wanted to express her feelings for him privately,rnbut in retrospect, he wasn't so sure. There was something about thernurgency of the letter's tone that disturbed him. Something didn'trnquite add up. Hernunderstood not wanting to have such a forbidden discussion on schoolrngrounds, and, her choice of a small, out of the way café allrnthe way across town from South Glen in which to meet indicated shernrealized the inherent danger for him as well. Yet, she'd said shernwas looking to speak with him as a friend …and in fact, thernonly one she could trust. And howrnshe said she couldn't speak to him about it at school… Sam rubbedrnhis chin thoughtfully. If she'd wanted to make a declaration ofrnlove badly enough, he was sure she could have found a secluded enoughrnspot here at South Glen in which to do it. For thernfirst time, true fear shivered through Sam. What if he was wrongrnabout her intentions? What if…? What if she were in some kind ofrndanger? From Guy…or perhaps even her Uncle Gus? It was obvious thatrnJosie's uncle didn't support her or her dreams of becoming arnwriter at all if he wouldn't even consider the possibility ofrnletting Josie attend college. Perhaps there was something morernsinister going on… Samrnshuddered to even think about anyone hurting his sweet Josie. Sam'srnlips flattened to a thin line as he folded up Josie's note and putrnit into his breast pocket. This new development put him in a tightrnspot. He knew that if he was ever caught meeting with Josie in secretrnoutside of school it could end his career, especially if therndiscussion included what he thought it might. Yet Josiernhad taken a huge risk of her own writing the letter, and thernpossibility remained that she could be in real trouble. Sam knew hernwouldn't be able to live with himself if he ignored Josie's cryrnfor help and something happened to her because of it. Faced withrnthat horrifying possibility, Sam knew he had no choice. Josie neededrnhis help, and, consequences be damned, he was going to give it tornher. - Josiernscurried across the student lot to Bambi and yanked open its creakyrndoor, placing a hand over her heart as she laid her head back againstrnthe seat and closed her eyes. Snatching a paper bag from thernpassenger seat floor, she held it up over her nose and mouth,rnbreathing deeply into it to keep from hyperventilating. Her heart wasrnpounding a mile a minute and she felt vaguely lightheaded. She stillrncouldn't believe she'd done it; she'd actually done it: writtenrnthe letter she'd longed to write to Sam for weeks. Shernlowered the hand that clutched the bag and sighed. Gus would be lividrnif he found out what she was about to do. Perhaps he would even firernher…but she prayed he'd never discover her duplicity so shernwouldn't have to find out. Still,rnJosie reasoned, she honestly couldn't see how one personrnknowing her secret could possibly jeopardize her mission. Therernreally wasn't any risk to the newspaper; of that she felt sure.rnAfter all, she knew that, even if he ended up being upset with her,rnSam was the kind of man who would still keep her secret. Closingrnthe car door at last, Josie put the key into the ignition and turned.rnBambi's engine feebly turned over before rumbling roughly to life.rnShaking her head at the deplorable condition of her brother's car,rnJosie put the gear into reverse. Her mindrnon her potential meeting with Sam, Josie felt her heart race, whetherrnin fear or excitement, she didn't know. She could only pray thatrnonce she'd explained herself fully, he would understand. It wasrnalmost too much to hope to think that Sam might ever return herrnmore-than-friends intentions, especially after revealing how muchrnshe'd lied to him. Yet, as improbable as it might seem to her atrnthe moment, she couldn't deny that the tantalizing possibilityrnremained. Suddenly,rnJosie's breath caught in her chest as an ominously cold wavernsplashed over her: she'd just realized that in order to find outrnhow Sam felt about her, she'd have to survive her meeting with Gusrnfirst. - By therntime Josie pulled Bambi to a sputtering halt into a miraculouslyrnempty parking space in front of the Sun-Times building, her handsrnwere shaking on the steering wheel. Turning the key and pulling itrnout of the ignition, Josie again reached for the paper bag, givingrnherself a minute of slow in and out breathing to calm her frazzledrnnerves. In her current state, Josie wished she were doing just aboutrnanything else besides meeting with her crusty boss. Sherncrossed the main lobby and rode the elevator to the 6thrnfloor without incident, but the moment the elevator doors slid openrnand she stepped out, it was as if she had entered another world. Thernnormal chattery din petered out into an eerie silence as a hundredrnpair of eyes turned to stare at Josie. She felt her cheeks flame asrnshe hurried down the bullpen aisle, trying to keep her eyes downcast.rnEven her friends Cynthia and Anita stood staring, open-mouthed, asrnshe passed. She felt a little like Sandra Locke from The Gauntlet ,rnjust moments before all those dirty cops opened fire on the bus shernwas on. All toornsoon, Josie reached the doorway to Gus' office. Without evenrnlooking up, he said in his normal brisk tone, \"Come in, Geller…andrnshut the door behind you.\" Josie didrnwhat Gus asked, trying not to make eye contact with any of her manyrnco-workers who were still staring at her. She had to consciouslyrnrestrain herself from frantically closing all the blinds in thernoffice, just so those eyes wouldn't bore into the back of herrnskull. Gus hadrngotten up to stand beside the television in his office, the one withrnwhich he constantly monitored her student life at South Glen South.rnHe gestured toward the chair closest to him in front of his desk.rn\"Sit,\" he ordered, without preamble. Josie satrnabruptly, which was actually a good thing, seeing that her knees hadrnbeen shaking so badly, she wasn't sure how much longer they wouldrnhave held her up. Twisting her hands nervously in her lap, Josiernwaited for the other shoe to drop. She didn'trnhave long to wait. Almost immediately Gus said, \"Geller…what the hell did you think you were doing today?!?\" \"Wh…whatrndo you mean?\" Josie stammered. \"In casernyou'd forgotten, I'm paying you to be there at South Glen Southrnbecause you're supposed to be getting a story …not to flirtrnwith that English teacher of yours!\" Gus bellowed, a sound thatrnactually shook the glass walls of his office. Josie feltrnher face burning in shame. The absolute last thing she wanted at thernmoment was to have to admit to Gus that she had feelings for SamrnCoulson. \"I…I haven't been flirting with S…Mr. Coulson,\"rnshe defended tremulously. \"Bullsh-t,\"rnGus retorted. \"You've been flirting with the man for weeks !\" Josiernthought back over the past few weeks, over many afternoons spent inrnSam's company, working on prom decorations and discussing books andrnpoems they'd read. She scoured her mind for any instances in whichrnshe'd been trying to flirt with him, and came up empty. \"Irnhonestly don't know what you mean,\" Josie replied finally. \"Gus,rnyou know me; I wouldn't know how to flirt with a guy even ifrnI wanted to!\" Slowly, Josie raised her head and met her boss'rnstare, trying to show him that she was speaking the truth. Gusrnstudied Josie for a long, silent moment before letting out a long,rnfrustrated sigh. \"Fine…\" he admitted at last. \"I'll givernyou that. But that doesn't change the fact that you have been doingrnit, even if you haven't meant to.\" Gus put up a hand when itrnlooked like Josie was going to refute him. \"Look, I know. I'vernbeen watching you, remember?\" He pointed at the TV with the remoternhe was holding in his hand. \"Ask anyone out in that bullpen andrnthey'll tell you…it's been quite apparent.\" Great ,rnJosie moaned inwardly, wishing the ground would swallow her up. Itrnwasn't bad enough that she had feelings for a man she couldn'trnhave, but now it seemed she was so obvious that everyone in herrnoffice knew how she felt! \"Luckilyrnfor you,\" Gus went on, a ghost of a smile twitching at the cornersrnof his mouth, \"it seems that your teacher isn't exactly immune tornyour charms.\" Josie'srnheart felt like it skipped a beat before pounding against her ribs atrndouble-time. \"What?\" she breathed in disbelief. \"Yeah, Irnwas beginning to think that this assignment was so hopeless that yournwere actually gonna cost me my job. But this…this is fantastic!rnThis one's a real whiz-banger! I'm proud of you.\" Josie'srnblood felt like ice in her veins as Gus practically crowed,rn\"Student-Teacher Relations: How Close Is Too Close…\" Josie'srnmouth dropped open in horror as she watched her boss banner the wordsrnin the air with his hands. \"We're gonna blow the lid offrnit!\" Josie rosernto her feet without even realizing she'd done so. \"There is nornlid! There's nothing going on between Sa…\" Josie caughtrnherself, but his narrowed eyes told her Gus had noticed the sliprnanyway, \" Mr. Coulson and me.\" Gusrnactually snorted. \"Yeah, and I'm Peter Pan.\" \"Therernisn't!\" Josie insisted, stamping her foot. \"At least…\"rnJosie swallowed her humiliation as she mumbled, \"there's nothingrngoing on on his side…\" Gus staredrnat Josie as if she'd grown a second head. \"You're joking…\"rnhe said in disbelief. \"You can't be serious…\" Thernunchanged look on Josie's face gave him his answer. \"Yournreally don't know?\" Gus asked at last, incredulous. Shaking hisrnhead, he pointed the remote in his hand at the TV and hit rewind.rnAfter a few seconds, Gus stopped the tape and then hit play. Suddenlyrnshe was staring right into Sam's face displayed on the screen. Shernheard her own voice saying, \"…-guin, I mean?\" Somehowrnwatching the moment again, away from the initial emotions thatrnclouded her thinking, brought everything into sharp focus. Josiernwatched as Sam's eyes searched what would have been her own face. Arnsoftness stole into his eyes, one that took Josie's breath away.rnSlowly she sank bonelessly back into the chair as the Sam on thernscreen murmured, \"Yeah…actually I do.\" At therntime, Josie had believed that Sam must have meant Lara…but, it wasrnnow apparent that Lara was the furthest thing from his mind as hernspoke. His eyes had been riveted to Josie's face as he'd saidrnit…making his actual meaning crystal clear. Before sherncould process that thought further, she noticed the picture tiltrnslightly closer to Sam and knew this must have been the moment thatrnshe had momentarily lost grasp of her senses and given in to herrnyearning. She openedrnher mouth to ask Gus to turn off the picture, not wanting to witnessrnthe humiliation of Sam's rejection again, but the sound died in herrnthroat as Josie witnessed a blazing look fill Sam's features. Hisrneyes again traveled over Josie's face with aching tenderness…and then incredibly,rnunbelievably, his eyes slid closed and his lips parted as he leanedrnin, coming closer and closer to the camera, his intent unmistakable… But at thernlast possible moment, Sam shook his head as if waking from a dream.rnHis head came back up and a look of such self-revulsion and disgustrnengulfed him that tears actually pricked at Josie's eyes justrnwitnessing it. \"Oh my God!\" Sam breathed as he hastily pulledrnback and turned away from the camera. Gus took that opportune momentrnto stop the tape. Josiernplaced a hand over her heart as if somehow that would calm itsrnrelentless pounding. She couldn't believe it; Sam had really almostrnkissed her! \"Threernmore millimeters, and this story would already be at thernprinters…\" Gus sighed as if he regretted Sam's last momentrnchange of heart. Then he patted Josie on the back as if he were arncoach giving her a pep talk during half-time. \"But don't worry…ifrnthe guy's already that far gone, I doubt it will take much morernconvincing to seal the deal…\" Josiernstared up at Gus with both shock and revulsion. Her stomach suddenlyrnfelt as if a cannonball had lodged itself there. \"I…I can't dornit, Gus. I can't do that to him…\" \"Yourndon't have a choice,\" Gus replied flatly. \"Rigfort is alreadyrnbeside himself with excitement about it.\" \"Yournpitched this to Rigfort?!?\" Josie stood again, horrified andrnoutraged. \"Geller…that'srnmy job . It's about time you started doing yours.\" \"Yeah,rnand if I do my job…Sam Coulson will almost certainly losernhis!\" \"Betterrnhim than us…\" Gus muttered, more to himself than to Josie. The soundrnof Josie's slap echoed around the enclosed glass space and filledrnthe ensuing silence. \" You're the one that wanted this assignment, Josie,\" Gus' steely voicernreminded her as he ruefully rubbed a hand across his stinging cheek.rn\"I tried to talk you out of it, but you insisted you could do it.rnAgainst my better judgment, I gave in. I trusted you…and where didrnthat get me? My neck's on the chopping block right next to yours.\" Gus'srneyes narrowed shrewdly. \"I've worked for this paper for almost 15rnyears. I worked my way up from cub reporter to editor in chief, andrnworked every job in between. I'll be damned if I'm goingrnto lose it all now simply because you fell in love with your story.rnEither you get out there and do your job…or else I'll do it for you.\" If Josie'srnanswering look could have killed, Gus would have dropped dead on thernspot. Incensed, she yanked the strap of her purse off the back of thernchair and shoved it onto her shoulder as she turned her back on herrnboss and stomped toward the door. As Josiernshoved open the door to Gus' office, he bellowed after her, \"Callrnme when you've got it!\" -[Chapter 4] Breaking Point, Part 4 - As Josie stormed up thernaisle away from Gus' office, the many eyes that had stared at herrnbefore slid away, embarrassed, ashamed at having witnessed somethingrnso personal. A tall, slight,rndark-haired woman raced up a side corridor, intent on catching up tornJosie. As she pulled up alongside the younger woman, Josie gritted,rn\"Not now, Anita,\" without even slowing her pace. \"B…but, Josie…\"rnAnita stammered, momentarily shocked by the tough-as-nails responsernfrom her best friend. Still, Anita was nothing if not persistent whenrnshe wanted something. She followed Josie all the way through thernbullpen and right into the elevator. \"Anita…\" Josiernsighed ruefully, turning to face her friend in the otherwise desertedrnelevator car. Anita didn't sayrnanything; she just pulled Josie into a soothing embrace. She feltrnJosie hesitate for a moment, and then she relaxed into the hug,rnsniffling back angry tears. Patting Josie softly on the back, Anitarnsaid, \"Don't let Gus get to you…he's just a big jerk. He'srnnot worth it…\" Josie pulled back andrnwiped her eyes on the palms of her hands. \"You don't understand,\"rnshe replied, trying to get her breathing back under control. \"Whatrnhe wants me to do to Sam…I can't Anita! I won't. But ifrnI don't… he will. Oh God…what am I going to do?\" \"There's got to berna way around it, Jos,\" Anita offered hopefully. \" How? \" Josierndemanded. \"How exactly is that? Gus has already told Rigfort aboutrnit!\" \"I don't know,\"rnAnita admitted, \"I don't know. But, look at it this way…atrnleast it's Friday. You don't have to know the answer untilrnMonday, and I'm sure between the two of us we can come up withrnsomething before then.\" Josie looked down atrnher shoes and shrugged lifelessly. \"Look,\" Anita said,rntrying desperately to cheer up her friend, \"How 'bout I stop overrnlater and we can have a brainstorming session. I'll bring the icerncream…\" she lilted teasingly. Josie seemed to hardlyrnhave heard her. \"Yeah, sure…whatever.\" The elevator reachedrnthe lobby and the doors slid open. Josie stepped out, but Anitarnstayed inside, needing to go back up to work. Anita called out afterrnher, \"It's going to be all right, Josie; you'll see…\" Josie sniffed and shookrnher head as she walked away, knowing in her heart that it wouldn't. As Josie pushed thernglass entrance door outward and stepped onto the street, a brisk,rncool wind blew in off the lake, raising gooseflesh on her arms. Josiernwrapped her arms around herself, rubbing her hands up and down herrnbare skin to conserve warmth, but it didn't seem to help. Inrntruth, she felt just as chilled inside. Josie shoved the keyrninto Bambi's driver's side door, unlatching the lock and yankedrnthe sticky door open, plopping herself onto the seat and pulling therndoor shut behind her. Sorrowfully, she leanedrnforward and rested her head on the steering wheel as her eyesrnsuddenly clouded up with tears. Oh, God …Josie thought, herrnbreath catching in her chest as she held back a sob. The letter .rnJosie had had so much hope in her heart as she'd written it,rnpraying with all her might that Sam might just understand and forgivernher once she'd explained herself. But now, knowing that no matterrnwhat happened, his life was about to be ruined because of her? Howrncould he possibly forgive her now, let alone love her? The onlyrnwonderful thing to ever happen in her life, and already she'drndestroyed it. Josie gasped as purernmisery poured out of her. She grasped the steering wheel with bothrnhands and squeezed as she sobbed, tears dripping onto the lap of herrnpretty white dress until it was soaked. After a little while,rnher tears subsided and Josie sat up, reaching across the seat for arnnapkin before dabbing at her eyes with it. There was nothing for it,rnnow. She'd already made her date with Destiny by giving Sam thatrnletter. The risk of losing her job meant nothing to her now; all thatrnmattered was Sam. She'd said she would meet him; and meet him shernwould. She had been determined to tell him the truth; now it wasrnabsolutely essential she do so, even though it probably meantrnthat Sam Coulson would end up hating her. At least he would bernforewarned. A grim determinationrnstraightening her spine, she started up the car and headed for home. - Josie had quicklyrnchanged out of her white dress and heels, opting instead for herrnNorthwestern Wildcats sweatshirt and a pair of jeans and sneakers:rncomfort clothes. Then she climbed back into Bambi for a sputteringrntrip across town. - Josie arrived at thernCafé with several minutes to spare. She wanted some time torncompose herself before Sam arrived. That was, if he arrived.rnThere was no guarantee that he would even show up. Still in thought, Josiernpulled open the door to the café and small bells tinkledrnoverhead. Almost immediately, a graying woman in her 50's walkedrntoward her. \"Josie, what brings you to our part of town tonight?rnThe poetry reading is next Friday.\" Despite all her worryrnand fear, Josie smiled. \"I know. Ruth,\" she said, leaning forwardrnto give the plump woman a hug, \"How are you?\" \"Better than you, itrnlooks like,\" Ruth replied frankly. \"What's wrong with you,rngirl?\" \"Oh, Ruth…tornexplain that, it would take a week.\" Ruth put a comfortingrnarm around Josie's shoulders as they walked further into the café.rn\"Now, now, it can't be all that bad.\" Ruth put up arnstaying hand before Josie could protest. \"It never is.\" Shernpeered at Josie shrewdly and then stopped short, pulling Josie to arnhalt next to her. \"Goodness gracious! After all those Friday nightsrnalone you spent here during college, I never thought I'd see thernday!\" \"What?\" Josiernasked, confused. Ruth leaned in, as ifrnshe were about to share a secret. \"You're in love,\" sherndeclared. Josie's eyes widened.rn\"What? No, no I'm not…\" she protested. Ruth started walkingrnagain, her arm pulling Josie in her wake. \"Your pretty blush tellsrnme otherwise,\" she smiled. \"Now, is that what'srntroubling you?\" \"No…Yes… oh, Irndon't know!\" Josie moaned. \"It's much more complicated thanrnthat.\" Ruth pulled Josierntoward her usual table by the window. \"Well, I've got somethingrnthat I'm sure will help…\" Ruth stopped talking atrnJosie pulled out of her grasp. \"Not my usual table today, Ruth. Irnneed something a bit more…private, if you don't mind.\" Josiernglanced apprehensively at the window. Ruth's eyebrows rosernexpectantly. \"I'm…expectingrnsomeone,\" Josie stammered, heat flooding her cheeks once more. A knowing smile curledrnRuth's lips. \"Oh, I see…\" she said. \"A male someone,rnperhaps?\" Josie nodded, notrntrusting herself to speak. \"Well, in thatrncase…something a bit more private,\" Ruth said. Josie knew where Ruthrnwas leading her even before she grasped her hand: a small boothrnliterally around the corner from the rest of the room, out of thernline of sight of the windows and everyone else in the room except forrnthose going in and out of the kitchen. This was exactly where Josiernhad envisioned in her mind the moment she'd chosen this spot forrnher and Sam to meet. \"Thanks,\" Josiernmurmured thankfully, slipping onto the bench seat facing toward thernrest of the room. \"I knew you'd understand.\" \"Can I get yournanything, Josie?\" \"Just some decaf,rnthanks. I don't think I could handle any caffeine right now.\" Ruth wandered aroundrnthe corner and came back after a few moments with an oversized mugrnand a coffee pot. Pouring the steaming brown liquid into the ceramicrncup, Ruth asked, \"So, what's his name?\" Josie stirred in somerncream and sugar and took a long sip from the steaming mug. \"Sam…SamrnCoulson.\" \"Hmm, that's a nicernname. What's he do?\" \"He's a teacher,\"rnJosie replied, praying Ruth wouldn't ask much more; she didn'trnknow how she could possibly explain. Ruth nodded inrnapproval. \"When are you expecting him?\" \"Five thirty…that'srnif he even comes…\" Josie sighed, leaning her elbows against therntable. Ruth looked affrontedrnon Josie's behalf. \"With a pretty little thing like you waitingrnfor him? He'll be here.\" Josie aimed a gratefulrnsmile at the woman and then stared down at the linoleum table. Shernwasn't nearly as sure as Ruth seemed to be. Ruth seemed to sensernJosie's emotional retreat. She patted Josie on the armrncomfortingly. \"Well, you need anything, you know where I'll be.\"rnAnd she turned the corner to check on the rest of her customers. Josie slid aside thernribbed sleeve of her sweatshirt to reveal her watch. 5:22pm, it read.rnHer heart started racing and she had to fight the urge tornhyperventilate. She thought back to what she had learned thisrnafternoon…. not about what Gus wanted her to do, but about what shernhad watched on that television screen; the blazing look in SamrnCoulson's eyes just before he leaned toward her… And suddenly, Josie'srneyes were wet, and she sniffled, trying to hold back the tears thatrnseemed determined to fall. She felt cornered, trapped, like arnwounded animal. She would have given anything to be anywhere butrnwhere she was. She wished beyond wishing that she could turn backrntime; take back what she'd done, if only to keep Sam from gettingrnhurt, even if it meant never having met him. All that was left now,rnas hard as it would be, was the truth. She owed Sam that much. No,rnshe owed him much more for having opened up her eyes and her heart,rnfor making her feel cared for, even cherished…things she neverrnthought she'd ever feel. - Sam sat in his car,rnstaring at the little café across the street. Seeing that itrnwas just around the corner from the campus of Northwestern, hernexpected the place to be teeming with undergrads. Instead, it seemedrnrather quiet for early on a Friday night. Josie obviously knewrnwhat she was doing when she picked this spot , Sam thought,rnrunning his hands through his hair for about the hundredth time inrnthe past hour. All the way across town, Sam had debated the wisdom ofrnhis decision to meet with Josie. Logic told him this wasrna stupid, stupid choice; that there was no way he should have even considered this meeting. His heart, however, told him that hernneeded to come, that he needed to hear what Josie had to say, that hernneeded to make sure that she was all right. Sam leaned his headrnagainst the steering wheel, staring at the car's speedometerrnwithout seeing it. He had never been so nervous in his life, and hernwas afraid to examine why that was. He glanced at his watch: 5:32pm.rnHe should have met her two minutes ago…after all, he'd been herernfor five. Yet, he hadn't been able to muster the courage to openrnthe car door. - Josie held both handsrnagainst the sides of her coffee cup, keeping her otherwise nervelessrnfingers warm. She stared at the clock on the opposite wall, itsrnsecond hand keeping time with her heartbeats. 5:30 had come andrngone…and no sign of Sam. Josie sighed, blinking back disappointedrntears. Of course he wouldn't come, she chided herself. Whyrnshould he come? Gus was wrong, she decided with a miserable sniffle. Whatever it was he thoughtrnhe'd seen in Sam's face that afternoon, whatever behavior hernthought he'd witnessed, it just wasn't true. Because if Gus hadrnbeen right, then Sam would definitely have… Josie's train ofrnthought derailed as she heard the familiar jingling of the caférndoor opening. - Sam wondered if Josiernwas even there; he certainly didn't see her anywhere. Again, herntried to peer through the café's windows to see who wasrninside. Don't be an idiot, he scolded himself mentally, of course she's in there. She wasrnthe one who asked you, remember? Absently, Sam tugged atrnthe neck of his shirt, which felt about two sizes too small. Undoingrnthe knot at his throat, Sam yanked at the tail of the tie, pulling itrnfree of his collar and dumping it on the seat next to him. Hernunbuttoned the top button and took a deep, heaving breath, as if he'drnjust surfaced from an underwater dive. \"Okay, this isrnstupid,\" he said aloud to himself. \"Nothing's going to bernsolved by just sitting here.\" Forcing his hand onto the door latch,rnSam pushed the car door open and stood, pulling the door closernagainst his chest to let a car in the street go by him beforernshutting it. Sam checked the streetrnfor traffic before jogging safely across. Looking down at his hands,rnhe realized they were clammy; his palms were actually sweating.rnSighing, he surreptitiously wiped his hands on his pants. Then,rntaking a deep breath, he pulled open the door. The place was warm andrncozy, homier than he was expecting, even with all the Wildcatrnmemorabilia decorating the walls. It reminded him a bit of that placernNana's not far from South Glen where they held poetry and bookrnreadings from time to time. Sam's eyes scannedrnthe tables, searching for a glimpse of golden hair or eyes ofrnpiercing blue, but none of the café's current patronsrnmatched that description. Sam's mind whirled arnmile a minute, trying to decide what this meant. He doubted thatrnJosie would have written him that note if she had not meant to keeprnthe meeting. Yet, he did not see her. Sam's mind slid back to hisrnearlier fears. Had something happened with Guy or Gus…somethingrnthat prevented her from coming? Dimly, Sam registeredrnthat someone was speaking to him. Looking beside him, he noticed arnpleasant middle-aged woman with an apron tied around her waist.rnDistractedly, he asked, \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" The woman smiled inrnapparent understanding. \"I said, 'May I help you?'\" \"Oh,\" Sam said, asrnif finally realizing the woman was speaking to him. \"I'm…uh…sortrnof looking for someone.\" A twinkle blossomed inrnthe woman's eyes, making her suddenly seem much younger. \"Ah…Irnsee. You must be Sam.\" Taken aback, he staredrnat the woman, astonished. \"How did you….?\" \"Hi, I'm Ruth,\"rnshe interrupted, sticking out her hand for him to shake. \"If you'llrnfollow me, Josie's back here.\" - Josie gasped as shernheard the familiar voice. He came! Oh my God, he came! shernthought, as she wiped at her eyes with the sleeve of her sweatshirt.rnWith panic setting in full force, Josie tried to just breathe as shernheard footfalls coming in her direction. - Sam shook the woman'srnhand, curious about her greeting. Obviously, this woman knewrnJosie…and apparently knew she was expecting him. Considering thernrather unique conditions under which they were meeting, he wonderedrnhow much Ruth knew about Josie's predicament. \"Is Josie all right?\"rnhe asked Ruth quietly, not wanting to be overheard. Ruth's brown eyesrnseemed to bore a hole through him, as if she could see right insidernof him. It was disconcerting, and he fought the urge to squirm underrnher gaze. \"Oh, I expect she will be…now that you're here,\"rnshe replied at last. But before Sam had timernto ponder what Ruth had meant, they turned a corner…and there wasrnJosie. She had changed sincernhe saw her last, blending into the surroundings nicely with herrnpurple Northwestern sweatshirt and blue jeans. Yet, Josie did notrnseem herself. In fact, it looked as if she had been crying. Herrnbeautiful eyes were red-rimmed and watery and her whole manner seemedrndepressed, downtrodden. Sam felt as if a vicernwere suddenly squeezing his heart. His throat felt also feltrnconstricted as he breathed, \"Josie, what's the matter? Are yournokay?\" His worry nowrnoverpowering any feelings of nervousness, Sam sat and slid down thernbench seat across from Josie until he was directly facing her. Josie lifted her eyesrnto Sam's, her breath catching in her throat as she the worry etchedrnon his face. \"I…wasn't sure you'd come,\" she admitted,rnbarely above a whisper. \"How could I not?\"rnSam replied, reaching out to put a soothing hand over hers. \"Yournneeded me.\" The tenderness in hisrnvoice and touch was almost enough to set Josie crying all over again. Sam seemed to sensernthis, because he reached across the table with his other hand,rngrasping her free hand as well. \"Hey…everything's going to bernall right, Josie. You'll see.\" Guilt cascading overrnher, Josie carefully extracted her hands from Sam's and wrappedrnthem around the now-tepid coffee cup in front of her. \"No, itrnwon't.\" Sam reached across therntable to tip Josie's chin up, forcing her to meet his eyes. \"Yes,rnit will,\" he insisted gently. After a moment's pause, he said,rn\"Josie, whatever it is…I'll help you. I promise.\" Josie let out a soundrnthat was half sniffle, half snort. \"After I tell you…\" shernwhispered, almost more to herself than to him. \"You're going tornhate me…I just know it.\" Despite himself, Samrnbroke out his scolding teacher's voice. \"Josie…there is nothingrnyou could say or do that would make me hate you,\" he said firmly.rn\"Nothing.\" Josie stared down intornher own lap, as if she couldn't bring herself to even look at him.rn\"Well, I won't hold you to that,\" she said bitterly. Sam hadn't evenrnnoticed that Ruth had left until she returned with a pot of coffeernand a mug. Placing both on the table next to his elbow, she noddedrnand gave them their privacy. Bringing his attentionrnback to Josie, he hesitated before asking carefully, \"Josie…arernyou all right? Are you in trouble? Is…someone hurting you?\" Josie's eyes widenedrnas his meaning became clear. \"No…no, no, no. It's nothing likernthat.\" Sam's eyes connectedrnwith hers. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes,\" Josiernassured him. \"I'm very sure.\" Sam sat back againstrnthe bench seat and let out a breath. \"Good,\" he said. \"I wasrnafraid that maybe Guy was…pressuring you, or perhaps—forgivernme—your uncle…\" \"My uncle?\" Josiernasked in confusion. Sam gave Josie arnstrange look. \"Yeah, your Uncle Gus. The one who thinks college isrnsuch a waste of time…\" \"Oh. Oh!\" Josiernsaid suddenly, realizing whom Sam was talking about. \"No, it'srnnot that.\" \"Then what?\" And here it was: thernmoment of truth. Josie looked at Sam, opened her mouth…and foundrnherself unable to speak. Closing her eyes, sherntook several deep breaths, willing her heart to slow down. Then shernlooked at Sam and said, \"You…should probably fortify yourselfrnwith a cup of coffee. I have a feeling you're going to need it.\" Sam chuckled at thernknowledge that Josie knew about his weakness for java. \"That bad,rnhuh?\" he commiserated, pouring himself a steaming cupful and addingrnhis requisite cream and sugar. \"You have no idea…\"rnJosie muttered. Sam wrapped his handsrnaround the mug and lifted it to his lips. He took several deeprnswallows before setting the cup down again. \"Ahh,\" he said,rnalmost reverently, \"that's some gooood coffee…\" Josie smiled despiternherself. Sam's love of coffee was practically legendary at SouthrnGlen South. \"Now,\" Sam saidrnseriously, \"what was it that you needed to tell me?\" \"I…\" A lump inrnJosie's throat forced her to swallow before continuing, \"…don'trneven know where to begin.\" \"Well,\" he saidrnencouragingly, \"the beginning's usually a good place to start.\" Josie nodded, andrnclosed her eyes for a moment, gathering her thoughts. Then, with herrneyes still closed (if she'd had to look at him, she knew she'drnnever get the words out…), she said, \"You remember my first dayrnin your class?\" \"Of course,\" Samrnreplied automatically. \"You defined the word 'pastoral' forrnme… and gave me its derivation.\" He smiled at the memory. \"Do you remember whatrnyou asked me after that?\" Sam frowned and shookrnhis head. \"No…should I?\" \"You asked me if Irnwas really seventeen.\" Sam could not figurernout how this was significant. His eyebrows scrunched together inrnconfusion. \"So? It was just a joke, Josie.\" \"I lied.\" \"What are you talkingrnabout?\" said Sam, still not understanding where Josie was goingrnwith this line of thought. Josie took a deeprnbreath and said it all at once, as if afraid that if she stopped,rnshe'd chicken out. \"I lied about who I am. To you. Well, torneveryone, actually. I lied to everybody . Not that I wantedrnto…but I did.\" Sam looked at Josierndoubtfully. \"So, what? You're not really Josie Geller?\" \"No…I mean yes…Irnmean, yes I am Josie Geller, but…\" Sam smiled. \"Wait…isrnthis about you telling everyone you were from Bali? I told you…Irnalready saw your transcripts. I know you're from Scranton. Not arnbig deal, Josie.\" \"No,\" Josiernstammered, flustered. \"No, that's not it…\" Sam leaned back againstrnhis seat again. \"Okay, then you got me. What are you talkingrnabout?\" \"I…\" Josiernswallowed nervously and forced herself to make eye contact with Sam.rn\"I am Josie Geller…but I'm not seventeen.\" -[Chapter 5] BreakingrnPoint, Part 5 - A/N: I'm sorry it's taken sooo long to update anything. That's not by choice but by the intrusion of R/L. I have not abandoned my other story, just haven't had the time to work on updating. Thanks again for your interest! - Sam staredrnat Josie, dumbfounded. He didn't know exactly what revelation he'drnbeen expecting to hear (although he could think of one or two he'drnbeen hoping to hear), but this definitely wasn't it.rn\"Wait…what?\" Josie'srnvoice shook as she repeated, \"I am not seventeen years old.\" Sam'srneyes drifted away from Josie's, unfocused, as he tried to makernsense of what she had just told him. \"So, then…\" he trailedrnoff, thinking out loud, \"…you're, what, sixteen? You skipped arngrade?\" His eyes slid back to Josie's face for confirmation. She shookrnher head. \"No.\" Sam triedrnthe next most likely scenario. \"Eighteen then. You were held back arnyear when you were young and didn't want anyone to know?\" Josiernshook her head again. \"Nineteen?\"rnSam's voice held the desperation of a man clutching at straws. \"No.\"rnJosie paused as she took a deep breath, trying to calm her heart raternthat was quickly spiraling out of control. Hesitantly, Josie reachedrnacross the table and placed a hand on top of Sam's. \"Sam…\"rnshe began, deliberately using his first name for the first time,rntrying to ensure he was paying full attention. It worked.rnHis eyes flew to hers, riveted. - Samrnblinked as Josie denied being nineteen, too . It doesn't makernsense; none of this makes sense! What kind of game is she…? But thenrnhe felt her soft hand settle on top of his, and her touch made himrnlose his train of thought. But what she did next literally stole hisrnbreath away. She said his name—his first name. It both shocked andrnthrilled him to hear the lilting way it rolled off her tongue. Arnshiver of excitement rippled through him at the sound. It felt sornnatural—so right —for her to call him that. His eyes wererndrawn to her face, to her lips, like a moth to flame. He staredrnat her, watching her lips move as she said, \"I'm…not even arnreal student. I've already graduated from high school.\" Bloodrnthundered through Sam's veins, and the rushing sound in his earsrnblocked out all else. As he stared at Josie, he felt curiouslyrnlightheaded, as if he were about to faint. Sam closed his eyes tornstop the world from spinning and took a deep breath, held it, and letrnit out slowly. Then he opened his eyes again to stare at Josie inrnshock. \"Who are you?\" he croaked at last. The horrorrnmirrored in Sam's eyes at this newest revelation was almost enoughrnto make Josie burst into tears. Her voice thick with emotion, shernsaid, \"My name is Josie Geller...and I work for the Sun Times….\" Sam'srnbrain felt fuzzy and sluggish. It took him several long moments forrnher sentence to register. Then, it was as if the haze in his mindrnsuddenly cleared and he could see the whole picture fully formed.rn\"And you're a reporter,\" he finished for her, his voice as hardrnas steel. He pulled his hand away from Josie's as if he'd beenrnscalded, wrapping it around his coffee mug so tightly his knucklesrnwere white. \"You're an undercover reporter,\" hernclarified. Josierncould not miss the accusatory tone with which Sam said it. She feltrnthe pain coming off him in waves. She lowered her eyes to the table;rnnot wanting to see the hatred she knew would soon form in Sam'srnface. \"Yes,\" she whispered, anguished. The depthrnand breadth of Josie's betrayal hit Sam full force. Moments they'drnspent together over the past weeks flew through his mind, one afterrnthe other, each one of them now tainted by the knowledge that theyrnwere… \"Lies,\" Sam choked the last word of his thoughts aloud.rn\"All of it, lies…\" \"No!\"rnJosie cried, and tears spilled over her lower lids to roll uncheckedrndown her cheeks. She reached across the table and grasped Sam'srnforearm in desperation. \"No, Sam…it wasn't, I swear…\" Sam glaredrnat her…but he did not immediately throw off her hand. Encouragedrnslightly by this, she continued, still holding on to his arm, \"Yes,rnI know I told you I was seventeen, and yes, I pretended to be arnstudent, but Sam…the person I was—am—with you…none of that was a lie. I've never shared so much of my hopes and fears andrndreams with anyone else in my entire life. I…was always too afraid.rnBut you…you made it so easy to trust…\" \"…Whichrnis apparently something that was foolish for me to do,\" Samrnsnapped. \"How do I know that this wasn't all part of the plan?rnHow can you possibly expect me to trust anything you have tornsay now?\" \"Please,rnSam…just listen. If you hate me and never want to see me again whenrnI'm all done, then so be it, but at least give me a chance tornexplain…\" Josie pleaded. Sam satrnback, his arms crossed across his chest, as he glared at Josie acrossrnthe table. Surprisingly, even though she looked terrified, Josie'srngaze did not waver from his. After a long moment, Sam let out anrnexasperated sigh. \"Fine,\" he clipped. \"When Irncame to South Glen South, I had no idea what I was getting myselfrninto. At first, all I could think about was how this was the bigrnbreak I'd been waiting my whole life for. But then…I started tornremember: My first high school experience was less than idyllic…\"rnJosie snickered darkly at the gross understatement, \"and I wasn'trnlooking forward to going through that again. But no matter how hardrnit was to get up that morning and put myself back into high school,rnit was nothing compared to the amount of lies I had to tell thatrnfirst 24 hours…\" \"I guessrnI never realized how much actual lying was involved in an undercoverrnassignment,\" Josie explained. \"I hate lying, and here Irnwas, having to do it all the time, every day. But then…\" shernstole a shy glance at Sam, \"everything suddenly became morerncomplicated. I started to fit in, of a fashion. I had started to makernfriends: Aldys and David, the rest of the Denominators…and most ofrnall, you.\" Josiernstudied her hands, trying to ignore the heat rising in her cheeks asrnshe admitted, \"You always seemed to know just the right thing tornsay if I was having a bad day; you knew how to make me laugh. And yournbelieved in me, and made me start to believe in myself.\" Arnglistening pair of tears hung from Josie's lashes, threatening tornfall. \"Suddenly the stakes were higher; I was no longer lying tornstrangers: I was lying to people I had begun to care about. But evenrnthen, I kept doing it, because I felt I had to. My job depended onrnit. But the longer the charade went on, the more ensnared I became inrnthe web of lies. Suddenly, after I had given up all hope of it, Irnfound myself accepted by the popular kids. I was invited to join thernprom committee. And I got to spend more time with you.\" \"And Irnfound…that the more I got to know you…the more there was to like.rnYou were kind, thoughtful, and sweet. We had so many things inrncommon, even though there was no way for you to know that.\" The blushrnon Josie's cheeks deepened and her voice was barely above arnwhisper. Hardly aware that she was speaking aloud, she divulged, \"I'mrnnot exactly sure when it happened, but…somewhere along the way, thernlines started to blur. Despite the impossibility of the situation: myrnassignment, you thinking I was only seventeen, your… girlfriend …\"rnThe last word came out in a mortified mumble. She had to clear thernlump from her throat before she could continue. \"…I foundrnmyself,\" Josie closed her eyes, steeling herself for what she wasrnabout to admit, \"…becoming more and more attracted to you.\" Sam'srneyes widened at this admission and a jolt of awareness slashedrnthrough him. His heart began to thump wildly. He couldn't believernwhat he was hearing. Josie had actually confessed that she wasrnattracted to him! Part of him wanted to reach across the table, pullrnher into his arms, and kiss her senseless…but the more prudent partrnstill felt betrayed by all the lies she'd told. Josierntwisted her hands in her lap, her cheeks positively flaming now. \"Irntried not to…I really did! But…I just couldn't seem to help it.rnWhenever we were together…it was like the rest of the world justrnmelted away. Or, at least it did for me…\" Her voicerndwindled away into nothingness, humiliated beyond words at her ownrnastounding confession. She had never meant to tell Sam any of that,rneven in light of what she'd learned this afternoon. After all, nornmatter what else, Sam was still taken. Josie stared down at her lap,rnno longer able to even look at him. - Sam closedrnhis eyes, letting the knowledge that Josie felt the same things herndid for her wash over him. It was like being handed a gift, yet onernhe wasn't sure he wanted to accept. After all, there was so muchrnthat she'd lied about, he wasn't sure how much of what he lovedrnabout Josie was really her, and how much of it was part of herrndisguise. Still, hernhad to admire her gumption. What she'd just admitted took anrnincredible amount of courage, and if she were anywhere near as shy asrnthe teenaged Josie had seemed, then it was a truly amazing feat. Samrnstudied Josie, taking in her bright red cheeks, her twisting hands,rnher downcast eyes, her lashes rimmed with glittering tears…andrndecided that if she could take such a leap of faith, then so couldrnhe. Staring atrntendrils of steam wafting up from his coffee mug, Sam found he neededrnto clear his throat before he could speak. When he did, his voice wasrnquiet and husky. \"It…wasn't just you.\" Shocked,rnJosie's head shot up. \"What?\" she breathed, unable to believernwhat she'd just heard. \"It wasrnlike that for me, too,\" Sam repeated. \"Surely you must havernknown.\" A flickerrnof hope blazed in Josie's chest as Sam's eyes traveled slowlyrnupward to meet hers. \"I…I didn't know until this afternoon,rnwhen…\" Josie's voice trailed off, nervous and afraid tornactually verbalize what had almost happened between them. \"…whenrnI almost kissed you,\" Sam finished for her. Heatrncolored Josie's cheeks again and she found she could no longer meetrnSam's gaze. \"Yes,\" she whispered. Hearing him say it instantlyrnbrought the moment to mind, and Josie closed her eyes, lost in thernwonder of it. A ghost ofrna smile whispered across Sam's lips as he realized that Josie wasrnreliving the moment in her head. As damning as everything seemedrnright now, his instincts told him that he'd made the right decisionrnwhen it came to trusting this woman. Still,rnthough…he wanted answers. \"Josie.\" She openedrnher eyes and met his in answer to his unspoken request. \"I needrnto know,\" Sam said simply, \"how much of the Josie Geller you'vernshown me is who you really are and how much of it was just an act.\" Josiernshrugged an embarrassed shoulder. She wished she could tell Sam shernwas really suave and sophisticated like his girlfriend Lara, but sherncouldn't. She'd told enough lies. With heatrnrising in her cheeks, Josie admitted, \"Other than the necessaryrnlies I told to keep my cover… everything you saw is who Irnam.\" Josie's eyes drifted down to her hands, twisting a napkinrnaround and around until it resembled a rope. \"As amazing as itrnmight seem, I really am this awkward and timid andrnself-conscious and…\" \"…sweetrnand adorable and funny and smart,\" Sam finished for her, reachingrnacross the table to remove the twisted napkin from her fingers andrnreplacing it with his own hand. His warm fingers squeezed her shakingrnones, trying to transmit at least a small amount of comfort, to letrnher know without words that things were going to be okay. Josie letrnout a sound that was half-sniffle, half-snort. \"No, I'm not…\"rnshe protested. \"Yes yournare.\" Josie justrnshook her head in denial. \"Why isrnthat so hard for you to believe?\" he asked softly. \"Maybernbecause no one else ever has,\" Josie mumbled at her lap dejectedly. Sam let gornof one of Josie's hands and crooked his index finger under herrnchin, tilting her head up to face him. \"Come on, Josie…there mustrnhave been someone in high school…\" Now Josierndid snort at the absurdity of Sam's comment. If he'd seen herrnsenior picture, he would never have asked. \"No.\" \"Thenrncollege, surely,\" he reasoned. \"Nope.\" Sam'srnbrows furrowed together with puzzlement. \"What about at work?\" hernpersisted. \"Nuh-uh,\"rnJosie replied, shaking her head. Creasesrnlined Sam's forehead. How was it possible that no one had noticedrnhow incredible a find Josie Geller was? It was inconceivable to him. Josiernseemed to understand Sam's confusion. \"Sam, I…didn't alwaysrnlook like this.\" She gestured toward her blonde curls. \"Whatrndoes that have to do with anything?\" Josie letrnout a long sigh and reluctantly pulled her hands from Sam's so sherncould rummage around inside her purse. Extracting her work ID, shernheld it out. \"This was taken a couple of months before I started this assignment.\" Samrnreached out and took the small plastic card from Josie, holding it uprnso it caught the light above their heads. The photo that met his eyesrnwas so different from the woman sitting across from him that he hadrnto do a double-take to be able to tell it was even the same person.rnWhereas the live Josie was blond, perky, and vivacious with a smilernthat made her eyes glow, her two-dimensional counterpart was matronlyrnand hesitant, her mousy brown hair pulled back into a thick, severernschoolmarm's bun. Yet, evenrnwith all the differences, Josie still had skin like fine porcelain andrnthose heart-stopping blue eyes. Her Mona Lisa-like smile hinted atrnthe woman she had yet to become. Kindness radiated from her face,rnsoftening the otherwise harsh photo. Sam smiled and handed the cardrnback to Josie. \"I willrnadmit that you looked different than you do now, but what does thatrnmatter? It doesn't change who you are on the inside.\" Josiernshook her head and rolled her eyes as she stowed the card back inside herrnpurse. \"You can't tell me that you would have even looked at merntwice looking like that .\" Without arnmoment's hesitation, Sam replied, \"If I'd had any chance to getrnto know you at all, I sure as heck would have noticed you.\" \"How canrnyou even say that? God, Sam…your girlfriend could practically be arnfashion model; I blend into the woodwork. I couldn't hold a candlernnext to her.\" Sam gavernJosie a look that clearly meant that he thought she'd lost herrnmind. \"Are you crazy? She's the one who couldn't hold a candlernto you , Josie. She might be pretty on the outside, but yournhave an inner beauty that Lara will never have,\" hernexplained. \"And besides, she's not my girlfriend. Not anymore.\" Josie'srnmouth literally dropped open from shock. A swooping sensationrndescended upon her as her stomach filled with butterflies.rn\"Wait…what!? Why?\" It wasrnSam's turn to flush slightly. He hadn't meant to blurt out thernnews of his breakup the way he had, but he found that lately he'drnhad a tendency to do unexpected things in Josie's presence. \"Dornyou want the long or the short story?\" Josie wasrnstill too stunned to speak. She shrugged her shoulders, not wantingrnto pressure Sam into telling her anything he didn't want torndivulge. TakingrnJosie's shrug as a sign to continue, Sam explained, \"Well, thernshort story is that I finally figured out what I should have realizedrnyears ago: that I was staying in a bad relationship because I didn'trnwant to admit that we had nothing in common and wanted completelyrndifferent things out of life.\" \"But…\"rnJosie sputtered in disbelief, \"you two seemed so happy together.\" \"Didrnwe really?\" Sam persisted. \"Are you sure about that?\" Josiernclosed her eyes and played the moments back in her head. Every otherrntime she'd pictured those moments at Delloser, Josie had focused onrnher own misery at discovering Sam had a girlfriend and that he wasrnmoving away. This time, she saw the little telltale details thatrnsignaled that not all was right with Sam and Lara's relationship:rnthe way she'd latched onto Sam's arm as if anyone and everyonernmight be a threat, the way Lara made little veiled comments disparaging Sam, the way the light dimmed in Sam's eyes as Lararntalked about him moving to New York. Josiernopened her eyes again. \"No, I guess not.\" Sam smiled in agreement. \"Somernwise person I know recently told me that 'love is too important tornsettle'…\" Josie blushed furiously, knowing that he wasrnreferring to her, \"…and that's exactly what I was doing. I wasrnsettling for less than what I wanted because I was too afraid to takerna chance.\" \"Meetingrnyou opened my eyes, Josie. I don't know if I would have had therncourage to end things if I hadn't known you, if you hadn't madernme see the truth.\" Josiernshook her head in denial, embarrassed at Sam crediting her for his change of heart. \"I don't believe that, Sam.\" \"Well, you should,\" Sam smiledrnwryly. \"We all have our own demons to face, Josie.\" \"Butrnyou're one of the bravest people I know,\" Josie protested. \"Afterrnall, you faced your fear of heights to get on the Ferris Wheel withrnme…\" \"Thatrnmoment was a lot of things, but brave wasn't one of them,\" Samrnadmitted, picking up his half-empty coffee mug and swirling around its contents.rnAgain he felt his cheeks burn hot as he admitted sheepishly, \"Onernmoment I was standing over at the pie-throwing booth. The next momentrnI was right there handing the carny a ticket and climbing in next tornyou. It wasn't even a conscious thought; I heard you were inrntrouble and I just…reacted. I didn't even fully realize what I'drndone until he'd already fastened that bar in place.\" Josie hadrnthought it was Sam's sense of chivalry that had spurred him intornfacing his fear in order to save her some shame. But this explanationrnmade the memory ten times better. Josiernrealized that it hadn't been gallantry; it had been love —however fledgling—that had brought Sam beyond reasonrnand drew him to sit next to her in Bucket 5. Even then, he'd had itrnbad for her, and perhaps hadn't even realized it yet… It wasrnunbelievable, incredible; the absolute sweetest thing she'd everrnheard. \"Andrnthen you were stuck on that ride with me, facing one of your worstrnfears…Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.\" \"I'mrnnot,\" Sam replied. \"Being up there with you made me face a lot ofrnthings. Not just my fear of heights, but it also made me face therntruth about Lara and I…and the feelings I was starting to have forrnyou.\" \"I still think you were very brave,\" she confided to him, her blush growing again. \"Only because you were there to help me through it.\" Sam smiled fondly, thinking of her calming influence, remembering the touch of her soft hand on his arm that helped center him as they swayed high above Chicago. Josie's hand's snaked up to cover both her flaming cheeks. \"I can'trnbelieve this is happening…\" she breathed, as much to herself asrnto Sam. \"I never even dared dream it was possible…\" \"Neitherrndid I.\" Sam reached out to capture Josie's hands in his own,rnplacing them on the table between them. \"But here we are…\" Josie'srneyes met Sam's and the intensity of his gaze took her breath away. Suddenlyrnan impish look stole across Sam's face. He leaned forward as if hernwas imparting a secret of great importance. In a loud stage whisper,rnhe said playfully, \"I told you there was nothing you say tornmake me hate you…\" Josie'srnburble of delighted laughter trailed into a choked cough. In herrnthrill and excitement of learning that Sam had forgiven herrndeception, Josie had forgotten that that was only half of the story.rn\"Well, there's still time,\" she responded with black humor. \"Yournhaven't heard the rest of it yet.\" ","Summary":" Breaking Point by RocknVaughn A/N: Since I am hopelessly stuck on Snowbound at the moment (but stil"},{"Movie":"Professional","Title":"Just like you taught me","Author":"re-fiction","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4025819","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chaptern1: The past and the surpassed… Mathildanreached the roof of the old apartment building, it seemed peaceful asnshe walked across to the north east corner of the roof, and laid downnher mat.

After she left, she pleaded with Tonynthat she was still eager to walk in Leon's shoes and take upncleaning as a profession. Heck, in between doing homework and schoolnshe would constantly exercise and test herself, becoming stronger,nquicker and more cunning. She'd been doing this since she wasntwelve and for her it was like a religion. Shenfamiliarised and mastered a large array of weapons from pistols, tonshotguns, rifles, garrottes, knives and even her bare hands, whichnshe found was always handy if she had her weapons removed. Her goalnwas to match Leon in every way possible, and then some more, to trynand become as skilled, silent and ruthless as possible. Cleaning wasnall about proficiency, taking out the target with minimal disturbancenand then becoming a ghost, disappearing into the crowd. No one wasnbetter at that than Leon but now she would surpass him. She had to ifnshe wanted to live to see another day Still,njust because she wanted to be better than Leon didn't mean shendidn't still look up to him if anything she owed everything to him,nfor keeping her alive, the cleaning lessons and of course hensacrificed his life to save her. He was a real hero for her, for anlack of a better term and it gave her strength that she couldn'tnbuild from working out. She followed his \"rules\" to the letter,nlike they were written in some holy book. \" Nonwomen, no kids\"… Leon's voice echoed. That rule alwaysnstayed in her head, as if Leon was somewhere around, reminding her ofnone of his most important rules. Finallynafter she turned eighteen Tony finally gave her a job, to take outnsome bastard who was supposedly selling weapons to some of the gangsnnear her home in little Italy. She was a bit careless at first, butnshe did better on the next job and the next, until there reallynwasn't a way to further herself without actually becoming a ghost.nBy twenty one, she was exactly where Leon was all those years ago,nshe was a cleaner and she was good at it. She kneltndown on the mat and laid her seemingly innocent, large briefcase downnand opened it up, hearing the somewhat satisfying clicks of the locksnopening, revealing its deadly contents. Leon's old rifle was lockedninto the case with worn, black leather straps. She never could thrownit away. It was the only rifle she'd used and it became a part ofnher, she treat it like it was some connection to Leon like he wasnthere with her when she took her shots, guiding them to the target. \" Comento think about it, I've never missed with this rifle yet, and Indon't intend to… Ever.\"[Chapter 2] Chaptern2: Anything for Tony… Shenloosened the straps with ease and carefully laid the riflesncomponents down. As she did she made a mental checklist of thenpieces: the two main body parts of the rifle itself, cleaned justnyesterday by herself, a bipod attached, a magazine in which shenloaded two, .270 calibre rounds with hollow-points so the round wouldndeal the most damage on impact, a suppressor, and finally an mil-dotnscope for when the client was far away, when wind and bullet dropnwill dramatically reduce accuracy. Shenestimated the distance from the roof to the building the target wouldnbe going to; a lick over three hundred yards, she already zeroed thenscope before she left so it was only a matter of the wind effectingnthe round now, and with little to no wind she was virtually set tonshoot. Mathilda assembled the rifle at an inhuman speed, her handsnsleek and trained and the movements natural and unrushed likenbreathing, working over the parts. (Flashback) The targetnis some big time drug dealer who Tony wanted taking out. Light work,nbut apparently if he six feet under it would make the streets a lotncleaner. He said that he would probably have a few guards, estimatednat around six to ten of them. Mathilda studied the picture andnmemorized the face. When she saw the picture the man instantlynreminded her of her father; black hair, round face and dull eyes thatnburned into her memory like a hot branding iron. \" Makesnhim all the easier to kill\" her thoughts told her throughnimaginary gritted teeth. She hated her father and wished thatnStansfield hadn't wasted him in that hallway so that she could havendone it. She hated him with every sense of the word and all of hernbeing. He would hit her, ridicule her and treat her like something henscraped off the bottom of his shoe. Stansfieldnhad killed her father because of a drug complication as well as thenrest of her patched together family, her little four year oldnbrother, the only one who really appreciated her and gave her a hugnevery day included in the unforgiving slaughter. \"Henalways checks into the same fancy hotel every Tuesday… tomorrow\"nTony said \"sorry to leave it this late but are you free onnTuesday?\" he questioned \"Younbet\" she replied with a warm smile. \"Anything for you Tony…\"[Chapter 3] Chaptern3: Flickering flashbacks of old home movies… Thensniping spot was chosen excellently; not the most obvious spot whichnwould have been from the hotel across the road, the building she wasnon was across the street and a block away, a bit of an strangenposition but well hidden and laying down near some old rusted pipes,nwhich she guesses had something to do with the ventilation, made hernpractically impossible to spot. The fact the room was nearly a blocknaway gave her ample time to get gone. The targets room was on thencorner with clear view. She chose to wear something comfortable fornthe hit so she had plenty of freedom during the shot: black baggyntrousers, a T-shirt, a long, black trench coat complete withnround-framed shades. Her watchnticked over to half six and her alarm beeped its alert. She quicklynpressed a button and its warning fell silent. \"Thentarget should be here any minute now\" Mathilda spoke to herselfnquietly, pulling out a pair of binoculars and waited, watching fornany signs of the target. A few minutes passed when a group of blackncars arrived. Two cars parked in front of the hotel \" Late…\" Mathilda thought as a smirk spread across her face thenndisappeared quickly; she had spotted her target. He stepped out ofnthe front car along with three tall, well-built guards, black suitsnwith a back shirt and a reddish tie, the target was wearing annexpensive designer suit. Four more guards stepped out of the secondncar making it eight guards in total. She pocketed the binoculars andnwent prone and watched the group enter the hotel through her scope,nbut not before taking off her glasses, she preferred to shoot withnthem off as they felt uncomfortable when looking through the scope. \" Thirdnfloor…big window on the corner \" said her thoughts countingnthe floors up and the rooms across to the corner. Maybe a minutenpassed when the target entered the room, her heart picked up the pacenbut gradually settled down after a little while. He was carrying anblack case with him; she suspected it might contain drugs. She feltnherself go numb, the same feeling she felt before every kill, mustnhave been a way to stop herself from feeling empathy for the targetnand backing out, she wondered if Leon felt this when he went on anhit. Probably not, the years he'd spent doing it he more thannlikely lost that feeling more and more with every kill. During thenfive seconds of wondering the target had gone, she froze, hoping thatnshe hadn't been spotted or missed her chance. Tens of seconds wentnby until he showed again putting her fears back to rest, her heartnrate slowing. All of a sudden everything quiet, the sharp sounds ofnthe traffic below softened and hushed, strange warmth on her rightnside came from nowhere and began to speak in a gravelly voice. \" Keepncalm... Don't take you're eyes off him... Breathe easy…watchnhis movement…\" Visions ofnthe jogger flickered in her mind like she was watching a black andnwhite movie. She swore the jogger actually took the place of thendealer as she briefly blinked. \" Trynto feel his next movement…take a deep breath, hold it…\" As if onncue she inhaled smoothly and held her breath, her lips trembled evernso slightly her face tingled with a warm sensation. Emotions floodedninto her memory. Her mental self holding them back, damming the flow.nThe crosshairs lifted over the man's right eyebrow. He was now atnthe window looking out to the traffic below. \"… now.\" The voice commanded Shensqueezed the trigger slowly until it snapped back like the triggernwas made of glass. The kick of the shot, a dull force hit hernshoulder softly, the bullet cracked out of the barrel, she felt thenheat of the bullet as it went fizzing towards the target, he wentndown in silence as crimson liquid splattered out of the small, darknhole above his right eye. The last thing he probably heard was thencrack of glass as the round penetrated the thin glass window. It didn'tnmatter now what he thought, he was dead and she needed to get going. A poignantntear rolled down her cheek. She turned to quickly disassemble thenrifle, place it back in the case, grab her mat and exited through thenold roof door. \" Justnlike you taught me…\" Shenslipped her shades back on as she left the building and faded intonthe crowd[Chapter 4] Chaptern4: A lonely ghost, a moving shadow, Together again Thennumbness didn't do away till a few minutes after, when the worldnaround her sharpened and bustled with the beeping of taxi horns andnother cars around her as she walked down the street to her apartmentnbuilding. She was a ghost, completely anonymous. At five tonseven, Mathilda opened the door of her dainty apartment and sat hernrifle case down on the little, rectangular table, taking the plantnoff the sill of the open window just above and placed it on the tablen she moved on to the bedroom. A dark man-like shape caught her eye innthe chair in the dim corner on her right; she pulled out a 9mmnBeretta, silenced, from her holster and found herself aiming at anlonely chair she releases the trigger finger slowly.

It is very short and sweet, a little something that was running around in my head when I first noticed Rachel's lower half in this scene. It's where she's shopping and she's getting ready to go in the dressing room. If you look closely she has on what look like thigh-high stockings and a very short dress/skirt, and you can see some skin. Happy Reading! As he stepped out of the limousine, Frank squinted at the glare of the afternoon sun. He headed to the back of the limo to open the door for Rachel. As she swung first one leg, then the other out of the car, Frank caught a glimpse of stockings and skin. Not bothering to show her gratitude, Rachel headed for the clothing store she preferred to shop at in the valley. Through a silent look of communication, Frank let Henry know to stay at the limo with Tony. Frank caught up with Rachel, who had stopped at the entrance to the store because she knew Frank preferred to scope out all public places they went to. He opened the door and after doing a quick-but thorough-sweep he gestured for Rachel to come in. The lady sitting behind the counter hadn't bothered to look up when Frank opened the door. But when Rachel walked in and greeted the woman by name, she exchanged pleasantries with Rachel and proceeded to tell her about new merchandise she had. Frank kept close to Rachel as she browsed around the store. As she settled on a rack near the dressing room, Frank turned his attention outside where he could see Henry and Tony fooling around with some local kids. All the while, he felt Rachel staring daggers into his back. She had been difficult since the beginning. What she didn't understand was that in order for him to do his job well, she would have to make some small sacrifices. As a former secret service agent, Frank did not take his job lightly. \"Hey Farmer,\" he heard Rachel call, \"Wanna come in here with me? Just to be safe?\" She was taunting him again, making a joke about how seriously he took his job. Frank eyed what Rachel was wearing. She had on what looked like a dress that barely stopped above her knees with a long-sleeved silk shrug. On her feet were some type of flat shoes, but with a square heel that kind of reminded Frank of the shoes that Michael Jackson often wore. He gave her one of his 'looks' and turned back around but not before seeing the grin on her face as she went into the dressing room. Frank wasn't quite sure what it was, but her little innuendo got to him. He scanned the store and out front quickly before turning on his heel and disappearing under the curtain where Rachel was trying on clothing. He decided he would call her bluff. She had continued talking so she hadn't seen or heard him coming. Her back had been to him, about to remove her top when grabbed her right arm and pushed her against the dressing room wall. The look of surprise on her face quickly turned to anger as she processed what was going on. \"Frank-\" she began but he cut her off. \"I have to make sure there is nothing suspicious in the clothing,\" he told her, \"Just to be safe,\" he added, throwing her words back at her. Frank was sure a string of curse words were about to come out of her mouth. But before she could get the chance, he kneeled before her and placed his hands on her stocking covered legs. The stockings only came up past her knees and stopped mid-thigh. Rachel would have never admitted it aloud, but when Frank grabbed her and pushed her against the dressing room wall, she was afraid. Afraid that whoever was stalking her was near. That changed the moment Frank placed his hands on her legs and slowly moved up until they came to her exposed thighs. Rachel's breath caught as both hands moved around to the inside of her thighs before they continued their journey up under her skirt. A rush of heat flooded her body as they moved up over her hips where he grasped her waist, then started back down, and moved over her lace-covered rear. Frank slowly stood and dropped his head to her neck. His lips brushed her ear as he whispered, \"All clear,\" and with a smirk quickly returned to his post in front of the dressing room. Frank smiled to himself as he had caught sight of the look on Rachel's face. If looks could kill, Rachel wouldn't need Frank to protect her. Rachel said nothing to him the rest of the shopping trip.[Chapter 2] A/N: Soooo, I decided to make this story into a series of post-scene one-shots. Most of these one-shots will be to my favorite scenes, and incidentally this scene takes place after the shopping scene. Also, I will take requests of some of your favorite scenes from TBG. This is for the ladies over at Fanforum on the Kevney thread! Happy Reading! Rachel sat in a chair at her vanity. She is filing her nails, and gossiping with her hair stylist Sharon. She was telling Rachel about this guy she had been dating. Rachel listened as Sharon was trying to describe the guy's package. \"Too big,\" Rachel asked. \"Average,\" Sharon replied, making sure she hadn't missed any section of Rachel's hair. \"Five minutes,\" Rachel said, asking a different question. \"Three..four,\" Sharon replied, to which Rachel laughed. Rachel continued laughing until she heard singing, specifically herself singing. She tried to shush Sharon as she continued to fuss over her hair, and attempted to look out the window from where she was seated. Finally, Sharon was satisfied that Rachel's hair was completely crinkled and bid Rachel goodnight. Once the door closed behind Sharon, Rachel rose from her chair and walked over to the window. From her vantage point she could see Frank in the pool house, watching her Run to You video. Rachel frowned slightly in confusion. It puzzled her that not only was he watching one of her videos, but with the volume turned up very loudly. Moving on impulse, Rachel crossed over to the door nearest her. She pulled it open and stepped onto her balcony. She walked over to the stone steps and slowly descended them. As if she were in a trance Rachel kept walking. She passed the pool and slowly approached the pool house. Frank pushed the cassette tape into the player, grabbed his pencil and pad off the coffee table, and took a seat in the chair. Rachel's face comes on the screen as she begins to sing the first verse; Frank feels like she is trying to tell him something. I know that when you look at me, there's so much that you just don't see. But if you would only take the time I know in my heart you'll find, oh a girl who's scared sometimes, who isn't always strong. Can't you see the hurt in me? I feel so all alone, I wanna run to you. The image on screen changed to a full body of Rachel wearing some type of flimsy white, see-through material wrapped around her body. She was running to him—to the camera, surrounded by clouds, looking like an angel. She had a sweet smile on her face, and her eyes were filled with happiness. The pad on his lap forgotten, Frank leaned forward as if to get a better view. The video ended and Frank rose to switch the TV off. When he turned to sit back down, he saw Rachel a few feet from the pool house, staring at him, wearing only a white robe. He walked over to the door and opened it. \"I heard music,\" Rachel began by way of explanation. Frank crossed the threshold and approached Rachel, \"I'm sorry if it disturbed you,\" he apologized. Rachel tilted her head slightly to the right, \"I would've never figured you for an undercover fan,\" she said with a hint of a smirk. Frank pushed his hands in his pockets and dipped his head to hide the smile on his face. They continued to stand silently, but not uncomfortably. Rachel was curious as to why Frank had been watching that video, listening to that particular song. It was Rachel's favorite song. She had written it herself and given voice to the words that held so much truth in them. Rachel liked Frank, though she would never admit it aloud, to him especially. He wasn't like most men she met in her line of work. He demanded respect and didn't put up with any of Rachel's crap. Although he was a bit hard to figure out, she was aware that Frank Farmer was a very smart man. She suspected he had seen through those song lyrics, that somehow he was able to get a glimpse of the real Rachel Marron. She didn't know if that frightened or excited her. \"I should go,\" Rachel said, and turned to leave. Frank placed his hand on the small of her back to escort her back to her room. When they reached the stairs leading to her balcony, Rachel began to ascend them but stopped on the third step. She turned her head to look back at Frank. She wanted to ask him why he had been watching that particular video; but some things were better left unsaid. \"Goodnight, Frank,\" she said instead and continued up the stairs. Just as she is about to open her balcony door Frank's voice stops her. \"If there's anything you need….anything. Let me know.\" They stare silently at one another until Rachel nods her head once and enters her room. Frank checks around him before returning to the pool house.

Has no middle, beginning or end. One-Shot... maybe. Hope you enjoy. \"I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat... something's missing. Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two sided mirror\" It was 1:33am 10-year-old Fletcher was sound asleep in his room unaware of the argument taking place in his parent's room at the moment. \"Rachel come on!\" Frank said with a sigh getting up from his spot on their bed walking past her towards their bathroom. They always had little disagreements, mad at each other one minute and over it in the next. The arguments meant nothing; it was just how their relationship worked. They'd express what they were feeling and get over it. There was something about this argument, though, that was gnawing at Frank on the inside. He didn't know what it was, but this particular fight felt different to Frank; a bad feeling was creeping up on him. \"Frank just hear me out,\" Rachel said following Frank into their bathroom. \"Oh, I'm pretty sure I heard you the first time.\" Frank stood in front of the sink and began brushing his teeth. \"Frank…\" Rachel said sternly, watching him through the mirror he was standing in front of, obviously vexed by his non-understanding. She noticed him glancing briefly at her reflection in the mirror, then back at himself, continuing to brush his teeth. Rachel knew she was asking a lot but she really needed him to understand where she was coming from. Frank rinsed his mouth out and turned around almost bumping into Rachel not realizing how close she was standing to him. She stood her ground, hands on her hips, annoyance etched in the features of her beautiful face. Sighing Frank folded his arms across his chest and leaned back against the counter, looking Rachel directly in her eyes, \"I'm listening.\" Taking a deep breath, annoyed at having to explain herself a second time, Rachel tried to get through to Frank again. \"Calvin got in touch with Bill and told him to let me know that he was in town and he really wanted to have a sit down with me.\" \"About what?\" Frank questioned raising an eyebrow, his arms still folded across his chest, annoyance and impatience written into every single one of his features. The trained bodyguard usually wouldn't let his emotions show; never wanting to let the other person know what he was feeling. The only people he ever bared his true emotions to was his family and right now he wanted Rachel to know just how uncomfortable he was with the whole situation. Hesitating by the expression on his face Rachel replied, \"Well, I could assume, but I honestly don't know\" At this, Frank dropped his arms to his side, shaking his head and sighing, as he attempted to walk past Rachel out of the bathroom. She quickly sidesteps to stop him from leaving, putting her hands on his bare chest pushing him back a bit. \"Frank ... Just...\" she says pausing trying to collect her thoughts. \"Look I wasn't going to go initially. I told Bill to tell him I wasn't interested but...\" She trailed off sighing, temporarily distracted by the gleam reflecting off the small silver cross necklace that hung around Frank's neck. \" I ... I realized that I have a lot of things I want to get off my chest concerning him bailing on me after we had Fletcher. It's just a conversation baby, that's it. \" \"You can't do that over the phone ... or email\" Frank questioned only half joking, mumbling the last part under his breath. He understood her reasoning but he couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about the whole situation. Why now after all these years. He especially though it was odd on Calvin's part. 10 years and now he wants to \"talk\"? Frank didn't trust it. Rachel gave him a look, clenching her jaw slightly \"Can you not be a smartass right now?\" Usually his dry humor entertained her but right now she wanted to choke him. \"No, not really\" Frank retorted. Through her agitation her lips twitched as a smile tried to break thru. \"Haha\" she said sarcastically with a smirk. \"Your obviously going to do what you want anyway Rachel, so why are we even having this conversation\" Frank questioned, growing more and more agitated by the minute. It was late and they weren't doing anything but talking in circles. He knew in his heart that Rachel was going to do this whether she had his \"permission\" or not. Once she had her mind set on something that was the end and very little could persuade her to do otherwise. They were both stubborn as hell, which is where the arguments arose most of the time, no one wanting to give in. \"Because…\" Rachel said, dragging the word out. \"I love you, & it would be nice to have my very handsome fiancé's blessing.\" She finished. Her tone noticeably softened with that statement as she stepped a little closer to Frank, who slowly unfolded his arms allowing Rachel to press herself up against his torso and wrap her arms around his neck. If it was anything else she probably would have let it go, but she couldn't shake need to do this. She needed answers and she was going to get them. Rachel frowned as Frank sighed, resting both of his hands against the counter instead of wrapping them around her. \"Please?\" She questioned searching his face for answer. \"Whatever Rachel\" Frank stated flatly, shaking his head as he removed her arms from around his neck and walked out of the bathroom. Rachel watched him go, a bit disappointed; this is not the way she wanted it to go. She felt a strong urge to follow him and continue their conversation but decided against it. It was going on 2am and she knew Frank still had to be up early for a meeting in the morning. She opted instead to take a long shower hoping it would relax her. Rachel walked out of the bathroom and started getting ready for bed, glancing over at Frank a couple of times wondering if he was still awake. She smiled a bit thinking he looked like a little kid with his black basketball shorts on (that posed as his pajamas), lying on his back, sprawled out on their bed with his left hand somewhat over his face. As Rachel continues her nighttime routine she watches Frank's reflection in her mirror as he shifts a little and looks over at her before closing his eyes again, signaling to her that he's still awake. Although half asleep, Frank couldn't get their conversation out of his head. He wanted to let it go and just sleep but he still had one more question to ask. \"When are you supposed to be having this 'sit down' anyway?\" Frank asks eyes still closed, in a sleepy voice. He had gotten comfortable and almost fell fully asleep until he heard Rachel come out of the bathroom. When she didn't respond he looked over in her direction, eyebrows raised waiting for her to answer. She glanced at him briefly before going back to what she was doing. \"Tomorrow morning\" Rachel responded quietly. She knew she should have brought it up to him earlier or even a few days ago but she had really just decided that morning that she was going. She glanced in Frank's direction knowing he wasn't happy. Frank narrows his eyes at her before sitting up fully on the edge of the bed closest to Rachel glancing at the clock going on 3:30am. \"Tomorrow morning?!\" Frank repeats, visibly irritated, no longer sleepy. \"As in today? As in a few hours from now?!\" Franks asked incredulously. Rachel sighs, getting annoyed at how Frank insisted on dragging out this fight. She was now the one tired and sick of trying to explain herself to her hardheaded fiancé. \"When did you plan on telling me? After the fact?\" Frank questions. \"Baby, look...\" Rachel starts, trying to calm Frank down once again. \"I'm sorry, okay? I just decided I wanted to go this morning and I didn't know how to explain it to you and not start an argument. Okay? Now it's late, you have to be up a couple of hours so can we please just drop it and go to sleep?\" Rachel says hoping that will get Frank to back down. \"Rachel...\" Frank starts sternly, shaking his head, but is cut off by his now very irritated fiancé who spins around in her chair to face Frank. \"You know, I'm starting to think that you have a bigger problem than just not wanting me to talk to Calvin. I'm mean what's your real issue here Frank?\" Rachel's spouts, clearly more upset and irritated than before. She tried to be reasonable and understanding, but now he was just making it impossible she thought. So if a fight is what he wants, a fight is what he going to get! \"What?\" Frank asks, clearly confused at where his fiancé was going with this. Rachel gets up and walks to the opposite side of the room a few feet away from Frank before she turns to look at him arms folded across her chest. \"I'm starting to think you don't trust me. Is that your problem?\" Rachel asks basically throwing daggers at Frank with her eyes while looking a bit hurt. Frank softens a little at his fiancé's words and the look on her face. \"Of course not. You know I trust you, wholeheartedly Rach.\" He says as he stands up taking a few steps towards her. He notices that Rachel's demeanor has softened a bit so he continues. \"But that doesn't mean I trust Calvin or should have any reason to.\" Frank explains. As fast as she softened, she quickly goes back into defense mode. Rachel couldn't believe him! \"Frank saying you don't trust him is basically saying you don't trust me! You don't trust me enough to know I'd stop something from happening if he were to try something.\" \"Why would you even put yourself in that situation in the first place?!\" Frank fires back, raising his voice slightly. He absolutely didn't understand Rachel's reasoning at the moment. Of course he trusted her but he didn't know Calvin and him showing up out of the blue to \"talk\" to his fiancé was absolute bullshit to him! There had to be something more behind it. \"Oh? And what about you Frank?\" Rachel's throws back, hurt at even the thought of Frank not trusting her. \"What about me Rachel? What are you talking about?\" Frank asked once again baffled at what she was getting at. \"You and these overseas trips? How do I know what goes on over there? That's you putting yourself in a situation for something to happen\" Franks looks at Rachel incredulously for a few moments before he responds. Is she insane? \"My going overseas is entirely different from you wanting to sit down with your damn ex. I'm working when I'm over there and you know that!\" Frank says pointing at her briefly before putting some distance between them. \"Do I?\" Rachel questions arms still folded over her chest. Rachel didn't like where the conversation was headed but she couldn't seem to stop herself. Frank pauses for a moment staring at Rachel in disbelief, gripping the back of the now vacant chair that Rachel had been sitting in earlier. \"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\" Frank demands, staring directly at Rachel. She didn't actually think… believe that he… No. She couldn't. Rachel trusted him. He knows she does and he's never given her a reason not to. Everything he does is with her best intentions at heart so where was she going with this? Where was this coming from? Before Rachel knew what she was saying the words were out of her mouth and there was no way to take them back. \"I'm just saying maybe there's some truth to what I read in those magazines that write about you with this women and that women when your over there. Anything you care to tell me?\" As soon as the words left Rachel's mouth she knew she messed up. Her heart sunk looking at the hurt look on her fiancé's face. Frank was absolutely speechless. He let out a slight laugh out of amazement of what she just said and shook his head as he walked past Rachel without looking at her. Rachel closed her eyes and put her face in her hands, sighing deeply as Frank walked passed her. \"Frank, baby, I'm sorry… \" Rachel started but was cut off by the slam of their bedroom door closing behind Frank as he exited the room. \"Dammit\" She muttered shaking her head, as she walked over to their bed and flopped down on it. She knew her request would probably end up with them arguing, but never thought it would turn out like this. What the hell was wrong with her? She didn't even mean what she said, but the argument got so heated that she couldn't stop herself. Frank was one of the few men she actually did trust with everything she had. The only reason she even knew about the stories in the paper were because of that idiotic manager of hers. Even then she paid them no mind so why bring it up now? Sighing Rachel wondered if she should go see where Frank went, but decided against it. He was clearly angry and she had no idea what to even say to him at the moment. Instead she pulled back the covers on his side of their bed and climbed in. The pillow smelled just like him as she snuggled down into it trying to make sense of what just happened. If you like it, I may turn it into an actual story :). Let me know. Disclaimer: I own none of these characters, just my thoughts. Beginning lyrics belong to Rihanna.[Chapter 2] Thanks for all of the reviews! You don't know how much I appreciate them! Enjoy the new chapter. \"Sometimes the wrong, don't know that they're wrong. Sometimes the strong ain't always so strong. Sometimes I do stupid things to you, when I really didn't mean it at all... Sorry for the stupid things I wish I didn't do, but I do.\" Rachel woke up the next morning having eventually dozed off without realizing. Blinking a few times, looking to her right, she wondered for a brief moment why she was on the wrong side of the bed. Then suddenly flashbacks from her and Franks argument last night (or earlier that morning) came back to her and she sighed deeply, slowly sitting up in bed, swinging her legs over the edge of it. She ran a hand through her hair, thinking, briefly looking at the clock on the side table that read 6:52am. She slightly remembered Frank quietly coming into the room earlier that morning to grab some shower supplies and clothes, but she wasn't sure if it was reality or if she had dreamt it. Shaking her head and sighing once again, she decided to go see if Frank was still home. After checking in on Fletcher for a quick second, Rachel made her way down the hall to the guest bedroom where she figured Frank had went after he stormed out of their room last night. As she reached the door, she put her hand on the knob then paused. What if he was still too angry to talk? Was he even here? What was she going to say to him anyway? She shook her head slightly as to shake those thoughts out of her head and turned the knob to the door slowly. She opened it, only slightly at first, saying Frank's name softly. \"Frank?\" Rachel questioned again a little louder, opening the door a tad farther, this time poking her head in a bit. When she didn't get a response she opened the door the rest of the way and stepped into the room looking around. Frank had definitely slept in there, she decided, as she glanced around. She could still smell the scent of the cologne he had put on and still see the grooves in the sheets from where he slept. She also noticed his black basketball shorts and a few shirts strewn about. Rachel figured he couldn't decide on a shirt to wear and smiled a bit at the thought as picked up the strewn about articles of clothing and walked out of the room closing the door behind her. She sighed and leaned back against the door contemplating what to do next. She really wanted to talk to Frank, but seeing as how he was obviously unavailable at the moment due to his meetings she pushed away that urge for the moment. She would just have to wait until late that afternoon to have a conversation with her fiancé. There was still the impending meeting she had with Calvin in 2 hours or so as well. She contemplated that thought for a minute, walking back toward her and Frank's room, before deciding against it too. She wanted to go, but not like this. Not when she was on bad terms with Frank. She honestly didn't know what Calvin wanted and the thought scared her a bit. If she really was going to sit down with him, she was going to need Frank on her side. Sighing as she entered her room she hung Franks shirts back up in their closet and placed his shorts back into one of his dresser draws. Finally deciding on what to do with her day, Rachel called Bill to cancel the meeting with Calvin, telling him to let Calvin know she'd reschedule in a few days. Then she hopped in the shower deciding to go to the studio to work on some tracks for her new album hoping it would take her mind off of everything for a little while. Meanwhile across town, Frank was barely making it through his first meeting and had 2 more to go that day. A few months after he and Rachel had got engaged he decided (due to Rachel throwing a fit) to quit being a bodyguard. He needed a job though; he couldn't be a \"stay at home dad\" that would never work for him. So he decided to start his own security business, bringing along Henry who he basically trained to be his right hand man while guarding Rachel. Not only had he trained him, but Henry had also become one of his closest and most trusted friends throughout the years. He felt it only right to include Henry in his business venture making him his co-partner. Henry looked over at Frank for what felt like the 100th time during their meeting. He could tell Frank was distracted when he picked him up that morning and by the looks of it he still was. Getting tired of wondering what his problem was Henry elbowed him slightly giving him a look. \"What's up with you?\" He whispered keeping his eye on one of his colleagues that was speaking, but glancing briefly at him. Startled out of his reverie, Frank dropped the pen that he was twirling idly in his fingers. It made a loud clink as it hit the table. Dave, the colleague who was talking, paused giving Frank a look. Frank rolled his eyes slightly and offered a small \"Sorry\" as an apology. Extremely anal and full of himself, he wasn't Frank's favorite person in the world, but he was great at his job so he tolerated him for the sake of his business. Frank waited for Dave to start talking again then tried to balance his attention between him and Henry. \"What?\" Frank asked glancing at Henry. \"Everything Okay?\" Henry asked approaching it from a different angle. \"Just Peachy.\" Frank replied flatly keeping his eyes on Dave who was still droning on. \"You sure? Cause you seem a little... distracted\" Henry replied searching for the right word, his attention fully on Frank now. \"Rachel & I got in a fight last night.\" Frank stated simply, but sighing deeply still staring straight ahead. \"We'll that's nothing new.\" Henry joked smirking slightly at Frank expecting him to do the same. He was used to hearing about his and Rachel's little arguments. Most of the time they were meaningless, entertaining, and over faster than they started. Frank side eyed Henry, but remained silent. \"Must've been some fight.\" Henry probed when Frank didn't respond. Frank looked at Henry, starting to respond when he heard someone clear their throat loudly. He didn't have to look up to know that it was Dave. He saw Henry roll his eyes and shake his head. He couldn't stand Dave either and couldn't fathom why Frank tolerated him. Frank looked up at Dave with an air of annoyance and boredom while Dave remained silent, staring at Henry and Frank for a minute. \"Continue.\" Frank barked slightly, annoyed at Dave's stares. What were they in high school and who did Dave think he was the principle? Frank was in no mood for his colleagues' antics this morning. Thank god he wasn't in any more of his meetings today. Frank sighed trying to refocus his attention on the meeting, but he could see Henry's questioning stare in his peripheral. \"Later.\" Frank said glancing at Henry, who nodded at him slightly and refocused his attention on the meeting. Back across town in the opposite direction, Rachel had been at the studio for about 4 and half hours. Her plan to forget about the craziness worked well for the moment. She lit some scented candles and dimmed the lights slightly giving the room a tranquility that relaxed her. She also limited the amount of people that had permission to be in the studio allowing only a producer, one engineer and Bill to come and go as they pleased. She had gotten one song fully recorded, fixed up a previous one she had did and was now focused on writing a brand new one. As she was humming slightly to the track the producer had playing through the speakers, trying to formulate the chorus to her new song, Bill walked in with a look that Rachel couldn't quite read. She couldn't tell if he was irritate, concerned, or both. Rachel signaled for the producer to turn the music down and give her and Bill the room as he approached her. Instead of taking the seat in front of her on the other side of the table, Bill stood next to her and leaned against the table with his arms folded looking down at her slightly, reminding Rachel of her father when he was about to scold her. Rachel looked up at him and started to say something until Bill cut her off. \"Rachel what is this mess with Calvin?\" Bill asked not wasting anytime. \"Good morning Rachel. How are you? Oh I'm just fine Bill, thanks for asking.\" Rachel responded sarcastically, looking up at him, annoyed at his impatience. \"Rachel...\" Bill said sternly. He was in no mood for her smart remarks. Sy was being particularly more annoying this morning than his usual self and Calvin wouldn't stop calling him after he left the message that Rachel needed to cancel. \"It's not a mess Bill, I have it under control.\" Rachel responded sighing and looking away from him. She picked up her pen and focused her attention on the notepad in front of her, pretending to concentrate on the lyrics that were written on the page. \"Do you? Because Calvin's been calling me every five damn minutes.\" \"Did you tell him I'd reschedule?\" She asks rolling her eyes still focusing on the pad. \"Re-schedule? I don't even know why you're entertaining the fact in the first place!\" Bill said exasperated. Rachel sighed, leaning back in her chair for a second before putting her pen down. \"Bill, you're the one that told me about the phone call in the first place. If you didn't want me to go, then why even tell me about it?\" Rachel questioned standing up to face Bill, mimicking his stance. \"You know good and well that's not how I operate Rachel. We don't keep secretes. However, that does not mean I agree with the situation.\" Bill responded shaking his head. Rachel ran a hand over her face looking down for a minute. She knew all too well how Bill felt about Calvin. He was there when she first started dating him and her shoulder to cry on when he bailed on her. Bill recalled that time period well also. He was the one that told her to be careful; he didn't trust him from jump. Calvin thought he was the smoothest and the best thing out. He irked Bill to no end and always wondered how a great woman like Rachel fell in love with someone like him. He was also there when Calvin bolted like a punk after Rachel told him she was pregnant, comforting her while she balled her eyes out. He had some damn nerve trying to make contact now after all those years. Bill didn't trust him then and he damn sure didn't trust him now. The room went quiet for a minute or two, both recounting those days. \"Does Frank know about all of this?\" Bill asked quietly, breaking the silence. Rachel let a quick ironic laugh as she rubbed the back of her neck with her hand. \"Yea... he knows about it alright.\" Bill looked at her, his eyebrows raised, waiting for her to continue. \"He and I got into a fight about it last night that ended up in me saying something I didn't mean and him not speaking to me at the moment.\" Rachel responded plopping back down into her chair with a deep sigh. Bill shook his head looking down for a minute. Rachel hadn't even had any serious contact with the guy and he was already stirring up trouble. Bill didn't like it. \"Fix it Rachel.\" Bill said sternly, shaking his head as he left the studio. Rachel sighed resting her arms on her knees and her head in one of her hands as she watched him retreat out of the room; so much for getting her mind off of it. Rachel stayed at the studio for about 30 more minutes before giving up and calling it a day. She couldn't concentrate with the fight from last night and Bill's stern \"Fix it\" request still swirling around in her head. She had to speak to Frank. While Rachel made her way home through the LA traffic, Frank and Henry were also headed home a little earlier then expected due to Frank ending the last meeting early. \"So... Are you gonna tell me the full story of what happened or am I gonna have to continue playing 20 questions with you?\" Henry joked. They had been driving about 20 minutes and for 20 minutes he had been bugging Frank non-stop. He sensed that Frank didn't really want to re-live the argument, but he was curious of what was so bad about the fight that it had thrown Frank off of his game. He was always super alert and very attentive in every meeting, hell in everything he did. Today, though, he was super distracted and it bothered Henry a bit. He wasn't just his mentor anymore, he was his best friend and he wanted to help. Frank sighed and proceeded to recount his and Rachel's fight scene by scene, making sure to leave nothing out. Henry was quiet for a minute after Frank finished, mainly tying to digest and understand the information. His lack of response, however, was irking Frank a little. \"Oh so now you decide to be quiet?\" Frank said unbelievingly, glancing at Henry quickly before looking back at the road. All he did was talk since they got in the car and now he had nothing to say? Frank didn't want to re-hash the argument in the first place, but now that he did he wanted Henry's feedback. The fact that he was now apparently rendered speechless irked Frank. He rolled his eyes, sighing, and drummed his thumb on the steering wheel waiting for Henry to find his voice. After a minute or two Henry still hadn't said anything. Frank glanced over at him several times before he gave up being patient. \"Seriously?!\" Frank said incredulously. \"I... I mean... … Damn she really went in on you.\" Henry said laughing a little. Though it had never really been directed at him, Henry was no stranger to Rachel's anger when someone made her mad. So he wasn't surprised at Rachel's blow up. \"So this is funny to you?\" Frank shot back at Henry not bothering to hide the annoyance on his face. \"No! No it's not. I just...\" Henry started, deciding to get serious when he saw the look on his friends face. \"Look Frank you know better than anyone how Rachel gets sometimes when you piss her off. She gets mad and then says things she doesn't mean. Admittedly, she's gotten a lot better at controlling that since she met you, but no ones perfect.\" \"And that makes what she said to me okay? She basically called me not only a cheater, but a liar!\" Frank exclaimed, shaking his head. \"I'm not saying it was okay, she definitely owes you an apology, but come on Frank we both know your one of the few people Rachel has actually allowed herself to trust; your blind if you can't see how much that woman loves you.\" Frank sighed but remained silent as Henry paused before continuing letting his words sink in. \"Besides don't you think you overreacted just a little?\" \"Excuse me?\" Frank said in surprise. He was the one that overreacted? Henry couldn't be serious. \"I'm just saying look at it from her side. Wouldn't you want some answers?\" Henry said trying to reason with Frank. He knew his friend was a good guy, but he could be a bit of hothead. \"I guess you have a point.\" Frank side eyed Henry and sighed. \"Damn right!\" Henry exclaimed smiling. \"Alright, don't get smug. I still don't trust it, but … I don't know, I guess I should at least be supportive on Rachel's behalf.\" Frank responded sighing. \"You trust your fiancé... Right?\" Henry asked. Frank nodded yes as his response. \"Then trust me, my man, you have nothing to worry about. She won't disappoint you.\" Henry said quietly tapping Frank on his shoulder lightly. Frank smirked at Henry slightly, murmuring a small \"Thanks\" feeling slightly stupid about his and Rachel's argument. It should have never gotten that far. Frank dropped Henry off at his house then made his way down the road to his house, circling the block a few times to gather his thoughts before going home to talk to Rachel. He was still pretty pissed about what she had accused him of, but he also saw his wrong doing in their argument. He just hoped this time they could talk it out without a repeat of the night before.

","Summary":" Really random; just had the urge to write. Has no middle, beginning or end. One-Shot... maybe. Hope"},{"Movie":"Bodyguard, 1992","Title":"Frank and Rachel What happened after","Author":"CC Niles Forever and Always","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11369767","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Bodyguard(What Happened After) It's been years since Frank Farmer and Rachel Marron had talked or even saw one another. Both have lived their lives. By now Frank was already hired by another client and out of the country. Rachel was successful as a singer and actress that had everything that she wanted. Fletcher had moved out went to college and now was a father to two young children. The rest of the crew Bill, Sy and Tony still had their jobs in Rachel's life. To say the least Frank and Rachel led their own lives. At times they thought about one another and how they could be together. But the one question that remains would be how could we make it last? Frank could not stop thinking about a certain women he knew and feel in love with. He thought about what if he'd stayed with her? Would it help the loneliness in him? He tried to pick up the phone and then realized that there was no used. He thought of the worse, would she remember him? Would she forgive him, would she even talk to me? So he put down the phone and went on his way to forget her but knew he couldn't. Rachel in time did think about him time and time again but didn't know if he would remember her. She didn't know what she would say if they ever did talk? She knew in her heart she wanted to be with him but was not sure of his feelings especially when they agreed that it was for the best leaving. Bill and Tony knew that she still loved him but didn't know what to do so they just stayed out of her business. Sy didn't like the fact that he knew she still loved him. He tried to have her forget him all together but it never did help. One day came and Bill had said \"Rachel, I really think you need to talk to Frank and think you two should try again. Rachel smiled and said \"I don't know if I should. Bill said \"why not? Rachel saids because Frank and I agreed that it would be better if we weren't nothing more, our paths would never cross and that were simply weren't meant to be. Bill saids \"Rach, I know him and I know he can't live without you, I know he didn't mean what said and you need him as much as he needs you, why don't yu call him? Rachel saids then why hasn't called or contacted me if I'm what he wants and needs? Bill saids to her I can't explain why but I do know that he does love you and always have rach. Then Bill saids I have something to give you that was from him before he left and was in the hospital. It was a letter address to Rachel. Rachel opened it and it read Dear Rachel, I'm writing this because I want you to know I love you and I loved being your bodyguard. I know our paths haven't crossed but I do know that you will always be part of me and always be the holder of my heart. I know we're going our separate ways but know that I'll always be here for you and that I will always love you. Love Always Frank. Rachel had a few tears and closed the letter and said I need to be alone for a bit. Bill said I understand but I think you need to tell him how you feel so he knows. Rachel said that what if I do and he has moved on and forgot about me and what we had? Bill saids Rach, I can't tell you what to do all I can say is that I know Frank and he won't ever get over you just like that. Rachel saids I know I'm scared that his life is going great for him that in his heart he sees me as someone who will bring it down. Bill saids I don't think that at all, I think he's scared of letting you in because of what happened in Miami. Rach saids he knows I only did that because he had pissed me off and I wanted him to be jealous nothing happened with Portman or me in there. Bill saids I know does he tho? I don't think he does Rach. Rachel saids he has to know that was the reason of it? Bill saids I don't think he knows because if he did he wouldn't had gotten defensive about it. Rachel saids to him I'll talk to him even if I'm e one who has to call him and talk to him? So after the conversation she had called Frank but he didn't answer. She left a voicemail and this is what she said. Frank its me Rach, we need to talk, we haven't talked in a while and we both have feelings for one another that we need to express and say. And you need to know the honest truth about Portman and I at Miami. Nothing had happened between us and the only reason I did it was to make you jealous because I was mad at you. I love you and always have. We shouldn't had ended it like we did. There's a chance to make it right. Please call me back. I love you Frank and always will. Frank listened to the message and thought to himself. He though of the right words to say to her. He didn't know how to confess his feelings.[Chapter 2] Rachel put the song What Becomes of a Broken Heart as her own version. Despite what Sy had said. She wanted her own band to be in it. So she created it a little different then before. Lately with everything that had happened she just didn't know what to think. She was hurt and confused for the fact that he didn't want to work on it but maybe there fling was pass them and she needed to move on she wasn't sure. Bill knew that there relationship gotten strong within time Frank was working for her. While time had change so did Rachel. She believed in finding love again but just as soon as she found someone all she thought about was Frank and how he made her feel. So without a doubt she called Frank to see how he was. She dialed Franks number. He picked up and said \"hello\". Rachel said\" is this Frank Farmer\". He said \"yes whos this\". So Rachel told him it was her. Frank said \" Hi Rach how have you been\" She told him \"she was good and he also asked how Fletcher was\" She said \"he was doing good\". Then the conversation began. Frank said \"Rach I know why you called and I know you still have deep feelings for me and to tell you the truth mine never went away I just felt that with our history and the fact our worlds are still different it wouldn't work out. Rachel said this\" Frank, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Ever since I read your letter I wanted to stop singing and making my mark. Frank told her that she shouldn't give up her dreams just for him, she was a star and that was she was supposed to be. Rachel said \"I know but I know I can't live without you\". Frank told Rach \" How would we make it work\"? You would have your career which has been booming for years and what about my job working as a bodyguard for someone.\" Rachel gold him\" We would find a way, after that song I wrote called I Will Always Love You I was never the same, I never wanted to find love or anything\". Frank said \"Rach that song was beautiful and to tell you the truth I replayed it over and over but found myself asking the question of how would our paths cross. Rach told Frank \"We can find a way I know it\" Frank said Rach lets try it and see where it gets us\"? Since I'm not your bodyguard anymore. Rach saids okay so do you want me to meet you somewhere or how do you want to confront this? Frank saids to avoid Sy and his shit we will somewhere close how about our old bar that we danced and had dinner at\". Rachel had agree with it and said I can meet you there tomorrow if you would like\". Frank saids \"I will see if I can get a flight tomorrow and if I can I will call you when I get in tomorrow. Rachel said \"okay that sounds good see you then\". Then they both say goodbye and then they go on with their day. Meaning Frank went to find out if there were flights tomorrow and what time and Rachel did what Rachel did best he. Meanwhile after Rachel and Frank talked on the phone, Sy decided to show up and continue with his crap. He said \"Rachel you aware you have plenty of interviews to do this week and remember that your album is being released this week\". This is what she said to that \"Sy I know what's going on this week I would appreciate for you to get off my back, I know about the god damn interviews and album. I don't think you need to just walk into my house and tell me what to do. I am more than capable to know what's gong on and shit so back the fuck off and go find something else to do for the day\". Sy was speechless for once. So without a doubt he had left Rachel alone for the day. Meanwhile Rachel had things on her mind she needed to get done before she went on her date with Frank. She told Tony, Bill and Fletcher she would be going on for a few and would be back later and then asked Henry to drive her to the closest mall so she could shop for some new outfits. In the car Henry and her had the basic talk but then she decided to ask a personal question \"Henry what did you think of Frank Farmer? He said I liked him he was a nice guy and well I always admired of how he had did things even when he took the bullet for you? She said oh okay what would you think if he came back into my life and we were more than friends more like lovers. Henry said \"Rach I think it would be great for you and also Fletcher he always adored Frank and Frank was like a father figure to him. So after a while they got to the where Henry dropped her off at the door and said he was going to drive around til she was ready. So she went in and looked around until she found a dark blue long dress that had a beautiful design on it and some sparkles on top. She tried it then on then bought it. Then told Henry and he was on her way to pick her up. They head home she puts the dress on a hanger and leaves it for the following day. It's about 6:00pm she eats dinner then decides to head to bed by 8:00pm since she's meeting Frank tomorrow for dinner. Tomorrow rolls around she wakes up to Fletcher in her room standing by her bed. She saids good morning baby what's wrong? He saids nothing mom I have a question do you ever think of Frank? Rachel saids yes I do why honey? Fletcher saids it just I miss him and I wish he was here to watch me grow? Rachel saids Fletcher he will come around give it time. Right now I don't have a lot of answers but I do know he misses you. Fletcher saids are you sure mom? She saids Im sure. Looks at the clock and it saids 10:00. So she tells Fletcher that she's gonna get ready for the day and would meet him down stairs. She just puts on a shirt and jeans for now until it got closer to the date time. She gets down stairs only to find Sy being annoying. Sy saids \"Rachel I need you to do an interview at 1:00 today is that possible\"? She saids \"Sy I have things to do today and I'm not in the mood to do it. He saids Rachel come-on. Rachel saids I have something going on later tonight that I must be present for and I'm not canceling because of this. He saids you can do the interview and then do what you need to do I just hope it has nothing to do with Frank Farmer again he cause enough problems when he was you bodyguard \". Rachel's hesrt began to sink when he said that about Frank made her furious and mad so she finally gave a what for to Sy\". \"Sy shut the fuck up about Frank would you\"? He was protecting me in times of need and guess the fuck what he did a great job doing it which attracted me more to him. He saw me thru everything that had happened\". He took the bullet for me and he could had died and I know you wouldn't care so get the fuck out and leave me and him alone\". Sy was speechless and left. Them 6:00 rolled around later that night. Her and Franks night would begin and she would have to tell Frank that Sy knew and that they couldn't sneak around. She didn't know how she would do it but knew it had to be done. She got to the bar and restaurant and her heart began to beat faster and faster as soon as she got to the door.[Chapter 3] As Rachel had looked around for Frank she decided to just take a seat til she saw him. Then few moments after she sits down he walks in. He was in a nice tie and suit. Rachel looked beautiful with her blue dress she bought the day prior. He sees her and thinks she's beautiful more beautiful then before. They both look at each other until Rachel gets Franks attention and saids you can have a seat I don't bite. He looked at her and said I know Rach. So they sat down and ordered a drink then talked. Frank saids Rach I know its been hard on you but its also been hard on me. I found myself wishing things could been of been different. I found myself watching your I Will Always Love You music video and then shutting it off because it was to much. Also Rach I have to admit something back when I was your bodyguard I wasn't comfortable with you in Miami with Portman it literally killed me inside not knowing what he was doing with you and I don't mean the details either its just at the time of the event I did not know he was the killer. After he said this he knew he'd should be quiet before he almost told her about Nikki hiring him to kill her and if she would find out it would literally kill her. Rachel then saids I only did it to make you jealous because I was mad for the fact after sleeping together the one night you didn't want us like that anymore. Frank said Rach we can put that aside now and be the couple we should be. Rachel agreed to that and found herself longing to kiss him but knew that it would lead to other things so she let him finish his drink and food. Even sitting across the table from each other she could feel his heat, the way he smelled to the way his kiss tasted on her his drink and asked Rachel if she's about ready. She saids yeah I am then tells him I don't have to go home yet I mean someone could watch over Fletcher for me for the night. Frank knew that she had this set up and said Rach you can sleep at my house if you would like. Rach was glad but also the look on her face you could tell she wanted him. Frank puts a tip on the table for the waiter and then meets Rachel by the car. Frank saids won't you have to call your driver and tell him you don't need a ride. Rach saids naw. So they get into Franks car and head to his house. They get to his house and Frank looks over at Rachel who's asleep in the passenger seat he gets out and opens her door she doesn't move. He picks her up and carries her into one of the guest rooms. He puts her in the bed and covers her up kisses her forehead and saids goodnight Rachel see you in the morning. The only response he get is a groan he shuts the door and goes into the living room. He thinks about today and how wonderful it was to be with her. Just as soon as he drifts off to sleep someone starts massaging his shoulders he looks up and sees the woman and not just a women the women he loves and wants. He saids what are you doing up? I thought you were sleeping.. She said I was but heard the door close. He said oh I see so you were waiting til I left to be sneaky. As she puts her arms around his neck she starts to nibble his ears and then starts to kiss his neck. Then starts to unbutton his shirt Frank knew what this would lead to but wanted to make Rachel feel comfortable and didn't want to force her into doing something she didn't want to do. As soon as she started to unbutton his shirt and started to kiss down to his stomach he knew he wouldn't be able to control it anymore. So he started to take her shirt off and started to kiss her chest and then some to the point where she would be moaning. He started to nibble at her ears and sucking her nipples till she started screaming for more from him. From there they started to make crazy love and not just like the first time they made love but it wasn't slow and relaxing more like hard core. There were many moans and screams in this and after they both had climaxed they both laid in each others arms that night in that chair. Frank thought to himself \"I just slept with her and I have her right here but am I doing the right thing for us\". Rachel had fell asleep on him so all he heard was snoring in the sound of his thinking but not as soon as she fell asleep he found himself drifting off. Then the dream came. He was her bodyguard back in 1992 he protected her from fans who wanted her and a hired man hired to kill her as we soon found out as his old colleague Portman who he killed at the academy awards. As the dream went on he thought something would happen to Rachel if he wasn't there with her. He thought about what happened to her at the academy awards and how scared she was to loosing him. The dream became more realistic as he saw a life without her and that's when he woke up to the sound of a gunshot just to realize it was nothing. Look down and saw Rachel sleeping and fell back asleep til morning. The next morning came and they both woke up and were happy. Until Rachel realized what time it was and realized she should be getting home. Then as she stared into space she saw the flashback the one where he told her he couldn't protect her that way and she saw the hurt she felt that day and how angry she was at him until the tear felt down her face and Frank saw her crying and asked what was wrong? She asked him \" did you regret last night\"? He said \"umm… no Rach I didn't why would you think that?\" Rachel said \"because you did once before \". Frank said \"that's the past lets look at the future\". Then Rachel came back to it and asked Frank \"could you drop me off at home?\" Frank saids \"Sure baby I can\". Few hours past and she tells Frank she should be getting home. Frank doesn't want her to go but realizes she does have a life and does have things to do. So Frank take Rachel home by the time they get to Rachel's house. Sy, Tony and Bill were waiting. Bill and Tony greet Frank while Sy just stands there annoyed and complaining about the fact Rachel was gone all night and half of the day. And things needed to be done such as Rachel's new album. Rachel greets everyone and Sy starts questioning and complaining and she saids \"Sy shut up your pissing me off with this crap lately and I can't take it anymore so what if I have interviews and stuff to do it can wait I just got Frank back and I'm loosing him because you and your bullshit \". Sy looks at her and shrugs his shoulders and heads into the house. Meanwhile Tony and Bill talk to Frank and get caught up with him. Rachel just stands there and admires the fact they are getting along. Then Rachel heads into the house to find a piece of mail on her table. She opens it only to find it familiar as before in her life another death threat. Could it be the same guy who did it years ago to her the creepy fan who had a locker full of her pictures and personal things of her. She didn't know but knew she needed the only one for her Frank. She ran outside in horror and gave the letter to Frank and in the back of his head he said oh no. Then he showed Tony and Bill and they knew what to do this time. Rachel understood more this time and wanted to be more cautious. The only problem was they didn't tell Sy.

She still wasn't sure she needed a bodyguard but Bill had insisted and even Sy, who usually disagreed with him, had said that it was necessary for her to have Frank around. She didn't like Frank Farmer, he thought he knew what she needed and he didn't listen to her at all. That was he handsome, very fit and right certainly didn't make her feel any better. She didn't want to admit that he was right about anything. The thing which had her watching him for the second morning in a row, though, was the troubling fact that somehow, unreasonably, she was attracted to him. It obviously had everything to do with the fact he was very nice to Fletcher, spending hours with the boy, and nothing to do with the fact that he was handsome and had a sense of humour, and definitely nothing to do with the fact that although he was always there watching her, they had yet to have a non-confrontational conversation. Yes, Rachel tried to convince herself, she was watching Frank Farmer only because she was bored and hadn't been on a date in a long time. She stood at the window for a moment longer and then made up her mind. She would ask him and really he was a grown man, he didn't have to agree if he didn't want and Rachel herself was a grown woman and could handle rejection. At least she hoped she could. 000 By the time she made her way downstairs Frank was in his office working. She knocked on the half-open door and entered and sat down without waiting for an invitation. 'What changes have you come to complain about today?' he asked her. 'Is that why you think I'm here?' Rachel asked him, 'to complain?' 'It's all you ever do.' Frank replied. Rachel narrowed her eyes and looked at him, she wondered for a moment whether to get up and storm out of the room like she usually did but remained seated and smiled at him instead. Frank watched her smile slowly and knew that whatever had brought Rachel to his door, he wasn't sure he was ready for it. 'I have this little problem,' Rachel told him. 'Yes?' 'You're my bodyguard, right,' she began, 'so you have to go with me everywhere I go.' She paused, looked down and then looked at him again. 'What if somebody asks me out for an evening, a man you know, are you gonna come to?' Frank didn't reply. 'What if my date asks me to his place afterwards,' she continued, 'are the three of us gonna go back together?' she laughed awkwardly and then added, 'I think it would be very weird…so here's what I was thinking… since you have to be with me everywhere, why do we go out, you and I, for a date, you know just to hang out?' Rachel finished talking and looked at Frank who was just staring at her his expression blank. She probably shouldn't have asked him but it was too late now. 'Frank, only if you want to,' she told him, 'you and I can spend some time …like on a date,' she paused and added again for good measure, 'but only if you want to.' Rachel couldn't say that Nikki's timing always sucked but seeing her sister at Frank's office door at that moment, reminding her of some work she had yet to finish without hearing Frank's response really made her want to shout at her but as she stood up and left the room she thought to herself; maybe it was better that Frank hadn't responded. It was better to have no answer than to be rejected outright. 000 Frank watched Rachel leave the room and turned his attention to Nikki who had brought his jacket back to him, all cleaned and pressed. Nikki was really a very nice person and while he usually enjoyed talking to her, admittedly mostly about Rachel, he found that talking about Rachel today after what had just happened wasn't enough, he wondered how to politely get rid of Nikki but luckily his phone rang. 000 Frank couldn't believe Rachel had asked him on a date. It wasn't that he was unused to women being the aggressors, not that Rachel was that but still she had asked him on a date. The thing that was troubling him the most though was how tempted he was to say yes. He'd had wanted to say yes immediately. Then all his training came back. He was here to do a job, not to socialise and certainly not to get attached to his client. And yet he had never wanted to say yes more in his life. 000[Chapter 2] Thanks for reading and reviewing. 000 Frank quickly left the table after supper and made his way back to his room. It seemed to him that he hadn't had a moment to himself since Rachel had asked him out. He needed time – more time – to think about it. He was almost sure Rachel had only asked him out because of the reasons she'd given him. He needed to be around her all the time which would make her going out on a date awkward but he refused to believe that that was the only reason. She wouldn't have asked him out if she wasn't interested in him, would she? He had just shut the door behind him when he heard a knock. \"Hi, Frank. I hope I'm not disturbing you.\" Frank smiled at Fletch. \"No, of course not.\" \"See, Ma, I told you that he wouldn't mind,\" Fletcher called over his shoulder and Frank looked out and saw Rachel standing further down in the corridor. \"So Fletch,\" Frank turned to the boy, \"how can I help you?\" \"You promised to help me with my cars,\" Fletcher reminded him, \"and I was kind of hoping you could do it tonight although Ma said you were probably too busy to do so.\" \"There are cars to be fixed,\" Frank said, \"I can't be too tired for that, my man.\" \"Thank you,\" Rachel said to Frank as he and Fletch went past her to Fletch's room and he nodded in reply. 000 Rachel watched Frank and her son walk past her and sighed inwardly. She was in real danger of falling in love with Frank Farmer. Why couldn't he have brushed Fletch off and refused to help him? Why did he have to be so nice to everyone? She knew, although Nikki had tried to keep it from her, that Frank had gone to hear her sing at that seedy little club she insisted on singing at every week. He seemed to have time for everyone and everything and he managed to look good all the time. If she didn't find it so attractive so would have found it annoying. Well, he refused to go out with you, she reminded herself , so maybe he's not so nice after all. Still, Frank Farmer had wormed himself into their lives and she wondered how they would survive when he left… because he would have to leave eventually. Everyone did. 000 Frank worked with Fletch for almost two hours until they both agreed that they were too tired to continue and would return to their labours another time. Without knowing why he found himself walking towards the balcony and he wasn't surprised to find Rachel sitting there staring at the well-lit lawn. He watched her for a while; she hadn't seen him yet and debated with himself about joining her. Who was he kidding? \"Hi,\" he called out to her. Rachel turned and smiled at him. \"Frank, thanks again for helping Fletch, you know you don't have to.\" \"He's a great kid,\" Frank replied, 'I like spending time with him.\" \"That's my baby.\" Frank smiled; he just couldn't help himself. \"So, shopping tomorrow, uh?\" \"The first free day I've had in months,\" Rachel replied, \" and there's so much new stuff in my favourite boutique, so nothing, not even grouchy you is going to stop me from enjoying it.\" \"Really?\" \"I hope you're up to the challenge,\" Rachel told him, \"shopping is hard work.\" He looked at her, and decided it was now or never. \"Rachel, about your suggestion earlier…\" \"Yes?\" \"I accept.\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"You accept what?\" He shook his head. Why had he thought she would make it easy for him? \"You asked me out on a date, I accept.\" \"Okay, great.\" \"But I get to choose the place,\" he added. \"Why am I not surprised?\" He helped her out of the chair and they made their way back into the house. 000[Chapter 3] Thanks for reading and reviewing. 000 \"You're taking me to a karaoke bar?\" Rachel asked him incredulously. \"I thought you said you didn't like singing.\" \"I didn't say I didn't like singing,\" Frank replied. \"You know you did,\" Rachel insisted. \"You said and I quote, 'I don't sing'.\" \"I said that I would be willing to die for you,\" Frank reminded her, \"as your bodyguard because I can't sing.\" \"So you can't sing but you like going to karaoke bars, uh?\" \"It's my friend Joey's bar and since you don't want to be recognised in that get-up,\" he pointed at her outfit. \"It's perfect.\" She was wearing a pair of blue jeggings and a sweater; she'd also donned a woolen hat to disguise herself farther. Frank had laughed at her when he'd seen her in the morning and told her that that disguise would only fool the unobservant fans but that she needn't worry because the places he intended to take her wouldn't be frequented by any of her fans. They had gone to a Japanese film festival where his favourite film was showing, had lunch – a picnic – in the park and now he was taking her to a karaoke bar. Rachel had spent of that time trying to get him to talk about himself but the only things she'd learnt were that he was an only child and that he was close to his father. She had asked him if he was seeing anyone and his only answer had been a 'no' and he'd refused to expand on that. In fact the only thing that Rachel had found out for certain was that Frank didn't like singing, so of course she was surprised when he drove them to a karaoke bar. \"So Joey's a friend of yours?\" Rachel asked him. \"Not exactly,\" Frank replied, \"I met him on a case a few years ago and we became …friendly.\" \"I see.\" \"Don't bother asking him anything about me, though,\" Frank told her, \"he's more closemouthed than I am.\" Rachel had called him that earlier in the day. They entered the bar and were hit by the sound of one of Rachel's songs 'How Will I Know'. A trio of girls was up on the stage massacring the song. Rachel had never heard such a bad rendition of the song. A man walked up to them and greeted Frank and led them to his 'usual' table. \"So you've protected a lot of important people, haven't you?\" \"Some.\" \"You know Frank; you could have said no if you didn't want to hang out with me.\" \"What makes you think I don't want to hang out with you?\" \"You've shut down every topic of conversation that I've brought up,\" Rachel told him. \"Come to think of it the only time you seemed happy was when we were watching the movie.\" \"And what does tell you?\" he teased her. \"You think I talk too much,\" Rachel asked him, \"don't you?\" \"No,\" he tried and failed to suppress the smile that was forming. \"You do,\" Rachel insisted. \"Everybody does.\" \"It's not a bad thing,\" Frank told her. \"Your tone suggests different.\" \"I'm a quiet guy,\" he reminded her, \"I like to keep things to myself and in my profession that's a plus.\" \"So you're really not going to tell me anything about yourself?\" \"That really bugs you, doesn't it?\" \"Only because you know everything about me,\" Rachel told him. \"I'm sure there are things I don't know.\" 000 \"You seem surprised,\" Rachel told him. \"I am,\" Frank admitted. \"Well I have a son,\" Rachel reminded him, \"and we have to have things to talk about.\" \"So you talk about Doctor Who and Samurai X .\" \"Not Samurai X ,\" Rachel told him, \" Rurouni Kenshin .\" \"Is there a difference?\" \"Apparently\" Rachel assured him, \"and it's better than talking about other stuff.\" \"Let me guess…cars,\" Frank said. \"I can't understand his obsession with them.\" \"It's a guy thing.\" \"You wish.\" \"Okay,\" Frank conceded. \"It's not a guy thing.\" They drank in silence and then Rachel said \"I must tell you Frank you're not what I expected at all.\" \"What did you expect?\" \"I'm not sure,\" Rachel replied, \"but I definitely didn't expect Japanese movies and karaoke.\" \"Speaking of,\" Frank gestured at the stage were a man and a woman were singing 'Summer Nights'. \"No way,\" Rachel told him. \"Come on, you know you want to,\" Frank urged her. \"Is that why you brought me here?\" Rachel wagged her eyebrows at him. \"To make me sing for you?\" \"You sing in the house all the time,\" Frank reminded her. \"I don't need to make you sing. But tell you what, I'll sing a song if you sing.\" \"Really?\" Rachel couldn't help the excitement that buzzed through her. \"You first.\" 000 Frank stood on the stage waiting for the intro to end, wondering to himself why he was doing this. He didn't like singing…he couldn't sing and yet here he was humiliating himself for Rachel Marron. If I should stay , he sang Well, I would only be in your way And so I'll go, and yet I know That I'll think of you each step of my way And I will always love you I will always love you Two couples left their tables and went onto the dance floor and begin to dance. Bitter-sweet memories That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me Good-bye, oh, please don't cry 'Cause we both know that I'm not What you need But I will always love you I will always love you He saw Rachel wince when he went off-key but he continued singing And I hope life, will treat you kind And I hope that you have all That you ever dreamed of Oh, I do wish you joy And I wish you happiness But above all this I wish you love I love you, I will always love I will always, always love you I will always love you I will always love you Frank left the stage but asked Joey to keep the song playing and asked Rachel to dance. \"You weren't kidding,\" Rachel told him. \"You really can't sing.\" \"I told you.\" \"It would have helped if the song you chose wasn't so sad, though.\" \"You don't like those 'somebody's always leaving somebody' songs?\" he pretended to be shocked. \"I'm guessing it's your kind of music.\" \"It is.\" The song ended and Frank took her to choose a song. \"I really shouldn't,\" Rachel told him. She wasn't going to sing, not today on her day off and besides the only songs she knew were her own. \"A bet's a bet,\" Frank said. \"Unless, of course, you're chicken. And you can one of those songs by that Oscar nominee Rachel something or other.\" Joey assured her that they had all Rachel Marron's songs and she could choose any she wanted. Rachel stood up on the tiny stage and began to sing 'I Have Nothing'. Halfway through the song some of the patrons figured out that she really was Rachel Marron and as Frank watched them take pictures and record the singing he could have kicked himself for making her sing at Joey's. Thankfully she was just singing and not doing anything embarrassing. Luckily the patrons didn't do more than record the singing and take pictures and as soon as Rachel finished he got her out of Joey's. He needed to be more alert when he was with her; there was something about Rachel Marron that made him careless. 000 \"So this is your home,\" Rachel stood in the sitting room looking around, half his stuff was in boxes and he really needed to unpack and organize it. \"Definitely not what I expected,\" she turned around slowly and shook her head, \"on the other hand, it's exactly what I expected.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Really?\" \"You're a complicated guy,\" she told him, \"so it stands to reason that - .\" Frank had been watching her talk; he could see her lips moving but he couldn't really hear the words. All he could hear was the beating of his heart. He moved closer to her and leaned in as if in slow motion and kissed her. 000 ","Summary":" The Bodyguard doesn't belong to me A mix of the film and the musical Getting Fixed Up Rachel Marron"},{"Movie":"King's Speech","Title":"Enclosure","Author":"cruisedirector","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7484837","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This story is a crossover between the universes of The King's Speech and The Queen , and since both of those movies are based on historical events, I want to stress that this is entirely fiction. Although I didn't use the names of any real people who aren't characters in the films, it's going to be pretty obvious who inspired me, so if that is too close to RPF for you, you may want to skip this. Also be warned that there is non-explicit but implied love between two men. Enclosure She isn't sure it's wise to invite him. Her husband thinks not, absolutely not, but Philip doesn't know the whole story, and with her mother and sister gone, there is no one else she can ask for advice. In the end she follows her instinct and has her secretary place the call, inquiring about the young man's interest and stressing that it will be a private luncheon...a magnanimous gesture from a monarch who remembers the grandfather he never knew. She trusts that a man in his position will understand the need for absolute discretion, though as she waits, she wonders how many members of his family already know the truth, which she will never mention unless he finds a way to broach the subject. She feels uneasy that morning, but when the hour arrives, it passes very pleasantly. The grandson is not as young as she had supposed, though younger than her own children; he is respectful, self-deprecating, witty like his grandfather, and if he is intimidated by her, he doesn't show it. She finds this charming, perhaps in the way her father must have found Lionel Logue charming when they first met. The grandson is thrilled to hear stories about his grandfather from someone who knew him when she was only a child, particularly since her family held Logue in such affection. She thinks that perhaps she was wrong in her suspicions, though she'd felt so sure, while watching his interviews, that he must have discovered what she'd thought she was the only person still alive to know for certain. Perhaps what she had taken to be hints from him had been meant only as jokes to publicize the film, the same way the actors who played her father and his speech therapist claimed to have fallen in love with each other. It isn't until after the dessert plates have been cleared - leaving them completely alone for the first time - that she realizes the grandson might have been waiting for a moment of privacy to speak. He reaches into a pocket and pulls out a yellowed, slightly rumpled envelope. \"I hope that I'm not overstepping, ma'am, but I wonder whether this is why you wanted to meet with me,\" he says quietly, passing it to her. She doesn't need to open it to know what it must say. To nod would mean not only to acknowledge that she has a hidden agenda, but to confirm the truth of conclusions he must have come to on his own. She holds her head and her expression steady, rubbing one thumb over her father's handwriting on the envelope. \"My grandfather wrote in his diary near the end of his life that he was going to destroy all private correspondence from the King,\" the grandson tells her. \"It puzzled me at first, because obviously there's a great deal of personal correspondence that he saved - progress reports on tours and thank-you notes for gifts, things of that nature, which I talked about when I was interviewed about the movie. There are also gaps in the diaries. I asked my aunt what she thought it meant, but she didn't want to tell me. I kept after her for months before she gave me that letter.\" It would be easy to speak in icy tones, to dismiss the speculation of an old woman and to warn this stranger what might happen if he threatened her father's reputation. She forces herself to nod and listen. If this man had wanted to ruin her family, he could have done so already. In all the television appearances and promotional interviews, he has never mentioned the existence of the letter nor anything like it. \"I'm pretty sure my grandfather did what he said he would and destroyed the correspondence. There aren't any other letters like this one. My aunt thought Lionel couldn't bear to destroy this last letter.\" \"Where did she get it?\" The words come out more sharply than intended. \"She inherited it from her husband, who was Lionel's middle son. She said that her husband had found it under the mattress when Lionel died. I don't think my father or his other brother knew that it existed, and my aunt and uncle never told their own children. Lionel knew that he was going to be cremated and had asked my uncle, who was a surgeon, to burn whatever was left with him. My aunt thinks that Lionel must have meant this letter.\" \"Why didn't your uncle burn it?\" she demands. There are a half-dozen reasons, easy to guess, all for the benefit of the Logue family: fame, wealth, notoriety, blackmail, anti-Royalist sentiment, or if she wishes to be kinder, perhaps merely a reminder of the family's onetime proximity to power, much the same way that Camilla reportedly had bragged to Charles that her great-grandmother had been his great-great-grandfather's mistress. The grandson is hesitating, looking directly at her, evidently able to guess at what she might be thinking. \"I suppose my uncle must have kept it as a way to remember his father,\" he says finally. \"I didn't know him well, but this uncle had become a doctor, which my grandfather said in his diaries that he would have wanted to be as well if his circumstances had been different. I think my uncle always thought he was very close with Lionel because they had so many things in common. To have discovered only after Lionel died that my uncle didn't know something of such great importance to his father may have been a shock to him. Or perhaps my uncle already wondered, but never could talk to his father about it. If it had been me, I might have saved the letter just to feel I understood the man a little better.\" Her knuckles have gone white, clutching the envelope; she is crumpling the old, fragile paper, damaging the letter within. That should not matter - she will have to burn it later, as the grandson surely understood when he handed it to her - yet she sets it down and smooths it out, glancing at the stains on the envelope from who could guess how many rereadings. \"What does it say?\" she asks, disliking the idea of this stranger quoting her father's private words and at the same time knowing that she may never feel strong enough to open the envelope and read them in his own handwriting. The grandson's eyes drop and his cheeks flush. \"Nothing vulgar.\" She wonders whether that sort of note ever existed - whether a King of England could have been rash enough to send erotic letters to a man. Her mother had insinuated that her uncle's naughty letters to Noel Coward had been taken and destroyed before they could be wielded against his family. Surely her father had veiled whatever feelings he might have had in less incriminating language. She can't help wondering whether Lionel had chosen this particular letter because he believed it to be the safest or contrarily because it was the most passionate. She also can't help wondering whether the grandson is wrong that his own father never knew - perhaps Lionel's other sons knew all too well, and chose not to give their own offspring any hint of such an explosive family secret, the same way she and her sister never shared all that they knew about their father with their children. \"Is there anything that might explain why your grandfather saved just this one?\" she asks the grandson, holding up the envelope. \"The language is very...affectionate.\" The man is still blushing, still choosing his words with great care. \"I know that people were more expressive of their feelings in those days. But if it ever got out, people now would read it as something sordid.\" If there's one thing she learned from Diana's death, it's that despite the decline of letter-writing as an art form, modern people are far more expressive of their intimate emotions than were those of her generation or the generation before, whether commoners or kings. She does not mention that her father was never a very demonstrative man, so any letter that sounds even a bit affectionate indicates a great depth of feeling for its subject. No matter how he might try to spare her sensibilities, it's clear that the grandson believes this to be a love letter. Curiosity battles with concern in his expression; after a few moments, curiosity wins. \"You thought that I might have something like this when you invited me,\" he speculates. She chooses to ignore the gross breach of etiquette, saying instead, \"Thank you for bringing it to me. I hope that you will do me the favor of letting me keep it.\" His breath catches, but she knows he must have made his decision when he elected to come to the Palace with the envelope in his pocket. To him, it is a titillating relic from an ancestor he never knew. To her, it is a time-delayed bomb bearing the signature of her beloved father. \"Of course, Your Majesty,\" he says. \"Again, we thank you.\" She will send him a souvenir of her father in return when a suitable amount of time has passed. \"My family appreciates your family's loyalty.\" \"We feel honored that a member of our family was able to serve the King. Just as I am honored to be here today.\" It's a rehearsed response, like her own. They have already moved past the moment for sharing any connection. She reaches for the teapot to ask whether he would like another cup, and smiles in approval when he tells her he has had too much already. Once he is gone, she takes the letter to her bedroom, where she asks a maid to light the vanilla candles she sometimes requests to get rid of the smell of the window cleaner. No one will ask what she has been burning once the ashes are in the rubbish bin. When she is alone, she pulls the letter from the envelope, wondering whether the streaks on the back might be tear stains or merely an effect of the stationery's age. Years ago, her father's hand had turned this page over onto itself and creased the fold into the center. She is a loving daughter and a Queen: surely she is brave enough to face whatever words she may find inside. She unfolds the paper as she knows Lionel must have done, the first time he read it and many times after. My dear Logue , the familiar handwriting begins. I had to write once more before leaving on this dreadfully long tour, to tell you again how much I will miss you and long for your presence...

Lionel knew that Bertie was terrified about the ceremony, yet Bertie's wife exuded confidence. Since she had not yet been crowned Her Majesty and was still a mortal like himself, Lionel let himself wonder whether this was because she would soon receive the title her husband's brother had wished to bestow upon an American divorcee. Bertie had never wanted to be king, but as for what his wife had wanted for him - and for herself and their daughters - Lionel was less certain. He'd heard whispers that Elizabeth had turned down Bertie's marriage proposals at first in the hope of luring the attentions of the brother destined for the throne. If she had dreamed of becoming Queen of England, all her choices had been vindicated. No wonder she seemed so pleased with herself. The Duchess caught his gaze, which Lionel quickly lowered. He feared that she would guess at his ungenerous thoughts, but on this night she was quick to forgive even breaches of etiquette. \"My husband tells me that you have a great fondness for Shakespeare,\" she said in a friendly tone. Lionel had waited for years for such an opportunity. He blurted out, \"Your husband tells me that you grew up in Glamis Castle.\" It was not something he had ever dared to bring up in conversation for fear of sounding like a royal hanger-on, but her words had seemed to be an offer to pursue the subject. Indeed, she nodded at him encouragingly. \"May I ask what it was like? \"Not so much grand as imposing. Quite drafty, especially in winter.\" She smiled at him. \"Alas, I'm told that Macbeth and his lady never actually lived there. Macbeth killed Duncan fairly on the battlefield, you know, after Duncan led an army into his lands. It was Duncan's grandfather Malcolm who died at Glamis, and it was not from murder most foul.\" Lionel refrained from mentioning that that line was from Hamlet , not Macbeth . \"I see you've studied your history as well as your Shakespeare,\" he said instead, returning her smile. \"I'm sometimes asked about it by people who prefer the version of events in the play. I'm afraid that I must disappoint them when I explain that no dagger of the mind has ever appeared before me. But the castle does have a ghost. To this day, we leave an empty seat in the chapel for the Grey Lady.\" Lionel was curious whether the unfortunate Grey Lady - the tortured and executed Lady Glamis, Janet Douglas - had been burned at the stake by one of Elizabeth's own ancestors. But again, he held his tongue. The Duchess of York had made it apparent that she was more desirous than the Duke to wear a crown. Lionel had heard her order her husband to be brave, just as the Lady of Glamis in Shakespeare's play had done when she learned of the destiny for which Macbeth seemed intended. Beneath her gentility, what ruthlessness might Bertie's wife disguise? Lionel could picture her in the famous role, hissing, \"Thou shalt be what thou art promised.\" Bertie emerged with the archbishop, looking tired and nervous. Lionel gave him an encouraging smile, then glanced at Elizabeth. Her expression was not so much concerned as determined. Lionel could also well imagine how far this Scottish lady might go to seize the throne, should a trio of witches arrive before sundown.

Lionel considéra les propos de Myrtle un instant. « Présente tes excuses » avait-elle dit quand il avait émis l'idée que peut-être il était allé trop loin avec son patient. Il soupira et se dit que oui, des excuses feraient surement du bien à leur amitié. Non pas que Bertie et lui soient réellement des amis – Bertie ne le reconnaitrait jamais, et qui Lionel était-il pour l'y obliger ? On ne force pas un Roi à admettre des choses qu'il n'a pas envie d'admettre. C'est là le privilège des monarques. Ils crient et ragent, mais au bout du compte, ce ne sont pas eux qui se déplacent pour présenter leurs excuses. Même si, de l'avis de Lionel, les choses que lui avaient dites Bertie méritaient des excuses. Certes, il était un acteur raté, il ne servait plus à rien qu'il se le cache. Certes, son père n'avait pas le prestige de celui de Bertie – tout le monde n'a pas la chance de naître dans une famille royale. Certes, il n'était qu'un rien-du-tout. Mais Lionel n'en restait pas moins un homme dont les sentiments avaient été heurtés par les propos de celui qu'il avait, en secret, commencé à appeler son ami. Soupirant à nouveau, il enleva ses lunettes et observa son épouse, détendue sur le canapé où Bertie s'était si souvent assis. Myrtle avait raison : il fallait qu'il aille trouver Bertie, son futur Roi – Lionel n'en avait aucun doute – et qu'il s'excuse. C'était peut-être le sort d'une nation qui se jouait là, car il ne faisait aucun doute que le Roi Edward VIII allait abdiquer et que Bertie prendrait le trône à sa place. Et dans l'état actuel des choses, Lionel était mieux placé que quiconque pour savoir que s'il avait l'étoffe d'un grand Roi, Bertie n'en avait pas encore tout à fait la voix. Alors il se leva, embrassa rapidement le front de sa femme, attrapa son manteau, son chapeau, un parapluie, et un sourire de circonstance, et sortit sous les torrents que le ciel londonien crachait sur lui. Arrivé à la résidence de Bertie, on lui demanda d'attendre, on allait prévenir le Duc d'York de sa visite. Lionel s'assit, se sentant bien trop petit dans cette opulence qu'était la demeure d'un « fils de Roi », d'un « frère de Roi » – d'un futur Roi, Lionel en était certain – lui qui était né dans la pauvre et aride Australie et qui habitait encore aujourd'hui dans une Londres miséreuse. Bien vite, malheureusement, Lionel s'entendit dire que le Duc était occupé, et quand il déclara être prêt à attendre ou à repasser plus tard, on lui fit comprendre que Bertie ne souhaitait pas le revoir. Et quand l'un des majordomes lui ouvrit la porte pour le faire sortir de la maison du Duc, de la vie de Bertie, alors qu'au dehors il pleuvait toujours des trombes d'eau, Lionel ne put s'empêcher de penser qu'il pleuvait surement encore plus en lui.

This is my first fanfic for the King's Speech. Hope you enjoy! Disclaimer: I do not own the King's Speech \" Bertie. It's time.\" Those three, simple words spoken from the mouth of my dearest wife Elizabeth have threatened to send my heart into the throes of palpitations so violent, that they had the potential to bring me to a premature death. My poor, innocent, unsuspecting daughter Lilibet; destined to become Queen of England at the tender age of thirteen because her father the cowardly King didn't have the courage to give a mere ten minute speech! It's just as well; she would certainly perform the job much better than I! Dear lord! Now I am most certainly in a bind! I find it downright inconceivable that I, King George the Sixth must deliver a speech which will be broadcast to not only the nation but also to countless others that make up the established British colonies overseas! Of course my father, King George the Fifth had no trouble, and neither did my brother. I mean to say, while I can concede that the content of David's speech was none too easy, what with his abdicating from the throne on which I reluctantly now reside, he is highly eloquent when he speaks, an enviable quality which I most certainly do not possess! Oh, what I wouldn't give for him to be standing in my place at this moment, staring down a long corridor which inevitably leads to the royal broadcasting studio! Good Lord! I feel as if I am a man walking towards his death, rather than a high King preparing to rally his people together in anticipation of a war! No, my own personal war always seems to be waged against the microphone, or rather, my own pitifully debilitating stutter. If it weren't for Logue, bless the man, I certainly would be in a much worse state than I am now! My own tongue and throat are my enemies, the obstacles blocking my pathway to victory, and Lionel is my chief strategist in this battle between stutter and speech. It is solely because of him, that I am able to even have a modicum of control over my own voice. \" Now remember, the red light will blink four times and then I've asked them to turn it off, because we don't want that evil eye staring at you all the way through.\" Humph. Evil eye indeed. It's a smart idea of Lionel's to turn that blasted light off. When I find myself delivering any speech (albeit poorly so), it transforms itself into a glaring beacon of terror and foreboding, challenging me to utter a single sentence aloud that does not come with a stutter or pause in between the words. \" Forty seconds sir.\" Oh, good God! Forty seconds! Only forty seconds? Whatever am I to do? I know I have practiced the speech for what must by now be thousands of times, but still! All of the gruesome scenarios that could occur in mere seconds ! Dear me, I have no idea how I ever became King... Why, if my ancestors looked upon me now, surely, they'd be turning over in their graves! I should just stop now, quit while I'm ahead...or, at least try to salvage what little dignity I have left. Maybe I'm the one who should have been forced to abdicate the throne after all! \" Forget everything else, and just say it to me. Say it to me as a friend.\" Right; Logue is here, and I am not alone. Lionel Logue, the Australian son of a brewer. Dr. Logue, the speech therapist. Lionel, my friend. Surely, I can recite my speech to him without utterly humiliating myself! After all, that is what I've been doing for the past couple of hours. C'mon Bertie! Get it together man, you are King now! King of England and the whole of the United Kingdom. King of practically a third of the globe. You are King George VI, and most importantly of all, you have a voice! That sentence alone brings an immediate memory to mind, one that has the overwhelming power to strengthen my resolve and bolster my confidence. I find that this single, vivid memory will give me the courage to begin the speech which will rally my people together. (Flashback): I whirl around in frustration as I realize the infuriating Lionel Logue isn't listening to a word I'm saying. I vouched for him to the Archbishop of Canterbury, convincing him that Lionel was a credible, trustworthy, qualified speech therapist, despite his precise lack of credentials, and this is how the man repays me? With ignorance? Why, I should lock him in the Tower of London for his impertinence! The sight which greeted me when I turned around to face him however, made the situation much worse. \" What are you doing? Get up! You can't sit there! GET UP!\" \" Why not? It's a chair.\" \" No, that...It is not a chair. T-that... that is Saint Edward's chair.\" \" People have carved their names on it.\" \" That... chair... is the seat on which every king and queen has... You ah-are trivializing everything. You trivialize... –\" \" I don't care about how many royal highnesses have sat in this chair.\" \" Listen to me. LISTEN TO ME!\" \" Listen to you? By what right?\" \" By divine right if you must, I am your king.\" \" No you're not, you told me so yourself. You didn't want it. Why should I waste my time listening?\" \" Because I have a right to be heard. I HAVE A VOICE!\" \" Yes, you do. \"You have such perseverance Bertie, you're the bravest man I know.\" (End Flashback) I find that those fateful words said on that day, the day before my coronation, had come from somewhere deeper than the recesses of my mind. I believe that they came from my very soul, that some part of me, despite being afflicted with a stuttering problem, desperately wished to be a good leader to my country. Those words, and those words alone , had made me realize that I was ready to become King. And now, those same words let me know that I am ready to begin my first wartime speech. Because I have a voice. And it will be bloody well heard. \" In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself...\" Did you like it?

Disclaimer: I do not "},{"Movie":"King's Speech","Title":"Temper","Author":"cruisedirector","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7514260","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Note: According to a biographer, King George VI once threw a sword in a fit of anger and nearly hit his steward. Sometimes it's the pages of the speech that get flung across the room. Sometimes it's a pen or a paperweight. Today, however, it's the ceremonial sword that comes flying past, missing Lionel by inches. A dagger of the mind , he thinks rather wildly, unable to believe that Bertie would actually toss such a thing - sharp enough to be deadly, both the finely wrought blade and the symbolic honor of the King. Yet there it lies, clattering faintly against the floor which bears a new garish scratch. Bertie looks as astonished as Lionel feels, staring at the sword as though he can't quite make out how it got there. Lionel clears his throat. It wouldn't do for the speech therapist to stammer, even now...perhaps particularly not now, when the King might believe himself mocked. \"I think that's enough practice,\" says Lionel awkwardly, turning away from the weapon, very nearly turning away from the King. \"Don't -\" The fury is still there, in Bertie's voice and in Bertie's clenched fists, though it seems as if Bertie doesn't know it. His eyes have grown wide with surprise, still glancing from Lionel to the sword and back. It isn't impossible that Bertie will blame Lionel for the sword lying there, insisting that Lionel provoked him past the point of reason. Lionel is usually a very patient man, but suddenly it's too much - Bertie's rage, Bertie's condemnation, Bertie's alternating insistence that he can't manage any of it without Lionel and that Lionel is nothing but an unqualified common colonial. Careful not to commit the deliberate and intolerable insult of turning his back, Lionel shuffles toward the chair with his case. \"A few minutes of rest will do you more good than another rehearsal.\" \"Lionel.\" The name makes him meet Bertie's eyes. Usually at the Palace it's \"Logue\" or still, occasionally, \"Doctor.\" Bertie's mouth works, but no sound emerges. His jaw is more tightly locked now than it was while he read the speech. At such times, Lionel instinctively reaches out to help - sometimes with words of encouragement, sometimes with a diversion, occasionally with a hand on Bertie's shoulder or his forearm. The arm nearest Lionel now - the right, the one Bertie was trained to favor for writing and shooting, traumatizing his brain and quite possibly leading to his stammer - is the same arm that moments earlier hurled the sword. He keeps his hands at his sides. It is Bertie who steps forward, surprise giving way to panic, fingers clutching at the air when Lionel lurches aside too quickly to stop himself. He doesn't mean to do it. It's an automatic recoil from the hand shooting out at him so soon after the blade. He forces himself to stand and face Bertie while Bertie's hand lowers, going still at his side, though Bertie's head shakes \"no\" again and again. Lionel can see the conscious effort it takes for Bertie to stop it, to shut his eyes and pause, to take a deep breath from the diaphragm, to rock onto the balls of his feet - all tricks Lionel has taught Bertie. \"I shouldn't have done that.\" It isn't an apology, but it's more consideration than Lionel usually gets when Bertie has one of his gnashes, and he knows that he owes Bertie (that he owes the King ) acknowledgment. He nods stiffly, still not entirely certain that he trusts his own voice. If he could smile, Lionel knows, he could consign the incident to the past, perhaps even make Bertie smile too and get them back on track with the speech during the few minutes of rehearsal left to them. It shouldn't be difficult for someone who's trained in the control of the mouth and jaw to turn up his lips, slide his lower teeth forward, let the muscles of his face crinkle the skin around his eyes and crease laugh lines into his forehead. He can't do it. \"P-please,\" Bertie continues, his remorse plain as he turns his palms out to Lionel, raising his hands. Is he offering them for Lionel to take or merely showing Lionel that they are empty? Lionel won't risk reaching out and being rebuffed. Instead he offers Bertie his own copy of the speech. Bertie lowers his head, frowning, but he takes the pages, and after a moment he begins to read. His voice is slightly unsteady but less forced than earlier. He is midway through the third paragraph without a significant break or sputter when a knock on the door interrupts. The equerry's face remains impassive as he enters, pauses, picks up the sword, polishes it, and awaits the King's approach before offering the handle. The King replaces it in the decorative scabbard. \"I shall need a moment,\" he tells the equerry, waiting for the bowed head, the acquiescence (always very good, sir ), and the click as the door closes behind the man. He glances back at Lionel. \"Is it better now?\" Lionel doesn't know whether Bertie means the speech or the wound Bertie inflicted when he flung the sword, even if it never came close to touching Lionel. It's a complicated question. Lionel is a paid employee of the Crown, better treated than some. He has always known that the King has a temper, and that the sort of work they do together often triggers frustration that has nothing to do with Lionel's teaching. The real question is why Lionel feels so wounded. Much easier to take the simplest meaning of Bertie's question. The speech is indeed better, and Lionel is able to smile as he nods in encouragement. Bertie smiles back, his face transformed with relief at the apparent reprieve. \"You'll stay where I can see you while I give the speech?\" asks Bertie, wholly unnecessarily, since that is why Lionel is here. Again Lionel nods, and the reassurance comforts him as well. \"Of course. Though you won't need me - you'll be fine.\" \"Yes, I will.\" Bertie's face colors, though not with fury this time. \"I need you to -\" Again a knock interrupts, this time a reminder that an audience is waiting. Lionel's smile comes more easily. \"I'll be right there,\" he says again. \"Thank you.\" That, too, is something Bertie doesn't often say. When courtesy demands it, of course he expresses what gratitude is necessary, but heartfelt expressions of appreciation are more rare - only when something punctures the invisible barrier that separates royal from commoner. Like a sword flung across a room.

All of these characters are dead, and those living are merely mentioned; so I own nothing! I got inspired to write this after watching the Royal Wedding as well as the King's Speech. Announcement Buckingham Palace…November 16, 2010…Press Room… Queen Mary silently leaned over the Press Sectary's shoulder to read the announcement that he was preparing to place on palace's gates: The Prince of Wales is pleased to announce the betrothal of his son, Prince William of Wales to Ms. Catherine Middleton. She pursed her lips in faint disapproval; as usual she kept her feelings to herself, but deep within her she couldn't help wishing that her great-great grandson picked someone from one of the local nobility or even from one of the royal houses; however it was not to be, the Lord apparently had a plan concerning William and Ms. Middleton. Sighing, she passed thru a wall toward the ballroom where nearly everyone who had lived in this particular palace gathered; ignoring the tourists whom shivered as she passed thru, she announced, \"It's true.\" Queen Victoria, once again young and beautiful, grimaced in displeasure and reluctantly said, \"Well, at least our family will not have another situation as we did with Diana or Sarah…hopefully.\" Mutters of agreement went around the room, her husband commented, \"I do feel sorry, for Diana; she will not be there in the flesh to welcome her new daughter-in-law.\" Prince Albert looked sadly at his daughters and sons that were gathered in the room, \"I understand all to well on what she will be feeling when her son marries his bride.\" More mutters of agreement went around the room, finally Queen Alexandra hesitantly asked, \"Who will tell her? Everyone stared at each other uncertainly; finally a voice with a slight stutter called out, \"Elizabeth and I w-will go!\" Everyone stared at them, \"Are you certain Bertie? Elizabeth?\" questioned King George V. King George VI stared at his father bravely, \"Yes, I-I too understand w-what she will be feeling,\" he then gave his wife a stern look, \"And Elizabeth, I-I think it's about t-time that you and D-Diana have a long t-talk. If my b-brother and I can at least meet e-each other h-halfway…you and D-Diana can at least do b-better than us.\" Queen Elizabeth stared at her husband thoughtfully, \"Oh, all right! I suppose its partial my fault in pushing them together,\" she reluctantly admitted, \"But, that doesn't mean I will totally forgive her for what she put this family thru!\" \"I wouldn't expect you too,\" he muttered to her as he kissed her check. As they disappeared from the room, Prince Arthur asked, \"Speaking of David, where is he? I thought he would be here with us.\" \"He won't come without Wallis,\" answered Princess Mary, and her brother added, \"He is also reluctant to be near Gan-Gan and Papa.\" Prince Arthur shook his head in disapproval, \"In other words, he is still hiding from them after that lecture they gave him.\" \"Quite,\" said his great nephew. Althorp Estate… \"I hope she's here,\" grumbled Queen Elizabeth. \"Darling, you know she's rarely left here since her boys graduated Sandhurst,\" he gently chided her. She grunted in agreement, and then pointed out toward the lake, \"There she is.\" He looked over at the lake, and there sitting on the ground near the water, was Diana, Princess of Wales. She was gazing sadly at the island she was buried on, and tears were slowly going down her cheeks. King George winced in despair and softly said, \"It l-looks like w-we maybe too late.\" Queen Elizabeth sighed sadly, \"No matter what I or anyone else says about her; she was a good mother to William and Harry.\" She sighed again, and reluctantly told him, \"I better do this alone, Bertie. Why don't you go and see what Dr. Louge is up too?\" \"Knowing h-him, he is probably w-watching the rehearsals at the Globe,\" he told her, and then disappeared from sight. Sydney, Australia… Lionel Louge and his wife watched the sun set from atop the Sydney Opera House, he sighed in amazement, \"I can't believe we are doing this, we could get killed!\" Myrtle Louge smirked at him, \"We are already dead, Lionel,\" she said with amusement. \"Ah, yes,\" he muttered, \"You're beauty fair lady, made me forget!\" \"Lionel!\" she chuckled out, \"Really!\" Suddenly, King George VI appeared beside them, \"Finally! I had a h-hard time finding you Lionel!\" The couple sighed with despair, and Lionel asked, \"What do you want Bertie? You're ruining a perfectly magnificent evening!\" \"Sorry,\" he apologized, \"I thought you w-would like to know…William has finally proposed to young Kate.\" \"That's wonderful, your Majesty!\" exclaimed Myrtle, while her husband shouted, \"It's about bloody time!\" \"Yes, it is about time,\" agreed the King, and then he gently chided, \"Myrtle, h-how many times have I told you? Call me Bertie, please! W-we're all friends, and in death w-we are all equals!\" \"Yes, you're…Bertie,\" she agreed reluctantly. They were silent for a moment, until Louge asked, \"I realize that you're great-grandson has had a difficult life, but I do wonder where young William gained his reluctance about marriage from?\" \"Elizabeth,\" answered Bertie, \"I had to ask h-her three times before she would agree; the situation with h-his parents merely a-amplified it.\" \"Bertie, really!\" protested a feminine voice out of the air, suddenly Queen Elizabeth was sitting beside them; \"I wasn't reluctant!\" Her husband merely gave her a knowing look, finally she grudgingly admitted, \"Well, perhaps slightly reluctant.\" Quickly she changed the subject, \"Diana should be fine, and I left her with her grandmother.\" The King looked at his wife, and inquired, \"And?\" \"We talked,\" she said, \"I imagine we will never be close, but we did reach an understanding.\" \"Good,\" muttered her husband. Once again silence reigned, until Dr. Louge asked, \"Your Majesty, are you going to reach an understanding with the Duchess of Windsor as well?\" Queen Elizabeth gave him a cold, hard look; finally he answered his own question, \"Perhaps not.\" \"Indeed,\" she muttered, and then looked toward the sunset, \"This is a lovely view, and the sunset is magnificent from here!\" Planning December 1, 2010... Buckingham Place…The Queen's Drawing Room… The royal ladies gathered around the room to watch the future queen choose a tiara for her wedding day, \"I believe,\" mused Queen Victoria, \"She will choose my Fringe Tiara.\" \"I don't believe so, mama,\" said Princess Beatrice, \"Perhaps the Russian tiara that Mary bought years ago.\" \"I don't think so, Beatrice,\" opposed Queen Mary, \"I believe it will be the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland Tiara.\" \"I believe it will be the Strathmore Tiara,\" stated Queen Elizabeth. A moment later, they stood in stunned silence, \"The Scroll Tiara!\" muttered Princess Louise. \"Elizabeth… wasn't that the tiara that Bertie had made for you?\" questioned Queen Mary. \"Yes,\" she answered softly, \"I loved the design when it was presented to me, but I only received it two weeks before the abdication. Ever since that time, I loathed the memories it brought up.\" Silence reigned once again, finally Queen Victoria muttered sarcastically, \"Well, she is already wearing a ring that is cursed; she may as well wear a cursed tiara for her wedding day.\" \"Perhaps she will have better luck with both pieces of jewelry,\" Queen Alexandria quietly suggested. \"One can only hope and pray that you are right, Alexandria,\" stated her mother-in-law, \"Please tell me, how is my descendent the Crown Prince of Denmark and his wife are doing? I understand she will deliver twins next month, correct?\" \"Yes, Mama,\" answered Queen Alexandra, \"From her latest sonogram… I believe it's called…the doctor has told them that they are having a boy and a girl.\" \"Isn't that lovely!\" exclaimed Queen Victoria, \"Absolutely delightful!\" Planning II February 1, 2011… The Royal School of Needlework, Hampton Court… Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and Myrtle Louge watched silently as the last piece of lace appliqué was finished, finally Mrs. Louge broke the silence, \"This will be a beautiful dress, your Majesties, it reminds me of Princess Grace's wedding gown.\" \"Mmm,\" muttered Queen Elizabeth in agreement, \"I believe that is whom she had in mind; in order to differentia herself from Diana's wedding day.\" The women slowly drifted away from the scene, and were slowly making their way thru Hampton Court when Queen Mary suddenly commanded, \"Stop.\" Queen Elizabeth and Mrs. Louge stared at the elder queen in concern, \"Is everything all right, ma'am?\" Mrs. Louge quietly asked. \"We are in the,\" she began to explain, \"Quickly, step back!\" Just as soon as they followed her order, a woman with long blond hair and wearing Tudor clothing rushed past them toward the Chapel Royal, she screamed as she faded from sight, \"Your Majesty! I beg of you, your Majesty!\" \"As I was going to say,\" breathed out Queen Mary, \"We are in what is called the Haunted Corridor; and that was…\" \"Catherine Howard,\" interrupted Mrs. Louge, and then said meekly, \"Your Majesty.\" \"Indeed,\" said Queen Mary, \"She is trapped here and at the Tower.\" \"Well,\" gasped out Queen Elizabeth, \"It was lovely to meet her, but I rather not see her again anytime soon.\" Wedding Anniversary April 26, 2011… Westminster Abbey… King George VI and Queen Elizabeth slowly walked around the volunteers that were preparing the Abbey for a royal wedding, the King remarked, \"Trees, w-why in heaven's name are they bringing t-trees into the abbey?\" \"I believe to make it seem more like a wedding at a small country church, darling,\" answered the Queen, \"After the wedding they will be planted at Highgrove,\" she frowned in thought, \"Or was it Windsor?\" Her husband grunted in disbelief, \"It seems incredible foolish to me! At our w-wedding…\" He stopped as something occurred to him, \"My God, I just realized!\" \"Yes, dear?\" she asked in concern. \"Darling, do you realize what today is?\" he asked. Her eyes narrowed in concentration, and then a slow smile spread across her lips, \"Our wedding anniversary, eighty-eight years ago today…how could I have forgotten?\" \"How could we have forgotten,\" corrected her husband. \"Thou have been concentrating on the living,\" explained a male voice. They turned around, and immediately bowed and said as one, \"Your Majesty.' King Edward the Confessor waved them up, \"Rise, thou has no need to bow to me…we are all equal in the Lord's eyes. As I was saying, thou have been concentrating on the living; for they are more interesting than the dead. Soon, ye shall forgot the minor things in thy lives, then thy major things, and then thy shall be like I. Watching the living, advising them when it is needed, and waiting for the day when the Lord shall come again.\" They nodded their heads in understanding, finally King George VI said, \"T-thank you for telling us.\" \"Ye are welcome,\" King Edward told them, \"Now, could one of ye explain why these lovely trees are in the abbey?\" Wedding Day April 29, 2011 Westminster Abbey… The gathering of spirits…old and new; rich and poor in their lives watched eagerly as the bride and groom went down the aisle. The mother of the groom wept tears of joy and sadness, muttered, \"William, my little man…he looked so handsome!\" \"There, there,\" whispered her parents as her father pulled her into a comforting embrace; \"Come,\" he whispered, \"We don't want to miss the party.\" As the gathering of spirits went their separate ways; only four spirits were left, and slowly they drifted around the nave. \"Thank you for allowing us to be with you on this grand occasion,\" said Dr. Louge. \"Yes, thank you,\" repeated his wife. \"N-no thanks are n-necessary,\" King George VI told them, \"You are dear friends, and p-part of our family…n-no matter what P-papa and the rest of them think!\" They were silent for a moment, until Queen Elizabeth exclaimed, \"Dear Lord, what is he doing?\" \"I believe doing somersaults down the aisle, ma'am,\" replied Dr. Louge as he watched the priest making a spectacle of himself. \"Doesn't he realize that the c-cameras are still on?\" King George VI asked in disbelief. \"I don't think so, sir,\" he once again replied, \"And if he does, I don't believe he cares.\" \"Well,\" resignedly said Queen Elizabeth, \"It was a lovely wedding.\" ","Summary":" I own nothing!

It is whispered that Queen Mary got rid of his predecessor for courting a woman. James Stuart had admired the youngest daughter of the Earl of Strathmore before the Duke did. Now Campbell must pretend not to know that, though he thinks of it whenever he bows to the Duchess. As the Duke's equerry, Campbell is privy to secrets, overheard conversations, dictated correspondence, one-sided discussions over the telephone. He knows who the Duke calls, and when, and often why. He is trusted not for his devotion, but his silence. (2) Campbell glances at the messy pile on the desk. On top sits a half-written letter to the Duke's brother, words crossed out, bottom of the page torn. Campbell's impulse is to straighten the pile, but he knows better than to touch anything. The Prime Minister has rung again. Whether this constitutes a sufficient reason to interrupt the Duke's speech lessons, Campbell can't say for certain. It's easier to stall the secretary and the man for whom he works. Campbell can say for certain that if he interrupts the Duke and Logue for less than an emergency, he'll suffer for it. (3) No matter how disastrous a speech might be, it is Campbell's job to remain impassive. He may offer no words of reassurance beforehand, no comforting jokes afterward. He can see the Duchess weeping at Wembley. He can't miss the Archbishop's frown at the Accession Council. Yet he is not permitted to react to the Duke's misery nor the dismay of others. The Duchess once guessed that Campbell's job must be terrible on days when the Duke is in a temper. But in truth, the temper makes it easier. Repressing his own anger stops Campbell feeling the Duke's pain so keenly. (4) \"Tell him that I'm b-b-busy.\" He knows immediately that that isn't what the Duke really wants to say, but it isn't Campbell's place to contradict a prince. \"What shall I say if he offers to wait?\" The Duke's closed fist strikes the desk. \"Tell him that I'm very busy.\" \"Very good, sir.\" It isn't very good, but it isn't Campbell's place to say that, either. He exits the office, delivers the message. Logue shows no sign of anger; he nods once, thanks Campbell, and departs. It certainly isn't Campbell's place to tell Logue that the Duke is being an idiot. (5) After the coronation, Campbell will become Groom of the Robes, a grand title for a more ceremonial position. Ironically, the elevation will leave him with less access to the man he has served for so many years. He won't know the details of the King's life as he did of the Duke's. Still, Campbell will be honored with the CVO, and a few years later, so will Logue. Some of the loftier gentlemen at court will scoff at that: an Australian, a commoner, a man with no degree. Campbell may have to hold his tongue, but silently, he will approve. ","Summary":" (1) Harold Campbell knows how lucky he is to have his job.

This is like a draft really; tell me if you want more! This is a work of fiction I do not own any of the characters! And although they are real people, the events are fictionalized! MY FOUR BROTHERS AND MY SISTER George V instructed his children to spend time with their youngest brother, Prince John who suffers from epilepsy. The King had noticed that his son was probably curious what his older siblings were like or perhaps wondered why he never had anyone except for his brother Prince George who visited him often but never his other siblings. John had always been happy to meet any of them although his brother Albert or Bertie as he called him had difficulty speaking and that he was teased by his classmates in Naval College, Johnny was told by George that he gets angry easily 'like father'. His eldest brother David as everyone in the family called him, he was always elegant and a real 'Prince of Wales' who always 'liked the ladies' as Georgie said to him during one of his visits. Mary reminded him of their mother; she looked like their mother and always defended David because they were very close, additional information that his brother spilled to him and thought it was unfair to Bertie. Henry expressed to George that he did not want to join the Navy, but he wanted to join the Royal Army because he wanted to be in the ground fighting, not in the sea, Henry wanted to grow a beard so he would look like an Emperor like their uncle Tsar Nicolas II. And George wanted to be a pilot; he could never express his love for airplanes because their father wanted them to collect stamps like he does. When Johnny heard from Lala; his nanny that they were coming to visit him the little prince's face lighted up, he thought throughout his young life that they hated him because he was always sick and never came home to them, it made the little boy very sad. They're coming alright but he would never know that his father had set-up the whole visit, but his brothers and sister were coming! This made him very happy at last even though he liked Lala's company and riding his horses, he would finally be in their company. \"Now, now little prince we don't want you to get hurt just before they arrive now do we?\" Lala said in her motherly voice. \"Of course not Lala.\" said Johnny in reply. \"When will they arrive?\" \"On Monday, it's Saturday today so you don't have to wait longer.\" She replied fixing his hair for today's adventure. \"How long will they be staying?\" \"The telegram said for a week, just in time for your birthday.\" He smiled that sweet smile. \"A week.\" That Monday morning, David, Albert, Mary, Henry and George arrived and were greeted by the servants one of whom told Lala of their arrival. When Lala arrived she greeted them formally and went off to tell the other servants to serve lunch for their guests. \"I'll go and fetch your brother.\" She said and went outside to fetch the little prince. They made sure no one was around and David immediately began. \"Alright, let's decide where we'll be sleeping. I'm taking the largest one where Papa stays.\" He declared making Bertie roll his eyes, his younger brothers laughed. \"What is so funny?\" Mary asked without a clue. \"Nothing.\" Henry replied. \"You can decide for yourselves where you'll be staying.\" said David. \"I'll take Mama's room, the one with many cabinets.\" Mary said. \"I'll take the one with the view of the backyard.\" Henry replied. \"I'll take the one near the stairs, so in case there are any monsters…\" George said and everyone's eyes were on Bertie, who looked extremely uncomfortable. \"As always, Bertie gets the last word.\" The eldest said. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk…I don't think there would be anything coming out for a long time. Our determined brother gets to sleep in the living room.\" \"David, don't…\" the second son started, he was angry with this his jaws were clenched. \"What? B-B-Bertie?\" David asked mimicking his brother's stammer; and with the other children still looking except for George who placed a hand on his brother's arm. \"Don't Bertie…not this week.\" Prince George said. \"Not this week with Johnny, you'll break him.\" He added in his very young voice that immediately calmed his brother. \"O…kay\" he replied and just in time, Johnny arrived. Johnny looked very happy to finally have them in the same room, just his siblings, no mother, no father; just his older brothers who would tell him how much they love him, and that they would protect him no matter what happens, and his sister who would help him find a beautiful girl who would marry him someday even though he was very sick. He could imagine them telling him a story every night this week. \"Johnny!\" George ran to his brother and hugged him lightly. \"Hello John.\" The two eldest said together. \"How are you John?\" Mary asked. \"I don't feel good, some days.\" \"John let's play a game when we finish lunch.\" Henry said. \"I'd like that Henry.\" The little prince led them with Lala in tow to the dining room when one of the servants said that lunch is served. John sat at the head of the table with Nana assisting him, while on his left sat George and Henry on the other side. Mary sat next to Henry and David sat opposite Bertie who sat next to George. The feast was silent at first, but John started. \"So…David, what do you do in the Naval College?\" he asked innocently. \"Well…it's a Naval College so you study to be in the Royal Navy.\" The eldest answered. \"You and Bertie are going to be classmates?\" \"Yes.\" He replied lowly. \"Johnny, David says you are ill…are you?\" Henry asked. \"Yes, most days I don't feel so good.\" The boy replied and added. \"I wonder if it hurts.\" \"W…what hurts Johnny?\" asked Bertie who took a sip of his iced tea. \"Dying.\" \"Let's not talk of such things little brother; we are suppose to celebrate your seventh birthday come Friday.\" Mary said smiling at him warmly. \"He won't last long anyway.\" The Prince of Wales mumbled sipping his soup. \"W-w-what do…you mean…by that?\" asked Albert who looked at his brother the same way earlier. \"N-n-nothing B-B-Bertie.\" Albert stood up from his chair ready to strike, he hated that name, he hated everything about himself bad enough he was teased because of his embarrassment. \"Sardines\" There was silence, no one ate, everyone was just froze up. This was insult to injury! \"Please Bertie, not in front of Johnny.\" came George's voice pleading him. \"I'm sorry Johnny.\" He apologized to his brother and turned to David. \"Listen, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS you don't have to rub it in our faces that one day you'll be King and that you can do everything you want! I'll tell you now that one day I'll find a beautiful girl and she'll love me for me and even for my stammer. We'll have children and were going to spend time with them, and by then you can continue your kinging and parties but for now you'll have to take my tantrums personally while I still have the chance to throw them at you!\" He stormed away knocking over his chair, the others could hear the front door slam and with that, the prince left for the wide fields. \"He doesn't mean that John.\" David said, almost reassuringly. \"I think he does,\" John replied. \"Does this always happen?\" \"Yes, only because David starts it all the time.\" Mary, the only girl seemed to always be in the middle between her brothers spoke. \"It's nobody's fault that he gets angry like Papa, it's because of that stammer, and he's probably so stupid that he can't think straight!\" \"Mary how can you say that?\" Henry said to his sister. \"It was nobody's fault that he was left handed, but it's Papa's fault that he was forced to use his right!\" Henry too had a temper but more controlled. \"Well Bertie is very determined, I'm sure he will overcome his stammer.\" George said defending his brother. \"He could quit Naval College if he wanted too but he didn't.\" he added and smiled at Johnny. \"You children make such a fuss over Bertie, always Bertie this and Bertie that, it's not like he's going to be King someday! I am! I'm the Prince of Wales! I'm the Heir to the Throne! Not shy, stammering, ugly Bertie!\" and as David continued his rant his two youngest brothers whispered to each other in secrecy. \"I'd rather have an angry and determined King than a vain one.\" George said to the little prince who grinned. \"I hope he finds that beautiful lady who will love him, even for his stammer.\" said John, he said to himself 'and I want to be able to name their first child Elizabeth when the time comes.\" And he smiled that youthful smile once more. Please review… Sardines was a nickname that was given to Bertie when he was in Naval College because of his small frame. I don't know if there are that many rooms in Wood Farm.

At first his wife had been sympathetic, but her well-practiced patience was wearing thin after three days of listening to Bertie enumerate the reasons that he couldn't possibly see Lionel Logue again, which ranged from outrage at Logue's lack of respect for the monarchy to despair at Logue's failure to understand Bertie's position to shame at the names Bertie had called Lionel as he'd strode away from him. Bertie knew as well as Elizabeth that all of these were just excuses. Still, Bertie's jaw clenched up at the thought of trying to speak to Lionel, even though the thought of never speaking to Lionel again made it clench up even more painfully. \"We've been through this,\" he told Elizabeth. \"It won't improve matters if I see him.\" \"Ah. I hadn't realized you'd become so comfortable with your preparations for the coronation.\" Elizabeth's smile was as sweet as a metal splint. \"Bertie, you know that I wouldn't push you to seek out someone I thought would make your position more difficult than it already is. You and I both know that he helped you. And what's more, you liked him. Ring him up.\" \"I can't. I told him it was finished. I can't ring him up now.\" \"He didn't come to Piccadilly to see you because he wanted to keep quarreling. I'm sure he's as miserable as you are -\" \"I am not miserable!\" \"- so stop arguing with me, and let him do the job we both agree that he does very well. If you don't want to ring him up yourself, have Lascelles do it. Or I'll do it. I'm not afraid to speak to the man.\" It would be just like Elizabeth to contact Logue without consulting Bertie first, just as she'd done the first time. More distressing than the possibility of Lionel refusing to speak to him directly was the possibility that Lionel might dismiss a call on Bertie's behalf placed by someone else. Bertie couldn't bear to imagine being humiliated thus before his secretary or his wife, by someone so ordinary, by someone who knew all his flaws, by someone whose company he had once appreciated so much. \"Fine. I'll do it. But it won't help - you'll see.\" Placing the call was like a speech exercise. Residual anger - at Lionel, at Elizabeth, at Bertie's own father and brother and entire ancestral family - propelled him through the connection. I am not a thistle sifter , he thought defiantly. I am the bloody King of England. It was only when he heard the voice uttering the greeting that his courage failed him. \"Hello?\" \"Lionel?\" That was all Bertie managed to get out before he had to stop. He didn't stammer. Rather, tears choked off his throat. He was certain that if he said another word, he would weep into the mouthpiece, completing his degradation where Lionel was concerned. \"Hello? Are you still there?\" Lionel's voice came again through the earpiece, warm and concerned, as Bertie had tried for weeks alternately to conjure it in memory and to banish it forever. The relief of hearing it, and the terror that it would turn cold and angry once Lionel realized who was on the line, made Bertie's hand tremble so much that the switch hook rattled. If he couldn't speak now, then Lionel would assume the connection had been broken and put down his telephone. After that, Bertie would be too ashamed to try again, or even to let Elizabeth or Lascelles summon Lionel for him. Gritting his teeth, he forced sound between them. \"It...it's me...\" He thought he heard a sharply indrawn breath of surprise, but that might only have been an increase in the perpetual hiss on the line. \"Take your time.\" Lionel's voice floated through the earpiece, full of the encouragement Bertie had longed to hear on so many agonizing days when he couldn't find his own voice. \"I'm not going anywhere.\" That promise made Bertie's knees wobble with relief, though he didn't dare sit down to reply, just as he couldn't sit while giving a speech. \"It's me,\" he said again, hoping Lionel would believe it was the stammer rather than emotion making Bertie's voice shake. \"I need to see you, Lionel...\" Once again, speaking the name aloud brought a flood of tears to Bertie's eyes. He knew that if he clenched his jaw to hold them back, he'd lock himself into silence. As Lionel had done so many times in the past, Lionel came to his rescue. \"I'd be delighted to see you any time, Bertie. Is tomorrow too soon? I happen to have your usual hour free. You could come round to the house if that would be easier than coming to the office. I could give the route to your driver, though my son Laurie tells me that I have the worst sense of direction of anyone he's ever met...\" While Lionel went on, patching over the days of suffering with the kindness in his voice, Bertie pulled out a handkerchief to wipe his eyes and pinch his nose. He felt like an idiot, not only for the tears, but for all the times he'd convinced himself not to call Lionel when it had been the one thing he'd most wanted to do. \"I'd like to bring my wife with me,\" he said when Lionel finally paused. It was an inane thing to mention, but Bertie knew that he'd need Elizabeth's calm during the ride over. \"I would be happy to see Her Royal Highness...pardon me, it's Her Majesty now, isn't it? I trust that she is well, and your girls. I've seen the official portraits in the newspapers, they must be very proud of you...\" The pride in Lionel's voice did more to make Bertie feel like a king than any fawning he'd heard from members of his family or privy councilors. He took what felt like his first unencumbered breath since David had announced the plan to leave the throne to Bertie. Then he wiped his eyes again and allowed himself a small smile as he repeated, \"Tomorrow.\" (2) Lionel set the mouthpiece down slowly, licking his lips, which had gone dry as he'd talked and talked to try to keep Bertie on the line. He knew that Bertie hadn't been fighting a locked jaw, despite the difficulty most stammerers experienced when speaking on the telephone. That sound was very different than the gulping hesitation of someone struggling to speak through tears. For the first time since Bertie's equerry had dismissed him from Bertie's home, Lionel let himself think back to that afternoon in the park. He hadn't understood, then, what had made Bertie so upset, at least not until Bertie walked away. He had known at the time that he should have called Bertie back, ignored the insults as he would have done with a child having a tantrum, and apologized himself. It had all happened so fast; Bertie hadn't exploded like that since shortly after they had met, and no matter how angry Bertie had become during lessons, he had always come back. Lionel had let himself believe that Bertie always would. By the time Lionel had realized that he'd pushed much too hard, it was much too late to call the words back. Yet this evening, Bertie hadn't had to ring Lionel up himself. He could have asked one of his staff members to make the call, set up an appointment, insisted upon proceeding as king to commoner. Nothing Bertie could have said would have signified remorse more strongly than the fact that Bertie had been on the line himself, and had called Lionel by name rather than title. Surely Bertie must have known that Lionel would have had him back at any time. Lionel had been so sure that it must have been Bertie's pride keeping him away - certainly not fear of Lionel. But then why the tears? Merely relief at having the conversation out of the way? Or had Bertie, too, woken more than once in the night feeling inconsolable at the loss of the connection? No, Lionel was surely flattering himself. Undoubtedly Bertie was simply frustrated with his inability to control his voice, now that he had much less time for exercises. Glancing at the calendar, Lionel began to make a list of tasks he needed to complete before seeing the King and Queen. He'd have to order Laurie to take Antony to his tennis lesson and send Valentine to the library. He'd also need to buy some fine quality tea. Things could never be as they had been before Bertie had become king, but that didn't stop Lionel from feeling exultant. He had a wide smile for Myrtle as they sat down at the table to eat. \"Are you playing bridge tomorrow?\" he asked casually, since he already knew the answer. \"You know I am, with the Boyles. What are you grinning about? Don't tell me you had a call.\" \"A call?\" repeated Lionel, his face warming at the memory of the telephone conversation. How had Myrtle known? Myrtle peered at him. She had known that something was bothering Lionel for the past several weeks, but other than the one brief conversation before Lionel tried to see Bertie to apologize, they hadn't discussed Lionel's preoccupation. \"You're looking very pleased with yourself,\" she said, passing a bowl of peas. \"There must be a play.\" \"No, no Shakespeare, I'm afraid. I just had a good day in the office.\" Lionel hadn't gone for an audition since he'd started working with Bertie. He hadn't missed playing kings when he'd had a prince coming daily to his office. In the past month, he'd tried to find a theater group, but nobody was posting notices for actors. If she knew about the telephone call, Myrtle would be rejoicing that the King of England wanted to work with Lionel. He had never tried to think about Bertie as the King of England, yet he knew that he must, now. He'd learned on that miserable day in the park that some topics must never be broached, no matter how much Lionel might demand total equality in the consultation room. There were too many things he didn't understand about the way Bertie had had his duties explained to him since he was very young. It would be even more complicated now that Bertie had inherited the title he had resisted for so long. Did it matter? That Bertie was now the king had little bearing on Lionel's feelings. Lionel had longed to talk to Bertie before he'd heard that Bertie's brother planned to abdicate, when the gossip had suggested that Edward VIII would give up his lover to marry someone deemed more appropriate. If that had happened, if the previous king had produced an heir, then Bertie would have remained a duke all his life, as he'd claimed all along he wanted. No, it didn't matter. Lionel was overjoyed at the thought of seeing Bertie again, and would have been even if Bertie had never become king, nor ever would. \"I did receive a call - a telephone call,\" he told Myrtle. \"From a patient I haven't seen in several weeks. He'd suspended treatment, but he's coming back. He has some important people to impress.\" \"Perhaps he's been invited to the coronation,\" said Myrtle. \"Wouldn't it be exciting to meet the king?\" \"I suppose it would,\" agreed Lionel. Still smiling, he glanced in the direction of the chilly front hall where he'd set down the telephone. \"Perhaps one day someone will introduce us.\" ","Summary":" (1) \"Ring him up,\" Elizabeth ordered Bertie.

She remembered that fateful day when her father became king. \"Mummy, will we have rooms for the horses when we move to the new manor?\" \"Of course, darling, we'll have a palace full of rooms...!\" The newly anointed king entered the corridor, and his wife and daughters turned to face him. They all walked up to the patriarch of the family. \"Curtsy...!\" Elizabeth whispered to little sister Margaret. \"Your Majesty...\" The formal barriers were gone as a soft sniffle left the father king, and he embraced the two princesses. Their father loved the two of them very much. And he made sure they knew it very well. No matter what the struggles royal life had on them. At first, Elizabeth wondered why her father wouldn't be king after grandfather, but her mother explained the laws of succession. If Uncle David hadn't married Mrs. Simpson, and hadn't abdicated the throne... she wouldn't be where she was at today. A Queen. But it didn't start there. First her father became king, she was the crowned Princess... Then her father was becoming ill. She quickly married her childhood friend, Philip... and soon after her father died, she was crowned the new Queen of England. Soon she became a mother to Charles. Then Anne came along, then Andrew and Edward. More time passed, and she became a grandmother. Her own mother managing to live a little longer, becoming a great grandmother. She didn't know how England's values had changed. Was it through Tony Blair and his 'modern' philosophies? Or was it through Diana, that she was living proof of the 'twenty-first century' princess?

If her father was in her mother's place and still alive to this day... Would he still wrap her around in his arms like the great winged albatross he claimed himself to be?

I don't own the House of Lords either...they're half of the British government, people. And I only wish the Palace of Winchester was mine. A/N: This is really just a sad, sweet little fluff piece full of hyphens and good prose, written especially for disoriented-problem.

Also, I apologize for the excessive stammering...but that was kind of the whole point of the movie... First thing I've posted in a very long time, so reviews would be great. Enjoy! The chamber of the Palace of Winchester designated as the meeting place for the House of Lords echoed with the conversations of crusty old men. Their voices soared to the peak of the sculpted ceiling, lilting with the arrogance that so often accompanies political power. The hall was embellished with stained glass and colossal paintings and gold leafing. The Lords were garbed in flowing red robes and a deafening rustle like so many birds taking flight filled the chamber as they took their seats. The conversation dimmed, but did not die, for the man they were expecting hadn't stepped out yet. Rather, he was standing in the corridor, trying to calm his quivering hands as he patted perspiration from his forehead with a handkerchief that was already damp. The collar of his meticulously pressed suit tightened its stranglehold around his neck and he swallowed hard in a bid for freedom. Butterflies fluttered merrily around his stomach and the feathery tickle of their wings made him nauseous. Contrary to the advice he had been given, he had stood at the window and watched the robed politicians stepping from their coaches, trotting through the rain and into the building by the dozen. It had sliced what little confidence he possessed into little bits of confetti on the carpet. Now he was struggling just to breathe, to slip back into the instinctive rhythm of inhale-exhale. It was surprisingly difficult, and he felt a little lightheaded…his knees were peculiarly wobbly…was it his imagination, or had the corridor begun to sway back and forth…. \"Bertie, are you alright? You look a bit tipsy.\" The delicate hands of his wife took hold of his shoulders and steadied him, and not a moment too soon. She stepped around him and looked anxiously up into his face. \"You haven't been drinking, have you? Because you know that only makes things worse, and you can't address the House of Lords with brandy on your breath.\" Bertie smiled numbly. \"N-N-No, dear, n-n-n-no b-brandy. I w-wouldn't dare d-d-dream of it.\" The wrinkles in her brow dissolved as she smiled at him. \"Well then, it's just a case of nerves, isn't it. We can fix those in a jiffy, can't we? Just remember what Doctor Illingworth said, and picture the birds. Picture the birds in flight, and breathe in and out. Here, we'll do it together.\" He shook his head, fidgeting with the handkerchief. \"N-N-N-No, Lizzie, you kn-know that doesn't work.\" \"I'm only trying to help.\" She took the handkerchief from him and her slender fingers lingered on his. \"You can do this, Bertie. I have confidence in you.\" \"M-Misplaced confidence, per-perhaps.\" Elizabeth narrowed her big brown eyes at him. \"With an attitude like that, you'll never get anywhere. Come now, let's get this over with. You'll give yourself ulcers again if we stand here worrying much longer.\" \"B-But L-L-Lizzie….\" He hesitated, trying to decide just how much he believed in self-fulfilling prophecy before he spoke. \"What if I…what i-if I…m-make a-a f-f-fool of myself? I-I-In…in front of…of the whole House?\" She gave him a roguish smile. \"Bertie. The least you can do is try. Carpe diem , my love, and we shall see what happens.\" Elizabeth took his face in her hands and gave him a kiss. \"I shall be sitting just in the front. Speak to me, Bertie, and things will be fine.\" He still was unconvinced, but he felt the impatience of the Lords seeping into the hallway from the crack beneath the door and knew he could stall no longer—not if he wanted to present himself to an audience with a cheery disposition. Bertie took one trembling breath and tugged once more at his collar before striding to the door and giving them a soft tap. The doorman stationed on the other side pushed it open and Bertie entered the chamber, Elizabeth trailing behind. There was a great whisper of movement as the Lords rose for him out of tradition, and a great hiss as everyone informed their neighbors of what to expect from the next few minutes. Bertie felt his ears grow hot and the blood drain from his face as he caught a few snatches of the words being mumbled on the front row. \"Stammering problem, poor man….\" \"…can't get a word out to save his life….\" \"Not fit to be a king, if you ask me….\" \"…and just hope that it ends soon.\" He licked his dry lips with an even drier tongue as he stepped up to the podium and gripped the scrolled rim for support. The Lords reclaimed their seats and a terrible hush fell over the assembled congregation as all eyes fell menacingly, accusingly, sympathetically upon him. Elizabeth sat gracefully in the third chair from the end, smoothing her skirt before looking up at Bertie and flashing him a reassuring smile. It did little to comfort him, however, because he saw the way her fingers were throttling one another in her lap out of sheer anxiety. This speech would not only humiliate him once again, but her as well. Bertie was overcome with guilt and shame for his inadequacies. Not for the first time, he wondered if she regretted their marriage. These thoughts were in no way building his confidence. The hall seemed to grow and shrink all at once, and he felt the intensity of his audience's gaze like so many pins pricking his skin, and he knew that they were waiting on a man who simply was not good enough, and the thought made him tremble inside. The butterflies fluttered ever faster. He sensed the Lords' growing irritation and he willed himself to speak. His lips parted and he tried desperately to form the words that sounded so perfect in his mind. \"I…w-would…like t-t-to…ad…address you…t-t-today….\" Bertie swallowed hard, painfully aware that he had already let them down. He would not allow himself to look at Elizabeth for fear of the disappointment he would see in her face. He squeezed the podium harder, silently begging for a miracle. \"I-I would like…t-to sp-speak about…the n-n-new…agri…agricultural…b-bill.\" Sweat was saturating his brow. His mouth was bone dry and his tongue felt like rubber, sitting heavy and useless behind his teeth. Bertie tried to calm his racing heart with slow, even breaths, but he found himself gasping for air in the stifling room. The silence was horrid. It pressed in on him expectantly, waiting for him to fill it with words that utterly refused to come out, and all the while the assembly sat motionless. Staring at him without mercy, unmoved by his plight, willing to let him stand there and shake. They had no confidence in him—they never did. They had come with a low expectation, and he had failed to meet even that. He was pathetic. He was useless. He was a fool. All at once, he was overwhelmed by his sheer inadequacy. His face flushed with humiliation and he released his grip on the podium. The looping grapevines carved into the wood had imprinted themselves on his palms. He stepped slowly back from the podium, unable even to make an apology for his failure before he bolted off the platform and out of the chamber, leaving the Lords shaking their heads. The silence remained, thick with condescension, a memorial to the speech that no one had expected to hear. The man sitting beside Elizabeth on the front row leaned to whisper to his other neighbor and the beginning of his statement happened to reach her ears. \"Well, it isn't like no one expected this.\" Immediately, she rose from her chair and strode to the doors, conscious of the fact that she was holding the gaze of every member of the House. The doorman, only just recovered from Bertie's flight from the room, made a move to open the door for her. She didn't give him the chance. She left the chamber with her chin held high and her respect for Parliament severely depleted. Bertie had evidently made it farther than the hall; she suspected he had gone outside and so she followed. The skies were still dripping and the chilly wind tugged at her skirt. Elizabeth pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders and set off towards the street. She looked to her left and saw nothing; she looked to her right and could make out a misshapen figure through the fog. Her heart sank. She hurried in that direction, heels cracking on the wet pavement. He was sitting on the curb with his head in his hands and his shoulders slumped low. His hair was plastered to his skin and every last inch of him seemed to be saturated with rainwater. He was shaking, whether from cold or sobs or residual fear she didn't know. She hesitated for one moment, eyeing the grime on the sidewalk before taking a seat beside him, gingerly avoiding the miniscule river in the gutter. There was no measurable response from him and she sighed. \"Bertie? Bertie, dear?\" He answered with a mute shake of his head. \"Bertie, come now…it wasn't so bad.\" He turned his face toward her, regarding her with bloodshot eyes. Hot tears of shame melded with rain and streamed down his cheeks. \"W-Wasn't s-s-so b-bad? Elizabeth, i-it w-was awf-f-ful!\" Bertie bit his wavering lower lip. \"I-I'm…I-I'm a-a disgrace t-t-to m-my f-family…m-my f-father…what w-will he s-s-say?\" \"Bertie, the important thing is that you tried.\" \"N-No, Elizab-b-beth, th-the important thing i-i-is that I f-failed. I-I keep humil…miliating myself. I-It isn't fair t-t-to m-my father, o-o-or t-to you o-or the girls…n-no o-o-o-one wants a-a son o-or a husband or a-a father wh-who can't even sp-sp-speak!\" The pain in his voice was so great that for a moment, Elizabeth caught a glimpse of the anguish that regularly tormented his soul. Moved with compassion, she wrapped her arms around his soggy figure and hugged him close. \"Bertie…oh, Bertie, how can you be so blind? You are so loved, darling, so loved even with your imperfections. We all have them—why, it's the price of being human. You mustn't feel this way. You are in no way inferior. You are special, Bertie, more valuable than any king of any country.\" She took his face and turned him towards her. \"Our faults do not define us. You mustn't feel that they do.\" Elizabeth pressed her lips to his cheek. \"You are my husband, and I love you very much.\" He stared at her with pleading eyes, until a soft sob escaped his throat and he hung his head in despair, exclaiming, \"A-A-At least o-one of us d-does!\" As Bertie's tears joined the steady flow of water in the gutter, Elizabeth stroked his sopping hair and began to think. This could not go on—she was certain of that. Something had to be done, and it was apparent that the responsibility had fallen upon her shoulders. But what to do? Surely some solution existed, something infinitely more effective than picturing birds. She only had to find it. It may take time, it may take effort, it may take patience and the sting of disappointment. But she would find it. For the sake of her husband, her country, and herself, she would find it. In the meantime, she could only hold her trembling husband and worry about the headline in tomorrow's paper, watching the street melt in the mist. Hooray for Elizabeth! I promise that this did not start out as a women's empowerment thing...I feel like it kind of ended that way though...oh well. I hope you had fun, maybe shed a few tears but probably not, and let me know what you thought of it by hitting that cute little button at the bottom with the letters R-E-V-I-E-W on it. Much love and appreciation to all. ~ ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Bertie or Elizabeth.

This is my first 'King's Speech' Fanfic. Please tred lightly. My take on Lionel's first lesson with the Duke, later king. First Lesson When he walked into my office, I truly didn't know what to expect. Perhaps a man in arms with the regal attire. Maybe I thought Mrs. 'Johnson' was lying. But no. The Duke of York simply walked into my room, his wife seated in the lobby. I could see that he had already given up on himself. I could see the distant twinkle in his eyes, like so many who had come to see me over the years. So selfconcious. So afraid of themselves that they feel no more hope. But the boy who had greeted the royals in the hall was proof that with work, anything was possible. When he had first come to me, he had barely been able to utter a word. I knew he wished not to be there. I could tell by the way he acted. Barely speaking ( I knew he could utter the words. He just refused for some time). Shoulders stiff. Back straight. The looks he gave. I asked if he wanted tea, and he declined. In so, I made some only for myself. Still, I was there for a job, and even if it were a duke or a common man, I would allow what was most comfortably to me. My room. My rules. I would call him by a name. \"Bertie.\" I wouldn't have shaken, no matter hard he pressed. He tried to smoke, but I protested. I didn't like the thought of filling the lungs with smoke. \"My castle. My rules.\" The Duke was probably not used to the likes of me, especially since I came from Australia, but what's the difference? We're all men on this planet. He said his physicians had told him it was good. I said they were idiots. He said they were knighted. I said that made them official. I know we had started on the wrong foot. He was overly defensive of his privacy. Perhaps he thought I would sell it for something. If this was to work, he would have to be open with me and trust me. I knew that me calling the duke 'Bertie' wasn't helping. I had him try the latest thing from America, (Who thought they would be so helpful? Such am amazing piece of machinery), which resulted in him becoming all the more agitated. I knew that if he didn't think about what he was reading, and more or less focused on the words, he wouldn't stutter as much. I had him read some from Shakespeare, and cursed when he couldn't hear anything except the music. I told him that was the point, and I was to play his reciting back to him. He put the head-set back on, and spoke. I didn't allow the look of accomplishment cross my face as he recited them back. He said the words fluidly, stubling only once or twice. He ripped the head-phones away, and said he couldn't do this. Did he not know that he had said them without his usual long pauses? The self loathing was in his eyes as he refused for me to play it back to him, to show him what he had done. He was to walk out, when I begged him to take the recording, free of charge (though I still hadn't recieven my shilling for the lesson.). He took it, and stomped from the room, probably never to come again, to only break the record when he got home. I sighed, cursing slightly, my brewing tea all but forgotten. My only hope was for him to hear the recording. To hear what I could help him to accomplish without the American machinery. Like I had said, my first 'King's Speech', so a little rought.

Blocked As Bertie stood in front of the people, ready to hold his first speech to them, he felt blocked. Even paralyzed. He knew they expected him to speak to them, but the fear itself was making his words disappear and not come out. At least not how he wanted them to come out. He could hear Elizabeth's breath behind him, feeling how it was restrained and away. Waiting for him, worrying. Pausing as he stood there stuttering, not being able to get out his words. How could she stay with him? When he couldn't even address his people, their people. He felt like a failure in every way. He didn't need to turn to see her expression; he already knew it was pained. All because of him. He couldn't continue, he just couldn't, and that much he knew. As he got off the stage away from the people, her right behind him he wished he would never have to address them again. \"Bertie,\" he heard her whisper. He didn't answer her, how could he. How could he even look her in the eyes, feeling like this, like he had disappointed her. He stopped as he felt her tiny hand against her shoulder and turned to face her. His wife, his duchess, the love of his life. She looked at him with calm and very loving eyes. He looked back, his eyes shimmering with frustration. He truly hated this. She took his hands in her own whispering, \"We'll find a way to get through this.\" \"I don't see how,\" he whispered, looking away. She took her hand and guided his head so he again looked at hers, \"Please look at me.\" \"How can I when I feel I have disappointed you yet again,\" he said with a sigh. \"You never did, and we'll find a way to solve this, I promise,\" she whispered in a soft tone. He nodded, daring to believe her as she was almost always right. She smiled at him, before reaching to give him a kiss knowing that somewhere there had to be a solution to his problem, and she would find it. After all even with the stutter she loved her husband a great deal, and as he held her close she knew as always they would be alright one way or another. As he felt the woman close to him, leaning his head on top of hers, he knew she as always would find a way, as she could see what he could not. She was always the one to help him through the barriers when he got stuck or blocked. She was his light when all seemed as dark as today. With her everything was possible. And as he kissed her once more his worries seemed to drift away, if not for long, for just then, and in the end that was just what he needed to feel less like a failure.

This is my first King's Speech fanfic so I hope it's good! :-) Title: A Day In Buckingham. Summary: Following Bertie's POV from a day in the Buckingham palace, dealing with his unfriendly father, his overprotective mother and his mean brother David, and his other siblings Vicky, Henry, George, and his ill brother John, facing all this being just ten years old and with stammer on his side. Note: I tried to research their ages accurately, and all the differences I got (respectively from Bertie) got me to his siblings' age when he was ten. David would be 11 (being one year older), Victoria would be 8 (two years younger), John would be 6 (being four years younger), Henry would be 5 (being five years younger), and George would be 2 (eight years younger). It would be set in 1905. Lionel Logue placed a cup of tea on Bertie's hands. \"Do not worry, Bertie,\" he told him, mother-likely. \"It's not wrong to feel that way. Everything is rushing too much. Your brother's abdication is not doing any good to your stammer. Would you like to practice some breathing exercises?\" \"I-I'd like to t-tell you a s-story,\" Bertie said, stammering a little. Lionel looked at him cocking his head questioningly, \"It's not very proper of you to want to tell me stories. But well, start off.\" \"It-It's about me, w-when I was only ten y-years old,\" Bertie explained. Lionel nodded, encouraging him to talk, \"Go on with it.\" Bertie took a deep breath and started. Bertie's POV, telling the story I knew I wasn't an average boy, even though I didn't have many friends by that time. The only kids I knew where my siblings and government highnesses' children, who were mostly mean brats who always picked on my for my stammer. Of all the fears a ten-year-old could have, I had the most peculiar one: talking. Most children my age would fear ghosts, monsters under their beds, darkness or fire. None of these could be compared to my own fear of being ridiculed by everyone if I ever opened my mouth. I would stammer over my own words without knowing what to say or what to do, so I just ducked my head and ran away if I ever met strangers. Father didn't approve my attitude, he said I was being childish and ungentlemanly. Mother didn't approve it, either, but understood why I did so. My younger siblings wouldn't understand why I scarcely talked to them, and David would just mock me calling me 'B-B-B-Bertie'. The only person in the palace I could talk to without feeling rejected or laughed at was my younger brother John. John suffered from epilepsy, and died at age thirteen. He was one of the royal family's little secrets. Scarcely anyone knew about him. They had little John excluded in a room in the palace. They wouldn't let him go outside, and his nannies would go to feed him inside his room. Everyone in Buckingham seemed to hate little John, or disliked him to say the least. Although he was really young when I was ten years old, I enjoyed his company because he was the only person not to make me feel wrong. I guess we were just similar after all. I always felt sad when I woke up in my fluffy bed. My room was big and light, I had all the toys a child my age could wish for. But it remembered me of my brother David, who would be waiting for me in our dining room, and of my parents, who would be far too busy to take care of us. \"Come on, Bertie, it's time to meet David in the dining room,\" my nanny, Caitlyn, told me. I nodded as I jumped off my bed. She dressed me up in a white shirt and suspender pants, and took me over to the dining room, where my older brother and younger sister were waiting for me. Henry and George were too young to join us in breakfast. They had their own nannies to take care of them, same happening to John. \"Good m-morning,\" I murmured as I sat down in my chair. \"How did you sleep, B-B-Bertie?\" David chuckled as the maids placed an egg and bacon platter in front of me. I looked at him sheepishly, \"F-fine.\" Victoria looked at me with a bored expression, \"Really. You could try and talk better. I hate it when father starts yelling.\" \"Do you think I like talking this way?\" I burst out, glaring at my younger sister. I stuffed a bacon strip in my mouth and gazed down, breathing heavily. My both siblings looked at me, startled. David started eating silently, deciding it was not the moment to tease me. But my sister pointed out in a whisper, \"You didn't stammer.\" I looked up at her with watery eyes, and shook my head, \"Not when I'm angry.\" Vicky looked at me, pondering what she was going to say, but finally gazed down at her platter and started eating. After breakfast, I decided to visit John for a while. He would be in his room, as always, playing with his toys and with the only company of his fearful nanny, Lala. I knocked the door slowly. \"Come in,\" Lala's faint voice whispered. I opened the mahogany door and saw my little brother laying in his bed. He seemed really tired, but smiled joyfully when he saw me. \"Bertie!\" he cried. \"Sir, your brother is feeling really tired,\" Lala advised. \"He didn't have a good night. His seizures have been frequent and even Her Majesty the Queen had to come in the middle of the night to visit him.\" \"I w-want to t-talk w-with him,\" I explained to the nanny. \"Sir, I would highly recommend you to come later...\" she started. \"I w-want to t-talk w-with him now,\" I insisted. Lala sighed, \"Very well then, sir. But please don't bother him much.\" \"I will not,\" I assured. I took a chair from John's desk and sat by his bed, where he smiled. \"Hi, Bertie,\" my little brother greeted me, smiling. \"Hello John,\" I answered. I looked at Lala, \"Lala... c-could you go out f-for a s-second?\" \"I don't think I should, sir,\" Lala started. \"Your brother could...\" \"We will be fine,\" I assured, \"p-please, Lala.\" The nanny did a sigh, but went outside the room, leaving me and my younger brother by ourselves. \"Are you okay, Bertie?\" John asked. Truth be told, he was really smart for his age. Were it not for his epilepsy, he could have certainly become a great man. He could sense my feelings. I guess he was the only boy he'd ever met. He never saw David, Vicky, George or Henry, but I tended to visit him when I was in my lows, or simply needed someone to talk to. He never pointed out my stammer, which kind of made me feel well, like a normal boy. I knew he did feel better too when I visited. Even though he was very young, he could notice his other siblings' displeasure against him. I think that's why he was so joyous and cheerful when I went to visit him. \"Not really,\" I answered, shrugging my shoulders. \"Same than always. Creighton is ill, so I'm not receiving any lessons today. I guess it's just free day.\" \"You are lucky,\" John commented, peering through the window. \"Really lucky.\" I stood up and looked through the window, seeing the same than my little brother. He was looking at Mother, who was strolling Henry through the castle's gardens. She had Henry taking her hand, the young toddler sometimes pulling faces at his baby brother. \"Mother never took me outside,\" John said in a whisper. \"At least not as often as she does with Henry and George. I've always been here, inside these four walls. I sometimes think it's only you and Lala who care about me.\" \"D-don't say that, J-John,\" I answered. \"Y-you know everyone h-here loves y-you. E-even F-father.\" John turned to face me, \"Do you think so? Do you really think Father does love me?\" I nodded vigorously, although I didn't know what to think. Sometimes Father could be so harsh at me...I knew all he wanted was to watch me become a man, but his pressure was a lot to take. But I certainly didn't think it was the same with John. Little did I know about epilepsy by those times, but I still knew it was a serious illness. I rarely saw him coming into John's room, so rarely I couldn't even recall the last time I'd seen him there. A year ago? Maybe two? The truth was I didn't know. \"We are different to our brothers and sister,\" John sighed, sitting back on his bed. \"Don't say that, John,\" I said firmly. \"W-we are not d-diferent.\" Just a second later, Lala opened the room door and said, \"Sir, lunch is ready.\" \"Thank you, Lala,\" I said, standing up. I turned to my brother, \"Bye, John. I hope you have a good day.\" \"Bye, Bertie,\" he answered, smiling sadly. I walked to the lunch room, where David and Vicky would be waiting for me, thinking about what John had said. But the words flew away like soap bubbles in the wind. \"David, look at this!\" Henry cried, running into the sitting room. David and I were both there, reading a book Mother had given us. My brother looked up to see a new football in the hands of my grinning little brother. \"Wow, Henry!\" David cried, looking at the ball. \"Where did you get it from?\" \"One of the nannies told me she had found it in the attic,\" the toddler explained with a shrug of his shoulders. \"Let's go to the gardens and play with it!\" David suggested, bolting up from his seat. \"Yes!\" Henry cried excitingly, handing David the ball. I looked at both of them as they left the room. Just a second before he closed the door, Henry's five-year-old face peered inside and asked, \"Do you want to come too, Bertie?\" \"I don't think our little B-B-Bertie has any football skills whatsoever,\" David laughed meanly. Ignoring my older brother's comment, I smiled sheepishly at my little brother, \"I don't r-really think I w-would-\" Henry ran up to me and started pulling my arm, \"Come on Bertie, it will be fun!\" I did a sigh, but smiled, \"Okay.\" \"Yes!\" Henry cried once more as he dragged me down to the gardens. I could feel David's tense glare behind me, but I didn't really care about it. I just smiled pleasantly at Henry. Once we arrived to the gardens, David left the football in the grass and told me, \"Let's see what you can do, B-B-B-Bertie.\" I took the ball with my foot and started kicking it up to the air, hitting it with my knee and sometimes with my head, but mostly with my foot. I started running through the garden, playing with the ball happily and then tried to shot a goal between two trees. It flew in perfectly. I ran to where the ball had landed and ran back to my siblings. Henry had watched me with his jaw dropped and an idolized expression in his toddler features. David just glared at me with his brow furrowed, as whenever I did something well. \"You were so cool there, Bertie!\" Henry exclaimed cheerfully. \"Can you teach me how to do that?\" I smiled sheepishly and nodded. As my toddler brother started kicking the ball, I noted, \"T-try and k-kick it a little s-softer. I-It's easier if y-you have c-control of it.\" The afternoon went on, and I could pleasantly see how jealous was David becoming of me right then. He always saw me as a weak, stupid child, and now I had just proved him I was worth some respect, even if he didn't admit it right then. \"Hey Bertie, let's play a little match!\" Henry exclaimed. \"Will you be the goalkeeper?\" I nodded, and walked to the middle of the two trees. As my toddler brother started aiming, I looked away to John's window. I could see him staring at us sadly, tears filling his watery blue eyes. I had forgotten about him now Henry had started to idolize me as a football player. I was so distracted in my own thoughts I didn't notice the ball passing sharply by my shoulder, and flying between the two trees. \"I scored a goal!\" Henry cried happily. \"I did it!\" I smiled weakly, \"Well done, Henry.\" I looked back at John's window. He still stared at me, accusing me with his eyes. I looked at David and cried, \"D-David, I t-think we s-should get J-John in.\" My brother looked at me as if I had just turned crazy, \"The epileptic boy? No thank you!\" \"He's not the epileptic boy, you idiot!\" I cried furiously. \"He's just another of your brothers!\" David watched me in silence, and so did Henry. Maybe he had been surprised I hadn't stammered a single letter. I looked back at John's window and signaled him to come to the garden. As I saw a grin broadening in his face, he ran to the door, probably to tell Lala about it. A second later, the nanny came to the window with an angry expression. I signaled him to come, insisted. She did a sigh and took John's hand. A minute later, my brother came to the gardens, smiling. He had been through one of his seizures, so his face was quite reddened. Lala came to me and started, \"Sir, your brother's health is really precarious. He should not play, at least not these ball games.\" \"He can do it,\" I stated firmly. Then I signaled John to come. \"Who is he?\" Henry whispered to David. \"He's John, our brother,\" David answered. \"You'd rather not get too close to him. He's ill. It might be contagious.\" \"Come here, Henry,\" I told my toddler brother, against David's words. \"Do you boys want to play football?\" Henry nodded shyly, but backed away, \"David told me not to get too close to him ,\" he pointed at John with disgust. \"I don't care what David said!\" I exclaimed angrily. \"John is your brother, and if there's any brains in there, you will play with him!\" Henry gulped, but nodded as he came closer, handing me the ball. I turned to John, \"Now John, y-you have t-to know the f-football rules. Y-you have to hit the b-ball gently with y-your feet, but n-not with your hands. Understood?\" My brother nodded. \"As to get s-started, y-you could p-pace a little t-through the garden, k-kicking the ball.\" John looked at the football suspiciously, as if it were to bite him, but after a few seconds of awkward silence, he took the ball and started kicking it gently. He started walking up and down slowly, the ball between his two feet. \"G-great job, John!\" I cried, encouraging him to keep on. He smiled at me, and started walking a little faster. As he sped up, he started kicking the ball more confidently, and ultimately he could be seen running up and down the gardens, grinning. \"I'm doing it, Bertie!\" he cried. \"I'm playing!\" \"You are...\" I whispered, smiling to myself. \"Hey!\" Henry cried. \"Let's play all together!\" John came to us, handing Henry the ball. We started playing. Even David seemed to be having fun. He tried to score a goal once or twice, but I always stopped the ball. If he felt annoyed, he didn't show it at all. However, John was just the star of the day. He was a great football player, and I could notice Lala looking at us with a pleased smile. Just as I saw John go through his epilepsy and play with us, I promised myself someday I would go through my stammer too. Finished! :) Hope you liked that!

I was intrigued by something that people in the movie kept saying to Bertie, so I wrote a story about it. Special thanks to Haiza Tyri for her help.) \"It's ridiculous,\" Bertie complained. He was pacing up and down Logue's office, while the therapist himself watched placidly from an armchair. \"Every time, someone says it. Every blessed time. 'Let the microphone do the work,'\" he mimicked savagely. \"As if it had to do all the talking.\" \"It does sound rather silly,\" Logue acknowledged. Bertie dropped wearily onto the sofa and rubbed his eyes. \"Ridiculous,\" he repeated. Logue's ban on smoking was getting past bearing, he thought. Just now, he would give his right arm for a cigarette. No, make that Logue's right arm. It was his blasted ban in the first place. \"Might as well slap a t . . . torture device down in front of a man and tell him to let it do all the w . . . work,\" he went on, morosely. \"A torture device?\" Logue echoed, with raised eyebrows. \"Isn't that a bit . . . melodramatic?\" Bertie shrugged helplessly. \"What else is it? Just an instrument for spreading around my . . . my lack of a voice.\" He paused briefly as a memory struck him. \"Even my f . . . father calls it 'this devilish device.'\" \"But it's not an enemy,\" Logue said reasonably. \"Your problem, Bertie, is that you've come to see the microphone as some sort of malevolent creature. No wonder it's giving you the willies. You've got to learn to relax around it.\" He got up and went over to his recording apparatus, while Bertie regarded him warily. Retrieving the microphone that he had used to record Bertie's voice on his first visit to the office, he held it up. \"Remember when you read into this for me? You did just fine.\" \"Because you t . . . tricked me.\" \"No, I distracted you. Quite different. But the point is, the microphone has no power over you. It can't make you go to pieces; it can't make you do or be anything.\" He tapped it. \"Just an inanimate object, that's all. Now, come over here.\" He watched as Bertie approached. \"No, not like that. You look like a nervous lion tamer on the first day of work. Just walk over here and stand by the thing. That's it.\" He picked up a small volume lying on the record cabinet. Bertie saw the words A Tale of Two Cities on the faded cover. \"There's a whacking great opening sentence in here we can work on,\" Logue explained, as he opened the book to the first page. \"I'll switch this on, and you read. Let's see how far you get.\" Bertie took the book and stood holding it, watching Logue fiddle with the microphone. With that memory of his father's words lingering in his mind, he saw himself sitting in front of a similar device on the king's desk, struggling to read his father's Christmas speech on command. But it was remarkable how different this felt. The same dreaded instrument was in front of him; the difference (apart from the shabby surroundings) was the friend who now stood across from him, smiling encouragement. A feeling of calm—a feeling he never knew in his father's presence—came over Bertie. With fresh determination, he lifted the book and took a deep breath. \"Oh, and Bertie?\" Bertie stopped and looked at him. \"Don't let that microphone do any of the work. You do it.\" Bertie grinned, and began to read. ","Summary":" This Devilish Device (Disclaimer: Not my characters.

In the original scripts, it was made blatantly clear that Leon and Matilda were lovers (not that the final version didn't subtext this enough...). I simply dream of an alternate reality. Die hard Leon and Matilda canon lover? Don't agree with the context? Better turn back now. Growing Pain Chapter 1 – Eternal Sunshine Why was everything so dirty… and so loud? What is that noise? Not the explosions or gunfire. No… that thumping, that incessant thumping - was it only the harried beating of his wretched heart? It made him go hot and cold all at once. When had he ever felt so alive? Since when had life unexpectedly, surreptitiously slipped into his being? Was it because of this warm bundle at his side? It must have been, because all he knew now, was not to keep calm and cool – a lesson so deeply entrenched in his mind and body from the past twenty years- but to protect her at all costs. Protect Matilda. Save her. Save himself. He barely registered the pain through his arm when the wall broke underneath his hand – probably shattered a few bones, but it didn't matter. All that mattered was the wet bundle of mucus and tears that struggled against him. Why was she struggling? Shit, didn't she know they didn't have much time left? Her hair was dirty and her face streaked with tears. He reached out to wipe it clean, only to add to the grime already there with his dirty, calloused fingers. What? What? She wanted to – no. It's impossible. She has to live. He would make sure of it. \" I know I've put a lot of money with Tony I know I-\" \" No! No… you're just saying that to keep me from worrying. I don't want to lose you again, Léon..\" \" You're not going to lose me again, Matilda. You've given me… a taste of life. We're going to be happy-\" His voice begins to shake, as if it was taking him everything he had to believe in his own words. \"…sleep in a bed… have roots…you'll never be alone again, Matilda.\" He tried to swallow, but it only came out as small gasping breaths. \" Please… go now, baby. Go!\" She looked into his eyes, unable to speak, choking on the tears that would not stop pouring out of her wide, hopeless brown eyes. They were so childlike, in their desperation, and so, so sad. Leon found his voice hoarse, the aching within his own soul drowning out all outside noise, until he could only mouth the words. Go. Go. \" I promise you, Matilda… I promise…\" He rubbed her hands with his own large brown fingers, covered in dirt, grime and blood. She was slipping away, and for a moment, he was frightened by the sudden urge to draw her back to him, to draw her close and never let go. \" I love you, Matilda.\" It was what he had never been able to say until that day. Looking into her large hazel orbs, so hopeless and desperate, he found courage to put his feeling into words, and to let go. \" I love you too, Leon.\" What happened after was all a blur. The moment she slipped through his fingers, his life was no longer his. Shaking like a leaf, the giant of a man stood from his kneel, and without knowing why or how, he howled. It was everything that had been kept inside for so many years – under lock and key. Everything the world had never known about Leone Montana, the cleaner of Little Italy. And then, All he could remember was a loud explosion, flashes of light, lots of black clad men, and …the open door towards freedom to the outside world? He dared not believe it. It could not be this easy. There was a blue taxi on the other side of the street, waiting for him. And Matilda, she would be waiting for him, and his plant and…Norman Stansfield. Bastard. He was so close to the door, he could see it… the sunshine, taste it, freedom, so sweet and slightly tinged with the scent of summer. Instead, there was only the metallic tang of blood – slowly filling his lungs. And the smug face of that rat bastard Stansfield, with his dirty, greased blond hair, and that smirk of his. He made sure he wasn't smiling for too long, however. It was the least he could do, for Matilda. \" F..rom…Ma..til..da.\" Matilda. Ignoring the confusion in Stansfield's expression, he closed his eyes. I'll be waiting for you, my sunshine. All before the world was drowned in the most brilliant explosion of white. \"-sie!\" Streams of light poured through half closed window blinds, illuminating thousands of particles of dust slowly floating through stale air. It was the perfect environment for an afternoon nap. Warm, soft, sunshine. None of that incandescent crap. Real sunshine… \"Elsie!\" If he didn't have a legitimate excuse for this, there will be blood. \"El-whew! Have you ever heard of vacuuming?! Or air conditioning…What's with all these boxes?\" Elsie opened her eyes, and for the first few milliseconds, saw nothing but brilliant white light. Panicking slightly, she lifted her head a few inches from the table upon which she had mindlessly dozed, and looked around. Inconspicuous brown suitcases, half filled, and boxes of all the junk that had slowly accumulated in the past three years. And standing in the midst of the modest but slightly outdated office space stood a thin gangly man with sandy hair and bottle cap glasses that were at least a few centimeters thick, if not an inch. \"What do you want. I'm busy.\" She grumbled, and lay back down upon the warm tabletop. It would be a long time before she could ever sleep on it- or even see it again, for that matter. She had to make the seconds count. \"Wh-… oh no. Don't tell me…\" Elsie heard the realization in his tone, and squeezed her eyes shut again, willing peaceful daydream and slumber to resettle. \"That's right, I almost forgot - you've been assigned to scrubbers haven't you.\" Elsie groaned. Stanley – oblivious, obvious, unnecessary, redundant, standstill, sandy Stanley. She'd forgotten there was a reason they called him that. \"Well… where are you going?\" \"Mnewnorg.\" \"Huh?\" \"New York. Friday.\" There was a pause. \"Oh, that's too bad. Because, you know, the Yeminov case –well, I thought you might have wanted to know that he's here. In the quarter, actually. At this instant.\" Elsie's eyes shot open, and within a second, her head snapped up in response. Even from the distance, Stanley could see her pupils restrict under the sun – normally they were so dark it was hard to distinguish the black of the pupils from the iris, but at that moment, he realized for the first time that they were the color of red wine. That gaze - of which the meaning was completely lost upon him –left him baffled. What kind of a mutation was that? It must be some pigmentation disorder. Elsie, not having received any positive response to her silent question regarding the veracity of his claim other than a slightly slack jawed and baffled expression, arose and quickly marched to the door. Stan followed briefly, and raced to catch up with her as she sped down the unoccupied corridors. \"Just my luck,\" She grumbled, scratching her scalp in frustration. \"of course, it just had to be that only when I am about to leave, this kind of miracle happens.\" \"Wait, Elsie- wait! Did you know your eyes are the color of clotted blood under the sun? Have you ever noticed? I think it may be some sort of-\" \"Aw shit – forgot my key - What's the authorization code? Quick!\" \"Uh, 627-TJL-8390.\" Beep beep . Good. She marched through their cramped quarters tucked away neatly within the bowls of the building and through the narrow emergency only staircase. Four flights later, they broke through the heavy metallic door toward the glass windowed walkway separating the city investigation bureau to the district police headquarters which on this particular Saturday afternoon was filled with busybodies. Abruptly stopping and peering into a door to the side, she glimpsed her reflection off the pane of glass above the doorknob and jumped slightly. Her disobedient short locks which under normal conditions was at best as knotted and fluffed as a wild lion's mane, now extended in all directions seemingly in direct defiance to the laws of science and gravity. Recalling a rather embarrassing incident during her intern years, Elsie quickly shook her head, and after a moment's contemplation, licked her palm and smoothed everything back from the hairline. No use. Screw it. \"Hey how's it going – listen do you have a minute I need a report update-\" \"MOVE! People! Make room!\" \"'scuse me, commin' through…pardon me-\" Growling with impatience, Elsie weaved through the sea of bodies through the hallways, down one end and then around another corner, People were forced against walls and she swore she heard a child crying somewhere. Sweat broke out upon her neck and face, as she led their way. The crowd dimmed and slowly more space was available through the halls as they made their way down to the temporary detainment area. Two three four… two three three… two three two… two three one. Bingo. When they opened the door, they were immediately greeted by four police officers and a nosy intern nearest to the door within the cramped dark hole of a room. Other senior officers and inspectors idly occupied chairs brought in for the highlight of the day, and there was even the scent of stale coffee lingering in the air. They slowly inched toward the front, were the Chief Inspector and Superintendent stood before the black window, murmuring to the officers in charge who Elsie noticed were practically swollen with pride. They settled off to the far side of the wall with other members of their bureau and division, who offered several nods and updates. \"Good Lord, it's hot in here, eh?\" Stanley smiled awkwardly, and polished his glasses. His hair was matted upon his forehead, and the crisp blue shirt wrinkled with dirt and sweat from their frenzied excursion. \"Unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable. Ya know where they spotted him? That son of a bitch – he was on the metro at central crossing, hooking up with some sleaze bags. Caught by a patrol officer for illegal activities this early in the day. Didn't realize until later it was Isaac Yeminov.\" A portly man in his mid-forties grumbled, taking a drag of his quickly diminishing cigarette. \"Can't they turn up the air conditioning in here?\" A younger officer complained. Several cheers encouraged his remark, followed by a round of snarky comments from the police department group, who took the opportunity to debase the investigation department for their lack of physical tolerance and endurance. \"Who's conducting the briefing?\" Elsie asked, leaning against the blackened one way mirror. \"Eli Westwell. Who else.\" Aw, shit. Of all the guys it could have been, of course it had to be Eli. At that moment, a hush went around as the lights slowly brightened within the inner room. Elsie narrowed her eyes with a scowl as the people within came into bright contrast. Elsie felt a rush of excitement. There he was, criminal convict Isaac Yeminov, Serbian underground drug lord and key to the chain of investigations regarding black market smuggling within and around the city and even as far as down the east coast. His eyes were open, and albeit being only narrow slits, she could see a pair of dark brown eyes that hazily rested upon one corner of the room. Stan mumbled to himself beside her, going through the list of offenses they had stacked up for him. Her eyes soaked in his every detail, until a permanent image was imprinted upon her memory. It was only then that she saw, sitting across from him, calm, placid almost amused, detective inspector Eli Westwell. \"I was surprised he's the one doing the briefing.\" Stanley whispered beside her. \"I thought he was busy with the capital case.\" Elsie stared at the grey shirt collar sticking out of the top of his suited back. Damn it. The excitement turned into a sour feeling in the pit of her stomach. The dope deal was supposed to be hers. It should have been her sitting across from that thin yellow teethed bastard. It should have been her, perfectly at ease, within a conditioned room that smelled nothing like body heat and stale coffee. Instead, she was being sent to scrubbers. Why couldn't have that bastard Yeminov made his appearance two weeks earlier? Then maybe the extra incentive for her to stay would have kept her at her current position. Shit. Shit. Shit. Eli Westwell was keeping his cool, even as Yeminov began to clean his fingernails. He got up from his seat, and turned to pour out some water into two waxed cups. \"Stop. Wasting. Time.\" Elsie snarled, seething. The man was graceful enough to smile as he poured out the water slowly. She could have punched him, it was close enough. If only the glass wasn't there to protect his handsome little face. The briefing lasted a mere hour or so, before a break was ordered. When the suspect was safely led away by armed officers, the door to their conjoined room finally opened, and people began filing out into their respective duties, or else the common area for further discussion of the case – their first break in almost a year of fruitless research. As they made their exit, Stan was quickly caught by a fellow colleague who wanted to discuss forensic evidence. Grinning to him, Elsie quickly slipped away and began heading back toward her office and safety haven. There were a few points Westwell missed, enough perhaps to guarantee her a spot on the team and a chance to stay. \"Holden! Holden- wait – Elsie-\" There was only one person aside from the Chief Inspector who dared be so familiar as to refer to her on a first name basis – she quickened her steps hastily, eager to avoid all possible confrontation. Unfortunately, as she turned a sharp corner, a rolling cart from the forensics department blocked her only path to freedom. Left with no alternative, she groaned mentally and turned to find herself face to face with man who had without any unease in conscience, stolen her job. \"Detective Westwell, what a surprise.\" She couldn't help the sarcasm in her voice, and it seemed as if he heard it for the briefest of smiles twitched his lips. \"What's with the rush? Haven't finished packing yet or something?\" Elsie stared into his blue eyes, searching for any trace of taunting or ill will which she could use as an excuse to break his nose. They held their invisible contest for a few moments more, before she sighed, and turned away. Even though she was quite tall, he was almost six feet two, which meant excessive neck pain to glare for prolonged periods of time. It wasn't worth it. \"What do you want, Westwell.\" She grumbled, resuming her walk at a normal pace toward their collective department. He walked in sync beside her easily. \"Well, first, I want you to call me Inspector Westwell – since we are equal ranks at the moment.\" At the moment. She snorted, knowing exactly what he meant. \"Actually, I wanted to ask you about the case. You were a pivotal member of the team first assigned the case, and seeing as such a valuable resource will soon be out of reach, I thought it wise to take advantage of the little time you have to consult you on the best approach.\" Elsie stopped, and turned to seethe at him. \"The little time I have left , I won't care to waste on such useless attempts.\" She snarled, satisfied to note that he looked a little shocked. They continued to march through the corridors and walkways, this time at a faster pace. Eli ran a hand through his loose locks, rubbed the back of his head, and looked at her sideways. \"I didn't ask to take your case – you don't have to get so defensive.\" She sighed. He was sly, this one. Playing the guilt card even like this? Well so what if she felt jealous and hurt and angry? \"I'm being deployed to scrubbers, Westwell. There's a reason they call it that – I'm going to fucking scrub up some dirty orphans and volunteer my time to the little jackasses. Give them hope or something by setting a good example. What could you possibly want to gain from me?\" This time, he intercepted their pace, and stopped her. \"Just a chance to talk. I know there's more to this than what we've scratched at the surface. And you know it better than anyone. Will you help me? For the sake of the common well-being. Come on, Elsie. Have dinner with me. Tonight, I'll arrange everything.\" \"I'm busy tonight.\" \"Tomorrow then. Your flight's on Friday – you can't possibly have scheduled something the night before.\" She hesitated at this reasoning, and he smiled, knowing he'd won. \"Thank you. I'll pick you up at eight. Don't forget.\" Elsie sighed, looking about her in dismay. Her apartment, which had sustained her for the past seven long years, now looked forlorn, cold and empty. Most of her things had already been sent off in preparation for the flight next day, all except her most personal possessions which were portable enough to remain in suitcases. She looked at her wrist watch – eight ten. Waste of her time, bastard. However, just as that thought flew through her mind, the doorbells rang, loud and clear in the otherwise quiet suite. She contemplated feigning her own absence, but the persistent rings which came now more frequently demanded her attention. \"You're late.\" She grumbled half-heartedly, closing the door behind her. \"Traffic.\" They took the elevator down and out of the complex, across the street to where his car, a sleek black sedan was parked. A few minutes of silence ensued as they drove towards their destination, before she remembered that he hadn't informed her of its exact location. \"Where are we going?\" \"The Lux Grande.\" Elsie looked at his calm countenance warily, and noticed for the first time that evening that he had taken deliberate consideration to his appearance. Silk shirt, black suit, hairs smoothed back, yet purposely limp against the sides of his face. And then, she saw the toothpaste stain slightly to the left of her crotch. Decrepit grey sweater, old jacket, and sneakers. That bastard. She was sure he did it deliberately, so she would be embarrassed one last time before leaving town. Well, screw him. He was paying- at one of the most expensive restaurants in the area, at that and she would make sure to make the most of the meal at least. When they arrived within the restaurant, Elsie realized how much she had overestimated her own bravado. Scowling, she quickly sat down at stared at the menu in feigned ignorance of the obvious stares from those around them. Elegance and posh simply didn't come naturally to her. Eli raised an eyebrow. \"What's the matter, doesn't suit your taste?\" She ignored him, and ordered the most expensive item on the menu. Giving him a smug look, she was surprised that he had the grace to look so poised and unfazed even as the waiter hesitated uncertainly when the words left her mouth. Bastard. She turned away sullenly. \"Elsie? Why on earth are you ignoring me? This dinner was supposed to be conversational in nature, remember?\" She glared at him angrily, and then sighed. \"Fine. Let's just get this over with. What do you need to know?\" He paused, and then sighed as well. \"Alright, well if that's what you want. Let me see... okay first of all, why did Yeminov let himself get caught? I'm supposing he was thrown out of the circle, but even then, it makes no sense that he would just surrender like that.\" \"Most likely he was forced – you know how tightly the mafia are linked to the drug trade.\" \"Names?\" She looked at him in irritation. Did he know how long and by what measure it took her to get them? Like hell she was telling him. \"Was it the Boris group?\" She blinked. Boris group was a new addition to their list of possible connections to the case. How the hell did he know anything about them? \"I think there's still something missing in this equation.\" Eli continued unfazed, scratching his chin slightly. \"No…Boris group was only the first affiliation traced, but the story goes beyond that. Beyond Boston; wherever the drug trade goes the mafia follows. The Serbians do business like that – and then usually the Italians respond with forces. It's a win-win situation for both parties, as you know.\" \"But that would mean the origins of this came elsewhere. A third party involved.\" Eli responded. Elsie leaned forward intensely, for the moment oblivious to her envy and irritation towards the man sitting across from her. \"Listen. Whenever I try to backtrack on the system, no matter where I start – whether with Yeminov or Boris or their associates, I always end up at the same place. A void, a nameless void somewhere, who does the business transactions from one end to another, from one hand to another. He's stashed countless years' worth of goods for himself – and it seems everyone goes to him for business, but nobody know exactly where he is. Then, about nine months ago, he disappeared. Do you remember the September riots? That had to do with this, I think. It seems that when this unknown force disappeared, several parties who had collaborations underground were left hanging – without the middleman; they couldn't even see the other side. In such confusion conflicts arose – akin to the Yeminov case. People had to be discharged, somebody to take the blame and-\" Elsie suddenly stopped, looking blankly at Eli who had a smile on his face. Shit. She gave too much away. \"If I'd known you knew so much, I would have asked you out to dinner earlier. I had no idea- and just took a gamble today because, well, quite honestly, I didn't know what else to do.\" He grinned, and swallowed some wine. Too horrified and outraged at herself for such stupidity, Elsie could only splutter indignantly. \"You-took-you what ?!\" How could he-! Eli laughed at her expression, and gently swirled his cup. \"-of course, there was a personal benefit that was more or less the core of things, but really I didn't expect you to really have had insider information on the case.\" \"Wait.\" She took a deep breath. \"You said that you wanted to exploit me before I left since I was a pivotal member of the investigative team.\" \"Well, I may have exaggerated it a bit.\" Elsie groaned. Eli watched her stab at her meal sullenly. \"You really think I'm a sleazy bastard who's shallow enough to use others just to get ahead, don't you. You really always thought that…?\" She glared at him, and then resumed her vegetable mutilation. \"What, you're not? That's what you'd say of course.\" She replied sarcastically. Eli blinked, and then sighed. \"I just wanted to have dinner with you before you leave.\" He paused. \"The stuff about the case – well, it was supplementary, I guess, but really, I don't want you to think of me as a louse when you're in New York. I only said this was for business because I knew you wouldn't have accepted if it was for pleasure.\" Elsie stared at him, and then narrowed her eyes. \"So you didn't want to talk business. You didn't even think I had anything worth offering you in this matter anyway.\" She took a deep breath. \"So why the hell are we here!? So that you could clear your terrible track record in my memory before I leave? So I can broadcast your greatness and virtue in New York to my colleagues?! What's the reason? This is not your idea of a pleasurable evening.\" \"We're here because I took a chance today, for personal benefit. This is my idea of a pleasurable evening- or it ought to have been, in my mind at least.\" Eli paused, and lightly traced his thumb tip against the stem of his wineglass. \"In my mind, having dinner with you is exactly what I would call a wonderful evening spent.\" Elsie stared at the man sitting across from her, looking at his wineglass as if it were the most interesting thing he had ever seen. Eli Westwell, standing at six feet two, was a sight to be beheld. It wasn't by chance that whenever the criminal investigation department was scheduled for a press conference, he was the one chosen to represent. At thirty seven years old, he was at his prime. Broad shouldered with a slim waist that was rare to find within their department, there had once been a rumor spread more likely than not by bitter rivals that the only reason he wasn't married nor interested in pursuing a relationship was that he was gay – a rumor squashed almost immediately by his squad of female admirers. In light of these facts, it was a well-known fact that they did not get along together, were people of different species entirely. Elsie prepared to snort at his blatant lie. However, before she could Eli finally raised his eyes from the wineglass, and looked at her calmly. She flinched at his cool steel grey eyes that held hers. She had been one of those who wholeheartedly supported the 'homosexual Westwell' theory, so why was she so damn nervous? \"Ack. I wouldn't be able to hack this apart with a chainsaw. Imagine the damage it'll do to one's digestion – where are the waiters in this place? I thought this was a four star restaurant-\" \"Elsie.\" Shit. \"do you still think I'm a louse?\" She nervously looked back at him. He had reason to be confident of himself – it didn't matter what she thought anyway. \"Why the hell are you suddenly curious about what I think of you? What does it matter what I think anyway – it doesn't matter.\" She repeated firmly. He frowned at her response. \"Why do you think that?\" She sighed in frustration. \"Because – well, because you're Eli bloody Westwell our paragon of excellence, damn it! We hate each other, remember? Look – look at me and then at this background, into which you so easily amalgamate. I'm an odd piece of the puzzle. We're two different people who do not associate for pleasure. Or even business.\" Eli sighed, and ran a hand through his soft brown hair, which immediately fell back smoothly. \"See?! See?! There's a reason we don't get along-\" Elsie ran her own hand through her hair which immediately stuck in its new bizarre position. \"What?! Because my hair is smoother than yours? Oh, Elsie, you've got to be kidding me-\" \"-we're different people that should not mix for anything.\" She paused. \"This, let's call an exception. I was hoodwinked, kudos to you.\" Eli sighed, but this time there was an angry fire to his eyes that wasn't there before. \"I wish I'd gotten to this bottom to this earlier. I regret being so hesitant before. Why do you always retract back into your shell and never confront the issue as it stands before you? You know what you remind me of sometimes? A coward.\" He suddenly leaned in, and grabbed her hand. Elsie froze in horror, the knife with which she had been spearing peas randomly still within her grasp, which was now within his. \"W-what do you want, Westwell- \" Eli looked at her closely. \"I want you to stop assuming things that aren't true.\" She looked at him uncertainly. \"Like – the fact that I want to crush you so I can move forward. Or that I'm gay.\" She stiffened at the last part, and looked away guiltily. Eli raised an eyebrow, and let go of her hand \"You really did think that?\" He asked incredulously. \"A lot of people did.\" She grunted. \"Your own damn fault for never having a girl around, even though there were plenty for you to choose. You just never seemed interested – it was a logical assumption.\" \"I never had a girl around because I already had one in mind. I never seemed interested because I was already interested. It's just that she's incredibly insecure, self-defeating – overall dense, never seems to respond to me, and in fact seems to hate me with her guts. No, in fact, she's told me she hates me deeply.\" Elsie spluttered indignantly. \"Dense? Now you're calling me dense?\" Eli raised an eyebrow and smiled. \"I wasn't aware you knew who I was talking about.\" She stalled, appalled at the words that had so carelessly left her mouth. \"I'm greatly disappointed that the day you finally realize the truth is the last day I'll see you.\" \"It's better this way – you can realize your insanity sooner.\" Elsie muttered. Eli laughed. \"Promise to keep in touch, Elsie. And at least let me try to get closer to you.\" She opened her mouth to retort, but he stopped her. \"In return, I'll keep you updated on the case.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 – This Empty Soul Summer. What was so good about it? Matilda never understood why her peers and classmates counted down to the beginning of summer every year. True, the weather got better, but living within the private boarding school with nobody to go back to, no home to return to – summer vacation became her most despised period of the year. She snapped open the dusty blinds of her dormitory window, and looked out into the courtyard. The school was made in the shape of a rectangle with an open expanse of greenery in the center. On the other side, iron bared fences marked the end of the inner city school boundaries. Her bedroom window was at the corner of the third floor, and from her viewpoint she could perfectly watch for her plant – no, Leon, as she named it. She'd planted it beside the other trees and flowers that made up the courtyard garden, though a little ways off so as to avoid others from accidentally damaging it. She'd made sure it was at an angle where sunlight could penetrate its leaves all year long. Watered twice daily, it had grown roots quickly, and had already sprung up in nature's soil so that it reached her belly. Nine months ago, when she first arrived at the school, she'd been afraid it wouldn't adapt to the soil conditions. But it seemed that Leon was supposed to have roots. It adapted well, the opposite of her own condition. Even though her thirteenth birthday had passed merely two months ago, it seemed as if she could never again amalgamate into the world of adolescent school children. In all of her classes, Matilda rarely spoke – only when spoken to, and even that had to be forced. Her grades were mediocre, reflective of the amount of care and work she put in. She wanted to leave, to go back to that familiar part of New York that was now so far away – Little Italy, people called it. Back to where she and Leon had lived together, happy, satisfied. How could they understand? How could any of her classmates, teachers, psychology professionals, understand that she had experienced more in her thirteen years of existence than most people have ever encountered their whole lives? It is only normal that she could not fit in. A deep resonant bell rang through the building, signalling dinner was ready. Slowly shutting her blinds, reluctantly tearing her eyes away from Leon, Matilda turned to gather a few books she'd borrowed from the library, and made her way down to the dining hall. There weren't very many students present during the summer holidays; most had gone back to their families. Of those who stayed, she was the youngest by far. Even teachers were sparse at this time of year – only as many as it took to run the place, prepare food, and some reluctant ones who'd picked the short end of the straw. There were two new staff members though, who in order to get accustomed to the school before the September rush had moved in already. One was a health professional, a pristine young nurse who always looked immaculate – once, Matilda could have sworn she heard her vomit in the toilets, but when she came out of her stall, the same crisp white smile which Matilda had grown to hate remained on her face, and not a hair was out of place. The other was supposedly a police officer, though she didn't look anything remotely like all the other policemen or women she'd ever encountered. In many ways, she was the exact opposite of Marilyn the nurse, as Matilda decided upon calling her. Marilyn - for Marilyn Monroe. It was either that or blonde Barbie. Considering outward appearance, the policewoman could not have presented a better contrast with her large woolen jumpers and thick overcoats. She had slightly tanned skin, dark hair which she did nothing with – often, Matilda suspected, leaving it the way it happened to be in the morning. Matilda thought she looked almost tropical, perhaps even with some central Asian blood– or maybe born somewhere in the Mediterranean. Unlike Marilyn, she hardly ever smiled and looked rather grumpy for the most part. As if she would rather be a million miles away than spend her days with them. For that, Matilda decided she didn't dislike her. As she walked through the corridors, finally reaching the dining hall, other faces finally made their appearance. Middle and high school children chattered and laughed as they walked in their groups – seemingly always able to talk about something. She quietly lined up with her platter, and sat down at the end of a long bench. Mashed potatoes, peas, carrots, gravy. And a cup of milk, of course. But that, she would save until the end. \"Hey, squirt. Yeah, brown-nose.\" Matilda pretended she didn't hear the words, and quickened her pace. \"I'm talkin' to ya, you little ass-wipe.\" It was a girl, probably in the final year. They were the worst. It seemed as if she was with her friends, from the sound of their giggles. \"Hey, what's your name again? I forgot.\" Matilda looked up into a pair of narrowed brown eyes, shining with malice. She recognized the face, and those of her friends behind her. There were about five of them, two boys, and three girls. It wasn't a fight she was willing to take on. \"It's Matilda.\" \"Oh –she speaks! The freak speaks!\" Laughs went around, and Matilda lowered her eyes back to her dinner. From the corner of her eye, she saw the teachers at the head table, scattered and idly sitting around either chattering with one another or reading newspapers. It was either they didn't care, or pretended not to notice. \"Excuse me.\" Matilda got up, but a tall lanky boy stopped her. \"Hey, how's your plant, freak?\" She paused, and slowly looked up at him. He laughed, and looked to the others who encouraged him to continue. \"Yeah, we've noticed you take pretty good care of that guy, eh.\" Matilda's eyes widened. They were talking about Leon. What did they do to him!? \"What kinda plant is it? Is it very… expensive?\" A girl with unnaturally bright red hair yawned. It was fake Matilda knew, because when she did it, her hand covered a sly smile. \"Leave me alone.\" She tried to back away, but the boy put a hand on her shoulder. \"Hey, don'cha wanna be friends? What's wrong with you? We just wanted to hang out, you know… hey isn't it about time for you to go check on that guy again? Give him his water break? You even have a name for it, right? What is it, your boyfriend?\" Rage boiled in her veins as she looked at him evenly. \"If you even so much as touch it, I'll make sure you will live the rest of your life in pain.\" She said quietly. Her body was shaking with anger. \"Oooooh, she's pissed now.\" The girl from before laughed. The boy narrowed his eyes, and leaned in. \"Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad because I can't really remember what I did… why don't we go and have a look?\" Matilda's eyes widened as they began making their way out of the dining hall. She was forced to walk ahead of them, feeling their eyes follow her every move. The sun had begun to set outside, and cast an amber glow through the dining hall windows. She was sure the other students saw what was happening – even some of the teachers must have realized by now. But nobody made a move to stop them, each telling themselves and those around them that it was probably just a game, nothing more. Elsie swirled the mashed potatoes around on her plate. She'd always hated potatoes mashed; it looked like a pile of bleached baby barf. Jesse sat on her opposite side, chattering away about the nutritional value of various roots and vegetables. They were the only two new recruits, or volunteers, rather, because they sure as hell didn't get paid. She supposed it was alright for Jesse, she was an intern fresh out of nursing college and needed the experience. But she wasn't even a bloody cop – they just put her here because there wasn't anywhere else that wanted her. Sure, it was something everyone in their field of work had to do, volunteer their time to the community from time to time (more to satisfy society than true heartfelt desire to give back), and yes, she'd never so much as lifted a hand to help an old lady cross the street, but that didn't mean they had to make her satisfy all her bloody social hours at once and in such a nasty way. Who knew people further up ever kept a record on such things anyway? If she'd known ahead of time, she would have done the occasional department runs for charity and whatnot. A couple hours sure beats a year beats months in this hell hole. And everyone knew it was just that- no matter how much they tried to lift the spirit and surround it with pretty words. Community service, exchange internship, shit, shit, utter shit. Elsie wished the blonde would shut up already. Her voice was too high. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a group of kids stand up. She hated kids. Good, get the hell out of there. They laughed, and one at the front pushed something. As they turned to leave, she got a clear look at that object, and saw with some surprise that it was a small girl, maybe only thirteen years old. She'd noticed that girl before, with straight short brown hair, and dark intense eyes. She was always alone and very quiet. At that moment however, Elsie thought she saw a desperate sadness and hate in her features – she was being targeted. Blinking, Elsie sat up from her slouched posture, suddenly fully awake. She looked around at the other teachers and staff members, who carried on with their evening nonchalantly. \"Hey, those kids look like they're up to no good.\" She said to a nearby staff member who sat two chairs away from her drinking his coffee. He idly looked up, and then back at her absently. \"Oh, just kids with their activities, you know. Kids like to be kids. There's nothing we can do about that.\" Elsie stared at him incredulously. He folded his newspaper, and got up without a word. The few others that were at the table also prepared to leave. Looking back at the group, she noticed that they had already exited the hall, and were nowhere to be seen. Elsie arose, and walked in the direction they were heading. She followed them as they made their way out of the school building, and into the western courtyard. \"-what, you crying? I was feeding it the good stuff. You outta be on your knees, thanking me. Lots of nutrients in my piss, ya know.\" Matilda stared at the plant before her, of which only several stalks remained. They'd ripped out its leaves, and peed on it. Her Leon. She didn't even realize when the tears fell onto her cheeks. \"You sons of bitches.\" She gasped, voice shaking. \"I'm going to KILL YOU ALL!\" She turned around screaming, and lounged at the nearest one. It was another boy, with sandy hair and freckles that ran down his arms. She knew this because he'd caught her and instantly twisted her arm around. Yelling, she kicked back and sent a punch straight into his nose. She felt it squish under her knuckles, and heard him howl in pain. His friends ran up to tend to him, and two girls pulled her hair and arms. \"You little bitch-\" The boy held his bloody nose in his hands, and pointed to her. \"You're going to pay for this- come on, hit her!\" Matilda felt the punches come, and squeezed her eyes shut. She kicked out, and twisted like Leon had taught her. Memories of how he'd trained her to be strong flashed through her mind through the pain and she continued to fight them. \"-op! STOP!\" A different voice yelled, and slowly, the hits diminished. She felt herself fall to the ground, and curled up instinctively. The tears continued to run down her cheeks, not because of the burning sensations, but because of the knowledge of what they'd done. Elsie grabbed the two girls' arms, and pulled them away from the younger girl who felt slumped onto the ground. \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!\" She snarled at the five teenagers, who looked guiltily at one another. \"It's not our fault! She broke Brian's nose – look, he's still bleeding!\" The first girl protested. Elsie turned to her seething. \"Your friend there got no more than what he deserved. I saw what you were doing in the dining hall.\" The girl closed her mouth, and looked to her friends nervously. They knew she was the new police officer in charge. She wasn't so easily persuaded. \"Let me make this clear.\" Elsie looked at all of them. \"I don't give a shit about what the other teachers allow or don't allow, but if I ever catch any one of you doing something like this again, I'll personally make sure you'll get double of exactly what you dished out. Got it?\" The group nodded, and inched away nervously. \"Get him to the nurse, and screw off.\" The kids didn't need a clearer order, and quickly scrambled away. Elsie watched as they quickly disappeared, and then turned the girl who had painfully pulled herself up with her thin arms, until she knelt before the fallen leaves of her plant. She'd noticed this girl before, always silent and reclusive. \"Hey, you alright?\" \"Fuck off.\" A thin trickle of blood ran down her nose, and she quickly wiped it away, smearing a trail of red that mixed with the flood of tears upon her cheeks. Matilda looked up at her, and Elsie saw the bruises upon her neck and eye that already began to turn purple. But it was her eyes that stopped her from leaving, those dark brown eyes full of hate and anger, and pain. Shit. Kneeling down so they were eye level, she turned to look at the mutilated plant remains. \"What species is this?\" \"I thought I said leave me alone.\" There was a pause. \"You don't give a shit about us, and even if you did, it's not like there's anything you could do.\" Elsie sighed in frustration. \"I can do something about those bruises.\" The girl gave her a sideways glance, but remained stubbornly silent. Elsie reached out to examine the leaves of the plant, but the girl snatched out her hand, and stopped her. \"Don't touch him.\" Him? She raised an eyebrow. Strong emotional attachment to a …plant? At her age? \"Well, we can't just leave it here. Or you.\" Elsie scratched her head. \"We could move the roots and lower stalks into a pot, and hopefully it can regenerate.\" Matilda looked at the woman before her doubtfully. \"Why?\" Elsie stared at the girl incredulously. \"What do you mean why? You want to spend the night here? If I hadn't found you out, eventually someone would have. It could be very much worse. You might have had to speak with a higher up, or spend the night in the nurse office with ginger.\" \"No, I mean… why are you here?\" The detective opened her mouth, and then closed it again. That question she had no answer to. \"You don't even want to be here, doing this job. So why are you helping me?\" Elsie frowned, examining the girl more closely now. Had it been so obvious that she despised her new position? That was probably true. \"Yeah, well, there are things that you must do, even if you hate them. Duties. You'll understand when you're an adult.\" \"I understand.\" \"Well then, you ought to come with me. Uh, here.\" She jogged over to the side of the courtyard, where several spare clay pots lay, still dirty from the plants that had resided within only recently. Matilda took the pot slowly, watching Elsie's moves, and then turned to unearth what was left of her Leon. \"You need to put some dirt in first-\" Elsie dug around with her hands, until she reached the soft earth beneath the surface, and then transferred handful after handful of moist soil into the clay pot. They slowly took the plant by the stems, and dug around its roots until the whole things was unearthed, and then covered what was remaining in the jar with excess soil. Matilda brushed off some dirt on the stalk and leaves, and then struggled to lift the earthen jar. Wanting to help her, but knowing that she would refuse, Elsie only led the way toward the staff quarters parking area. To both of their relief, they met no patrolling staff members. They made their way to a small blue Chevy, and Matilda automatically got into the front seat. As she drove toward the gates, Elsie suddenly paused. \"I think you should have more questions for me.\" She only got a blank look from the child beside her. Messing her already disarrayed hair, Elsie continued. \"Like for example, where I'm taking you, whether I'm a safe person to be around. Questions like that.\" Matilda stared at her. \"You're taking me home with you for the night, aren't you?\" \"Well, yes, but-\" Elsie looked at the kid, and then back to the road. \"How'd you know I didn't live at school like the other regulars?\" \"There wasn't space. Officer Martin is still going to come back when school resumes, so you couldn't take his place. I've seen you leave after dinner.\" \"You're quite smart.\" \"That's not called being smart. It's being observant.\" Elsie sighed, and continued driving. \"You probably know that this isn't the proper way to do things. But I have a bad feeling about leaving you there tonight.\" She muttered. The other staff members didn't seem to mind the abuse and violence between children, but she wasn't so sure that her little threats earlier would be enough to pacify the gang of seniors. Since she had no place to stay at the school, it just meant the girl had to go with her. When they arrived at her apartment, several people shot questioning stares toward the duo. Smiling as best she could, Elsie quickly ushered them into the elevator, and then down toward the last room on the third floor. \"Here, put it on the counter for now.\" As she flicked open the lights, Matilda looked about her. It was a small suite, with a conjoined lounge and kitchen. Aside from the small closet to the left, there were only two doors to the right, one to the bathroom and the further to the bedroom. She placed her plant on the small square dining table, and then turned to Elsie in silence. She had ventured into the bedroom, and came out with a large white box of first aid materials. \"Come here.\" Matilda followed her into the small bathroom, where she put down the toilet seat and sat upon it as she was told. Elsie soaked a towel in warm water, before kneeling before the young girl. She pressed it against her skin softly, and slowly added pressure as she went along. \"I never got your name.\" \"Matilda.\" \"Matilda.\" Elsie mumbled absently, wiping away the grime and tears mixed with blood. \"Matilda Lando, but it doesn't matter what's at the end of it. And you're Officer Holden.\" \"You can call me that, or most people prefer Elsie. It's short for Elsephora.\" Matilda raised an eyebrow. \"Don't look at me as if I chose it.\" Matilda watched her as she worked at her bruises, ignoring the slight sting of pain she felt. She examined the woman before her, not for the first time that evening, though less surreptitiously than the previous times. She still frowned slightly, brows lightly knit together as she concentrated upon her wounds. \"You're not really a cop, are you.\" Elsie stopped, and stared into a pair of empty brown eyes. \"What?\" \"Your gun. It's not properly assembled – the framework is too lose, and you're wearing it wrong. And I'll bet anything that it's unloaded.\" Elsie gaped at the girl before her, and then slowly undid her holster and belt. \"And how is it supposed to be?\" Matilda reached out for the gun, and swiftly examined it. It was a common hand pistol, 10mm auto. Almost too easy. She crossed her legs, and took it apart, then placed it back together in its proper form. \"May I ask where you learned that?\" \"What are you really? You're not a cop.\" Elsie couldn't help but grin at the girl's fierce look as she responded with a diverting question of her own. \"I'm a detective from a special investigative unit branch of the Boston police department. Even though technically we're not part of the police force, their rules apply to us. One of them states that we have to engage in charity and volunteer work to, well, spruce up our image. I hadn't done a single hour since my first day, and unfortunately – someone kept track of these things. So I was automatically volunteered to take up this position working in a young adult community with you kids. There.\" Elsie stood up, and stretched, cracking her knees and back as she did so. \"Aw, man. It's getting late. There's a bunch of extra toothbrushes and things in that cupboard – go wash up and off to bed. I'm going to make a call so you don't get into trouble when they can't find you during roll call or morning services. The bedrooms the one next door.\" Matilda stared at the back of the woman who sauntered away stretching the muscles in her neck, messy dark locks tousled in all directions. She watched as the older woman picked up an old comforter, and sat upon the couch with phone in hand. Matilda closed the door, and crawled under the covers of the wide bed and stared at the ceiling for what seemed an eternity.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 – All Roads Lead to Rome Elsie sighed as she looked through the records Eli had mailed. They were making progress, but at such a slow pace that it seemed as if with every step forward, they were going two steps back. \"There was another phone call for you today.\" Matilda said from the small kitchen table where she had her notebooks open. Elsie hummed in response, eyes glued to the papers before her. It was a Saturday, so she'd had time to work on some stuff from Boston. Almost half a year had passed since Elsie first brought Matilda into her apartment, and since then, she'd talked the principal into letting Matilda live with her under the condition that she entitled herself a legal guardian and foster parent. It was a good excuse for the both of them, as Matilda was able to transfer out of the boarding college and into a private single gendered school, while the heartwarming story of rearing up of a foster child was able to successfully convince Elsie's department officials to move her back onto the case. It was also perfect that she remained where she was, as the New York area was one of the central areas of their investigation. \"What do you want for dinner?\" Elsie asked, chewing upon the end of a pen. \"Pizza?\" Matilda looked up from her homework, and made a face. \"Not again. How about Chinese?\" Eating out of cardboard boxes had become the norm for the two. Matilda mused over what Leon would say if he saw her living now. It was inevitable though, as neither of them knew anything when it came to the culinary arts. \"It was him again.\" Matilda pretended to be highly interested in getting the last piece of chicken meat from her wing, but watched Elsie's expression from the corner of her eye all the same. Elsie swallowed a particularly lumpy piece of broccoli, and looked at her. \"Oh, yeah?\" Matilda leaned in seriously. \"He asked me how you were coping here alone, with me, and all that. I don't think he likes me very much.\" \"Don't be ridiculous. Eli doesn't like anybody. He's a miserable snob to everyone.\" \"I think he likes you.\" \"Matilda… what did I say about this topic?\" \"Don't talk about it.\" \"Right.\" Matilda shrugged and got up to pour herself a tall glass of milk. Elsie watched her lazily with slight interest. \"Do you have OCD? Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\" \"…Not that I know of.\" The girl replied. \"Why?\" \"There isn't one day that you don't drink milk with your meal. Thrice a day. What's up with that?\" Matilda paused, and suddenly sat very still. Elsie watched her with increasing interest, and slight unease and confusion at the strained silence that now lingered between them. For almost a minute, the two sat without speaking, and just when she had begun to suspect that the girl didn't hear her properly, Matilda spoke. \"Why did you voluntarily entitle yourself as my legal guardian? You could have just faked it.\" Elsie blinked in surprise. \"Weeell… you needed help, and it happened that I could do something about it-\" \"What about all those other kids who need help? What about those alcoholics, the people who sleep on the streets – don't they need your help more?\" Elsie dropped her chopsticks with a sigh. As if she could have gotten away with this one so easily. \"You… remind me of someone. Someone…a kinda really important person to me. Initially it was only for the earlier reason, but then, you turned out to be not so bad. Save the excessive milk consumption.\" Matilda tried not to laugh at her additional comment, but smiled nonetheless. \"Oh, if you think I drink too much milk…\" She trailed off, and then stopped. Hesitating for a moment longer, before deciding that the woman before her was about the second person she had ever met in her life who truly cared for her, she began her story. As the startling tale of her young life unfolded, Elsie found her dinner quickly abandoned. She stared at the child before her – for she could only truly be called a child at her age – with growing incredulity that could have on many occasions leapt into the realm of disbelief if it weren't for her serious expression and the memory of the way she so expertly handled her gun. \"-and then, I never saw him again. Tony wouldn't let a kid work for him, and the money Leon made all those years were gone along with him. The rest, you can clearly see.\" Matilda finished. Elsie sat quietly for a few moments, processing what she had heard. \"That explains the plant and milk, huh.\" She finally said with a weak smile. \"I take back what I said. Earlier, I mean. I said that you reminded me of someone kinda important to me. What I meant was that you reminded me of a younger version of myself as a kid. I was an orphan, and assumed you were too. I'm sorry for misjudging – you are obviously much braver than I was or ever could b-.\" Elsie froze. She sat stone still for nearly a minute, during which Matilda raised her eyebrows and waved several times in the air before her eyes. The inspector saw nothing but a racing cloud within her mind's eye. This stream travelled backwards and forwards, linking piece after piece of the puzzle until finally, the whole picture emerged. Elsie blinked finally, and re-emerged from her thoughts. She grabbed Matilda's arm, and looked at her in barely contained anxiousness. \"You mentioned…your parents. How did they die?\" \"My father was involved in a drug deal, and cheating them from some. One day the DEA came – the bad ones. And they found him out. They killed everyone.\" Elsie nodded quickly. \"And the ringleader's name was Norman Stansfield?\" \"Yes, he was crazy. But he's dead now, Leon got him. For me.\" \"Nine months ago. That was the last time you ever saw or heard of either men?\" \"…yes.\" Elsie felt her pulse thump loud and clear in her ears. Norman Stansfield. It was a gift from God. The next few days were spent in restless research and phone calls. She'd immediately notified Westwell on her luck in chancing upon the missing link they'd been searching for, and within a day, was faxed all the information the Boston team could get their hands on regarding the Drug Enforcement Administration crook. The majority of them gave no insight to the case, but halfway through her browsing, she found a short article detailing the day of the incident. Unidentified bomb detonation…senior DEA agent Norman Stansfield single casualty after isolating bomb in unoccupied building space… within range... Elsie frowned. Single casualty… If Stanley had had the opportunity to watch her at that very instant, he would have noted a change in the woman's gaze that was not so very different from the one he saw all those months ago in the quiet little dusty office. He would have seen the way light queerly reflected off what should have been dull brown eyes, changing them to an intense deep mahogany. And, with this second opportunity for observation, he may have concluded that an idea, a connection, a realization must have had dawned upon the woman to have produced such an effect. His potential assumption given such circumstance was inevitably proved correct as Elsie snapped into action, quickly browsing through the rest of her pile, before placing a phone call to the New York's DEA Field Division Offices. This relayed her to a retired field officer, who kindly referred her to the Pernasso Hospital staff, who, after almost twenty minutes of hold, told her that an unnamed patient of the field division had indeed made his way into their emergency ward that day, but since they had been particularly busy all week and therefore couldn't spare the manpower to devote all energy to this man who bore what could only be called life-threatening wounds; had had him deported to the city's General Hospital. Elsie swore quietly, mentally groaning at this cat and mouse game, before taking a deep breath and dialing again. Luckily, this time, there was no wait at all. It seemed that said unnamed field officer, who'd suffered so much, so long, for the sake of his country, had waited in a comatose state for the past nine months as the state paid for his medical expenses. Nobody knew where he came from, since his uniform had been ripped apart by the paramedics the moment they found him, abandoned, unconscious, alone and miraculously still alive in the burning building; and nobody had ever stepped up to offer support as family or acquaintance. Amidst the rush of Pernasso, nobody thought to take down identification cues of the man that was pushed into the emergency ward, and then pushed out again all in the span of minutes. All they knew was that he had been with the DEA field division, and had narrowly escaped the bomb detonation by a hair's width. Elsie put down the phone, and slumped back into the decrepit living room sofa. She sat like this, thinking over the facts for hours until the lock rattled in the door, rousing her from her thoughts. Jumping up in shock by the passage of time, she stuffed her files into a pile before Matilda walked in with her backpack in hand. What fruits born of hours of laborious thinking flew away at that instant. Elsie swore in her head, turning away from the girl. It was the quickest and most direct way to question the man called Leon, but she couldn't even be sure it was him lying there comatose or not. Only Matilda would know. But what if it wasn't? What if it was some random guy at the wrong place at the wrong time? She knew it would break the girl's heart again. And what if it was? What does it matter? The man would have been in vegetative state for nearly a year now. Elsie tried to empty her head of all the possible scenarios that she's imagined for either case. \"There was a stray dog downstairs, and the creepy Fu Manchu on second floor killed it with a shovel. It's head came straight off, like some sick puppet and-\" Matilda stopped, and closed the fridge with milk carton in hand. \"Something happened.\" She said slowly, turning to look at the older woman. Elsie stood in a gray sweater, dark hair sticking out in all directions almost a flashing warning of the storm to come. She opened her mouth, and then closed it. \"Put down the milk, Matilda.\" She finally grumbled, foresight warning her of possible spillage. Matilda did as she was told, and then looked up in hesitant expectation. \"I want you to … come with me somewhere. I need you to help me.\" \"With …your work?\" A hesitation. \"Yes.\" Matilda was definitely suspicious now. \"But you never let me in on your work.\" Elsie sighed in slight vexation, and scratched her hair vigorously. \"Just… this once. It's something I can't do by myself.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 – One More Time It was when they walked into the hospital that the first inklings of fear began settling in. Matilda had felt no trepidation, only curiosity, during the four and a half hour drive, filled with nothing but the sound of the rusty radio and then lengthy periods of silence in between. Not even during their dinner at a shady diner on the side of the road did she feel a fraction of what she felt now. By the time they'd walked into the building, it was already dark outside. The hospital was enormous, and blinding lights shone from every ceiling top, illuminating already bleak whitewashed walls typical of such institutions. She subconsciously moved closer to Elsie, who after consulting the front desk had a nurse lead them through one corridor and down the other. Twice, they stopped for their host to greet cleaning staff and a nurse, and then silently continued down their way. It seemed their destination was in one of the highest floors of the building, where most of the hustle bustle of medical personnel and civilians had died down. The rooms had several or individual identifications, and looking through the open door of one such room, Matilda saw a pale man sitting near the window on a wheelchair his bed a messy array next to him. The lifeless eyes that slowly turned to gaze back scared her, and she quickened her pace. \"Here we are.\" The nurse stopped outside a door with a single ID slot, and took out her key. Matilda's heart hammered in her chest as the door slowly, agonizingly slowly, opened to a dark room lit by only one dull blue panel light above the patient's bed. Perhaps it was the uncertain silence, with which Elsie regarded her the entire afternoon, or perhaps it was precognition, but for some reason, she knew what was behind the door before it had fully opened. But fearing that she may have tricked herself, setting herself up for bitter heartbreak and disappointment, she'd let the evening roll on without bringing that iota of hope to the forefront of her consciousness. However, now as they entered the room, all her inhibitions broke. Lying with his eyes shut, IVs running as veins down his arms, and a breathing tube connected to a large machine was the lifeless, shapeless form of the man she had loved as her one and only family. Matilda felt the world shatter around her, the floor crumble, no sound but the dull thumping of blood in her ears. Her vision grew dim, and it was with a strength she didn't know she had that the girl stumbled toward the bed. Elsie sighed – whether with relief or regret even she couldn't tell. She nodded to the nurse, who quietly left the room. Matilda shook as she lifted her hand to trace the fingers, arms, cheek, nose… \"Leon…\" The girl choked, and it was all Elsie could do to hold her as she began to cry. Elsie pulled a nearby chair over, and they sat there for what seemed an eternity. Matilda couldn't keep her hands off the man who lay as if a corpse without any reaction. She whispered to him all sorts of nonsense that in any other situation Elsie would have laughed at. But the inspector could only swallow in vain at the lump that had formed at her throat at the sight. \"Elsie… I need to stay here tonight.\" Matilda finally croaked, still not tearing her eyes away from the man. \"Yeah. I know.\" There was a period of silence before Matilda spoke again. \"You said… you said that you wanted me to help with your work.\" Elsie hesitated at the direction of her question. \"If this… if Leon has to-to do with your work… then when he wakes up… promise me you won't take him away again.\" Shit. The kid had brains. Elsie watched the man wired to so many machines monitoring his vitals it was as if he were part robot. She looked him over slowly, and noticed the residual blue green shadows extending beneath his eyes. Ignoring the plethora of bandaging and cast work, she noticed the sagging of his pale flesh that pooled around any and all his joint areas. But still, she could see the distinct shadow of a once bulky man - one who had obviously lost a significant amount of weight. He must have been quite fit before the incident. She noted quite a lot of extraneous scars scattered upon his body in all areas – including several healed bullet wounds, and messy stitching that was definitely not completed by anyone remotely professional. The details of the story to this man which Matilda had told her before flashed before her mind. There was no visible response from him, not even a flicker. \"Granted you wake him up, I promise.\" For the next few months, they traveled from the apartment to the hospital every weekend to spend any time they could take away with the invalid. It was difficult to argue their case to the hospital. Without statement of familial relation they would have had no access to see him, but with such an affiliation came the impossible responsibility of proving his identification for continued government support on all related medical expenses. In the end, Elsie had to acquiesce to signing as the man's 'responsible', and only after a fantastic tale (which included raising a child on her own and hearing of the child's father only recently to travel all around the country to search for his body) and several rounds of begging did the unimpressed woman who manned the patient files agree reluctantly to use up whatever funds they had left for him before chequeing her as his 'responsible' and dependent. She agreed to leave his position and status as a governmental field officer as unidentified and probed no further on the premise that Elsie knew no more than anyone else did, and was only offering support as an act of charity toward a most unworthy 'father of an angel of a child who had suffered not knowing who or where her real daddy was'. And so they continued their weekly visits, each seemingly more hopeless then the last. But throughout the weeks, Matilda never lost heart or hope. She did everything she could to bring life into that dreary hospital room, sometimes with fresh cut flowers, sometimes an article from her favorite soft toys. She talked to the motionless man as if he had been perfectly normal, sitting there listening and talking back to her. And maybe, just maybe, even dead men can catch some of the conversation of the world above, hear a little bit of the ring of life – enough temptation to make them stir in their graves in desire to take back for themselves some of that same life. Hell was quite a lot colder than he'd expected, was the first thought that floated through Leon's consciousness. From the sliver that he managed to peek through, he saw only the blurred shape of things as they were. Cool blue walls and a strange sound of beeping. For a moment, he had the crazy idea that he'd somehow been taken up to heaven instead, and the incessant beeping the trumpet of angels heralding him, like in the storybooks. Suddenly, there was a shrill sound that shattered his thoughts. It hurt him and he found himself at once unable to breathe. At that instant several lights snapped on, blinding him. It must be the sight of God. He really had been taken to heaven. But the light burned him, and a biting and unnatural cold suddenly overcame his body. Something prodded him all over, and if it weren't for the sharp pain, he would have laughed at the odd ticklish sensation that accompanied it. \"-eon – Leon! Leon!\" His eyes didn't work, but the sudden sound of a voice calling somewhere far away – the sound of a voice calling his name stirred within him such a strong desire to awaken that he began to struggle against whatever held him down. He needed to search out and find the source of that voice, even if it killed him twice over. Elsie could barely hold the young girl as she screamed and clawed within her grasp. The room was suddenly filled with people, nurses scrambling to take readings from the many machines while doctors tore away the patient's blanket and clothing to examine him in closer detail. All in the span of seconds, chaos had broken into what had been a quiet and insignificant Saturday morning. She had been reading over some case documents when Matilda let out her first shriek at the finger that twitched upon the bed. The man's eyes had open slightly, and now as the medics bustled around him, it seemed that he caught some of the panic and began to move in all futility against them. Matilda's yells turned into cries, repeating cries of his name, begging for a miracle. Leon's head rolled automatically toward the source of the sound, and from in between fast moving bodies in aquamarine gowns, he saw a blurred shadow of a child held by a bigger shadow. Matilda… And with that thought, all at once an insurmountable strength overcame him. \"His heart rate is skyrocketing. Hit him with a sedative.\" \" Now?! He's just come out of-\" \"Reaching 185.\" \"Hit him!\" Matilda watched through thick tears as the sliver of an eye that turned to look straight at her glossed over again, and slowly disappeared. She leaned into Elsie and began to cry.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 – Lane Change When Leon woke up for the second time, he noticed that it had become darker and stiller in the room. The incessant beeping was still there, but that he recognized to be the sound of machines. He was miraculously still alive. And Matilda was waiting for him. Leon twisted his neck painfully to the same spot, but this time, no Matilda-shaped blur was there. He tried out different parts of his body, and found his members excruciatingly painful and stiff. He waited for several moments before gathering his strength to try again. This time, he managed to move a few fingers and toes, although it exhausted him to no end. So instead, he began adjusting his eyes to the world again. Slowly, Leon made out the shapes around the room, and quickly realized he was indeed in a hospital. Using all his strength, he lifted his left forearm about an inch and ignoring the pulsating headache that followed, he examined the thin pale arm covered in veins and small tubes that connected him to the life supporting machines. \"You really are incredible.\" Even through his fatigue, Leon felt his mind suddenly clear in alertness borne through the sharp instinct his job gave him. However, it was futile to do anything with his body as it was, and he knew it. He could only turn to look at the source of the voice and wait. A woman in her late twenties or perhaps early thirties frowned at him. She was tall for a woman, and had a tougher build than average, which was always a wary sign - although by one glance he knew that she possessed none of that distinctive and dangerous aura that accompanied every female assassin he'd met throughout the years. This woman had the messiest hair he ever saw, stuck out and piled upon in all directions. It put him at ease somewhat to see the inefficient and harmless grey sweater she wore, but more so, he saw within her eyes a hesitant doubtfulness that bordered on anxiety as she examined him. \"Matilda is sleeping. I promised to look after you, and wake her when you're alive again.\" She mumbled, and then pressed down the arm that he still held half-raised in the air. \"Good Lord, you're invincible, Leon Montana.\" Leon's eyes narrowed at her, and it seems that she noticed his mistrust for she pulled over a nearby chair, and backed into it with a sigh. \"If you really are the badass with a heart of gold Matilda told me you were, then you'd agree I won't wake her up. She's had no sleep for two days.\" Leon noticed the dark circles under the woman's own eyes, and his guard softened somewhat. Besides, he reckoned she could have killed him a dozen times over by now if she'd wanted. \"I guess you want to know who I am, and what the hell happened since you 'died'.\" Leon looked into her eyes steadily, and then moved his head ever so slightly up and down once. Elsie sighed, and nodded back to him. When Leon first saw Matilda, he thought he was dreaming. Even as her small body approached his, and finally grasped into his weak arms, he was afraid. His weak liquid arms refused to hold her tight, and it was only her own strength that kept them together. He dared not move a muscle, or even breathe too heavily for fear that it would rip them apart. Twice, he tried to speak, but found his throat tight and constricted – rusty from disuse. So he waited. He needn't have feared that Matilda would leave him again, or be offended at his lack of word, for the girl talked to him as naturally as if nothing had occurred once the first flood of tears subsided. She must have waited for him a long time, and gotten used to this, Leon thought. And indeed, Matilda never grew tired of talking to him. Usually mundane things, like school and the world outside. In the first few weeks, she never spoke of the year after his presumed death. She kept it simple and sweet, to give him time to recover both body and soul. Eventually, however, as his strength increased, and he began to speak – or rather croak, at least at first – urging her with questions as to how she had lived when he was absent from the picture, Matilda began to tell him the truth about everything. Leon tried to assume a nonchalant air and expression regardless of whatever she spoke, but when the weekends ended, and Elsie took Matilda back to school, Leon would sit by himself, sometimes looking out the window, sometimes doing his strengthening exercises, with his blood boiling beneath the surface, anger strumming with every beat of his heart. They would pay for their lies and manipulation, Tony and all the rest. He would make sure of it. And he will get back every penny that was owed to him – all the endless jobs in the middle of the night, and near-death scrapes; they will pay back what was not theirs to begin with. Four and a half months after, the hospital declared him ready to be released. Under the pretense of temporary memory loss pertaining to the moments before his 'incident', the hospital had continued to fund his stay for as long as they could with government support, with the continued supposition that even if he hadn't been a field officer, he would have been a bystander casualty whose compensation would have been legally settled at an even higher cost for the state. Elsie signed all the necessary papers, and, as she had promised Matilda, drove them homeward with Leon strapped in the back seats with Matilda by his side. \"The people in our building are very nice. Except for Fu Manchu on second floor, who's prone to killing stray dogs once in a while.\" Matilda chatted. Leon didn't respond, continuing to look straight ahead. The drive was long, but pleasant, especially since it had been now over a year since he'd last seen the outside. Leon couldn't remember for certain, but he'd always thought spring was the most wonderful season. But now, staring out the window at the mid-October palette of nature basking in the last of the evenings warm rays, he was taken breathless. How had he missed this beauty before? The hours seemed to fly by as Matilda fell asleep leaning beside him. When they finally arrived at the apartment, Elsie woke Matilda up and together they moved the stuff which had accumulated in the hospital room (mostly theirs to begin with, brought in bit by bit through the weeks), and then slowly guided Leon who had recovered most of the use of his body, but still required a cane to walk. Leon stood for a while as the two girls rushed to tidy the apartment and organize the boxes of stuff they'd hauled back, feeling out of place, and suddenly unsure of himself. The apartment was quite similar to many of those he'd stayed in before – a common flat whose extended doorway led to a living room adjoined to a small kitchen beyond which was the main bedroom and bathroom, and a much smaller room that could serve as a secondary guest room or a storage space. From a glance, he knew immediately that the smaller room had been colonized by Matilda as several plush rabbits and a rather off-beat patchwork tapestry hung above the headrest. \"I think you'll like this pillow, Leon.\" Matilda said, her arms stacked full of bed-sheets and two pillows, the top one of which was pink and had a distinctive pig snout stuck out on one end. It was then that Leon noticed the living room (which apart from two bookcases and a small TV in between them) had suddenly been transformed to a bedroom of sorts. Leon watched as Elsie continued to tug at the sofa which extended into a full futon-bed, then attempted to make it as comfortable as possible with the things Matilda had brought over. The coffee table had been set off to the right side, and a small table with a lamp sat on the left so that it really did feel like a rather large bedroom. \"Okay.\" Elsie panted, wiping at the sweat at her brow. She then noticed Matilda swaying slightly to the side, hardly able to stifle her yawns any longer. \"Matilda, bed. You, come here.\" Leon looked around him for a second, and then blinked at her. \"Me?\" \"I understand that people who wake up from comas are somewhat rebooted in their mind; that is they're as conscious as all the rest of us, only the body's a little rusty. You, however, seem to have the opposite problem.\" Elsie said, raising an eyebrow. She sighed when he didn't respond to her observation, a blank look plastered to his face. \"Yes, I was talking about you, big guy. See if this is comfortable.\" Leon limped over slowly, and hesitantly sat on the futon. It was strangely firm, and of good quality. He wondered whether she'd purchased this solely for his sake. Seeing him settled, Matilda leaned over and kissed his cheek with a tight embrace, then finally retired with a yawn. \"Goodnight, Leon.\" \"Goodnight.\" Leon watched her until the door clicked before turning around, to find the older woman staring at him incredulously. Suddenly feeling self-conscious, he ducked his head. \"It's very good. Thank you.\" Elsie stretched heartily. \"If there's anything you need, tell me. Oh and, Matilda's told me all about your habit of sleeping sitting with one eye open. You're not allowed to do that here – in case anyone wakes up in the middle of the night.\" Leon hesitated, afraid to meet her in the eye. He nodded. \"Okay.\"[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 – Giant Slayer Elsie would not have believed it if it weren't for the evidence of her own eyes. Matilda hadn't lied or exaggerated any part of her incredible story of the cleaner of Little Italy – Leon Montana. The man who had spent nine months in a critical comatose state had recovered at an impossible, near inhuman speed without any difficulty at all and within six months, he was good enough to get back in the cleaning business. Normally, it would have taken the average human an amount of time at least on par with the amount of time spent in critical condition to regain at the very best - normalcy. She expected that perhaps, because of his excellent physical condition beforehand, he might have not only regained normalcy but a full recovery by nine months' time, but it surpassed all expectation to see such an improvement occur in a mere six month period. She should have known he must have pushed himself to breaking point in order to regain his body strength in two thirds normal time; she should have known his stony silence (even for a normally quiet man) indicated a brewing storm, the shadow of things of come. She should have seen something coming. But whenever she did notice him, Elsie only observed the giant of a man relentlessly pushing his body with his daily exercise, until his muscles rippled dangerously across his back whenever he went to get his milk – a frightening but also strangely fascinating sight. She only saw the silent way in which he chopped carrots and other assortments of vegetables and cooked up the most delicious meals she'd ever tasted – claiming they were 'healthier' than the meals they'd been eating. She only enjoyed the presence of a care taker/cook/bodyguard/extra pair of hands and didn't give him any more thought or credit above that. As if the man did not have a brain, and a heart – and a soul. So when she got a call one afternoon during a meeting with the Boston Police department concerning hologram replication technique from a flustered and scared Matilda, she knew in her gut that he had pulled something insane – and it was her fault for not seeing it coming. Elsie and Matilda waited together that evening in silence, as the time ticked slowly by. It wasn't until near midnight that a soft knock sounded at the door. Both rushed to get to the door, and opened it in a hurry to reveal the giant of a man in a pair of ridiculous shades useless in this time of night (not to mention this time of year), a large trench coat, and two bulky duffel bags. \"Leon! Where have you been?!\" Matilda cried, pulling him inside. \"Elsie and I stayed up the entire night to wait for you – you didn't even leave a note, and I thought – I thought-\" She began to blubber, and cried into his arms. Leon dropped his bags almost as if by instinct, and Elsie noticed that they made a rather dull and heavy sounding thud on the floor. \"Matilda, I'm sorry. I went to get rid of Tony and –\" She suddenly pulled away from him, eyes large and glassy. \"You… killed Tony?!\" The hitman nodded. \"He paid for everything he did to us. Him and all his friends. I made sure he paid.\" Matilda slowly shook her head, and then turned to look at Elsie. Leon followed the girl's frightened gaze and saw the woman who had opened the door for him earlier- the woman who saved his life, stand frozen with horror at their conversation. He knew what ran through her head- he'd gone over every possible scenario in those quiet mornings when he was all alone in the apartment, doing his exercises over and over and over again in preparation. She was a police investigator, on the side of the law. Elsie's mind screamed at her to apprehend the man before her, but the more overwhelming emotion that ran rampant through her mind was to beat the crap out of him for endangering their – her and Matilda's – lives in such a manner. Matilda looked at her in desperation. \"Elsie… he's just… he was a thug. Didn't even have legal permit to work here – not even a real ID, remember? He didn't even exist to the government. He was a horrible man, you have to understand – he- I told you he- his death probably saved the lives of a lot of people.\" The girl pleaded quietly. \"Yeah, I… remember what you told me, Matilda. Don't worry, it's not my case, and has nothing to do with us. Go to bed, it's… it's too late.\" Elsie shook herself with a grin, though she knew it didn't fool the observant girl one bit. Still, Matilda obeyed; knowing that sooner or later there had to be a talk between the two. She grew up understanding that sometimes, adults had to be left to themselves. Although she feared no consequence or punishment with Leon or Elsie, the intuition regarding when to make her leave before things got ugly had been an instinct ingrained into her as a child. She acted upon it instantaneously, and after kissing Leon's cheek as she always did (albeit much lighter and faster this time), Matilda rushed off to her private space. After the resounding click of Matilda's door that strangely echoed through the silence of the night, it was several moments before either of them spoke. Finally, Leon rose to his feet, and reached for one of the bags. He didn't need to say anything for her to know what was inside. \"I'm sorry for all the trouble we have caused. If it is not enough, I will-\" \"What. The. FUCK . Are you talking about!?\" Elsie snarled, and tossed his money onto the futon. Leon took a step back when she advanced, and then stopped firmly. \"I'm taking Matilda with me. We will not bother you any longer. Thank you for all this time, but I-\" \" What ?! WHAT ?! You're – you want to – to leave?! Just like that?!\" Elsie struggled to keep her voice below shouting, but the anger that boiled in her veins threatened to explode. \"And go where?! Have you ever thought of what Matilda might think?!\" Leon looked away for a moment. Suddenly pissed off at the ridiculous and stupid shades he was still wearing, Elsie snatched them from his face and threw them on the futon as well. \" Look at me when I'm talking to you, damn it! \" She snarled, but then suddenly regretted her action for when the man turned to look at him, all she saw were large hazel eyes, filled with sadness and guilt. Elsie opened her mouth and then closed it again. She had forgot – though he had the body of a man able to instil terror into the bravest, his mind was as simple as that of a child. She ruffled her dark hair furiously with both hands, a fallback habit, Leon noticed, for whenever she was most upset. \"Damn it! Shit. Shit. Shit!\" Elsie turned away and then back to face him, dark eyes hard as flint and dangerous. \"Matilda is my legal responsibility. Technically speaking, I have more right to her in this world than you do. Also, when I signed those papers in the hospital, you became my legal responsibility too. And, I warned you before – you promised to help me with my work first, and you gotta live up to that end of the bargain. Names, organizations, everything I need.\" She took a deep breath. \"So if you really hate this place so much – if you really hate me so much, fine. You can go through the legal procedures and what-not and take her with you. I thought you needed to heal up completely before I'd grill you – but we can do it now if you want to. Sit down, and let's get this over with.\" Leon stared at the woman before him, dressed in a casual grey sweater and loose pants, obviously intending to have waited the entire night up with Matilda. He suddenly felt his blood pressure rise in panic, at a loss for words as she stared at him. \"I..I don't..\" He had never been good at this kind of thing, speaking emotions. He didn't have a way with words like some people did, even back home in his native tongue. It was why he hardly spoke at all. \"…It's not what you… think.\" That didn't seem to do the trick however, as a fierce expression overcame her. \"Then why don't you say it?! Goddamn it! Why won't you resolve things like normal people do?! I said SIT DOWN!\" She snatched the front of his jacket and pushed him hard. Leon gasped with a sudden violent cough, and stumbled backwards until he fell on the edge of the futon. Elsie started in horror at his reaction, hand still outstretched before her. At first instinct, she thought she'd really pushed him too hard. She had taken the necessary defense training courses before qualifying as a member of the police force – even if it had been years since her last real workout and her real job had almost zero physical demand. But then reason overcame irrational instinct, and the fact that a six foot four hulk who'd spent his entire life developing his physical prowess had crumbled from her pathetic shove. She stared at him as he clutched at the place where she'd pushed him, and it was only then that she noticed how pale his skin was, almost glistening with sheen of sweat. His breathing was shallow, as if it hurt him to exert too much energy. As realization dawned upon her, Elsie felt her heart sink in her chest. Oh God. Of course. He was wounded – that must have been why he had kept the heavy coat tightly buttoned up, and that pair of shades… Matilda would have been more observant and noticed his obvious discomfort. That cough didn't sound good. \"Take off your clothes.\" Elsie said quietly after sucking in a breath of her own. Leon looked up at her in overt surprise and some disbelief. What? His eyes seemed to ask. Elsie hesitated, glancing at Matilda's closed door. \"No, you're right – come here.\" This time she gently tugged at his elbow until, bewildered, he followed after her as she led them into her room. He'd rarely seen the inside of what he considered to be her private quarters, and the mess of clothing and random scrunched up balls of papers scattered across the floor proved to be a startling contrast with the pristine living room (pristine due to his vigilance). Rushing out into the washroom, Elsie returned and closed the door behind her. Leon saw a large white box in her hands atop of several washcloths, a plastic bucket and a kettle of water, and watched as she placed it near the lamp by the side of her bed. \"Sit.\" She muttered flatly, and he obeyed, sitting gingerly upon the edge of her bed. After closing the curtains on the window, she walked over to his side. \"You can take off your clothes now. This way, if Matilda wakes up, at least she won't have to see what you did to yourself.\" Leon stared at her as if there was a disconnection between them, and he couldn't fully comprehend her words to him. Elsie waited patiently. Leon toyed with a button on his coat in hesitation, glancing warily about him. After much fidgeting (and an impatient growl from the woman), he finally acquiesced and cautiously unbuttoned his coat. Elsie tried to keep a stoic face when she saw the bloodied shirt, whose white color seemed non-existent now that a heavy coat of brilliant crimson stained through it completely. Leon fumbled with this inner layer, which seemed to stick to his body like a second skin. When he finally removed it with some help, Elsie couldn't help a sharp intake of breath at the sight he beheld. The man had somehow stitched up what seemed to be a short but deep knife gash across his chest, and a rough uneven wound that resembled a dangerously close bullet graze. Obviously, both were aimed at his heart, and luckily, both missed by mere inches. A sudden feeling of guilt passed over her as she realized that her unfortunate shove had exacerbated the problem, and with this gnawing feeling of irritation, she wet a nearby towel and tried to clean the areas around the wounds. Leon jumped and snatched at the wet cloth when she approached him, with a quick \"I can do it\", but as soon as he turned to clean himself off, she came back with another towel and swiped at a different area. From the harsh scowl she wore, he didn't dare try to push her away this time. But all the same, an immense sense of embarrassment and shame overcame him. \"Stop flinching.\" It had been almost two hours since he'd done the job, and most of the bleeding had stopped thanks to his handiwork. But still, he couldn't help but notice that the shallow bucket of lukewarm water had turned a sickening red when she finally finished with him. \"You did a good job with this.\" Elsie muttered, glancing at his wounds. The stitches were tight and covered only what was necessary to encourage healing. Even if it was obviously done with a darning needle and string. \"It is a necessary skill to learn in my trade.\" Leon replied. Elsie didn't comment about the myriad of other scars that marred his otherwise fine physique. He was thankful for that-the fact that she didn't take any closer looks, or pry into the silver lines that criss-crossed each other, forever etched into his skin as a memoire of past expeditions. \"This will sting – but it'll be over in a second. Not alcohol.\" was all she said as she rubbed a dark yellow iodine solution over the open wounds. Leon felt the cool sensation tickle at his sore skin, and embraced the feel of clean gauze and bandages that were wrapped around him over and over again until it felt as if a heavy blanket covered him in all the places that hurt. \"There.\" Satisfied, Elsie rose to her feet, knees cracking from having kneeled for too long. She handed him a bottle containing two small red pills and a larger yellow pill. \"These are painkillers and a weak antibiotic. You should take them. If you trust me enough.\" Leon ran his fingers over the bandages that crossed his chest and over one shoulder, and then rose to his feet. \"Thank you.\" He said quietly, and took the plastic bottle from her hand. Elsie sighed wearily, and Leon suddenly noticed the dark circles beneath her eyes. A tremendous sense of guilt washed over him. \"Please… don't do something reckless like this again. Matilda lost you once – and it almost killed her. I can't bear to see that again, so take better care of yourself, alright? You should rest now - we can settle all the legal business tomorrow if you like.\" He nodded numbly, and then slowly walked toward the living room, where he'd made his stay. He heard her clean the towels and bucket immediately, and stuff his bloodied wasted shirt into the trashcan – so as to not leave any trace of trouble behind. Hours after he heard her finally retire to bed, Leon lay wide awake, fingers grazing the bandages that adorned him. ","Summary":" Author's Note: This story is non-canonical.

It's been seven years since Rachel has seen Frank, seven years since she signed her record deal, and seven and a half years since she gave birth to her son. To people, he is Fletcher Marron. Fletcher was a secret that she made sure didn't get out, for his sake. He was able to go to a public school, have friends that didn't use him to get to her, she even rented a little apartment so he could have sleepovers but Tony had to be there. Until Fletcher was three, the only people that knew about him was Tony, Mia, Andre, Nikki, Clive Davis, her agent Sy and her manager Bill. But when Fletcher was three, he came down with pneumonia and Rachel took him to the hospital. He stayed there for a week and during that week, while in the cafeteria, Rachel ran into Herb. Flashback Rachel hadn't eaten in a day. Her worry about Fletcher had made her lose her appetite. It wasn't until she stood up from the hospital chair and she felt herself get light-headed that she realized that she needed to eat. When Fletcher took his nap, she decided to make a quick stop to the hospital cafeteria. She bought herself a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a can of Pepsi and sat down. She had her sunglasses and baseball cap on so nobody recognized her. Looking around at all the people made her feel normal again, that she was a regular person in people's eyes, not diva superstar Rachel Marron. She looked at the man to the left of her and heard a soft sniffle coming from him. He looked up and to Rachel's surprise she recognized him as Herb Farmer. A man she hadn't talked to in 3 years. She thought about staying to herself and not approaching him but she couldn't help it, he looked so sad. She threw her bowl away and sat in the chair across from him. \" Hello Herb,\" she greeted him. He looked at her confused. \" Do I know you?\" he asked wiping his tears. Rachel took off her glasses and smiled at him. He looked at her surprised and said, \"Rachel? Rachel Marron?\" \" Yeah, it's me. How've you been?\" she asked. \" I don't think anybody has been doing better than you sweetheart, you are a superstar,\" he said. \" It's not always glitz and glamour but I like it. How's Katherine?\" she asked. Herb's smile fell at the mention of his wife and Rachel could sense something was wrong. \" Herb?\" Herb sighed and said, \"Katherine has ovarian cancer.\" Rachel couldn't believe what she was hearing. Katherine had cancer. \" Herb, I'm so sorry. Where is she? Is she here?\" \" She's upstairs. We are just waiting for her to be discharged. She's going to have to come back next week for chemotherapy,\" he said. Rachel stood up and held out her hand. \"Come on. I want to go say hi to her before you guys leave.\" Herb smiled at her and took her hand leading her to Katherine's room. They arrived just in time when the doctor had just discharged Katherine. \" Herb, where have you been and where's my chocolate muffin?\" Katherine asked when she saw her husband. \" They ran out of muffins but I found something better,\" he said. Rachel walked in and said, \"Hi Katy.\" \" Oh my God Rachel, honey,\" Katherine walked up to Rachel and gave her a warm, motherly hug. \" I'm so sorry to hear about your condition. Katy,\" Rachel said, hugging her back. They pulled away both kind of teary eyed. \" Don't worry about me, I'm a fighter, this is just a minor setback,\" she held Rachel's face in her hands, \"Look how beautiful you are. Hollywood has been kind to you.\" \" I guess you can say that. Look, if you guys need anything, I'm there. I can find a doctor that specializes in this type of stuff. I know people,\" Rachel said. \" It's okay Rachel, you don't owe us anything,\" Herb said, \"It was nice seeing you but we have to get Katherine some rest.\" Katherine hugged Rachel one more time and said, \"Come by the house sometime, it gets lonely.\" The couple walked out of the hospital room holding hands. 'I don't know why I'm doing this,' Rachel thought. She walked after them and said, \"I owe you guys an explanation.\" Herb and Katherine stopped and looked at her. \" Rachel, we don't hold a grudge. You were young, you didn't know what love was,\" Katherine said. \" You're wrong. I did know what love was. I did what I did because I loved him, just let me show you,\" Rachel said. Herb and Katherine looked at each other confused and back at Rachel. \"Show us what?\" Herb asked. \" Just follow me, and please keep an open-mind. I only did it to protect him,\" she said, \"This way.\" She leads them to the third floor of the hospital to the pediatrics wing. They stop in front of a door. \" Remember, I did this for him,\" Rachel said and opened the door. Herb and Katherine walked in and saw a little boy sleeping in the hospital bed. Katherine got a closer look at him before realizing who she was looking at. She covered her mouth as the shock hit her like a huge wave. She looked at Rachel and then at Herb and back at the boy. She stepped closer to his bedside and began stroking his head softly. Herb looked at Rachel puzzled as he had not caught on yet. \" Rachel, what's going on? Who is this?\" he asked. Katherine laughed at her husband, \"Herb, this is our grandson.\" Understanding it all, Herb's heart started to beat faster than it ever did. \" You were pregnant?\" he asked Rachel. Rachel nodded. \" And you didn't tell him?\" Rachel nodded in shame once again. \" I couldn't tell him. I didn't want to ruin his life with this. If I had told him he would have quit school and tried to take care of me and him. I loved him too much,\" Rachel explained, \"I wouldn't have told you guys either but hearing about Katherine made me think,\" she looked at Katherine who was still stroking the boy's hair, \"You deserved to meet your grandson.\" Herb ran his hands through his head. That little boy in that bed was his grandson. He then remembered where they were. \" What's his name? And why is he in the hospital?\" he asked. \" He has pneumonia. The doctor says that he should be fine in a few days. And everyone calls him Fletcher, after my dad,\" she said. Herb nodded in relief and understanding. Rachel looked at her sleeping toddler and smiled. \"But the name on his birth certificate is Frank Farmer Jr.\" Both Herb and Katy looked at her shocked. He really was Little Frank. Present Day From then on, Rachel didn't keep Fletcher from Herb and Katherine. He started spending days over their house and they attended his birthday parties. Rachel had begged them not to tell Frank and they agreed; it wasn't their secret to tell. As Fletcher grew up, Rachel didn't keep anything from Fletcher. When he was six years old, he finally got the courage to ask his mom why his father wasn't with them. Rachel had been waiting for that day ever since he was born and she knew exactly what she was going to tell him. She sat him down and explained her and Frank's entire relationship and why she didn't tell Frank that he was going to be a father. Being so young, Fletcher was still confused. Flashback \" What if he comes back and doesn't like me?\" he asked. This made Rachel feel like crying. \"Honey, if he comes back he is going to love you no matter what. Now he might not like Mommy anymore but I know he will love you.\" \" How do you know that?\" Fletcher asked. \" Because, that's just the type of guy he is, baby. You are his son, Franklin Herbert Farmer Jr. He will adore you just as much as I do, I promise.\" Present Day Now Fletcher is seven, about to turn eight in a few weeks and he is starting to look like a chocolate version of Frank, making Rachel miss Frank even more. She tried to date but never found anybody she felt a connection to. After a while, she gave up on finding love and just focused on her son and her career. While Rachel was still pregnant, she began recording her debut album. On nights that she couldn't sleep because the baby was kicking her, she was writing songs and listening to instrumentals. Sometimes she wouldn't leave the studio until 3 in the morning. Though the work was exhausting, she never felt happier. When her album released, it was an instant hit. Her face was everywhere and simple things like going to the grocery store became complicated when people would corner her in the dairy aisle. Fletcher wasn't even a month old when she had to start prepping for her tour. She worked out for hours to lose her baby fat and had to go on a special diet. She dreaded leaving Fletcher for her first tour but this was her job and she promised herself to spend as much time as she could with him when she was home. As money started coming in, Rachel bought her first house at only 19 for her and Fletcher and Andre. It was a modest starter home that she thought was the cutest place ever. Eventually her agent Sy convinced her to move to a mansion someplace in Beverly Hills even though she didn't want to but she knew her home was getting cramped with all the people going in and out so she needed a bigger space. Everything was going right in her life. Fletcher wasn't a baby anymore, her fame status was growing and growing and she was surrounded by positive people to keep the fame from going to her head. She was living the life she was supposed to live. She was truly happy about how things turned out. That is until she received a call. Rachel was sitting in Fletcher's room playing Monopoly with him. She wrapped up her second world tour and hadn't seen him in a month so she was trying to make up for lost time. \"Mom, stop cheating, I saw the extra $100 you took,\" Fletcher complained. \"I'm not cheating, I swear. Focus on your own money,\" Rachel laughed. Fletcher mumbled something under his breath. That's when her maid interrupted. \"Ms. Marron, Herb Farmer has called for you.\" ' He probably wants to see Fletcher this weekend,\" Rachel thought. She got up from the floor and took the call in her room next door to Fletcher's. \"Hey, Herb, you want to see Fletcher this weekend?\" she asked. \"Rachel,\" he whispered. Rachel immediately knew something was wrong. \"Herb? Are you okay?\" Rachel asked. He sighed. \"Rachel, Katherine's doctor just called with some test results. The cancer has spread. They said that the chemotherapy isn't working. She's dying, Rachel.\" Rachel sank into her bed. \"Herb, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? I have people that can find a better treatment or something. She can beat this, I know she can.\" \"Rachel, I don't want you to do anything. We fought and lost. All Katy wants to do is relax. She's tired of the needles and tired of the doctors. She wants to die in peace.\" Rachel could feel herself crying. Katherine was like a surrogate mother to Rachel and Fletcher's grandmother. \"I'll bring Fletcher over tomorrow so she can see him,\" Rachel said, trying to hide the sadness in her voice. \"Yeah, please? This might be the last time she sees Junior,\" Herb said. \"Fletcher can go over whenever you guys want him, she'll see him again.\" Herb sighed. \"Rachel, Frank's coming home the day after tomorrow.\" Did you like it? Yeah? Tell me in the review section, please? I have a few chapters ready to go so if this does well I will post soon. Smooches! -Tiff[Chapter 2] Hey love, just wanted to stop by, maybe update my favorite couple. Hope you guys enjoy it. Simple Life For the past seven years, Frank had lived a simple life. He graduated high school early and did receive a full football scholarship for University of Virginia. Belle refused to let him go. She wanted him to stay with her and get a job as a police officer in her small town. He fought with her for months about it. She threw away all of his college brochures and didn't give him any messages the recruiter would leave for him. Fortunately, while she went to bridge club and he was home alone the recruiter called and told him that he had left over five messages for him. Frank was livid. He had planned to call his grandmother out on it but thought of a better plan. After he graduated high school, he started slowly packing up his belongings over the course of a month. He packed the stuff he knew he would need and left unimportant things behind. He explained to the recruiter that he would have to have a place to stay as he wanted to leave in the beginning of the summer. After pulling a few strings, the recruiter arranged for Frank to live in a temporary dorm free of charge. Finally, after all the preparations were finished, while Belle took her afternoon nap, Frank snuck out leaving her only a note telling her that he was fine and that he couldn't live with her anymore. It took him a good three and a half hours for him to reach the university but when he got there it was like he could breathe again. It wasn't that many people there except for some students in summer school so Frank didn't make a lot of friends. He spent most of his time conditioning for football season since he had been out of shape for a year. When football season started he was the quietest one on the team. They all treated him like a brother anyways. Frank only focused on the game and his studies. He didn't go home during the summer instead he worked. His parents would come over holidays but most of the time they would talk on the phone. The holiday visits ended when Katherine had gotten sick and she wasn't fit to fly anymore. He always made plans to go back to LA after his college graduation but something always got in the way and he could never make it. Eventually, he graduated with a degree in Sports Medicine. There weren't many jobs that he could get besides the gym and most weren't hiring. He had to live off his savings and refused to take any money from his parents. By this time, Frank had met a girl. Her name was Francine and he met her at a diner where she worked. He thought she was pretty and friendly so he asked her out. They have been together ever since. After a year of dating, Frank invited her to move in with him. He was happy with her. She was simple and she loved him and he would be lying if he said he didn't love her back. They had a lot in common and she was a good distracting from Rachel Marron. He had seen Rachel's face everywhere; it was like he couldn't escape her. She was still beautiful as ever and she looked so happy. Even though he tried to avoid her, Frank was still happy for her and as much as he hated to admit it, she still owned a piece of his heart. After months of job searching, Frank had hit a rock bottom. His savings was running out and Francine's job paid very little. He thought that he was going to have to downgrade into a smaller apartment until one day one of his former teammates who played for the NFL called him. He wanted to know if he had any experience in being a bodyguard. There was a party going on and a certain politician was short of one bodyguard. Of course Frank lied and said he did. That night Frank realized he had a knack for being a bodyguard and decided to get certified. The course was a little expensive but as soon as he was certified, he was getting jobs left and right. Sometimes, he got big political clients or just a rich family. Either way, he loved his job. Now that they were on their feet, Francine had been tipping around that she wanted to get married. She would make random comments and he found a bridal magazine in her underwear drawer. Frank didn't want to get married. He loved her but he wasn't thinking about marriage and when he did it just didn't feel right. He tried to tell her that but she wouldn't let it go. She began to get needy and started talking about it more. Frank didn't know what more he could give her. Fortunately, he would leave for a job almost every time she would get annoying; one more thing he loved about his job. He was sitting in his new and bigger apartment watching the football game. Francine was out shopping for whatever reason so he had the place to himself. Right at half-time, his phone rang. \"Hello?\" He answered. \"Hey, honey,\" Frank heard his mother voice say. \"Hi, Mom, how are you feeling?\" he asked. \"I feel amazing. I just received some news that I want to share with you.\" Frank cracked open a beer. \"What type of news?\" \"Frank, the cancer has spread and the chemotherapy isn't working. The doctors said there isn't much they can do.\" Frank nearly dropped his drink. \"Mom, what does that mean?\" Katherine sighed. \"It means I'm dying, honey.\" Frank started pacing back and forth. \"Mom, don't say that. You're not dying. We can find another doctor and get you a new treatment, we can't give up.\" \"Frank, I'm not giving up. I want my last days to be happy and fulfilling, not me throwing up in a bucket next to my bed. I'm ready to die,\" she said. Frank sat back on his couch and started crying. \"But Mom, I'm not ready for you to die, not now.\" \"It's not your decisions, honey. I love you but I have already made up my mind,\" Katherine said. Frank wiped his face. \"I love you too, Mom.\" \"Then can you come home? I want to see you,\" she requested. \"Mom, I'm going on an assignment this weekend,\" Frank said. Katherine sighed in disappointment. \"I understand baby, well, can you try to make it before Christmas?\" \"I'll try, but I don't know. Can you give the phone to Dad, I need to ask him something?\" Frank asked. \"Sure, honey.\" Frank heard her mother called out for Herb and he soon heard his father's voice. \"Hey, son.\" \"Dad, are you okay with her decision?\" \"I can't say that I am but I have to support her either way, she's my wife,\" Herb said. Frank ran his hand through his hair. \"I understand. Look, are you in a room by yourself?\" Frank asked. \"Yeah, why?\" Herb replied. \"I want to surprise Mom and come home but I don't want you to tell her. I'm going to catch a flight out there tomorrow evening.\" \"Son, she will be so happy. I promise I won't tell her; she really misses you, I do too.\" \"I miss you guys too, I'm going to go pack, I'll see you when I get there, bye Dad,\" Frank said. \"Good bye, Frank.\" They hung up and Frank immediately started packing. He didn't know how long he was going to stay so he packed most of the stuff in his closet. When Francine arrived and seen Frank packing, she started panicking. \"Frank, what's going on? Why is your clothes pack? You aren't leaving for another assignment, are you? Or are you leaving me? Is it another woman?\" she rambled. \"Francine, I'm not going on another assignment,\" Frank said. \"So it is another woman. After everything we have been through, you are going to leave me?\" \"Francine, calm down. There isn't another woman. I'm going to see my parents,\" he explained. Francine let out a sigh of relief. \"Oh, why didn't you just say that? When are we leaving?\" she asked. \"My mom is sick, really sick, and I wanted to spend some quality time with her, so I'm going by myself.\" Francine's paled face turned even redder. \"What do you mean you are going by yourself?!\" She screeched. Frank knew she was going to go over the top with the situation. \"I just want to spend some time with my mother, Francine,\" he tried to explain but she wasn't listening. \"Frank, what if I wanted to meet your mom before she dies? Have you even thought about how this makes me feel?\" \"It's not about you, Francine, it's about my dying mother and all she wants is to see me without any distraction,\" Frank said. \"So I'm a distraction now?\" \"No, you are not a distraction, I just want to spend time with my family alone!\" \"Whatever, Frank, you do what you wanna do, I'm going out,\" she grabbed her bags and her keys and left. Frank ran his hand through his hair in frustration. He knew that she wasn't going to like it but he had hoped that she would see he was going through a hard time. His mother is dying and all she could think about is herself. After finishes packing his clothes, he changes into his pajamas and lays in his bed. He knew Francine wouldn't be back that night and it made him sad. He loved her but he was seriously doubting if she loved him back. This was his thought as he drifted to sleep. You know the drill, review please. Tell me how you really feel, especially about Francine. And don't get mad at me for adding her please, we wouldn't want our little Frankie to be lonely, would we? See you next time, smooches.[Chapter 3] Hello my lovies, I promise I have not forgotten about you but things in my life are pretty hectic right now so it takes me a long time to finish a chapter. I am going to finish this, I swear, just stick with me. Hope you enjoy this chapter. Selfish Being in the music business took a lot out of Rachel. She often came home exhausted and grumpy. Even when she leaves early in the morning, she doesn't get home until Fletcher is getting ready for bed and she hated it. Things like world tours and constant studio hours made it hard for her to have the relationship that she wants with him. She didn't want to be like her mom, who put everything and everyone before her. Fletcher knew that Rachel loved him but she also had a job to do and it really wasn't a big deal to him, but it was for her. After a long day at the studio, Rachel comes home around one in the morning plopped down on her couch. She was just about to nod off when she felt someone tug on her hand. She opens her eyes and seen Fletcher standing there in his Spiderman footie pajamas. \"Baby, what are you doing up, it's way past your bedtime?\" she asked. He sat next to her and cuddled up to her. ' Such a momma's boy,' she thought. \"I was waiting up for you, I want to tell you something,\" Fletcher explains. She wrapped her arm around him and said, \"It couldn't have waited until tomorrow? It's late.\" Fletcher shook his head and said in a small voice, \"I didn't know if you were going to be home when I woke up in the morning.\" Rachel immediately felt bad. Her son had to stay up until one in the morning just to talk to her. \"Well, what is it?\" she asked. Fletcher sat up and gave her a big smile. ' God he looks like his dad with that big smile, ' she thought. \"My boat made second place in the boat race today, that means I'm going to the finals,\" he said, excitedly. \"That's great, honey,\" Rachel said and pulled him in for a hug. She knew how important this was to him. Ever since Herb took him fishing for the first time two years ago, Fletcher had been obsessed with boats. Boats were all he talked about and all he wanted to do. Noticing her son's enthusiasm, Rachel found him a club for boys his age that taught them how to build model boats and racing boats and this year Fletcher was finally able to start competing. \"So I was wondering if you could take a day off from work so you can come and watch me,\" Fletcher said full of hope. \"When is it?\" Rachel asked. \"In two months.\" \"I will definitely be there, nothing will stop me,\" she said. \"Pinky promise?\" he asked holding out his pinky. \"Pinky promise, now let's get you back to bed before you sleep the day away.\" She stood up and walked Fletcher to his room and tucked him in. \"Mom?\" Fletcher called out as she was about to leave the room. \"Yeah, baby?\" \"Grampa told me that my dad was coming back to town, is that true?\" he asked. \"Yes, it's true,\" she said. \"Does that mean I'm going to meet him soon?\" he asked. She could feel her heart drop at the thought of Frank finding out that he had a son. She knew Fletcher really wanted to meet his daddy and she wanted them to meet each other too, but she could only imagine the hate Frank would have towards her. The feeling hurt. \"I don't know. Do you really want to meet him?\" she asked. \"Well, it would be nice to have back up at my boat race if you can't make it,\" he said. \"Fletcher, I promised you I would go and I am. You don't need a backup plan,\" she said. Fletcher seemed content with her answer and rolled over and went to sleep. Rachel turned out his light and said goodnight. Lying in her bed, Rachel thought about what it would be like if Frank knew about Fletcher. She knew at this point in their lives that he was well off and now she was just being selfish. Her main fear, besides Frank hating her, was Frank taking Fletcher away from her. Of course, she would fight back because he was her baby, but if a custody battle emerged, the whole world would find out Rachel Marron has a son and keeps him from his father. Sy would have a conniption trying to spin that their way. She has done a good job at keeping Fletcher a secret and she didn't want that to change anytime soon. ' But it wouldn't be so bad if Frank Jr. had his father in his life,' she thought as she drifted to sleep. The next day Rachel, fortunately, was able to leave the studio early. It was 6 in the evening and dinner was served at eight. Rachel wanted to make dinner for her and Fletcher for the first time in years. She called her chef and told him to just make food for her entourage. She dressed up for in her grocery disguise and went to the grocery store. She was going bought stuff for lasagna. It wasn't going to be a giant pan but enough for seconds. After collecting all of her items, Rachel stood in line behind a lady with a crazy looking wig on. \"What do you mean my coupon isn't going to work?\" the lady screeched at the scared girl behind the register. \"I-I'm sorry ma'am, but this is a Safeway coupon and this is Raley's,\" The cashier stuttered. \"A coupon is a damn coupon! Just give me my chicken,\" the lady demanded. \"Okay, b-but you will have to pay full price,\" the cashier tried to explain. \"Oh, I don't believe this,\" the lady groaned and looks in Rachel's direction. Rachel almost gasped when she saw it was her own mother, Alison Marron. \"Hey, you have ten dollars; this child is giving me a hard time?\" Alison asked Rachel. Rachel realized that she didn't recognize her, which was a relief. Rachel didn't know what to do. After all the things Rachel had been through with her mother, she still felt obligated to help her and she hated that. Rachel looked at the scared cashier who was pleading for Rachel to help her out. Rachel reached in her wallet and said, \"Yeah, sure.\" She pulled out two five dollar bills and handed them to the cashier. Alison collected her groceries and snatches the receipt from the cashier's hand. \"Thanks,\" said Alison as she leaves. The cashier started ringing up Rachel's stuff. \"Thank you, that woman was scary,\" She says. Rachel gives her a warm smile and says, \"Oh, you have no idea.\" \"Andre, I swear, she looks so different and not the good kind, I almost felt bad for her.\" Andre is helping Rachel cook her dinner while Fletcher is sitting in the living room. \"She seriously didn't recognize you?\" he asked. \"Nope, that disguise you created is fool proof,\" she answers. Once the food is in the oven, they share a bottle of wine. \"So what are you going to do about Senior?\" Andre asked. That was his nickname for Frank ever since Rachel told him the baby was going to be a junior. \"What can I do? Just go up to his place and say, 'Hey, I didn't break up with you because I didn't love you, I broke up with you because I was pregnant and now we have a 7 ½ year old son that I have been keeping from you. Oh, and your parents have known about it for years and I made them keep it from you too, please don't hate me?' Who knows how he would react.\" \"Yeah, I agree, he might be angry but you know he would want to be a part of Junior's life.\" \"That's what scares me Dre, what if he tries to take him from me, I would die,\" Rachel says. \"Frank wouldn't do that no matter how mad he gets. How much more time do you think you have before Junior starts to resent you for keeping his father away from him because it's gonna happen sooner or later, baby girl?\" Rachel sighs and gulps down the rest of her wine before pouring herself another glass. \"I didn't want to hurt either of them,\" she says. \"I know that but just because you didn't want to doesn't mean you didn't. You hurt Frank the day you decided to keep Junior a secret. I say you tell him as soon as possible because at this point, you are just being selfish.\" Rachel stares at him for a second, processing what he said. Soon, tears started welling in her eyes and she started sobbing. Andre walked across the counter and hugs her. \"Shh, it's gonna be okay, Chelly,\" he says, soothingly. \"He's gonna hate me,\" she cried into his chest. \"Probably, but he'll get over it,\" Andre says. Rachel continued to cry when Fletcher walked into the kitchen. \"What's wrong, Momma?\" Fletcher asked. Rachel moves away from Andre and wipes her eyes. \"Don't worry about it baby, I'll be okay,\" she answers, \"Go sit at the table, I'll bring you your dinner in a minute.\" Fletcher nods and goes into the dining room. \"Well, I have a date so I'm gonna head out. Are you going to be okay?\" Andre asked. \"Yeah, you go have fun, I'll be okay,\" Rachel said. Andre gave her shoulder one last squeeze and left. Once Fletcher was in bed, Rachel started cleaning the kitchen. This gave her time to think about the decision she made all those years ago. \" I mean, I was young and in love. I just wanted a better future for him,\" she thought. Thinking about what life would be like if she had told Frank gave her mixed emotions. She was sure he would have giving up on his dreams if she had told him. She was also sure that they would have been married soon after. That thought made her smile, then frown. He would have hated the life she was living. Frank was a quiet guy, being in the spotlight would have really made him unhappy; and the last thing she wanted was for him to be unhappy. By the time she went to bed that night, she knew what she had to do. Did you guys like it? Let me know. Reviews make me write faster. Have a nice day or night, where ever you are.[Chapter 4] Geez Louise it has been a long time. I told you I wasn't giving up on Frachel, just be patient with me. I hope you guys enjoy this chapter and I promise for real I'm going to try to keep up with this fic because I really want to finish it and we have a long way to go until the end. Anyway, enjoy. Welcome Home Frank Farmer During the whole trip to LA, Frank was on autopilot. He thought about what his mother would look like. His dad said that she lost her hair due to the chemo but Frank has never seen it before. A part of him feels ashamed that he left LA because a girl broke up with him. ' Not just any girl, I loved Rachel,' he thought. He quickly shakes that thought from his head. \" This isn't about Rachel, this is about my mom,\" he thought, \" My mom's dying. She's really dying.\" Tears start to form and he did nothing to hide them. As he falls asleep in his seat, his mind starts to slip back to Rachel. What are the chances that he would ever see her again? It is around 8:30 in the morning when the taxi pulls in front of his house. After paying the driver and collecting his luggage, he goes to the door. His dad told him that Katherine didn't wake up until about 9 so he knew she was still sleeping. He opens the door and immediately feels his shoulders drop. He was home. The smell of breakfast surrounds him so he walks into the kitchen to find his dad at the stove. \"Since when have you started cooking, old man?\" Frank asks. Herb turns around surprised. \"Boy, you almost gave me a heart attack, come here,\" Herb says. He gives his son the strongest hug he could give and Frank does the same. Herb is the first to step back and says, \"My boy is all grown up and still don't have any facial hair.\" \"Francine doesn't like it when I grow stubble,\" Frank argued. Herb turns his attention back to the food he was cooking and Frank sits down. \"She didn't come along with you?\" Herb asks. \"Well, I wanted to spend as much time with you and mom as possible before I go back and she has been very…needy lately,\" Frank explains. \"And how long are you staying?\" Herb asks as he turned the fire off his eggs. \"As long as you need me too, I guess. I don't have a job waiting for me so I'm in no hurry to get back.\" Herb begins making a plate. \"And how is work?\" Before Frank could answer, they hear muffled footsteps walking down the stairs and a voice calls out, \"Herb, I hope you aren't burning down my house.\" \"No, dear, just ignore the black parts,\" Herb called back. \"Oh God, what are you-\" Katherine stops when she sees Frank. \"Frank?\" she asks in disbelief. Frank stands up and says, \"Hi Mom.\" He walked over to her and hugs softly but as the shock wears off she hugs him as hard as she could and begins sobbing. \"My baby's home,\" she cries. She cries so hard that it almost made Frank start to cry, but he doesn't, he just enjoys the moment he's having with his mother. \"Honey, let him breathe, he isn't going anywhere,\" Herb says. Katherine squeezes Frank one more time before finally letting him go and gets a good look at him. \"Look at my baby, all grown up and not a lick of hair on his face,\" she teases him. Frank rubs his chin and laughs. \"Francine doesn't like stubble,\" he says. They move over to the table as Herb serves Katherine her breakfast. \"You didn't bring Francine with you?\" Katherine asks. He shakes his head and says, \"No, she wouldn't like it here anyway.\" \"What a shame. I would have liked to meet her,\" Katherine says, \"So anyway, how is my big, strong bodyguard, traveling all over the country and meeting people?\" Frank proceeds to tell his parents all about his job and the people he met in the past few years. He talks about Francine and how she has changed and her plans to get him to marry her. His parents tell him a bunch of crazy hospital stories that made Frank almost fall out his chair over. They deliberately leave the story about seeing Rachel at the hospital out of the conversation. They talk for hours and hours. Soon it was almost dark outside and Frank had to go unpack his stuff at his friend's house. As expected, Katherine wanted him to stay there with them but Frank convinces her to let him go with a promise to be back first thing in the morning. After Herb drops him off at the house, Frank immediately calls Francine. She might still be mad at him but he just wanted to let her know that he was settled. She answers on the first ring. \"Hello,\" she greeted. \"Hey, Frannie, it's me,\" Frank said. \"What do you want, Frank?\" she asks, annoyed. \"Ouch, I just wanted to check on you,\" he answers. \"Well, you wouldn't have to check on me if I was there, Frank,\" she snaps. Frank runs his hand through his hair. \"Frannie, I'm sorry if you are offended but I needed to do this by myself, I wish you could just understand,\" he says. Francine scoffs, \"Whatever; I'm going out tonight with the girls so I'll talk to you tomorrow.\" She hangs up the phone before Frank can say anything. A bit annoyed, he puts down the phone and says, \"Yeah, I love you, too.\" He dresses for bed and makes a list of things he has to do the next day. He had to go to his parents for breakfast, Katherine wants him to drive her to her flower shop; after that his wants to go grocery shopping, even though all of his meals might come from his parents, he still wanted some snacks in the house and his friend left an SUV for Frank to use. He also makes note to join a gym to keep in shape; maybe even to meet some people. He began thinking about his old friends Andre, Mia, Tony and of course Rachel, even though she wasn't his friend. He realized that in the short time that he lived in LA that they were his only friends. ' I bet I could find Andre's number in the phonebook if I ever get around to it,\" he thought. Around midnight he calls it a night and went to bed. He still couldn't shake the feeling of excitement of being home. Please review. I know it is too short you don't have to tell me because it is about quality, not quantity. Smooches. ","Summary":" Guess who's back...back again... Tiff is back...tell a friend. Hi my lovelies!

I hate his golf trips because he's gone for a whole weekend. \"I told you Rachel, I will be home at noon,\" Frank explained for the hundredth time. \"Why can't you just leave Bruce and hop on a plane right now, I want to cuddle.\" \"I would but I'm Bruce's ride home and he's calling hogs right now,\" he said. I whimpered like a little girl. \"Rachel, I will be home tomorrow and then you can cuddle with me all you want. Happy now?\" he asked. \"No,\" I whined. \"Why not Rachel?\" \"Because, I am having a nice hot bath and you are not here to enjoy it with me,\" I said, smiling because I know what I just did to him. \"Um, I think Bruce can take a cab; that last flight is leaving in one hour,\" Frank said. It sounded like he was already packing. \"No Frank you won't make it on time,\" I said. \"You did that on purpose,\" he complained. \"Yeah I know,\" I chuckled, \"So you know that new Victoria Secret body wash you got me smells way better on me than in the bottle.\" I could hear him groaning in the background. \"You are in so much trouble when I get back,\" he said. \"Threats do nothing for me,\" I said. \"Mommy!\" I heard three rooms down. \"Ugh,\" I groaned. \"Another bad dream?\" Frank asked. \"Yeah. She's been having a lot lately. And they have always been the same, a man chasing her and when she finally gets to one of us, she wakes up,\" I said getting out the tub. \"Well, have she said who he was?\" \"Well the first few were unknown but then she started to make him out as Sy. Maybe it's because of what he said,\" I didn't mean to say that last sentence. \"What did he say?\" \"What?\" \"You said he said something, what was it?\" \"Um, honey I'll call you back or more like I'll see you tomorrow, love you, bye,\" I hung up the phone before he can say anything. I threw on my robe and went into MJ's room. \"What's wrong honey?\" I asked her. She sat up and reached out her arms. I picked her up and asked, \"Nightmare?\" She nodded. \"Do you want sleep Mommy's room tonight?\" She nodded again. I grabbed her cabbage patch doll, I carried her to my room and then set her down. \"Get in the bed and I'll be right back.\" I went into the bathroom and put my pajamas and then to the kitchen and got the bag of cookies. When I got back to the room she was rolling around on the floor. \"MJ, what are you doing?\" I laughed. \"Rooolling,\" she dragged the 'o'. \"I see that, but you shouldn't be rolling,\" I sat down on the floor, \"It's time for sleep.\" She didn't say anything, she just kept rolling. \"Let me guess, you aren't tired.\" She smiled and kept rolling. \"Okay, can you please at least try to be tired then you will be sleeping in a few minutes.\" She kept rolling. \"I will give you four cookies if you get in bed,\" I said showing her the cookies. She stopped and thought and shook her head. \"MJ,\" I said. \"Roooooll with me,\" she suggested. \"Mommy doesn't want to roll, Mommy wants to sleep.\" She frowned and kept rolling. \"Okay, I will roll with you for a few minutes and then we go to sleep,\" I started rolling and she said, \"Cookies.\" I grabbed the cookies and past it to her. A few minutes became a few hours I have no idea when we stopped. Frank's POV \"I'm home!\" I yelled. \"I'm in here,\" Fletcher called back. I walked in the living room and saw Fletcher watching T.V. \"Where are your mom and sister?\" I asked. Fletcher turned the T.V. down and said, \"They are still sleep.\" I looked at my watch and it was 3:08 pm. \"This late?\" I asked. \"Yeah, they were up all night playing. I barely got any sleep,\" he said. I sat my duffle bag on the floor and went upstairs. When I got to my bedroom, MJ and Rachel were asleep on the floor. I chuckled to myself. They were sleeping on their sides and MJ was under Rachel's arm. I crept up behind Rachel and whispered, \"I'm home.\" She stirred for a few moments and turned around. \"Hi sweetie,\" she said in her sleepy voice. \"So uh what's with the sleeping arrangement?\" I asked. She slowly removed her arm from around MJ and said, \"I just forgot how fun it was to be five years old.\" I helped her up and she stretched. \"So how was your weekend,\" I asked. \"Just like every other weekend, except you weren't here.\" \"Sorry,\" I said. \"It's okay,\" she said. \"Well we should try to wake her up,\" I asked. \"Okay, I have to clean up these cookie crumbs and I don't want to vacuum her up.\" Rachel walked out the room and went downstairs. I turned around and MJ was still sleep and looking very peaceful. She looked so much like her mom that it wasn't even funny. The only things of mine that she had was my skin tone and my eyes. The rest is her mom; her face, smile, her curly hair, and a little of her mom's attitude. I bent down and shook her. \"Honey, wake up.\" She stirred but she didn't wake up. \"MJ wake up honey,\" I shook her again and she opened her eyes. \"Good afternoon sunshine,\" I said. She smiled and closed her eyes again. \"Are you still sleepy?\" I asked. She nodded. \"Do you want to sleep in Mommy and Daddy's bed?\" She nodded again. \"Okay, but daddy can't pick you up because he hurt his shoulder so he's going to need you to get up.\" She got up and jumped on the bed and fell right back to sleep. I went downstairs to catch Fletcher opening the door. \"Uh where are you going?\" I asked. He sighed and closed the door. \"Please, I'll be back in a two hours,\" he begged. \"You didn't answer my question Fletcher.\" \"Ugh, I have a date with the finest girl in school and if I don't leave right now, she might never talk to me again.\" \"I understand, so what's her name?\" I asked. \"Frank, can we do this later, I have to go,\" he said. \"Hey you can either answer my question or be late,\" I suggested. \"Tracy, okay, her name is Tracy.\" \"See how easy that was, tell me about her, but after you come back. Go and have fun, just not too much fun,\" I said. \"Thanks Frank, and don't tell mom, please just tell her I'm going to play basketball.\" \"Okay, go.\" He walked out and I went inside the living room. \"Where did Fletcher go?\" Rachel asked sitting on the couch. \"He is going to play basketball,\" I said sitting down next to her. \"No, he's going on a date,\" she said. I looked at her in disbelief, \"How did you know?\" \"I know my son.\" \"Okay,\" I said, \"What did you do all weekend?\" \"Nothing, I took the kids to the beach, your son got about four girls phone number and your daughter got sand in her hair.\" \"Why when he is a womanizer, he's my son?\" \"Because you are a womanizer,\" she said. \"Me? I'm shocked that you would even think that,\" I said with a smirk. I kissed her on the nose then the mouth. \"Frank-\" I pulled her under me and kissed her before she can finish. When I moved down to her neck she said, \"We are not alone in this house.\" I pulled away and said, \"She's sleep.\" \"And what she wakes-\" I kissed her again and worked my way back to her neck. \"Frank stop.\" I didn't of course. \"Frank st-\" I didn't stop her this time. \"Frank,\" she whispered. I moved back to her lips and my hands went under her pajama shirt. When I got her shirt off we heard, \"Knock, knock.\" Sy came in like he lived here. Rachel pushed me off of her and picked her shirt off the floor. \"We're in here!\" she yelled putting her shirt on. Sy came in the living room and said, \"Whoa, I didn't interrupt anything, did I?\" \"Yes,\" I grumbled. Rachel hit me in my chest and said, \"No, you didn't, what's up?\" \"I will be in the game room,\" I said. When I left I heard him say, \"I have some great news, Rachel.\"[Chapter 2] The Bodyguard: Points of view Rachel's POV \"I have some great news, Rachel,\" Sy told me. \"What is it?\" I asked. He took a deep breath and said, \"I did what you told me and bought that place on Sunset Blvd. and I am going to open a club.\" I launched out and hugged him. \"Oh I am so happy for you, I can't believe you listened to me,\" I said letting go of him. \"Yeah, and since you were the one who convinced me to do this, I'm letting you name it.\" \"Are you serious?\" I asked. \"Yeah, name it anything you want, but I have to have it by today,\" he said. \"Um, I don't know,\" as I said that Marilyn-Justice stumbled down the stairs and into the game room with Frank, \"How about MJ's?\" \"Oh no,\" he said standing up, \"No, I will not name my club after a kid that hates me.\" \"Come on, she loves having things named after her, remember when I wrote a song about her and she lit up like the 4th of July. Just think about what she would do if she found out that you of all people are going to name club after her.\" I knew he was going to try hard to get out of this. \"But I'll need for her to sign a contract and that will give her fifty percent of the whole club. She is only five, she can't run a club,\" he argued. \"Then let me help you; until she is of age I'll help you run it.\" \"Ugh, how am I supposed to convince her to put her name on an adult club?\" \"It doesn't have to be and adult club. It can be a talent club. You can have open-mic nights; I can come and sing once and awhile, you know how much business you will have?\" I asked. \"She doesn't even like me.\" \"Well, we'll get her to like you, hey I have an idea. Frank and I are having a date night tonight and Fletcher is going out with some friends, you can babysit her,\" I suggested. Sy froze. I guess the thought of being alone with an unpredictable five year old who doesn't talk and hates him scared him. \"She is a great kid and you know it,\" I said. \"Rachel, she will annihilate me, you've seen what happens when she goes off on somebody.\" \"You have been around her all her life and you barely know a thing about her, this is your chance to get to know her.\" \"Ugh, alright, I'll babysit, but if she hurts me, I'm suing you,\" he said getting up and walking out the door. I plopped my head back on the couch and groaned loud enough to get someone's attention. \"Mommy.\" I turned around and saw Marilyn-Justice. \"Hi honey,\" I said. \"I love you, Mommy,\" she said sitting down and hugging me. I hugged her back and said, \"Aw, I love you too sweetheart, what with all the sudden love today?\" She let go and looked at me, \"Babies, Mommy.\" \"What?\" She got up and went up stair. I sat there and thought. Am I pregnant again? That explains a lot; throwing up yesterday and feel nauseated today, I have been feeling fatigued lately, I can smell everything and… I haven't had a period in three months. Damn it. I ran upstairs and put on white-t and blue jeans and ran out the house yelling, \"I'll be back.\" The spring rain gave me a reason wear a coat with a hood and scarf. I did not want it plaster on tomorrow news that I was buying a pregnancy test from Longs Drug Store. \"Excuse me?\" I asked the store clerk, \"Where are the home pregnancy tests?\" \"Aisle five,\" the teenager said not taking his eyes off his Gameboy. I filled my basket with at least three tests. \"Shameful,\" I heard a voice behind me say. I turned around and an elderly woman was staring at me. \"Take a picture, it'll last longer,\" I snapped. She scoffed and walked out of the aisle. When I got to the counter the teenager ringing everything up said, \"I'm sensing it's wasn't intentional.\" \"Not really,\" I said. \"Yeah mine too. My girlfriend died at childbirth, so I have to raise my son by myself,\" he said showing me a picture in his wallet of his kid. \"Aw, he is adorable.\" \"Yeah, he looks like his mom. That'll be forty dollars.\" I pulled out a hundred dollar bill and said, \"Keep the change and buy your boy something.\" I grabbed my bag and ran out to my car. On the way home I 911 paged Sonya and she met me at her house. \"Hi Auntie Rachel,\" Bryan said when we walked in. \"Hi buddy-boy,\" I said dragging Sonya into her room. \"Girl what's wrong?\" she said. I dumped everything in my bag and said, \"That's what's wrong.\" While we were waiting for the results a few minutes later she asked, \"And why are you here and not sharing this moment with your husband?\" \"Because if I am pregnant I want to tell him tonight on our date,\" I answered pacing back and forth. Brriing. We ran to the bathroom. All three were positive. \"Congrats,\" Sonya said. \"How could I be so stupid?\" I said plopping on her bed. \"Wait, you aren't happy about this?\" \"No, no, no. I'm ecstatic; I just can't believe I didn't notice. My freaking five year old had to tell me.\" \"Wait, MJ told you?\" \"Yeah, but that's not the point.\" \"Well you need to go home and give your husband the news of his life. Frank's POV \"Honey, can you zip up my dress for me?\" Rachel asked me. I walked up behind her and zip up her dress. \"You know I'm better at un zipping,\" I said wrapping my arms around her waist. \"Down boy,\" she said pulling apart my hands and walking to get her purse. \"So where did you go today,\" I asked. I could see her stiffen up a little bit. \"Um, I went to the pharmacy and got MJ another asthma pump,\" Twitch, \"Flats or heels?\" \"Heels, I didn't know she was running out.\" \"Uh, yeah, and I don't just thought I'd get another one for precautions. The cashier and I had a nice conversation, he was a nice young boy.\" \"What can you and a cashier possibly have to talk about?\" I asked fixing my bow tie. \"His son, so where are we going?\" \"Surprise, so you talked about kids with a stranger?\" \"Ugh I hate surprise.\" \"Yeah, that's why I make them. Are you hiding something from me?\" I asked. Rachel isn't one to keep secrets, but today she is acting very cautious. \"No,\" Twitch, \"What makes you think that?\" \"Well, when you lie, you twitch a little bit,\" I said. \"Whatever, so how do I look?\" she asked. I looked her up and down and started to drool. She had on a strapless short black cocktail dress that fits her body curve to curve, devil red stiletto pumps a black make-up bag and she actually flat ironed her hair. She looked good. \"You look- wow,\" I said in awe. \"I'm guessing I look good.\" \"No, you look gorgeous,\" I said pecking her on her extremely soft lips. \"Somebody is trying to get lucky tonight,\" she said bumping my hip. I held my hand out and said, \"Ready to go my lady.\" She took my hand and we walked down stairs to say good-bye. Sy's POV I sat downstairs alone in the living room alone with Marilyn-Justice. I tried to stay focused on my magazine but she was glaring at me very evilly. For a kid, she is very scary. \"Alright you two,\" Frank's voice said when they came down the stairs. Marilyn-Justice smile and ran as I walk to them. \"Okay, MJ remember that your bedtime is 9:00 and not a minute later. Sy dinner is in the oven on low, take it out at eight. And MJ, you get two pieces of pecan pie and that is it and no TV. Now both of you, do I make myself clear?\" Rachel asked sternly. The kid nodded. \"I don't know why I have to follow rules when I'm the babysitter,\" I said. \"If we come back and MJ tells us that you didn't follow the rules and you will tell us little lady,\" she pointed at her daughter, \"Then you will be babysitting her for the next month. Wouldn't that be fun?\" \"Whatever go and have fun, everything will be fine,\" I said. Frank opened the door for Rachel. \"Follow the rules and nobody will get hurt oh and she has a slight headache so give her some children's Tylenol before she goes to bed,\" she said walking out the door. \"You guys have a good time. You have nothing to worry about now go.\" And that's want they did. When the front door closed the kid and I had a stare off. \"Um so, what do you want to do?\" I asked nervously. She didn't say anything. This night is going is interesting.[Chapter 3] Please don't kill me. I wanted to update but I kept changing my mind. Plus it's hard two juggle two stories at once. These stories are my babies and of course I'm going to give the newborn more attention. Well this chapter might be short but you ain't the one skipping homework to write this. Ugh, the nerve of some people. Only thinking about themselfs. Just kidding ya'll know I love ya'll. Anywho, enjoy. P.S. No MJ is not going to kill Sy. The Bodyguard: Points of view Frank POV The look on Rachel's face when we pulled into the fishing pier parking lot was priceless. \"You brought me to a pier,\" she said when I helped her out the car. \"Yeah, you wanted to go somewhere different, so here we are.\" I lead her to the dock where I set up a candlelit dinner. \"Wow,\" she said. I pulled her chair and she sat down. \"Let me guess, we are eating my favorite catfish?\" she asked. I sat down and asked, \"How did you know that?\" \"I can smell it.\" Okay, that is freaky. I uncover the food and we prayed over it. Ten minutes later Rachel asked me, \"What are you thinking about?\" I smiled at her, \"I'm just thinking about when I found out that you were pregnant with MJ.\" She slightly froze, \"That was epic. If Sy hadn't busted in on us and made me blurt it out, you wouldn't have found for another two weeks.\" \"Well, I wasn't going to tell you but, the day I found out was supposed to be the day I was going to propose to you,\" I said. She giggled. \"I kind of found figured it out. I caught a glimpse of the box when I was looking in your drawer for pajamas, but I didn't pay attention to it.\" \"Yeah I kind of suck at hiding things, but I had it all planned out. I was going to take you somewhere private like this. Every word was going to be a compliment, you are an amazing woman,\" I grabbed her hand, stood up and stood by her chair, \"I would have got done on one knee,\" that's what I did, \"And I would have pulled out a ring,\" I did, \"And I would have said, I love you more than anything and I can't see myself with any other woman than you. Since we are already married I want to asked you to wear this on your other finger this,\" I showed her the ring. \"Oh Frank, it's beautiful,\" she gasped. \"It was my mother's wedding ring; it took me four and a half years to get the courage to ask my father for it, to my surprise he was waiting for me to ask him, I was hoping that you will accept this. I had it sized to fit your finger and your birthstone around the diamond.\" \"Of course I will accept it honey.\" I smiled and slid the ring on her finger. \"I love you Rachel Marron.\" \"I love you too Frank Farmer.\" I leaned up and kissed her. Kissing her was like… it's indescribably amazing. I felt like I was in heaven. Life is good when I kiss her. I love her so much it hurts sometimes. \"Frank, I,\" kiss, \"Have to,\" kiss, \"Tell you,\" kiss, \"Something.\" I pulled away from her and asked, \"What?\" She smiled and sighed, \"I'm pregnant.\" Back at the house Sy's POV \"Hey kid, your dinner is ready,\" I yelled taking the lasagna out the oven. She rushed down and waited for me to make her plate. \"Here you go, corner piece just like you like it,\" I said. She took the plate and looked at me confused. \"Uh, I don't know how I knew that either.\" I saw a small smile crept up on her face. \"Go eat,\" I said. She actually obeyed me. After she ate she had her pies and took her bath, she was ready for bed. I poked my head her room and said, \"Hey, kid, time for bed.\" She was holding her stomach frowning. \"What's wrong with you?\" I asked. She ran passed me to the bathroom. \"Hey,\" I said following her. When I got to the bathroom her head was in the toilet. \"Are you okay?\" She looked at me when she could. \"Of course you're not okay,\" I walked in the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bathtub. Her little head was in the toilet for at least 2 minutes. \"Are you decent?\" She shook her head. Ugh, the one thing I hate more than kids are sick kids, but when I was in college I minored in nursing and I never thought I would have to use it. \"I want my mommy,\" she cried. \"I want both your parents, but right now we are stuck with each other,\" he said. She started cry and hugging her knees. \"Ugh, please stop crying, kid it's only the flu,\" I begged. \"And stop calling me kid, my name isn't kid, my name is Marilyn-Justice! Ma-ri-lyn Jus-tice, don't call me kid!\" she yelled. I have to admit, I was a little scared of her but I had to suck it up. I got up and searched for a thermometer. I finally found one. \"Put this under your tongue and wait.\" She shook her head. \"Come on, you are sweating bullets, if you have a fever and I leave it untended, your mother will kill me.\" She groaned and opened her mouth. I stuck the thermometer under her tongue. \"Are you done throwing up?\" She nodded. \"Can you walk?\" She shrugged her shoulder. \"Get up slowly, I'll walk you to your room.\" She slowly got up looked at me when her eyes went to the back of her head. I caught her and the thermometer just before she hit the floor. I scooped her up carefully and looked at the thermometer. Her temperature was 103.1. I sighed and carried her to her room and placed her on her bed. \"Okay, in school they said to… uh… damn it what am I supposed to do? Oh to help bring fever down you have to dab that patient softly on the forehead with a cold damp towel.\" I left the room and came back with a face towel. After dabbing for about an hour, I started wondering where Frank and Rachel were. Rachel POV \"I'm pregnant,\" I said. Frank's face went blank. It's hard to read him went there is no expression. I got a little scared but then a large smile spread across. In a blink of an eye, Frank lifted me up into the air and spun me around. I giggled. He finally set me down on my chair kissed me. \"When did you find out?\" he asked me. \"Today,\" I said, \"That why I went to the pharmacy.\" \"My God, I love you,\" he said. I smiled and said, \"I love you too baby.\" \"And I love you, too,\" he said in a baby voice to my abdomen and kiss it. I laughed at his goo goo voice. \"The baby can't hear you babe.\" \"Do you think I care? That's my kid in there. I cannot believe it,\" he said in disbelief. \"Well believe it papa bear because we are going to have another cub.\" \"You know what, let's cut this date short and go home so you can rest.\" \"Honey, I am not tired,\" I said. \"Then we can do something else,\" he had is sneaky face on and I knew exactly what he wanted to do.[Chapter 4] Sorry for the long wait, but I think it was worth it. 'Wink Wink' 'Nudge Nudge' 'Eye-Raise Eye-Raise.' The Bodyguard: Points of view \"Frank, how are we going to tell the kids?\" Rachel asked on the way home. \"They will be thrilled, Rachel. This will give you and MJ an excuse to decorate something,\" I said. \"Wait, MJ already knows. It was weird because she came up to me and said, 'Babies Mommy.'\" \"Hey, she's a special kid. She senses things like you falling asleep at church-\" \"That was an accident,\" she cut me off. \"What about the time you ate all the snacks at Fletcher's back to school night?\" \"Dammit, how can I not realize that I was pregnant?\" she asked. \"Well I didn't know you were pregnant either,\" I said. \"Yeah, I know but it's my body,\" she said. \"And I know your body just as much as you do. Hell, I probably know it better than you.\" \"Whatever,\" she said. When we got home Sy bum rushed us before we had a chance to step in the door. \"Where the hell was you guys, I've been paging you for at least an hour?\" he yelled. \"I left my pager here,\" Rachel said handing me her jacket. \"How was everything, I see MJ didn't tear you into pieces,\" I joked but his face was still serious. \"Oh everything was fine, until I discovered she had the damn flu!\" he yelled. \"What? Where is she? Is she okay\" Rachel asked. \"She is asleep. Her fever went down but she keeps coughing.\" \"Well, did you give her inhaler?\" I asked. Sy smacked his hand on his forehead. \"God dammit, I knew there was something I forgot?\" That's when Rachel took off upstairs faster than I've ever seen her run. \"Honey, you're pregnant, slow down,\" I yelled running after her. \"My baby needs me,\" she yelled back. She ran to the bathroom and got MJ's inhaler and went to her room. MJ was sleep, but she wasn't coughing, she was wheezing. Rachel sat at MJ's bed and tried to wake her up. \"Sweetie. Come on wake up,\" she said, but she didn't. \"MJ, wake up for Mommy.\" MJ started to open her eyes. \"MJ, sit up,\" she placed to pump in her mouth, \"Inhale… exhale.\" I left the room and went back downstairs. \"She's okay right?\" Sy asked. \"Yeah, she should be. Look man, Rachel told me about your club and the reason why you agreed to babysit MJ. I need to thank you for taking care of her because if you didn't it would be a lot worse.\" \"Anytime, you know she really is a good kid. I misjudged her and I'm sorry,\" he apologized. \"Tell that to my daughter,\" I said. \"She's okay,\" Rachel said coming back down the stairs, \"You did a good job, you can come back tomorrow and talk to her about your club, but now you have to go.\" \"Alright, I'll see you two tomorrow.\" He walked out and I closed and locked it. \"You want to go watch a movie or something,\" Rachel asked me. I turned around and nodded. We walked upstairs to our room and watched my favorite movie, \"The Seven Year Inch.\" Fletcher's POV I woke up in the morning and remembered that I wasn't home. \"Fletch, get up,\" my friend Mitchell said throwing his pillow at me. I threw it back at him and turned away. \"Man, we got to get up. We got to be at practice in an hour or coach will bench us so get you sleepy ass in the shower. And my mom put your breakfast on the table.\" He left and I slept for another 3 three minutes before I got up. I took my shower and went into Mitch's kitchen to be greeted by his parents and his little, by ten minutes, sister Trixie. \"Good morning people,\" I greeted. \"Morning Fletcher,\" his mom Pam said. \"Fletcher,\" Trixie said. \"Trisha,\" I said. She glared at me for call her by her real name. Trixie and I never really liked each other, she always been just Mitch's sister to me and I have always been just one of her brother's friends. She was seventeen and I just turned sixteen so we never have anything to talk about and it was starting to get annoying because I'm always over here and she never says a word to me. \"Where's Mitch?\" I asked, sitting down next to his mom. \"He left,\" his dad Michael said, \"He said that he wasn't going to wait for you so you and Trixie are going to walk down there.\" I loved being able to walk down the street and have no one know I was Rachel Marron's son. I kind of thank my mom for sheltering me from the media- wait, did he just say that Trixie is walking with me. \"Why does Trixie have to come with me?\" I asked. \"Because she needs to get out the house and I said so,\" Ms. Pam said. \"Yes ma'am,\" I mumbled. I swear that I have at least three mother's; my mom, Aunt Sonya and Ms. Pam. The telephone rang and Ms. Pam was the one to get it. \"Hi,\" she said, \"Yeah, she's right here. Trixie, it's for you.\" \"Hello,\" Trixie said. Then I could hear someone yelling at her from the other end. \"I'll take this in the living room,\" she said. When she slid the door shut both her parents looked at me. I took another bite of my bacon, wiped my hands and went around to the other side of their living room where I could see and hear Trixie but she couldn't see me, and luckily she had the phone on speaker. \"Rob, will you stop yelling, I can hear you,\" she said. \"I have to yell, bitch. You don't call a guy and tell him that we're over. We are over when I say that we're over!\" the guy yelled. \"Don't you call me a bitch!\" \"Okay, ho, you must don't understand. You belong to me.\" \"I don't belong to you man, no scratch that, I don't belong to you, boy. Robert, you are the scum of the fucking earth. You slept with my best friend behind my back and you have the nerve to call me a ho. YOU are a slut and I don't want to be with you anymore so stop calling my house and leave me the fuck alone!\" she hung up and I ran back to the kitchen. \"What happen?\" Mr. Mike asked. \"Let's just say that it wasn't pretty. I suggest getting an alarm system,\" I warned. \"FLETCHER!\" we heard Trixie yell, \"You have one minute to get you stuff and be at the door or I'm leaving.\" I gulped down my orange juice and said, \"Thanks for breakfast, Ms. Pam.\" I got up and grabbed my gym bag. \"Good luck,\" Mr. Mike wished. 'Yeah right,' I thought. The park was at seeing distance and I had twenty more minutes before I had to be at practice. Trixie and I haven't said anything to one another the whole walk but it was getting awkward. \"You okay?\" I asked. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" she snapped. I looked at her and she was looking at the ground. \"It's better if you talk about it,\" I suggested. She looked up to only shoot me a cold glare. \"Or not,\" I said. We were just a few meter away from the park went some pulled Trixie away. \"What the hell? Let me go,\" she said. \"No, is he the reason you broke up with me?\" the guy, who I assume was Rob, asked. \"I broke up with you because I hate you,\" she said. \"Come on, you don't mean that. I'm sorry about what I said on the phone. Forgive me?\" Trixie tried to get out of his grip but failed. \"Hey kid, get lost,\" the guy told me, but I was frozen. \"Fletcher you stay right there. Robert let go of me.\" \"Come on, baby,\" he wrapped his arms around her and tried to kiss her. That's when she slapped him. He let go of her and held his face. When he looked at her he said, \"You bitch.\" Then he punched her in her face. I unfroze in realization of what happen. Trixie was on the floor and Rob was standing over her about to kick her but not before I pushed him away. \"Hey, man you don't freaking hit a girl like that!\" I yelled shoving him harder. \"Kid, mind your own damn business,\" he shoved me back. \"Dude, your mom so stupid she didn't teach you to keep your hands off a woman!\" He looked at me before trying to punch me, but I caught his fist and punch him in his nose. He fell to the ground with tears come out of his eyes. I picked up an unconscious Trixie and carried her to the park. When Mitchell saw us he immediately ran over. \"What happen?\" he asked. There was a crowd. \"Her boyfriend.\" Coach came over and asked the same question. \"We were walking when her ex stopped us. He was trying to get her back and when he tried to kiss her, she slapped him. He got mad and punch her,\" I explained. \"Where is he?\" Mitch asked. \"By the gate.\" \"I'll kill him,\" he said, before taking off in Rob's direction. \"Mitchell, stop!\" I yelled because Mitchell was a cancer sign and he was crazy enough to do it. Coach went after him and stopped him. He walked Mitchell back over trying to calm him down. \"The best thing to do is call the police,\" Coach said to him. Mitchell was so angry he had tears in his eyes. \"No, the best thing to do is kill him. No one puts their hands on a girl, let alone my little sister!\" \"Fletcher, take her to the nurse,\" Coach instructed me. I nodded and walk into the building to the nurse's office. Today was probably one of the most interesting days of my life and it wasn't even noon yet.

Thousands of them staring up at you, their eyes gleaming, their mouths set in grim lines. Their expectations are high. Your hands tremble, your lips quiver like a young child about cry. You open your mouth to speak, but no sound escapes. You feel as if you are being choked, the air slowly, agonizingly being taken from you. The fates have dealt you a cruel turn, but you must continue. You must say something. These are your people, they look up to you; all eyes turn to you when disaster strikes. You are the King. You have all the power in the world at your fingertips. And yet, you carry such a burden; you endure so much suffering, sometimes it feels as if the world has been thrust upon your shoulders, and you are too weak to bear its weight. Your breaths come in shallow rasps; your heart pounds like an iron gavel in your chest. You close your eyes; you feel your heels rocking back and forth. Around you, the seconds tick past furiously; and yet time seems to have stopped as you try so hard to form a sentence. You stare so hard at that damned paper, analyzing every word with care and preciseness. In your mind you scream the words, screaming at God to let your voice be heard. And yet, nothing happens. Nothing at all. You look around you, a horrid sense of despair welling within you. Perhaps, the cause is lost. You see dear Elizabeth, tears welling in her eyes; it is all too painful for her to see you struggle. You see the Archbishop, his eyes cold and steely-gray. You see the people, thousands of them staring up at you, wondering what on earth has happened. And then…then you see Logue. Amongst the crowd, watching like any other person. But his eyes are not expectant; he is not examining you like an insect under a microscope. He nods his head and gestures with his hands vaguely, like Handel readying the orchestra. You look back down at the writing in your hands, the red slashes blood red on the stark white of the paper. It isn't a speech. It's a piece of music. A piece of music meant to be played slowly and melodically. It is meant for you . It is your song; within it, you are expressing your emotions. It is the ballad of a troubled monarch. Though he struggles, he never stops. Never stops persevering, never gives up hope. Let that monarch be you . So you bravely look up at the crowd, then back at that speech. You smile at it fondly, as if it is an old friend. You open your mouth, and you begin. Slowly, steadily. And you let your voice be heard.[Chapter 2] The ticking of the clock in the corner, The fretting of a little Margaret, not wanting to go to bed. Her older sister shushing her, the Queen Mother ushering them off. And you sit there, in your chair, eyeing a carton of cigarettes as if it were the devil itself, A yellowed sheet of parchment, the typed script slashed open with the bloody tip of a scarlet pen, lies on the desk before you. Such power there is, in the written word. And as you think of this, you realize that you've never pondered such before. Of course, there was no need for you to ponder such. It was entirely unnecessary. All your life, you've never had to depend on yourself, never had to rely on yourself. All your life, you had the luxury of hiding in the shadows of your brother and father. You knew from the start that you'd never be King; that you could live out the rest of your life in peace and quiet, indulging yourself in the serenity of private life. Being made a monarch, that was more a horror than an indulgence, but you simply chuckled at the idea, dismissing it as a nightmare that would never come true. But alas, even you must now admit that the luxuries you once possessed have now slipped from your clutches and you have, in effect, been thrown to the wolves. If, those wolves were in fact, a hungry, expectant audience of helpless, hopeless citizens, looking to you for guidance in this… this time of trial. But they see it in your eyes, and their faces fall, and you feel it deep in the creases of your heart, That overwhelming sense of despair; that sickening, nagging feeling in the pit of your stomach, That in this darkest hour, you have been let down by the one you were hoping, praying, and believing would lead you out of the filth, out of the fire and madness, into the light of a new day. The shattering of glass, the fury of writhing flames, the shrill howls of your people as they run to their bomb shelters. The hollow stomping of jackboots, the gnashing snap of Swastikas in the wind, like serpents. You can feel it deep within the marrow of your bones, the black cloud that is slowly consuming this earth within which you live, a portion of it, which you rule. Like a plague, it desecrates and mutilates and murders, leaving civilizations such as yours, once laced with grandeur and power, lifeless shells, shadows of what they once were. Of what they were always supposed to be. Rain drops clatter against the windows, the fire flickers in the hearth. The music echoing softly from the turntable stops with a sudden click. You are now fully immersed in the dark, heavy silence of so many emotions, you can hardly comprehend what they are. Greif. Shame. Depression. Wrath. And only the tiniest squick of confidence, barely hanging by a thread, threatening to be severed completely. The paper is now clutched tightly within your clutch, your knuckles paling as you exert the force of your feelings into that damned writhing monster, that demon that will forever haunt you, that – That worthless, lifeless, inanimate piece of parchment. How could something so useless and meaningless inflict so much torture upon you? How could you let it defeat you? You are better. You know in your soul you are. It simply took its merry time in allowing you to realize it. That object which has tormented you for so long, You will, someday, overtake its power. You will win back its respect. You are the King. It is your subject. It will vow its allegiance to you. With a sudden rasp, the fire dies and you are left in darkness, silence. But now, a new music has begun to echo throughout the room. Alas, its song is not so happy. It is a cacophony of man-made machines. It is the haunting shriek of an air-raid alarm. With a sigh, as if this is all second-nature to you now, You stand. So the Germans have come again. Will they ever relent? ","Summary":" Faces. Thousands of them staring up at you, their eyes gleaming, their mouths set in grim lines.

All she wanted to do was go home and cry, hibernate for anwhile until this whole mess had blown over. She saw Aldys, Anita andnGus marching across the field toward her as her emotions took anothernturn. Haziness enveloped her as her body gave way, fainting, hernjelly like figure becoming harder for Rob to handle on his own as hentried to carry her out of the stadium. Gus intervened, scooping hernbody up into his arms and carrying her down into the pit and towardnthe locker room never stopping until he had set her down on one ofnthe benches. Anitanknelt down at her left side, Rob at her right; all eyes were on thenone person they all loved in their own way. Rob reached out his handnstroking the now bedraggled bangs away from her face, all the timencalling her name to try and evoke a response from her. Anita triednthe same with her left hand, rubbing her own over it in order to trynand get a feeling from her that she was coming out of her daze. Josienfelt the soft caresses as she began to come around, was this what itnfelt like to be in heaven? Or could she actually believe that Samnhad come after all, that he had arrived late and had found her afternshe'd fainted? She wondered if he had picked her up and taken hernhome and was now eagerly waiting for her to wake up so that theyncould begin to spend the rest of their lives together. Eventuallynher eyes flicked open trying to register just exactly where she wasnand with whom. She quickly ascertained she wasn't with Sam. Shensmiled weakly at her onlookers. Her brother helped her sit up andnshe began to cough, she had obviously sat up a little too quickly. \"Josie, are you alright?\" Robnasked, steadying his sister with the bulk of his weight as he satnbeside her. She nodded flatly. \"Youngave us a fright there, Geller!\" Gus remarked as he carefullynwatched his protégé. \"Where am I?\" Josie said, chokingnout her words. \"You'renin the locker room of the stadium,\" Aldys motioned, \"You fainted,nwith the stress of it all I would guess.\" Josie nodded again,ntaking in her surroundings and the concerned faces looking on. \"He didn't come did he?\" Josiensobbed, her heart shattering into millions of tiny pieces at thenknowledge that Sam hadn't even turned up late. Anita pulled Josie into her embracenleaning Josie's head on her shoulder and stroking her hair, \"no,nJosie, he didn't make it, I'm so sorry.\" Allneyes turned to the locker room door as it was flung open, Josie couldnonly hope again that it was Sam, that he had eventually arrived butnit wasn't to be. Rigfort strolled in, \"where's my greatnreporter? How's she doing?\" \"I'm fine, physically, MrnRigfort,\" Josie managed, \"it's just emotionally that'll takenthe time to heal.\" She watched him nod. \"I think I'd like tongo home now, Anita will you come with me?\" \"Sure,nno problem,\" Anita answered, throwing a look to Gus. He motionednfor her to go before saying, \"call me if you need anything.\" nAnita nodded back. Josienstood uneasily, grabbing Anita's arm for support, she still didn'tnfeel quite strong enough to walk on her own. Anita lead her throughnthe group and out into the night on the way to her car. Josie wasnnevermore thankful that the crowd's attention was firmly on thenState championship game that was in hand now than on her ownnpredicament. Anitanwatched Josie, as she sat silently in the car watching the world gonby out of the passenger window. Josie was wondering what it had beennthat had kept him away. \"I really did think he would come,nJosie, you know?\" Anita said, as if in answer to Josie's ownnthoughts. Josie turned to her, \"Yes, I thoughtnhe would too, but there could be a simple explanation for this.\" \"Josie, you rely too heavily on yournheart and what it tells you. You need to realise that had you meantnanything to Sam Coulson he would have moved mountains to be therentonight, even if he was slightly running behind schedule.\" \"Inknow, Anita, I obviously hurt him more than I thought I had. Why, ohnwhy did I ever agree to do that stupid undercover story anyway? IfnI'd left well alone then I'd have never met him and this wholensituation would never have presented itself.\" \"Honey, look at what you havenachieved though. You look stunning and your confidence has soared,nmeeting that English teacher was not the only thing that happenednover the past few months, you grew.\" \"Butnto what end, Anita, none of this is any good without the man thatngave me most of it with his encouragement and thoughtfulness. No onenelse will ever be able to do that for me again.\" \"Josie, time is a great healer, andnthere are plenty …\" \"Don'tnsay it, plenty more fish in the sea,\" Josie's anger cut throughnAnita's statement, \"the thing is, Anita, that man was my penguin,nhe was my soul mate and I stupidly believed that I could makeneverything alright. I made my choice; I helped out my friend, and innthe process destroyed the one thing, the only thing that I have evernwanted, Sam Coulson's love and attraction. So please don't go onnabout there being someone else out there for me because as far as I'mnconcerned I would rather spend my life alone than settling to be withnanybody other than him.\" \"You'd go through life nevernenjoying the physical feeling of love with another person because younmissed your chance with Sam!\" \"Yes! I've never felt it before,nit's not like I'm going to miss it is it.\" \"Josie, you can't live your lifenwith such a big part missing.\" \"Yes, I can! I have loved and lostnthe only man I have ever truly needed to be with, I'm just going tonhave to live my life as if we'd never met.\" \"That'sna tough call; do you really think you can do it?\" \"I've done it before, Anita, I canndo it again!\" \"But that was at high school!\" \"Sonwas this, I just need to build those walls up again and this timenno-one will be able to pull them down.\" Anita pulled up outside of Josie'snapartment, watching Josie silently alight the vehicle she asked, \"donyou want me to come in with you?\" \"I'll be fine, Anita. I just neednsome time and some space to get my head around things.\" And withnthat she was gone. Anita stared after her friend'snretreating dejected frame, thinking abut the events that hadntranspired over the course of that evening. Josie's great storynhad received rejection from the only person that had truly matterednand Anita was resolved with one problem, she knew exactly what shenwould say and do to Sam Coulson if she ever had the opportunity. Onenthing was for sure though, she fully intended to make sure that thenwhole of Chicago felt Josie's pain and pulled them all in behindnher friend. Not that she believed she would have much to do as shenfelt most of the county would stand behind Josie anyway, but she feltnshe must do something. She opened her cell phone and dialled thenonly number she had etched into her memory, \"Hi, Gus, it's Anita,nlook where are you I need to talk to you … it's about Josie andnwhat we can do to help her … great, I'm on my way then … seenyou soon.\" She hung up, selected drive and pulled the car awaynfrom the curb, knowing in a few minutes she would safely be ensconcednwithin Gus's office at the Sun Times and hopefully working onnsomething to ease Josie's suffering. She only hoped it wouldn'tnbe a case of too little too late.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: None of the characters ofnthe film belong to me. Synopsis: Josie waits for hern'penguin' to kiss her at the State ball game, only to find thatnhe doesn't turn up. Five years later she's invited to the promnreunion, will she meet him again? And if she does how will her heartnreact? Chaptern2 Samnsat down in his tan leather armchair packing away the last remnantsnof his life as he awaited the arrival of the removers. Tonight henwas moving out and tomorrow he would start his new life away fromnChicago and Miss Josie Geller, the 25 year old undercover reporternthat had turned his world upside down twice and in as many months. nHe still couldn't get to grips with it; his Josie had connived hernway into his affections and then dashed them all with her remarkablenstory of how she had been sent back to high school to work on annundercover scoop. Admittedly, he had only heard half of her rant asnhe had managed to put one foot in front of the other and find his waynoutside to get some air. But the conversation that she had had withnher colleague about 'getting the story on Coulson' had been morenthan enough for him to cope with. Henwondered if he should have let her explain but what would have beennthe point, it was obvious that the paper had spotted their story andnhe was it. He couldn't believe how he had been duped by the onenperson he believed could never do anything like that to another humannbeing. She had been all innocence and naivety from their firstnmeeting, slowly coming out of her shell with his increasingnencouragement. But then that could have just been all part of thenact. Henwas momentarily relieved of his reverie when the removal men knockednon his door, as they slowly began to take his life away and putneverything he owned into storage, he quickly finished off packingnaway his trophies, not noticing that with his most belovednpossessions he had packed away her beautiful green eyes. Sealing thenbox he handed that over to the removers. He picked up his overnightnbag as he finalised the details of his storage arrangements, left thenapartment keys with the super and made his way to his car, safe innthe knowledge that tomorrow he would be up state and out of JosienGeller's life forever, at least with no memories of her surroundingnhim he would have a better chance to forget. Henpulled out of his street onto the main highway only to be confrontednwith traffic everywhere, 'strange time for gridlock', he thought.n Edging slowly up the road he managed to slow up near a policenofficer. \"Excuse me,\" he asked, \"what's going on?\" \"Oh,nsome girl is waiting for some guy to rescue her from the ball game ornsomething, not all that sure what it's all about but all the papersnare there and some of the news stations as well.\" \"Well, I hope she gets whatever itnis she's hoping for,\" Sam replied, \"shame its created such antravesty with the traffic though.\" \"Yeah, well these things happen, andneverybody loves a happy ending don't they, you should be alrightnthough after the next couple of blocks.\" \"Thanks officer,\" Sam smiled,n\"I'll be glad to get away from all this.\" \"Good night, Sir.\" \"Yes, good night.\" The trafficnbegan to move again slowly and as he reached the entrance way to thenstadium he could hear the crowd counting down, '5 … 4 … 3 … 2n… 1'. \"I just hope that you, whoever you are, are happier thannme,\" he said to nobody in particular, \"and I just hope that JosienGeller is covering your story, maybe then she'll realise what truenlove and happiness are all about.\" The traffic ahead eased off andnhe was able to move quite quickly, \"Goodbye Josie, I hope I nevernhave the opportunity to meet you again.\" Withinna few hours, Sam was safely hibernating within the confines of hisnparents' cabin by the lake. They never used it these days and werenvery happy when Sam had asked if he could in order to use as a basenuntil he could find something closer to the school that had justnoffered him a job from the beginning of the next semester. He madenhimself a hot drink and found his way up to his bedroom. The largendouble bed beckoned him and he lay down, his eyes closed withnexhaustion it seemed that this would be the first night in a whilenthat he would find sleep. Withinnminutes he was asleep, his chocolate drink forgotten as it stood onnhis night stand. A smile crept over his face as visions began tonplay out in his head. … \" You're amazing, JosienGeller,\" Sam announced, his face beaming with his admission. \"So,nhave you thought anymore about Dartmouth?\" Josie smiled, \"Yes, I have.\" nLetting go of Sam momentarily she deftly removed the 'wings' pinnand threw it onto the floor before continuing, \"There's somethingnI have to tell you.\" Sam couldn't believe what henthought he was hearing, was she about to declare herself to him, hencould only wonder. He looked deeply into her eyes, his ownnsmouldering with the desire that was welling up inside of him. n\"There's something I have to tell you, too.\" Josie smiled, \"really?\" Shenasked, he merely nodded. \"Not here though, and I have to gonfirst.\" \" Ok,\" Sam was perplexed, hisnexpression quizzical. \" The thing is, you may not wishnto tell me what you wish to tell me after you've heard what I havento say.\" Her face faltered, if he was about to tell her he hadnfeelings for her then she had to reveal herself first. \"Now wherenshall we go?\" They both looked around trying tonfind some kind of escape and finally decided upon the back stagenarea. They decided to split up, Sam was to go first, upon thenpremise that if Josie were needed she wouldn't be missed that long. Samnfell in behind the curtains and found a place to wait, his body shooknwith the recognition that he was about to tell his student how muchnhe admired her and wanted to be with her, and he had no doubt thatnhis feelings would be reciprocated. The only thing was what on earthnwas it that Josie needed to say to him, it had to be something soncompletely extreme from her assertion that she needed to go first. nSo she could go first, he really felt that nothing she could saynwould make him change his mind about what he had to say to hernanyway. \" Sam?\" \" I'mnover here,\" he replied, his eyes had adjusted to the half-light andnhe could see her make her way to him. Edging her way over shentripped on some cabling and landed in his arms, her warmthnsurrounding him as he held onto her helping her to regain hernbalance. \" Thank you.\" She smiled up atnhim. \" My pleasure, now what was it younhad to tell me.\" Her smile faded, she removednherself from his space and walked over to his original resting place.n \"You may wish to sit down,\" she said. Sam made his way back and sat onnthe edge of the table that had served as his leaning post before. n\"What is it Josie? Nothing can be that bad can it?\" \" I lied to you, Sam.\" \" Everybody tells white lies,nJosie.\" He was thrilled that she had called him by his first name,nand it had felt good. \" This is no white lie, this isnmuch bigger.\" \" I'm listening,\" 'whatncould be so bad' he thought. \" I'm not seventeen, I'mntwenty five!\" Hengrinned, had she just said that, in one fail swoop had she just toldnhim that he had had nothing to worry about by being attracted to hernin the whole time that he had known her. \" Did you hear me?\" \" Yes,\"nhe nodded his head, still grinning from ear to ear, \"so, what's antwenty five year old woman doing in a high school.\" She grimaced, \"doing annundercover report.\" \" On me?\" \" No, I couldn't, they allnwanted me to … but I couldn't, the pin I threw on the floor was ancamera, my editor was trying to find a story so that he and Inwouldn't lose our jobs, he told me 'sex sells' and decided thatnyou and I were getting a little bit closer than we technically shouldnhave, being teacher and student.\" \" If you're an undercovernreporter, why were you wearing a camera?\" Sam asked, amused. \" This isn't funny, Sam.\" Shenlooked away, down-hearted. \"This was my first assignment.\" Sam realised he'd upset her,nplacing his fingers on her chin he moved her head around to face him,n\"I think you better start from the beginning.\" \" Ok,nI was a copy editor at the Chicago Sun Times, but dreamed of becomingna reporter. Gus, the Editor, had used five of my ideas, giving themnto other reporters, he felt I didn't have it in me to 'grab thenbull by the balls'.\" Sam sniggered, Josie continued, \"he maynhave been right. Anyway, Rigfort, the publisher, decided that thenSun Times should send in an undercover reporter to high school to getnto know about kids of today. He picked me because I was thenyoungest. I enrolled, I cut my hair, I made up my face, I worenbetter clothes and I came back to high school. Then I met you. \" Ingave Gus some ideas, one about an exposé on cafeteria food andnone about 'the court', which was scooped. Gus then decided thatnhe was going to follow my movements with the camera and I had toninfiltrate the popular kids. My brother, Rob, enrolled in highnschool too to help me get in with them. It worked. I pitchednanother idea about the girls taking worn clothing back to the shopsnto get refunds but nothing was good enough.\" Samnlooked at her nervously with the anticipation of what was still toncome. \"Over the last couple of months I have come to know a goodnfriend in you, Sam Coulson, you have encouraged me and enlightened menfrom the first time that we met. No one has ever given me that; no man has ever given me that. I was confronted by Gus two daysnago, we watched the tape of you and I discussing an application tonDartmouth, we were sitting on the benches at school before they werenmoved here, the day we nearly … well, Gus told me that you were tonbe my story. I told him no, that there was no way I was going tonexpose you for something you weren't. Unfortunately for both of usnhe had already pitched the idea to Rigfort and he liked it.\" Hurtnswept over Sam's features, how could she do this to him. Josienplaced her hand on his arm. \"Tonight, before I came here I wasnresolved in doing one thing, revealing myself to you. You see, therenwas no way I could have the man I loved depicted as something henwasn't, I would rather lose my job than see you lose yours throughnmy negligence and that of the paper I work for.\" Tears welled innher eyes as she finally realised her true feelings for this man. \" Younlove me?\" Sam asked, not caring about anything else that she hadntold him, a smile pricked the corners of her mouth, she nodded. \"Inlove you, Josie. I have for … I don't know really … and I knewnyou weren't seventeen, well hoped. No one could truly have knownnthe meaning of pastoral at that age and give its Latin origin,\" henteased. \" Younlove me? Josie asked, the tears that once had threatened now fallingndown her beautifully flushed cheeks. Sam leant in using his thumbsnto wipe away the tracks that had formed. He bent his head down,ntentatively touching her lips with his own; deepening the kiss whennhe felt they both needed it. His hands slid from their resting placenat Josie's neck to her waist pulling her closer to him, the gapnclosed further still when Josie's hands found their way around hisnback and pressed him against herself. He probed further using hisntongue to explore her mouth awaiting her response. It soon followed,nboth their tongue's languishing in the other's playful antics. Reluctantly, Sam pulled away onlynfully aware of where this course would take them both if they weren'tncareful, by god he wanted her but he felt sure that this probablynwasn't the setting that Josie would feel comfortable in. \"Josie,nhow on earth are we going to work this?\" \" I've been thinking, I could dona story on me, how I managed to turn geek into prom queen, that mightnbe enough to sort out that little problem, and once that's out Inwon't have to pose as a high school student anymore, will I. Maybenthen we can go on a date like a normal couple.\" \" That sound's good, how long amnI going to have to wait, Josie.\" \" Onlynfor as long as I have to continue to call you Mr Coulson,\" shenquipped. \" Wellnthen, Miss Geller, how about just one more kiss for teacher beforenyou have to go back and join your friends?\" Sam asked. \" Ok, Mr Coulson,\" Josie repliednsinking back into his embrace and allowing him to thoroughly kiss hernagain. He stopped momentarily to say \"Inlove you,\" against her lips before arresting them again beneath hisnown mouth. Whennthey finally finished Josie was then able to reply, \"I love you,nSam, you're my Adele penguin, my soul mate, I'm so glad I'venfound you.\" \" And I you,\" he responded. \" I better get back, before I'mnmissed.\" \" Yes,\" he watched as shenstarted to move back to the outside world, \"Josie?\" She stopped and turned to look intonhis green eyes, her feelings toward him ever so evident. \"Yes?\" \" Can I call you tomorrow?\" \" Yes,nI'd like that, my number's in the book. Until tomorrow then.\" \" Until tomorrow, my love.\" … Samnstirred from his dream, how was he ever going to forget her if hisnmind kept playing these tricks on him, how was he ever going to stopnthinking about those green eyes that he always managed to losenhimself in when they shone at him from over a book or down a corridornor across a room. He'd managed to do it with Lara, why could hennot now do it with Josie. 'Because you're in love with her'nthe voice in his head reasoned, well he could damn well fall out ofnlove with her couldn't he, after all that was what he was here tondo. 'She's your soul mate, Sam, you'll never forget, you'llnhave to forgive her sometime'. \"The hell I will,\" he shouted out,nangrily spitting out his words, \"the hell I will.\"[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: None of the characters ofnthe film belong to me.

Please keep the reviews coming. Chaptern3 Josienperched herself on the edge of her white wicker loveseat that sat innthe alcove of the bay window to her living room. Tomorrow would benher first day back at work for four weeks as Rigfort had insistednupon her refuge. \"Takenas much time as you need,\" he'd bellowed down the receiver thenfirst opportunity he'd had, \"don't come back until you'renwell. I need my greatest reporter fit and ready for her new weeklynfeature.\" She'd smiled at that, at leastnsomething good had come from all the pain and suffering she'dnendured over the past few weeks. She picked up the old copy of thenChicago Sun Times that had lain on her coffee table for as long asnshe had been home. It was dated the day after her humiliatingndisplay. She decided that this was now the time to read the storynthat would have been written after the fateful event had occurred. nShe flicked through the pages trying to find the follow-up, unawarenthat it had also appeared in the features section as her own had donenthe previous day. Her picture stared back at her, herngolden curls limp, her face withered under the increasing sadnessnthat she had felt at that moment, her eyes echoing the same feelings,na solitary tear trailing its way down her cheek as she stood at thenpitcher's mound awaiting the first real kiss she had expected andnnever received. She had put so much work into that meeting and whatnhad it all been for, nothing! Shenread the by line, 'Still Never Been Kissed' by AugustusnStrauss, Editor. Her eyebrows furrowed, what on earth hadnprompted Gus to write her story? ' In all the time that I have beenna newspaper man, I have never had the misfortune to be involved innsuch a story as the one that unfolded at the State Championship ballngame last night. ' One of my copy editor's,ncertainly my best, was relinquished from my safe office cocoon innorder to go undercover at South Glen South High School to ask thenquestion, \"What makes today's kids tick?\" ' Itnwas to be her first assignment as a reporter and after voicing mynconcerns that she would be unable to cope with the stresses andnstrains of what such a job entailed, she set out to prove me and hernpeers wrong. Over the last two months, on her own voyage ofndiscovery, she has shown me that she certainly does have what itntakes to become a great reporter, even though her path never cut thenstraightest route. She has become increasingly confident and hasnblossomed into a fine looking woman before mine and our colleagues'nvery eyes. And this has all been due to one man; she has shone fromnbeneath the affections and encouragement of her English teacher. Ifnonly he could have realised and accepted how she truly feltnabout him, as I and my publisher had to yesterday as we watched onnwith the rest of you in awe. ' Innmy attempt to cajole her into writing an unfathomable story about anman she so clearly loved, Josie Geller stood up to me and told mencategorically that she would never write an expose on this man. Hisnintentions toward her were clear from the hidden camera tapes thatnwere shown to the office everyday and I read more into them than Inshould, I am sorry. If he had known how old Josie actually was thennwe are all sure that this never would have been the inner strugglenfor him that it was plainly obvious he had. He believed he wasnattracted to a seventeen year old student and that was the angle thatnI wanted her to take. For whatever reasons she had, Josie wouldn'tndo it. No matter what the consequences to her own career and minenshe held fast, there was no way she was going to hurt a man for doingnnothing more than fall in love with her. ' However,nshe assured me that the story she would write would be a greatnone. And it was, a truly remarkable piece of journalism. Lastnnight, as Josie waited for her love to finally kiss her, I, mynpublisher, several colleagues' and thousands of Chicago Sun Timesnreaders waited with her to see if her dream would finally come true. ' Unfortunately, due toncircumstances known only to himself, Josie's teacher was unable tonmake the meeting of his life. I'm sure I am not alone in askingnwhy this was the case? Perhaps one day we will find out. ' Butnplease, through everything that has happened in the last twenty fournhours spare a thought for Josie, the wonderful, unselfish andnbeautifully caring soul that was more deeply hurt in the course ofnher 5 minutes of infamy than she could ever bestow on anyone innseveral lifetimes. For you, Josie, I write this piece. You havenopened my eyes to situations I never thought I could entertain and nonone I know has ever touched me enough to want to write about theirncause as much as you have. I would just like to say, because ofnknowing you my life's better for it. ' AndnI must now publicly apologise, for asking you to contemplate hurtingna man you so obviously cared about; for having you put your life onnthe line after revealing your most hurtful experiences because itnmeant that neither of us would lose our positions; and, as a result, nfor having to witness your life taking yet another turn for thenworse. I know that you thought this man was your soul mate. I onlynhope that at some point in his future he comes to realise whatnhe has done by not showing up and ultimately, what he has missed outnon. ' I,nAugustus Strauss, am totally responsible for all events leading up tonand including last night. I shall never nor shall I want to evernforget what I have done to this poor young woman in order to get anstory so wholly biased on my part in order to sell papers. A woman Indare to call a friend. I also hope that in time I can become anbigger person for my actions as I'm sure, Chicago, we can allnsafely say Josie Geller has done. I believe we are all in agreementnwhen I say, \"we love you Josie, our hearts go out to you this nightnand we are all so sorry that you have still Never Been Kissed!\"' Ansingle droplet escaped from her eyes, falling in a rivulet down hernunusually pallid cheek on its way to oblivion. It hit the articlenwith full force leaving its mark in the centre of the page. She couldn't believe what she hadnjust read, had somebody, such as Gus, actually taken the time tonwrite a piece about her that conveyed the true message of how she wasnfeeling. Only someone who cared for her would do that and thisnproved that at least one person did, well two bar her family. Anitanmust have asked him to write it in the first place. Shenlay back, supporting herself with a selection of her needlepointncushions; a hobby she hadn't been able to enjoy over the pastnmonth. As she screwed her face up with the realism of past eventsntears began lashing down as if a floodgate had opened. How manyntimes had she done that recently, she wondered, and how long would itncontinue for? She was fed up of crying, after all that was all shenseemed to do these days. Shenhad given up on going out for a while as her brief moment of fame hadnmade her instantly recognisable to nearly everyone that walked by. nThey were sweet though, passing on their sincerest best wishes fornthe future unaware that every time someone mentioned the whole horridnepisode it upset her. She tried being strong, it just didn't work. Shenhad no misconceptions about who truly cared for her, her brother wasnalways there giving his support trying to ease the situation with hisngoofy antics and encouraging her to watch him play baseball. \"Comenon, Joss,\" he'd asked her, \"this is one big game for mentonight, who would I rather have there than my big sister to cheer menon?\" It hadn't worked though; she had declined like she had onnevery other occasion that he had asked her. Anita,ntoo, had tried to get her to go out and let her hair down. But Josienwas determined, there was no way she was setting foot outside hernfront door until she was good and ready. She had felt such a fool,nbelieving that in fact, instead of everyone giving her their support,nthey were ridiculing her. How could she, once Josie Grossie, havensuch a man as Sam Coulson fall for her, what on earth had she beennthinking? But he had, hadn't he? Stillnthe tears fell, her mind wandering again over the events leading upnto and surrounding the fateful night she had stepped onto thenpitcher's mound and asked forgiveness of the only man she had everncared about. What had been his motive for not showing up? Was henthat upset with her that he no longer cared that she stood therendeflated in front of a crowd of thousands of well wishers andnbaseball fans alike? Somehow he must have seen her pain, felt it,nsurely? Whichnwas why she still couldn't believe he hadn't shown his face, hennow knew where she worked, surely after seeing her standing therenwaiting for him, alone, the picture of absolute depression, he wouldnhave made the effort to come and see her or call her even if it wasnall over between them. But it wasn't to be, she had tried gettingnin contact only to be told that he no longer worked at South GlennSouth and they had no forwarding address for him. She tried locatingnhim through contacts he had told her about at Dartmouth but to nonavail, he just simply couldn't be contacted. It was as if he hadnfallen off the face of the earth, falling out of her life as quicklynas he had entered it in the first place. Shenthought about her actions, she had hurt him first, hadn't she? Howncould he ever forgive her for what she had been cornered into doing. nShe had been obliged to follow a storyline that she had no intentionnof following, but also allowing him to believe that she could all thensame. She could see his charming face wearing an unusually painednexpression, his green eyes bleak as they endeavoured to find out thenreal Josie, could she really be the callous, manipulative person hennow saw before him but really believed she couldn't be. He'dnalready got rid of one woman like that, how he could be that stupidnas to fall for another just like Lara. Josie had lied to him and henobviously couldn't be with a liar. Josie decided that she may as well trynto get some sleep, going over old ground again wasn't going to helpnmatters considering that she had no way of having her say and tryingnto win Sam around. She had to forget, it wasn't going to be easynbut she knew that was the only thing that was left to do. She onlynhoped that when she did finally get to sleep that it would benpeaceful and relaxed, but in her heart she knew it wouldn't be, shenknew Sam would always find her there wanting her, loving her. Shengot up from her seat and padded her way across to the bedroom. Shenchanged quickly into the silky nightdress that Anita had surprisednher with before she had taken leave of her senses and taken to thenpitcher's mound. She may as well use it, she'd thought, even ifnno one special would ever see her in it. Besides it was morencomfortable than the cotton pyjama's and night gowns she had beennused to. Shenlay in the dark trying to spirit her demons away in order to relaxnfor long enough to get to sleep. \"Tomorrow is the first day of thenrest of my life and I am determined …\" she spoke out, \"determinednthat I will forget Sam Coulson and move on. To God only knows wherenbut I will do it.\" Her eyes became heavy and she relaxed furthernsleep enveloping her senses. Tomorrow was yet another day butntomorrow everything would change, she only hoped for the better. Itnwas six o'clock Friday evening when Josie finally had the chance tonsit at her desk on her own in order to read her second ever by line. nShe had had a busy week in all after returning back to work onnMonday, her copy had had to be in by five the previous day and afternhaving a troublesome start she had managed to set out her story in nontime at all. They had also asked her to have some photo's takennfor her feature and that had taken all day Tuesday. Deciding what tonwear and how her hair should be styled, and then having to posenwhilst the photographer took many pictures in order to get the rightnmixture of emotions on her face. The results had been stunningnthough, she never would have believed she was so photogenic or sonbeautiful. Anita had commented that her final picture choice wasngoing to break some hearts. Shenhad brandished her copy of the paper all the way from the printersnand as she began to unfold it she carefully placed the paper on herndesk, un-ruffling the corners and smoothing out the pages she wasnabout to read. The features section stared back atnher the headline at the top stark, 'Never Been Kissed – ThenUpdate' by Josie Geller, Features Reporter. Josiencould hardly contain herself, the thrill of knowing her story wasngoing to be read by so many people again overtaking her hurt andndispleasure in what she had had to report on on that particularnoccasion. ' Atnfirst I must take this opportunity to thank everyone for their kindnwords and thoughts that I have been sent or given over the past fewnweeks.' Josienquickly surveyed her office; she still had bags of letters and cardsnthat she hadn't yet opened, whilst others had been given homes onnshelving, filing cabinets and her desk. She continued to read. ' It is good to know that so manynpeople care about me and my situation enough to show me theirnkindness, and I am also very glad that there are some who have usednmy own misgivings to pursue their own happiness, making sure thatntheir loved ones know how truly special they are. ' I'mnsure that most of you are wondering what has happened, I too sit andnwonder everyday on how such a formidable part of my life could benstolen away from me so easily. I am sorry to say that although Inbelieved so readily in a man that I loved and accepted as my soulnmate, my knight has chosen to completely ignore my apologies andncontinues to stay away from my admiration. ' Asneach day passes the pain is ever so slowly ebbing away. I know Inwill never truly get over him and because of this I do not considernmyself a loser as I have done so readily in the past. To havenhad the opportunity to love such a man as I had in my English teachernand to know that that love would have been reciprocated had it notnbeen for my own incompetence is enough for me to realise that I wasntruly worthy of someone's love. I am certainly a better person fornhaving known him for the short time that I did and I understand thatnI'm not Josie Grossie anymore, that I may be loved by someone elsenin the future, but this is not for me. ' Afterntwo disastrous romantic relationships I believe that I should sticknto what I know. And I know this, no one person will ever be able tontouch my heart as I allowed my English teacher to once do and as anresult I will never have the hurt and humiliation that I have had tonendure since losing him. This may sound a little selfish but mynheart and soul are too fragile to be enlightened in such a way evernagain. I can never allow my heart to belong to anyone else and Inshall remain, 'Never Been Kissed'. ' Inthank you all, once again for your support and best wishes in the fewnweeks that you, Sun Times readers have known me. I am truly gratefulnand I hope that over the coming weeks that you will stay with me,nreading my new features column with me as I attempt to unravel andnreport on this city and its people as we all travel down the road ofnself discovery together.' Anita had been stood in the openndoorway of Josie's office waiting for Josie to finish readingnbefore giving her opinion. \"Josie that was wonderful, I bet MrnCoulson is kicking himself for ever letting you go.\" \"Thanks, but I should imagine he'snnever going to read it,\" Josie said miserably, then brightened,n\"Anita, it doesn't touch too big a nerve does it? I mean, I'vensaid what needed to be said without sounding pitiful or big headed,nhaven't I?\" \"No, Josie. Nothing you could evernhave to write would sound like that, your heart is too big!\" Anitanreplied, taking a seat opposite her friend. \"I, along with most ofnthe male population of Chicago, just wish that you'd reconsider then…\" she trailed off. \"PleasenAnita; I know what I'm doing. We've had this conversationncountless times,\" Josie started angrily, then she clamed, \"I'mnok, I will be fine, I like being on my own!\" \"So did Gus!\" Anita retorted, \"Nonone likes being on their own, we're not meant to be that way.\" \"Anita,nyou and Gus have something special, like I did with …,\" Josienlooked up at her friend seeing concern behind her eyes, \"I don'tnwant to talk about it, how's it going with Gus, by the way?\" \"Josie, he's remarkable, the morenI find out about him the more I love, we've been going out for fournweeks and everyday, well, he surprises me. It's actually quitensexy and when we eventually, you know, make love I'm sure its goingnto be incredible.\" \"It's going ok then, I'm gladnAnita, I'm happy for you both,\" Josie watched as Anita absentlynnodded and bit her lip. Thank god someone's life was going well. \"Talk of the devil!\" Anita saidnas she saw Gus pop his head through the open doorway. He took thenopportunity to smile at his new love before returning his gaze tonJosie. \"Geller, Rigfort wants to see younabout your article, have you got five minutes?\" \"Sure,\"nJosie said only too grateful of the chance to get away from herngushing friend. Not that she minded but it did remind her ofnherself, evoking too many bad memories in the process. Josie got upnfrom her seat and made the move out of her office. Worriedly,nAnita exchanged glances with Gus, he reassured her with his smile,nand Rigfort had obviously liked it too. Gusnand Josie strode into the boardroom taking two seats close to wherenRigfort was standing, wielding a squash racket in his hands as henspoke to his personal assistant on the speakerphone. They waited innsilence. \"So,nhow's my star reporter?\" Rigfort asked as soon as his previousnconversation had ended. \"Fine!\" Josie replied. \"That's good, good. You see whennI get Sun Times readers enjoying my paper I get all gooey inside andnI think we're onto a winner. This follow up story is well …ntruly remarkable, it conveys everything about your situation and I'mnglad you decided to write it and share it with Chicago maybe even thenwhole of America if it gets picked up. It must have been annextremely difficult piece to write though?\" \"Thank you sir, I just felt that itnwas all part of my job, having to finish off my story so that itnwould give other's hope. I might be at a low point but it's whatnthe people want that counts, isn't it?\" \"Yes, indeed!\" Rigfort shot out,ngrinning, \"so, what city issues were you going to tackle first?\" \"I don't know, I thought I'dnmaybe look into the utility suppliers of the city, see how much moneyntheir making even with staff cutbacks and increasing prices.\" Rigfort shook his head. \"Ok, maybe public transport, why sonmany of us still wish to use our cars to get to work rather than usenit.\" Rigfortnshook his head again, \"how about, 'how to win a gal's heart'.n Its not only sex that sells newspapers, its romance too.\" \"Mr Rigfort, no offence sir, but younhired me to be a features reporter. I hardly think that …\" Rigfort cut her off, \"Josie, leaventhe utilities and the transport to the mayor, we'll cover them whennthe need arises. You are the people's friend so be exactly that,nhelp other people to help themselves. They'll love you for it andnkeep coming back for more. Ok, I'm off for my squash game now sonI'll look forward to reading your next piece, Miss Geller.\" \"Sir?\" Josie managed, as shenwatched him almost run from the room. She turned to Gus, \"I'vengot to write another story I don't particularly want to write againnthen?\" \"Josie, unfortunately there arentimes when we have to do things we don't want to do and, to benhonest, your innocence will probably help in writing these pieces fornthe features page. \"My naivety, you mean!\" \"No,nyour innocence, Rigfort wants hearts and flowers and you are the right man … er woman … for this job.\" \"Ok, I'll try but I'm notnpromising.\" \"Inknow, Geller, but be rest assured I have complete faith in you, and Inknow Anita has too.\" \"Thanks,nGus; you don't know what it means to hear you say that.\" \"Oh, I think I do. And between younand me, I'm hoping that the advice you give out next Friday will benjust the right encouragement I need to show Anita some romance,nsomething I think has been severely lacking in her choice of men innthe past.\" \"I'm sure you don't need me tontell you what to do, Gus.\" \"No,\" his eyebrows arched over hisntwinkling eyes, \"well, we'll see won't we. Roll on nextnFriday.\" Josie giggled for the first time innweeks. The relationship that had developed between Gus and herselfnwas exactly what she'd needed, almost like father and daughter or anclose elder brother. She knew that if anything or anybody ever triednto hurt her again she would be able to call on him to help out, notnthat he wouldn't be in line anyway. She rose from her seat, \"I guessnI'll see you on Monday then?\" She announced still smiling. \"Aren't you coming to the ballngame tomorrow night?\" \"I'm off baseball at the moment,nGus\" \"Well, if you change your mind.\" \"Thanks,\" Josie exclaimed, \"Seenyou, Gus.\" \"Yeah,nbye Josie.\" Gus stared after her retreating figure, if only therenwas something he could do for her but he knew at the moment therenwasn't. He'd just have to wait, like the rest of them had to. nThey all had to wait for Josie to ask them for help. He got up fromnhis seat and sighed, at least he had Anita. He'd never realisednhow lonely he actually was until they started going out and now hencouldn't bear to be without her despite his many intra officenmemos. He was falling in love and he only hoped, whilst he made hisnway through the bullpen to meet her, that she was too.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: None of the characters ofnthe film belong to me.

Please keep reading and writing thosenreviews. Chapter 4 Samnhad finally been able to pick up the keys to his new apartment thatnmorning and his friend, Ben, had called over to help him move in. nNow,nas Sam had nearly unpacked his life again, he slowly and carefullynslit open the final packing case with the knife he had in his hand. nHe removed the first newspaper covered trophy from its six monthnstorage home and after unwrapping it and giving it a wipe over henplaced it thoughtfully on the shelving unit that stood in front ofnhim. He picked out another and another patiently giving each trophynthe same treatment that its predecessor had had, and smiling as eachnof his most treasured possessions took their place once more upon thenshelving unit that had not equally seen the light of day since thatnfateful night he had left Chicago. Engrossednin his work, Sam picked out another trophy from the box. \"What then…\" Sam jumped at Ben's sudden outburst, nearly losing hisnbalance. He set himself back on his feet and made his way through tonthe kitchen. \"Jeese Sam, when I said buy some beer I didn't mean lets get completely slaughtered.\" Samnchuckled, \"it's not all for tonight!\" He answered, \"some ofnit's for Sunday, when some of the family and my old friends fromnthe city come over to me see me. You're coming aren't you?\" nHe perched himself on one of the stools at the breakfast bar as henwatched his friend uncap a bottle and hand it over to him. He placednthe still wrapped trophy on the bar as he took a swig of thenrefreshing beer. \"'CoursenSam, I wouldn't miss it for the world.\" Ben said as his eyesnroved over the bar. \"What's that there?\" He questioned,npointing at the wrapped package. \"One of my trophies,\" Samnanswered. \"Notnthat,\" he motioned toward the picture on the newspaper wrapping,n\"that? It's that reported isn't it? The one that was leftnwaiting on the pitcher's mound.\" \"Ben, what are you talking about?\" \"God, Sam, where have you been? Didnyou not read the paper before you wrapped up your trophies?\" Henwatched on as Sam shook his head in answer. Ben explained, \"therenwas this girl, Joanne, no. Jessie, no. Josie? Yeah, Josie, Inthink. Well she went undercover to High School and fell in love withn… hey, what are you doing?\" Sam began carefully unwrapping thentrophy, taking care not to tear it before gently smoothing it out innorder to read the article that now sat before him. He looked up atnBen, who had been eyeing him quizzically. \"Could you do me anfavour,\" Ben nodded, \"do you think you could find the other halfnof this article whilst I begin to read this page?\" Henheard Ben find his way over to the trophy box whilst he began to readnthe article, slowly digesting every word that was printed before him,nbecoming more and more nauseous with each passing sentence. SilentlynBen reappeared holding out the other half of the article. \"Here itnis,\" he motioned as he watched Sam slowly lift his head and look atnthe other sheet before taking it from his friend. \"Are younalright, buddy?\" Ben asked, concerned. \"You're as white as anghost!\" Sam faltered, placing the second pagenover the first hiding Josie's bewitching green eyes as he did so. nHe began to read the continuation becoming increasingly depressed thenfurther he read. \"Oh god!\" He finally uttered. \"What's wrong, Sam?\" Ben askednof him again. \"Itnwas me; I was supposed to,\" he looked up at his friend, absently,n\"to kiss her!\" \"What are you going on about?\" \"Ben,nthis story, the man that Josie Gellar thought she was in love with,nthe English teacher, the one that she so desperately wanted to givenher her first real kiss that was me!\" \"Woah, slow down! I think you bestntell me from the beginning.\" \"Right,nit's March ok? Final semester for the seniors and the school getsna new transfer student, Josie Gellar, which is odd considering thatnwouldn't normally be allowed to happen. The first time I see hernin my class she's wearing the most ridiculous outfit for a 17 yearnold and white lipstick, but I find it so endearing …,\" he shooknhis head and smiled, he corrected himself, \" her sonendearing. Trust me; I fell over my feet that day. So, I'mnbeginning to wonder what angel from above had sprung this littlensurprise on me when I ask the class to define 'pastoral'. One ofnthe senior girls defines pasteurise, so I ask again! Josie sticks upnher hand, I motion for her to carry on and she not only defines thenword, she states where it was first used and about it's Latinnorigin. Now my mind is going crazy, there is absolutely no way a 17nyear old student would know that stuff, they don't teach it untilnstudents study English at college. So, I question her; only to havenher, somewhat nervously, declare that she is indeed 17.\" He lookednto his friend for encouragement to continue. Ben motioned that henshould. \"Overnthe next few weeks I ask her to read in class, it's such a joy tonlisten to her. We're studying Shakespeare's 'AsnYou Like It' andnthis girl is good. She knows all of the passages by heart; I mean, Inteach it and I don't know every scene word perfect. \"Inget her to read her essays too. At first I told myself it was so thenclass could listen and learn from some of the best pieces of writtennwork I have had the joy to mark in my life, but then I realise itsnbecause I just want to hear her speak and feel the passion of hernwriting through her own voice. I find myself leaving her work untilnlast so that I can spend the time reading over and over again to trynto ascertain her personality from her words and feel the emotions shenemits through her own hand. \"Thennwe had this fundraiser for the prom at Navy Pier. I'd been walkingnaround for ages, talking to students and joining in some of thengames,nwhen I see her. To be fair, I had been looking for her for so longnthat I wasn't even aware I was doing it, and when I saw her, mynmouth went so dry and I could've sworn my heart stopped beating forna second.\" He blushed at his own admission. \"I hear one of thenfair carnies shout 'Lonely ride in bucket 5, single' and I watchnas Josie forlornly and quietly asks if he really needs to shout itnout, he says that he does. \"BeforenI know what I'm doing, my feet quickly cross the distance to wherenJosie is, my head only thinking of Josie being on that ride on hernown. I don't even think about what it could do to my career ifnanyone else read anything more into my actions. I hand over mynticket and take the seat next to her, I'm even oblivious to thenfact that I am now sitting in a chair on a Ferris wheel; scared ofnheights as I am. \"Thenride starts and that's when I get nervous, but she soothes me,ncalms me down with her kind words and by touching my hand with hernown. My mind wanders because of the proximity to her and I start tonbabble about Lara, trying to bring back some kind of sense to all ofnmy actions and reactions. I even say something about guy's liningnup around the block for her when she's my age, all the whilenwishing I could bite off my own tongue because all I want to say isnthat I want to be the only guy lining up for her. \"Overnthe next few days I get to see a different Josie, one that is morenconfident and radiant. She's begun to look and dress better, hernclothes fit better, her hair is straighter and her make-up isn't sonjarring any longer. She also seems to be warming up to me, as well. \"Shenbecomes involved with the prom committee, to which I am facultynadvisor. We're painting the sets and man, when we're alone wenbegin flirting with one another, getting more paint on ourselves thannon the sets.\" Sam stopped momentarily fleetingly thinking aboutnwhat could very nearly have been had they not been in the situationnthey had been in, a faint smile touched his lips as he absently shooknhis head, he continued. \"We've then got to decide upon the musicnto be played at the prom and blow me if we can't even be thatnserious about that either. Two days before prom and we're atnschool sorting out final props and getting everything ready beforenit's moved over to the country club. We start to talk and I swearnif it weren't for the sudden wake up call I gave myself, I wouldnhave kissed her there and then. I realised I was falling in lovenwith her. \"Thennight of the prom arrives, I'm there early as I need to go over anfew things and run through the running of prom court with one of myncolleagues. I'm ready early and I patiently wait to see herndressed up. Finally, she arrives with the most popular boy. Theynare all supposed to be famous couples and they turn up as Rosalindnand Orlando from 'AsnYou Like It' ,nI can only imagine that was actually her idea. She looks sonbeautiful, wearing a pink gown with antique lace around the sleeves,nthe bodice fits her frame so perfectly and her hair is up and pinnednaway from her face. It's the first time I've been able to seenthe full extent of her lovely neck and all I want is the chance tonkiss and caress it. I'm resolved, I have to tell her sometime thatnevening how much I admire her. \"Finally,nI get the chance I've been waiting for. She's alone and I makenmy move. I tell her there's something I need to say to her, shensays the same and pulls this pin from her bodice, wings – she'snworn it for as long as I can remember; she throws it on the floor. nJust as she's about to tell me whatever it is she wants to say, shennotices most of the popular crowd are about to make a fool out of hernfriend, Aldys. She comes to her rescue, very honourable of hernreally, she becomes angry with the popular kids for their actions,nthrows her crown on the floor and tells them, well, us all actually,nthat she isn't 17 she's 25 and an undercover reporter for thenChicago Sun Times. \"I'mndumbstruck, I can't believe what she is saying and I can't bearnany of it any longer. I find my feet and quickly find my waynoutside, making my way to the sunken garden to find a quiet spot andncontemplate what I've just heard Josie say. Not 5 minutes laternand she's outside presumably looking for me, but I can hear someonenelse too. A man and he's telling Josie that Gus is going mad aboutna lost feed and 'had she got anything on Coulson yet?' \"Shensays 'no', finally noticing me as I get up from my seat and turnnto face her, her 'friend' quickly leaves. She's nervous andndespondent,\" Sam laughed, \"as am I, she says \"surprise\", Insay, \"what? Surprise your doing a story on me? Or surprise I wasnallowed to be attracted to you? She says she couldn't do the storynand asks if I was attracted to her, and I shout at her and impressnupon her that she had just been setting me up. I mean, I can'tntrust her now and I sure as hell don't have any idea what is goingnon her head. I leave, telling her 'I can't look at you in thensame way', after she tries to console me and try to make me see hernsense, but obviously at that point I don't have any. \"Andnnow I read this story, six months after the actual event I get tonread a story that was written entirely for my eyes and mine alone andnI read it too late. I've stupidly allowed myself to believe thatnJosie Gellar was one of those self-important, uncontrollablenreporters that didn't give a damn what they wrote in order to getncirculation. Quite clearly, after reading this,\" he motioned tonthe newspaper before him, \"I was wrong! \"Thenmost stupid thing of all though, the night I moved out of Chicago wasnthe same night I got caught up in all of that traffic on it's waynto the State Championship Ball Game. If only I'd known Josie wasnwaiting there … for me, then this would all be different now.\" \"How exactly?\" Ben asked, afterntaking in all that Sam had just told him. \"Well, Josie and I would be togethernfor a start.\" \"Maybe, you would be, maybe, younwouldn't!\" Ben ascertained. Realisation struck Sam, like a knifenin the heart, \"Oh god, I should've been there, what the hell didnI put Josie through, the hurt she must have felt, the humiliation,nwhat have I done to her?\" \"Sam, don't beat yourself up. Youncouldn't help it if you didn't see the article, as far as younwere aware she was a conniving lying reporter who was doing her bestnto use you as a basis for a story that didn't exist.\" Ben lookednat the worried face of his friend. \"If it helps, I know there werena couple of follow up stories, maybe you could get copies and seenwhat they had to say?\" \"Yes,nthanks Ben, that's a good idea. They normally have copies in thenlibrary,\" Sam mused, \"I'll take a look tomorrow! But for now Inmust finish these last few bits off. Thanks again, Ben.\" Samnhad been given time off work in order to move and took thisnopportunity to go to the library in order to see if there were anynmore stories that did indeed follow on from Josie's originalnarticle. He asked the librarian where he would be able to find thenback issues of the Chicago Sun Times and was directed toward one ofnthe computers. The librarian clicked open the folder with thenarchived newspapers and Sam was then able to select the first papernfrom the day of the original article. Hensearched the navigator to find the page he was looking for and surenenough, once he opened the page Josie's eyes were staring at himnfrom beyond the screen. He shivered inwardly; she still had anneffect upon him. He had tried so hard over the past six months tonforget her but she still invaded his dreams. The more he tried thenmore he was taunted until finally he gave in to the realisation thatnhe may never be able to forget the one woman that had left a verynlasting impression upon his life. However, after all the feelings ofnhurt and dejection he had experienced since Josie's outburst he hadnfinally been confronted with the knowledge that she had always beenntrue to him. He had hurt her so badly and because of that she maynnever want to see him again but if anything could give him annindication of that then hopefully some answers may lie in thenarticles he was hopefully going to find. Henopened up the following day's paper hoping that there would bensomething in there relating to Josie's own article but afternsifting through he couldn't really see anything. He noticed ansearch box at the top right of the screen, he wondered if he couldnuse that to find her, he typed her name in and hit 'search'. Thenresults took their time but he was soon presented with a fair list ofnarticles that would have taken him a while to get through. He lookednaround hoping for something to help him; he found another boxnentitled 'search within'. He typed in the word 'kissed.' nHitting search again resulted in another lengthy search but finallynit processed a smaller list of only three articles. He read the textnavailable for the first and realised that that related to Josie'snoriginal text. He clicked on the second. The paper opened it's pages as Samnlooked on, not knowing what to expect as the first thing he caughtnsight of was Josie's utterly distraught picture as she had stoodnwaiting for him to come to her, obviously having realised at thisnpoint that he wasn't going to be joining her. His heart cracked,nhe reached out his hand touching the visible tear as it seeminglynmade its way down her cheek. \"How could I have done this to you?\"n He whispered. He read the by line – 'Still NevernBeen Kissed, by Augustus Strauss, Editor'. So this was Gus, hernboss. He started to read through the paragraphs becoming more andnmore distressed himself at what he had done and to what extent. Shenhad laid bare her soul, put her life on the line and she'd done itnall for him. And he in return, even though he had no knowledge ofnit, had done nothing but hurt her more than any words could expressnfor the second time in her life. He remembered that a third article hadnbeen shown in the search results and quickly navigated his way tonthis final article. This was once again written by Josie and wasnprinted a month or so after the original events, he noticed. It wasnher update. Henre-read it several times finally sitting back in his chair andnabsently wiping his now moist eyes. He really was a piece of work. nHe couldn't believe he could have caused so much damage to onenperson by not giving her one chance to explain her actions and ansimple explanation at that. He'd single handledly torn out hernheart and left a diminished Josie in his wake. He had managed tonwreck another person's life, which had only happened to be thenwoman that he found himself deeply in love with. Now he knew henreally did have problems. Evennbefore he had seen Josie's article thenprevious evening he was still able to believe that Josie Gellar was andeceptive, cruel miscreant that worked for one of the largestnnewspapers in Chicago. Now, he knew that she was nothing more thannthe truly remarkable woman he had met back in March when she hadnentered his life with a bang. \"Sir, are you alright?\" Thenlibrarian asked, trying to bring Sam out of his reverie. Henlooked up at the woman, a mild mannered, white haired, spinster andnmomentarily saw Josie as her, realising that this was the kind ofnlife that was meant for Josie if he didn't do something aboutnbridging the ever widening gap between them. \"Yes,nI'm fine,\" he answered, knowing damn well he wasn't but notnwanting to alarm anyone. He had to find a way of getting close tonJosie again, to make her realise what she meant to him and that hencouldn't satisfactorily go on with his life without her. But hownwas he going to do it? He didn't have a clue.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: None of the characters ofnthe film belong to me. Synopsis: Josie waits for hern'penguin' to kiss her at the State ball game, only to find thatnhe doesn't turn up. Five years later she's invited to the promnreunion, will she meet him again? And if she does how will her heartnreact? A/N: Thank you again for keepingnreading and writing those reviews! Chaptern5 Josie's life was perfect, or asnclose to her idea of perfect as she could achieve. She owned her ownnapartment, she paid her own bills, she had wonderful friends and shenhad the perfect job. The only thing she didn't have was a man. n'Who needs a man anyway,' her motto dashed through her thoughtsnloud and clear, 'I'm resolved to be on my own, I'm happy withnthat.' But she wasn't, admittedly evennafter 8 months of pitiful loneliness she still couldn't get SamnCoulson out of her head when she had the time to sit down alone andnthink. She had taken on a new role after the events that had lead upnto that fateful night, as friend and confidant. She spent much ofnher free time meeting with people and playing out her new over activensocial life. Anita had also refused to yield andnhad sent many an admirer Josie's way as and when Anita felt thenneed to do it. Not that Josie really minded, she was able to getnsome of the attention she craved before sending all the willingnsuitors packing with a flea in their ear for their trouble. And today would be no exception innkeeping herself busy. She'd met up with Kristen, Kirsten and Gibbynat the mall with the express intention of enjoying some well earnednretail therapy and those girls made shopping trips an absolute dream.n She'd bought herself some new outfits and underwear to match, evennthough she knew that she would never allow any man close enough tonher to see her in them but feeling that she deserved to own them justnthe same. She was then to meet up with Aldysnthat afternoon and take a trip to the cinema. They met in the mallnfood court and sat down to eat. Chatting was easy with Aldys, itnjust seemed so natural for Josie to talk to her friend with easenabout any subject they decided to undertake. Half an hour passed innno time at all as they idly nattered. \"So Josie, what have you been upnto?\" Aldys asked. \"Nothing much, Aldys. Actually, thenhighlight of my week has been going shopping this morning with thengirls!\" Aldys chuckled, \"you're stillndoing that?\" \"Yeah, why not? I mean, I know I'mnnot supposed to be dressing up like an older version of an 18 yearnold anymore but they do have some good suggestions for me and it isnfun.\" \"Well, I suppose as long as you'renenjoying yourself!\" \"And talking about enjoyingnyourself, how are you and Guy getting along at Northwesternntogether?\" \"Oh, ok. You know, he's been sonwonderful lately but I still get this nagging feeling that the onlynreason for it is because we're the only two people who went toncollege knowing one another.\" \"I'm sure that's not entirelyntrue, Aldys. I'm sure there are plenty of people there that you donactually know.\" \"Yes, you're right but it justnseems like it. He's been serenading me and leaving me these notesn… just about everywhere I've been.\" \"What kind of things does he say?\" \"He asks me how my day has been andnwhen I seem unhappy he asks me if anything is wrong and if I'm ok!\" \"Maybe true love is blossoming!\" nJosie said, nudging Aldys' arm, \"so, how do you feel about that?\" \"I really don't know? I know he'dnbe good for me; well, I think we'd be good for each other. He'dnhelp me understand life a little better and I'd help him withnMath.\" She giggled. \"But are you attracted to him? nAldys, relationships are born from attraction you know?\" \"Yes, I know and I am attracted tonhim, I guess I always have been. We've known each other for asnlong as I can remember and haven't really seen eye to eye for atnleast that long. But he's still popular and I'm still Aldys. nGoing out with him probably wouldn't be a good idea what with promnand all, not that he's asked me anyway.\" \"You don't think he was involvednwith the dog food fiasco, do you?\" Josie asked not believing thatnGuy had been. \"No, I'm certain he wasn't, innfact I've asked him about it on many occasions and he's alwaysnsteadfastly denied it. We've become good friends and I wouldn'tnwant anything to change that even if it means I get more as a result.n But like I say, he hasn't asked me and I'm too scared to asknhim!\" \"You know, Aldys, sometimes you havento take chances, although it doesn't always work and as you know Inam a prime example of a chance that didn't work out, but you'llnregret it if you don't find out. And you may be pleasantlynsurprised, he may even say 'yes'. Then you'll be thinkingnabout why you never took the chance earlier on.\" \"Yes, I suppose, he can only give menone of two answers can't he?\" Josie nodded, \"yes, he can. Aldys?\"n She looked to her friend, \"I'm scared too.\" \"Of what?\" \"I'm scared of being completely onnmy own for the rest of my life. Even Rob's got someone now. Insometimes feel like a freak.\" \"So why don't you take a chancenwith one of those guy's that Anita's always sending your way?\" \"You know I have my reasons andnuntil I can forget then I'm never going to be able to pick up thenpieces and move. I'm still not even sure I want to. This hasnhappened to me twice, I'm under the impression that I'm not fitnfor romance. Besides, this is about you not me, ask him, I'mnpositive he'll say 'yes'; go on a date and see what happens,nyou never know you may even enjoy it.\" \"Maybe?\" \"Come on, Aldys. You are the mostnconfident person I know. Take a chance, you're young enough. nYou're also intelligent and beautiful and Guy has obviouslynrealised this.\" \"Or he's playing another sicknjoke?\" \"Do you really believe that?\" nJosie watched as Aldys shook her head. \"He's not at college withnanyone that would influence him in that way is he?\" \"I know you're right, but …\" \"No buts, Aldys. Grab the bull bynthe horns; I'm sure it will all work out for the best.\" \"Yeah, it's not like I've got tonact like Anita either is it?\" \"No, and to be honest I think takingnyour time is a bigger turn on for worthy suitors, if you know what Inmean. Just enjoy yourselves, that's the main thing.\" \"But what about you, Josie? We'renall concerned for you; Anita said she felt like you were using thenwhole Mr Coulson scenario as an excuse to stay guarded and unhappy.\" \"What?\" Josie spat out, angerncrossing her features, \"she did, did she?\" \"Josie, I'm sorry, I didn't meannto upset you. I thought she may have said as much to you otherwise Inwouldn't have mentioned it.\" \"Why would Anita say anything to menabout Sam Coulson, she'd know better than that?\" \"I don't know Josie, although shenmentioned he'd been around to your office looking for you. Henfound Anita instead whilst on a mission to find Gus, he put two andntwo together realising that she wasn't in fact Pam Kitterman,\"nAldys giggled, she looked to Josie watching a smile tip her lips. nAldys went on, \"Anyway, he asked if he could explain himself andnended up telling Anita about why he didn't make it to the ballngame. He wanted to speak with you to put his side across and henhoped that in time you would forgive him but Anita wasn't convincednby what he had told her and told him politely to go aware and neverndarken your door again. She told him that words couldn't expressnhow the whole situation had affected you, how much you'd been hurtnand he was better off staying well away, that you didn't need him. nApparently he was adamant that you be told he had been there butnAnita told him that that wouldn't be possible. Josie, are you ok?\" \"Not really, Aldys. How do you knownall of this?\" \"Anita let it slip last time I wasnin town, when the three of us went out. You were in the toilet ornsomething and she just blurted out that Mr Coulson had been to then'Times' building looking for you. She pleaded for me not to tellnyou but I told her that I would if she didn't. I didn't want tonbetray her but I didn't want to betray you more either, I felt younneeded to know. Anita is biased, she just saw how hurt you were andnwanted to protect you; I, on the other hand believe that you need tonmake a fair judgement on what he actually had to say.\" \"Thanks, Aldys, I appreciate yournhonesty, it's just a shame that Anita seemed to think she knew whatnwas best for me.\" \"Don't be angry with her Josie,nshe only did what she thought was right.\" Josie's features softened, she tooknAldys' hand in her own, \"I know Aldys, thank you, but I am goingnto have to ask her about it?\" \"I wouldn't have expected anythingnless, Josie! Now, shall we go catch that film?\" Some hours later, Josie decided thatnnow was as good a time as any to confront Anita, the situation needednto be resolved and it would be better sooner rather than later. Shendrove the distance to Anita's home and saw that the living roomnlights shone brightly signifying that she was indeed home. Josienparked up, switched off the engine and got out of her car. Shenquickly walked the short distance to Anita's front door and knockednloudly. She wasn't surprised that the door was opened by Gus, andnshe felt that what she had to say to Anita would be better heard bynboth of them anyway. \"Josie? This is a surprise! Wouldnyou like to join us for dinner, I'm sure Anita has made enough ifnyou'd like to join us?\" \"Hi Gus, thanks for the invite butnto be honest I'm only going to be here a short time. Thanks fornthe invite though.\" \"My pleasure, come in, come in. nAnita is in the kitchen, come on through.\" \"Thanks,\" she followed Gus throughnthe hall into the kitchen. \"Hi, Anita!\" \"Josie, hi! What brings you aroundnat this time of night? I thought you were meeting up with Aldys.\" \"I did that already and she had someninteresting news.\" \"Oh?\" Anita asked, nervouslynlooking between Gus and Josie. \"What was that?\" \"Oh, just a little tale about SamnCoulson visiting the office.\" Josie watched both Gus' andnAnita's reaction to her remark. \"I see even Gus knew before me,nhey Anita.\" \"Now, hold on a minute Josie, Anitanonly did what she thought was right.\" \"Did you feel the same way then,nGus?\" Josie asked, \"did you also feel that I really shouldn'tnknow about something that could affect my life either one way or thenother? Did you also feel that I was too fragile to handle the news?\" \"No, Josie. To be honest I askednAnita to tell you … but she was resolute, you know what she getsnlike!\" \"Thank you, Gus. So why Anita, whyndid you keep this from me?\" Josie turned to look her friend in theneye. \"Because his lies were best unsaid,nJosie. You really didn't need to know them.\" \"But surely that was for me tondecide, not you, Anita. Now tell me everything, I want to knownexactly what was said.\" \"Josie, I …\" \"Anita? You're supposed to be mynbest friend, tell me what I want to know. I'll decide how to dealnwith the information if you don't mind!\" \"Ok, but lets sit down, would younlike a drink?\" \"No, I'm fine,\" she followednthem into the living room and took a seat opposite her friends. Shenwatched Anita take Gus' hand for support before she started to tellnher story. \"Sam turned up at the office about 7nweeks ago now, I found him wandering around the bull pen asking allnand sundry where you're office was and then asking if they knewnwhere you were. He recognised me from school and asked what my namenwas as it obviously wasn't Pam, I told him and asked that he follownme into my office. I sat him down with a coffee and asked him whatnhe thought he was doing turning up six months too late, I asked himnif he hadn't hurt you enough. He said he was aware of how much hisnnot turning up must of affected you and asked that I listen to hisnstory in order that I could then convey it to you. I let himncontinue. \"This is what he told me. He feltnbetrayed and unwanted by the one person that he thought he couldntrust and decided that it would be better for him to move away andnleave his position at South Glen South than to ever have thenmisfortune of meeting with you again.\" She looked at Josie, tryingnto ascertain whether she had tears in her eyes or not. She carriednon, \"he felt that his heart would be unable to resist your charmsnif he ever came into contact with you and although he still feltnsomething for you, he couldn't let you into his life again as henfelt he couldn't trust you. The night your article was printed andnyou put yourself out on the pitchers mound was the same night hisnstuff was being put into storage and he moved out of Chicago to hisnparents' lake house up state. He said he got caught up in all ofnthe traffic going to the state ball game but never had anyninclination that you where there waiting for him. \"A few days before he found himselfnin the 'Times' building he had been moving into his new apartmentnthat he had taken close to his new school. He was busy unwrappingnthe trophies from the last box he had left to unpack and he stoppednfor a break with his friend. His friend noticed the article, yournarticle, wrapped around one of Sam's trophies and pointed it out tonhim asking him if he knew about the girl that had 'never beennkissed'. He replied that he didn't and as his friend started tontell him your story he realised that he was talking about him and thenfact that Sam hadn't gone to kiss you. Sam then said he carefullynopened up the first page and as he began reading got his friend tonfind the other page so that he could finish your story. Guiltnoverwhelmed him and he tried to make his mind up over what to do, hisnfriend said that there were follow up stories and that he'd bestnread them first before deciding what to do next. \"The following day he went to hisnlocal library and found the other stories. He read them and realisednthat he had made the most catastrophic mistake that he could havenever made. He said that he needed to explain everything to you sonthat you could make an intellectual decision about what to do withnthe information he had imparted to me. He said that even though henhad moved 50 odd miles away he could never forget what you did to himnand how much he cared for you, loved you. He only hoped that youncould forgive him at least, if nothing else. That was it; he told menthat even though he tried to put you out of his life you were alwaysnthere, in his thoughts and dreams. He asked that I tell you but Incouldn't Josie, you'd been through so much, I didn't think itnwas right to burden you like that.\" \"So you decided instead to tell mennothing, he probably thinks I hate him. How could you, Anita?\" \"You believe his story, Josie?\" \"I have absolutely no reason tondoubt it, how can you not believe it?\" \"Because I know men, I know whatnthey're like.\" \"No, Anita, you know some men. Butnneither Sam nor Gus are painted with the same brush as most of thenmen you have ever known, Sam could never lie to me, not that itnmatters. It's too late now I can't do anything with thisninformation even if I wanted to, he'd never listen to me. Younknow, Anita, I thought you were my friend, but I don't know what tonthink now. I do think though it's probably best if we steer clearnof one another for a while as I don't think I could be around younat the moment.\" Josie got up from her seat. \"Thank you forntelling me, I appreciate that Anita but I'm going to go now. nGoodnight both of you, I'll see you at work.\" And with that she turned on her heelnand was gone, leaving Gus to console the shuddering body of Anita asnshe cried in his arms.[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: None of the characters ofnthe film belong to me. Synopsis: Josie waits for hern'penguin' to kiss her at the State ball game, only to find thatnhe doesn't turn up. Five years later she's invited to the promnreunion, will she meet him again? And if she does how will her heartnreact? A/N: Thank you again for keepingnreading and writing those reviews! Chaptern6 Monday's were always strange days,nand since Josie's return to high school she had found itnincreasingly more difficult to get out of bed on such a morning andnsort herself out. And today was no exception, hitting the snoozenbutton forcibly she turned on her side and surveyed the empty mass ofnbed that lay to her left. She'd slept fitfully all weekend,nvisions of Sam Coulson pounding a relentless beat in her head everyntime she managed to get to sleep only to be woken buy some turn ofnevent in her dreams that would leave her feeling wretched andnultimately exhausted. Absently reaching out with her right hand shenstroked the fabric of the sheets that should have enveloped hernlover, but she had to keep reminding herself that those events werennever destined to happen. Or were they? She remembered hernconversation with Anita from Friday night and realised that maybe shencould live with the hope that something could be done if only shencould find out exactly where Sam now worked. Deciding that she wouldnmake that her first job of the day she quickly pulled herself fromnher bed and went to shower. After half an hour she was ready to gonand noticed that the light was flashing on her answer machine. Shenhit the play button, if it were something important she'd betternknow now than leave it for later. The machine cut into her reverie,n\"Hi Josie, it's Cris from the publishers. Look, everyone here isnreally excited about how your book is shaping up, the cover sleevenhas been designed and I have another cheque advance waiting for you,nif you could pop by today sometime then that would be appreciated. nGive my secretary a call and give her a rough time on when to expectnyou, Ciao Bella!\" Josie made the mental note and leftnfor work. Arriving at the 'Times' offices early she began tonwonder how long she would have to keep on trudging the same oldnroutine. Her book, 'Re-sitting High School – The memoirs of annundercover reporter', was about to set the world's book chartsnalight with her stark autobiography of self discovery. And althoughnit was seen by some of her family and friends as a ploy to gain morencredibility of her worth to the world she saw it as an outlet to letnpeople truly understand her and offer help and encouragement to thosenwho needed it. After all, she was starting to get fed up withnwriting about ordinary day to day hearts and flowers on a weeklynbasis; she wanted to write about things that people weren'tninterested in in the newspapers unless corruption or scandal wentnhand in hand with it. She would have her meeting with the publishersnand then take the rest of the day to decide what she was going to donabout her job. But first she had to see if she could find Sam. When she finally negotiated the bullnpen to her office she was met with a sight that she wasn't quitensure she believed. Flowers in vases and balloons had been placednaround the office as if she had come back from a lengthy spell awaynin hospital, she was expecting to see a 'welcome back to work'ncard on her desk when she noticed the small lilac envelope in thencentre of her desk. She snatched it from its resting place andnquickly opened it. She began to read. Dear Josie I am so sorry for the way I actednupon the information that I was given by Sam, but I honestly didn'tnbelieve what he had to say at the time. However, after closernconsideration and having a lengthy chat with Augustus I realise thatnI may have read his intentions incorrectly. There were moments ofnclarity in his words and sometimes I could see the look of regret innhis eyes, at one point I even thought he was going to cry but thatnwas more because I said I wouldn't be passing his message on tonyou. I was blinded by my love for you and for that I apologisenagain. Please forgive me but I'll understand if you can't, Inbetrayed your trust in me and for that I realise I must be punished. He left some contact details withnme: Cell: Chicago-555-7896 School: SE Wisconsin-555-2379 I hope you can track him down andnthat you find at least peace with him. Your loving friend Anita Josie had to admit it; at least Anitancame up trumps when she needed to. But which number to phone. Josienfelt a little self conscious about using the cell phone number so shenwould ring the school number, then she would be able to find outnwhere he was working and meet up with him face to face, it seemednbetter that way. She dialled the number and after three rings thenphone was answered by a chirpy receptionist, \"Good morning, SalemnCentral High, how can I direct your call?\" Josie realised that itnmay have been an act of cowardice not to talk to the pleasant lady onnthe end of the phone but she replaced the receiver, she didn't neednher call directing anywhere at the present time as she now had annidea of where he was working. She opened up her laptop and flickednthe 'on' button. The computer hummed as it sprang into actionnand as soon as it was booted she opened up the internet connectionnand opened the search engine page. She typed in the school name andnthe school's webpage came up top of the list. Clicking on it thenschool page opened and she was able to find the faculty listing. Shenlooked under English and sure enough his name was there. Tentativelynshe opened his page, checking around to make sure none of her actionsnwere visible to any of her colleagues, and she hoped that Sam wouldnnever become aware that she was now looking at his handsome features.n She had to admit, he looked a little older, and maybe theirnsituation had worn him down as much as it had her, but he stillnlooked good. She reached out her fingertips to caress his face,nrealising it could never make up for actually touching the physicalnbeing. Her heart skipped a beat and she knew then that she stillnloved him; no mean feat of trying to forget could ever take away thatnfeeling. They were two separated halves of one love and they needednto reconcile, she was sure of it. She made her silent vow; she wouldntake a trip to see him within the next couple of weeks and try tonmake amends. But first she had to worry about her book. Picking up the receiver again, shendialled the number of the offices of her publisher. \"Hi, Katie,nit's Josie Gellar? … Yes, hi. Do you think it's possible fornme to come in about 2 pm? … Sure, great, well, I'll see you allnthen. Bye!\" Josie sat back in her seat and turnednto look out of the picture window of the city she called home, todaynwas going to be a good day after all. Josie had mumbled to Gus about havingna late lunch on her way out of the building, she didn't really wantnhim to know just yet of her plans keeping the information about hernbook a secret from everyone in the office. She would do it laternwhen she had finally decided what to do overall. She entered the plush grey marblednentrance lobby to the publishers and made her way across to security. \"Ah, Miss Gellar, they are expectingnyou on the third floor in the board room. Someone will meet you fromnthe lift.\" He handed her a security pass and motioned that shenshould put it on. Still reeling from the shock of thensecurity guard knowing exactly who she was, Josie walked across thenlobby to the bank of elevators, pushing the button and patientlynwaiting for any of the six lifts to arrive, she didn't have to waitntoo long. Stepping into the waiting lift she pushed the requirednbutton and she was on her way quickly up to the third floor. Shenalighted and was met by Katie who just as promptly ushered her intonthe elegant boardroom with its panelled walls and carpeted floor. \"Josie, Hi!\" Cris met her and airnkissed both of her cheeks. \"It's so nice to see you again,nyou're looking well!\" \"Thank you, Cris, I'm feelingnbetter. And hopefully more so when this meeting draws to itsnconclusion.\" \"Of course, well let's make anstart shall we? Would you like a drink before we continue?\" \"Um, yes, thanks. A coffee please,nKatie, white no sugar. So where shall I sit, Cris.\" \"Anywhere you feel comfortable, wenwill work around you.\" Josie made her way over to a smallnarea by the window that had been set aside for more informal meetingsnand took a seat in the middle of a mammoth black leather sofa. Crisnjoined her balancing dust jacket designs on his knee. \"Shall we look at these first? Wenhave three designs,\" he leant them all against the glass coffeentable that sat in front of them. \"Which of these most depicts hownyou want people to see your book?\" \"Well, to be honest, I haven'tnreally thought about how I want people to perceive the book,\" shenlooked quizzically at Cris before turning her attention back to thendesigns, \"but I don't like that one, I mean I know we seem to bengoing retro with everything these days but that looks like an oldn1950's cover.\" \"Ok, that one is gone,\" with anflourish and a wink of his eye, Cris had throw the design behind thensofa narrowly missing Katie as she walked around to place downnJosie's cup. Josie smiled at Katie in apology; Katie took it inngood humour. \"If the truth be known, we didn't like that oneneither, did we Katie?\" Katie nodded her indignation at the nowntrampled on board behind them. Josie was now left with two. One hadna picture of a young woman sitting at a desk wearing a lettermennjacket and a pair of high heels waving a ruler around her head withnher right hand and holding a reporters notebook in the other. Thenpicture was confusing and Josie didn't really know what thenphotographer was trying to achieve when he had taken it or thendesigner when he had chosen it. The other was a picture of Josienstanding on the pitchers mound looking hopeful that her Englishnteacher would come and rescue her. A picture from a time that wouldnbring back so many hurtful memories for both herself and Sam but alsonone that most of the world would know after her story had been pickednup by every major news agency in the world. She gazed at Cris andnthen back at the pictures. \"Unfortunately for me, I think that thenone with my picture on is the one that most people are going tonrelate to, Cris. Don't you?\" \"Yes, I have to agree, I do believenthat your existence on the front cover will be the tool to drive thensales of your book better than the other two. I'm sorry that itnmay cause you more hurt by seeing it everywhere for a while but I amnsure that as time passes the pain will ease.\" \"I'm sure you're right, Cris. nAnd I'm sure the royalties will allow me to find solace in a placenthat has no book shops.\" She giggled. \"Yes, Josie, at least you still havenyour wit. This also brings me onto the next piece of good news, yournadvance. I have been talking to the publishers and they are agreednwith me, as there has been much anticipation about your book I have anbankers draft here for you in the sum of $50,000.\" Josie's eyes widened with the amountnthat she thought she'd heard Cris mention. \"I'm sorry Cris; Incould've sworn you just said $50,000.\" \"I did, here it is to look at if youndon't believe what I say.\" He handed her the draft, she read thenfigures over and over not quite taking them in, her hands shooknnervously as she held onto the tiny piece of paper that was to changenher life completely. \"Is that enough to see you through the nextnfew months until your first royalty check arrives.\" She merelynnodded. \"Cris, I know this may sound cheekynbut how much am I expected to get then from each months sales.\" \"At least that, Josie, every month. nI actually have a projection here if you would like to take a look.\" \"No, that's absolutely fine. I'mngoing to be quite rich then?\" \"Yes, we anticipate that you willnbecome a very wealthy woman from your story, Josie, and I am gladnthat it is going to such a worthy young woman. Now, sadly, ournbusiness for today has come to an end. Would you like Katie to getnyou a driver so that you can get that money put into your accountnstraight away,\" Cris asked, seeing that Josie was still looking atnher check, \"or would you like to take it home and frame it fornposterity.\" Josie looked up at him, \"sorry, Injust can't take it in. Thank you for your kind offer and I willntake you up on it. Goodbye, Cris.\" \"Ciao, Josie. See you soon!\" Josie looked fleetingly back andnsmiled her thanks to Cris once more before finally leaving thenboardroom. Even though it was a bitterly coldnafternoon it was bright with the January sun and Josie decided tonwalk the short distance between the bank and her office. Her pacenwas slower than usual with no real sense of purpose, 'but then whatnwas the need' she thought, 'it's not as if I have to go back tonwork.' She rounded the corner of the 'ChicagonSun Times' building and made her way through the revolving doors,nfinding her way to the elevators as if she were on auto pilot. Shenrode the lift to her floor and casually made her way into the bullnpen. She walked the short distance over to Gus' office and knockednon the door frame, \"Could I have a word?\" \"Of course, Josie,\" Gus said as henmomentarily looked up from his knitting. \"What can I do for you? nIs it about Anita? You know she's really upset?\" He askednputting the knitting on his desk, getting up from his seat and movingnaround the desk to perch on its edge. Josie closed the door behind her andnwalked into the centre of the room. \"As far as Anita is concernednI am far from forgiving her just yet, but …\" Josie put up hernhand to stop Gus from saying anything more on the subject, \"I willnsit down and talk with her, take her for coffee or something, try andnmake her understand how I feel about everything that has happenednover the last eight or so months. I have something else that is verynimportant to me. I have a book being published in the next few weeksnand they are expecting me to busy with it, book signings andninterviews, etc.\" \"You want time off? What's thenbook about anyway?\" \"Don't get angry Gus but a littlenwhile ago, after my story went national, I was asked to write aboutnthe whole undercover, falling in love with my teacher, having himnwalk out on me without listening to me and then being left utterlynbereft of the one thing I wanted most in the world scenario. Atnfirst I didn't want to know but after I read through the journals Inwrote at the time I realised that even though it damn well hurt atnthe time, well to be honest it still hurts even now; I realised thatnit was a good story. People could take it as either fact or fiction,nwhatever their choosing. So I began to write my memoirs, Jacobeannpublishing took the book on and today I have chosen the cover andnbeen given a large bankers draft advance.\" Josie took a seatnopposite her boss, \"the thing is Gus, I don't just want time off,nI want to give you my notice.\" Gus was dumbstruck; one of his bestnreporters was asking the unthinkable of him, \"you really want tonleave? I thought you loved it here?\" \"I do, Gus, well at least I did, butnthe job that Rigfort is having me do is not what I grew up wanting tondo. I wanted to write well constructed and researched pieces ofnjournalism, instead I'm writing the stuff that really someone likenAnita should be conceiving. I'm done Gus, my book will make moneynfor me that I never dreamed I would be able to make and quitenhonestly if I'm going to write stories about love and romance I'dnrather do that within a novel than in a newspaper.\" \"Oh god, what am I going to do? nRigfort is going to do his nut when he finds out that you'renleaving!\" \"Gus, he'll think it's a badnidea for about 5 minutes and then move onto the next poor sap, asnwell you know. I'm sorry if this puts you on the spot but I wouldnlike to leave as soon as my piece for next Friday is done, do younthink you could do that for me.\" She watched as Gus pulled one ofnhis faces and rubbed his hands through his hair, he shook his headnand exhaled deeply, \"I'm sure Sally would love to fill thenposition, she's been anchoring after it ever since Rigfort gave menthe job.\" \"Yes, I'm sure she would. Well …nurm … ok, yes Josie, of course, I'll work things out here withnRigfort and everything; do next Friday's piece from home if younlike, e-mail it to me and include something in your piece about yournbook, I'm sure Rigfort won't mind a bit of free advertising. SonI guess it only leaves me to say … good luck!\" \"Thank you,\" Josie exclaimed,ntears beginning to prick the corners of her eyes. She got up fromnher chair, closed the short distance between herself and Gus andnhugged him, taking him totally by surprise. She planted a kiss onnhis cheek before drawing away as quickly. \"Thank you,\" shenwhispered again. \"My pleasure,\" Gus said, decidingnthat he really only wanted the best for the young woman that hadnbecome his friend just months before. \"Just do me a favour!\" \"Anything\" \"If, for any reason, you want toncome back, come and see me, we'll sort something out.\" He sawnher nod her acceptance. \"And Josie?\" \"Yes?\" \"Please try and make things up withnAnita, she's already miserable at the way she hurt you so readily,nI'd hate to see her state worsen just because she thought she'dnlost your friendship as well.\" \"I'll try Gus; I'll phone hernnext week and invite her out. Look after yourself Gus and look afternAnita too, for me as well.\" \"I will Josie,\" he took her into anbear hug. \"Don't be a stranger, hey?\" She pulled out of his embrace,n\"Never,\" she returned. She waved her hand and made her way tonher office to collect her things. 'Oh yes,' she thought, 'innall the bad days I've had to cope with recently, today was a veryngood day.'[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: None of the characters ofnthe film belong to me.

Ben noticed. \"You never did tell menhow your trip to the city went?\" \"I didn't think there was muchnpoint considering I didn't get the opportunity to speak to her.\" nSam looked back toward the TV and the ice hockey game that he had nownlost interest in. \"Sam, it looks to me like you neednto tell me something but you're not sure if it's the right thingnto do, what happened?\" \"Nothing, Ben. Josie wasn't therenso I went looking for her boss only to be confronted by a woman I metnbriefly at South Glen. I mean, she introduced herself to me as thensex education counsellor when in fact she worked in the same place asnJosie. Anita was her name, had something to do with writing thenobituaries. \"I asked her if she knew where Josienwas, she replied she didn't not that she'd tell me if she did. Intold Anita that I had to see her, had to tell her my side of thenstory and why I hadn't turned up; the fact that I hadn't seen hernarticle until I moved into my new apartment, but this Anita wasnadamant that Josie wouldn't want to see me and hadn't I thoughtnI'd hurt enough. I tried to reason with her, plead my case but shenjust wouldn't listen or believe anything I had to say.\" He said,nexasperated. \"I asked if she would pass on the message but shensaid she wouldn't. I gave her my contact numbers but as I've notnhad any response from either Josie or any of her friends I wouldnimagine Anita never passed them on either. \"I know when you and I spoke aboutnthis before I said that I would give her the space so that she camento me if she wanted to but how can she do that if I don't even knownif Anita has spoken to Josie or not? I really don't know what tondo?\" \"Does this Anita woman seem the typento cave in?\" \"No, to be honest I think she andnJosie are extremely good friends and so Anita doesn't want to seenher hurt anymore. That or the fact that she has told Josie and Josiendoesn't actually ever want to see me again; but I can't believenthat, Josie is far too generous a person, she'd come and speak tonme I'm sure, even if we didn't resolve anything.\" \"Sam, I don't know what to tellnyou buddy? Maybe this is all for the best. Please don't look atnme like that, maybe you do need to face facts that she may never wantnto see you again, you've said twice now that you'd give her spacen… let her have it. If the two of you are meant to be then fatenwill intervene and make it happen.\" Sam got up from his seat and movednover to the window watching the first flakes of the latest snow stormnfall. \"Ben, it wouldn't feel so damn wretched if I didn't lovenher so much.\" \"I know, bud, and if she loves younas much then this will all work itself out but it may take a littlentime. You have to prepare yourself for that.\" Sam turned back to face his friend, \"Inknow, I'm just impatient to be with her, to show her I how I feel,nyou know?\" Ben nodded. \"Talking of which, are you excited aboutntomorrow?\" \"Sam, I still can't quite believenthat you talked me into playing in this match against those hoodlumsnyou call students.\" \"Ben, its for charity … and itnwill be fun.\" \"What, watching me skate around onnmy arse for most of the match, being kicked and punched by five 16nyear olds.\" Ben raised his bottle in the air, Sam obliged him byntapping it with his own. \"Until tomorrow then.\" Sam laughed heartily and Ben could donnothing more than join in. \"By the way,\" Sam started, \"mynsister will be at the game tomorrow.\" \"Great, here I am trying to impressnher with my wit and charm and at the game tomorrow I'll make anlaughing stock of myself, thanks Sam.\" \"My pleasure, Ben.\" Sam teasedn\"You know I never thought you were good enough for her anyway.\" \"Well any chance I had will be wellnand truly scuppered by the end of the game, I'd honestly say you'vendone this all on purpose.\" Sam feigned hurt feelings but a smilencrept over his features, \"Maybe.\" They were all shattered, 'maybe thisnwasn't such a good idea after all,' Sam thought, \"Come on guys,nwe're being murdered out there, I think it's about time we gaventhem a taste of their own medicine.\" \"Yeah, go Sam!\" Tony Redman thenhead coach said with absolutely no enthusiasm. \"I know I trainednthese guys but they don't normally run on all of their 4ncylinders.\" \"Then what is the point?\" Samnasked, \"we may as well give up now then. I'm ready to do that ifnyou guys are?\" \"Sam's right,\" Ben said, \"Inmean I know I've been beaten black and blue by the little … butnwe gotta get back into this game, theoretically we can still win it!\"n The group nodded. \"So are we all in?\" Sam askednputting his left gloved hand into the middle of the bunch. The restnof the guys joined him and their pact was made. \"Then let's gonget them.\" They skated out onto the ice and whennthe whistle was blown and puck thrown down they went at it with allnguns blazing managing to pick up the points they needed to beat thenstudents by two clear points by the final whistle. Celebrations ensued both on and offnthe ice and when they had finally showered and got ready for theirncelebratory drink in the local bar most of them were met by theirnpartners at the players entrance of the rink. Sam saw his sister andngrabbed hold of her taking her into the biggest bear hug he had givennher in ages. \"Did we do good, sis, or what?\" \"You did great, but if it hadn'tnhave been for that pep talk you gave them all then you guys would bengoing to the bar to commiserate not celebrate. Well done, Sam.\" \"Thanks Al,\" he kissed the top ofnher head, \"and thanks for coming, I appreciate it even though ancertain someone probably didn't, if you know what I mean.\" Theynboth looked toward Ben who was still nursing a couple of his bruises,n\"Do you know I think he may need a bit of TLC, why don't you …\"nSam trailed off. \"What's up?\" Alison asked,nunlocking her arms from around him and trying to find what it wasnthat had caught her brother's attention so fervently. Sam moved away from her, \"give me ansecond Al, I could've sworn I just saw Josie.\" \"Josie? The reporter?\" \"Yeah, look I need to go check, staynhere I'll come back to you, ok?\" And with that he was off in thendirection of the school parking lot. Ben walked over to the abandonednAlison, \"Where's he gone in such a hurry?\" He asked. \"He said he needed to checknsomething out, said he thought he'd seen Josie!\" Alisonnanswered. \"Said he'd be back though, wanted us to wait for him. nSo how are you feeling?\" \"Sore! Everywhere! Including thenvery tip of my nose!\" Alison's eyes began to twinkle,n\"well maybe there's something I can do to help, hold still anminute.\" Standing on tip toe she was able to lean in and gentlynkiss him on the end of his nose. \"Is that better,\" shenwhispered. \"I think I've just died and gonento heaven!\" Sam shot off in the direction of thenparking lot and rounded the corner, running at break neck speed henwas sure he'd be able to catch the woman up that he thought hadnlooked like Josie. Not that he was entirely sure, the woman he hadnseen definitely had Josie's beautiful figure of that he was surenbut her hair was different; longer, straighter and more of a goldennbrown. But as he'd noticed her looking in his direction justnmoments before her eyes had pierced right through his soul and thatnwas the reason he had for leaving his sister stranded outside thenrink. Not that that would bother her at all, she'd just startnchatting to Ben and he knew that Ben would not let any harm come tonher. Ben respected Sam too much for that, let alone having beennmadly in love with her since Sam had taken him home one summer fromnUniversity when they had first met. He stopped by the main steps andnlooked around, desperately searching for anyone that resembled thenwoman he had just seen but to no avail. He started to run up andndown the lanes of parked cars but still no one. Just as he was aboutnto give up he noticed a silver Le Sabre coming toward him, his eyesnsearched through the windshield trying to ascertain whether thendriver was male or female ever conscious of the face he was lookingnfor. He managed to make out the face of a female as she starednforward concentrating on the road ahead, not once did she look atnhim. As she passed by he caught sight of her profile, even behindnher dark glasses disguise he could tell it was her, he called out,n\"Josie, wait. Josie, please wait.\" Had she heard him? Hencouldn't tell and if she had she never flinched or moved tonindicate exactly that. Grief swept over him in a tidal wavenand he found himself on his knees bunched over on the tarmac, hisnpalms pressing on the cold surface as tears stung his eyes and fellnaway from his cheeks to the ground waiting beneath. From somewherenbehind him he heard his sister and Ben shouting his name, henacknowledged them with a whimper. Soon they were with him, one eachnside trying to get him to his feet, attempting to soothe him withnwords of encouragement and leading him away from the scene of hisndespair. \"If you two don't mind, I'd like to go home,\" henmanaged, forcing a small smile although his anguish was stillnevident. \"I really don't feel like celebrating. Could younapologise to the guys for me, Ben?\" \"Of course, Sam, no problem. Willnyou be ok getting yourself home.\" \"I'll be fine,\" Sam said finallynfinding his feet and making his way across to his car, \"take Alnwith you, look after her.\" \"You have my word, buddy. Mind you,nI reckon she might be the one looking after me later.\" Sam smiled and shook his head,n\"whatever. I'll talk to you both tomorrow.\" Ben and Alison stood together watchingnSam as he drove off leaving them alone. \"Do you think he'll benalright?\" Alison asked. \"No, anything to do with that woman,nJosie, and he's a complete wreck. He'll tell us otherwise, ofncourse, but I'm sure he believes he's missed out on the love ofnhis life and is being made to suffer for not seeing her article andnturning up at that damn ball game.\" \"I didn't realise he had it sonbad.\" \"I don't think he did until henread her report, six months too late. We've got to do somethingnbut now isn't the time or the place. He has to learn to forget hernor he's gonna end up going insane if much of what just happenednhere today happens again.\" He looked at Alison and sighed, \"We'venjust got to be there for him when he needs us.\" After a shortnsilence Ben asked, \"so shall we go and celebrate?\" He held hisnarm out for her. \"Yes, lets.\" She said taking thenproffered arm. \"Lead on, Ben.\" As soon as Sam arrived home hentelephoned the school to let them know that he wouldn't be in for anfew days blaming the hockey match by saying he had received a crackednrib for his trouble. He knew Tony would cover for him. He felt destroyed, his world had beennslowly falling apart ever since he had read Josie's article and hadnbegun to believe that it probably would have been for the best ifnhe'd never seen it. 'At least that way I would've had thenopportunity to start again.' He thought. He carried the two packs of beer henhad into the kitchen and placed all but one into the fridge. Henhadn't eaten since dinner but he no longer cared. All he wanted tondo was drink, by drinking he could forget for a while and hopefullynwake up feeling better about the situation after the bender he wasngoing to go on. Although he already knew in his heart it wouldn'tnbe any different. He sat in his armchair trying to makensense of everything that had happened but not quite managing it. nDespite being furious with himself for letting his emotions show,ntears began to flow freely down his cheeks, his body convulsingnrhythmically with his erratic breathing pattern. It was obvious henhad never felt true love before as it had never been like this withnLara, he could swear he could feel his heart cracking with each sobnthat leapt forth from him. He called out into the deafening silencenthat surrounded him, \"I love you, Josie Gellar, why won't younforgive me?\" Utterly miserable he let his body donwhat it needed to do until sleep took him from the exertion of itnall.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: None of the characters of the film belong to me. Synopsis: Josie waits for her 'penguin' to kiss her at the State ball game, only to find that he doesn't turn up. Five years later she's invited to the prom reunion, will she meet him again? And if she does how will her heart react? A/N: Hi everyone, and thanks for reading. I will be getting to the story of the new prom shortly so please bear with me. I hope you're all enjoying it so far. I know its not my best work but I watched the movie again last night to gain some inspiration so I hope it pays off. Chapter 8 Josie woke early on Monday morning. She had wanted to write her last piece and make sure it had been finally edited before she sent it over to Gus, enabling him to only read through and print it. There were things she had wanted to do and for that she felt she needed an early start. She had made a morning appointment with her hairdresser, followed by a couple of hours with the beautician to do her nails and make her up for a magazine interview and cover shoot. She again considered that it might all be in vain as there was absolutely no indication that they would even run the feature seeing as the book hadn't even hit the shelves yet. However, they had called her and she had no option but to do as they bid. Besides a bit of pampering never hurt anyone. It certainly made up for the rough weekend she'd had. Saturday had seen her make her way over to the Salem Ice Rink, after an advertisement on the school website had caught her eye. There was to be a charity hockey match between the students and faculty, and knowing Sam's love for ice hockey realised that he would probably never miss the opportunity to play. When she entered the ice rink, along with the throng of crowds, she took a seat opposite the team boxes feeling sure that she would go unnoticed, at least for the time being. Who knew what would happen once her book hit the shelves of virtually every bookshop and stand throughout America let alone the English speaking World? As the two teams flooded out onto the rink she scoured the taller half looking for anyone that would ultimately be familiar to her. A shout of his name, from somewhere to her left, indicated him to her as he turned around to face the young woman and wave at her. Josie's heart somersaulted in her chest, her breathing quickened and her eyes took in all that they were allowed to before he skated off the ice and into the box. He was skating as often as coach would allow, and as he was easily one of the best players the coach had then that meant that Josie could enjoy watching his athleticism and prowess with a mixture of delight and jealousy. Jealousy directed toward a dark haired woman that continuely called out his and another man's name. Another man's name? She diverted her attention momentarily toward her, yes she was definitely directing her calls to more than one of the team. Josie smiled, relaxed back into her seat and continued to watch and enjoy the game. As they neared the end of play she noticed Sam taking charge, hustling with the other guys trying to get them to play harder, faster, better in order that they could actually get the two points they needed to win the game. She thought him fearless as he retook the ice and floated as gracefully as any figure skater, seemingly toward her. She grinned, fancying that his smiles were for her as play resumed and the faculty managed to do what they had set out to, win the game and keep their pride. As the crowd filed out, she held back. If she waited then maybe she would catch him, have the pleasure of speaking with him again, understand what it was that had kept him away from her that fateful night that in her mind still only felt like yesterday. She hurt from seeing him again, from being so close to him but it was like a dull ache now, the kind that never goes away. She found a spot near the entrance awaiting his appearance until she overheard a conversation between a couple of the parents. They mentioned another exit, one that all the players were using and so she followed them, holding back to find a view point. She watched as a few began filing out, parents commiserating students, faculty being congratulated for a fight well fought. Then he appeared, his sandy blonde hair still a little wet from the shower he'd obviously had. She took a few steps forward, maybe she could take this as the opportunity to go up to him and ask him about his conversation with Anita. She stopped again. Looked down. She was being stupid. There was no way that he would want to see her now, was there? It had been two months since he'd been into the city. She looked up again, her feet now firmly rooted to the spot as she took in the sight before her, she was still a little far away to hear the conversation but she knew that that dark haired woman meant more to Sam than just a casual acquaintance. There was no disguising the pleasure in his face as he held onto her, his arms firmly clasped around her body. Josie watched in horror as he kissed the top of her raven head, the chatter so easy between them as if they'd known each other for ages. It was then that he looked up and his eyes found Josie's, piercing through to her very core. She shuddered, losing her confidence rapidly. She turned on her heel and ran, thanking herself for putting on the lace up boots with no heel. It took very little time to get to her car but it seemed to take an age to open it and get in as she fumbled for her keys around the bottom of her bag and after dropping them twice onto the tarmac she managed to click the switch for the central locking and get in. She found her dark glasses in the pocket of her door and put them on, hoping that they would give her some sort of disguise should she drive past him. As she turned the corner she saw him wandering up the aisle towards her. He stopped and waited, intently looking through the window at her as she passed him. She kept stock straight, even as she passed, although a quick look in her rear view mirror enabled her to see him shouting her name and asking her to stop. She drove on, unnerved by her reaction to his being with another woman, was it ever going to stop? And it hadn't got much better then, tears flooded her eyes and she had to pull over several times in order to calm herself before feeling that she was actually up to the drive. She called her brother but he was out, probably with the new female gym teacher that had recently arrived at South Glen South High. She tried Aldys, but no luck there either. One of the girls in Aldys' house suggesting that Josie try her cell phone, as she was 'out with that guy from her old school again'. There wasn't even any point trying one of the girls, it was Saturday, there was no way any of them would be home. There was only one person left to try that she had ever trusted, and Josie hadn't quite forgiven her yet. But she needed to speak to someone and Anita would have to do. She punched in the speed dial and let the phone ring. \"Hello?\" \"Josie?\" \"Yes!\" She snapped. \"What's up?\" Josie sighed. \"I need to talk to someone.\" \"You'd best come round then.\" \"Is Gus there?\" \"No, he went out for a beer with some of the guys from work.\" \"Good,\" she whimpered, her emotions brimming over from everything that had happened. \"Anita, I'm sorry. It's no good, I'm just going to go home. Don't worry about it.\" \"Josie wait. Listen, I know what I've done is absolutely reprehensible and I am so sorry but I am still you're friend, even if you don't think I am. I love you as if you were my own sister and maybe I should've thought about what you would've wanted but I honestly thought I was doing the best thing for you by sending him away.\" \"I know,\" Josie uttered miserably. \"And after what I saw tonight you probably had good reason.\" There was a short silence, \"why? What happened?\" \"Can I come around?\" \"Of course you can, where are you?\" \"I'm just on my way back from Salem?\" \"What were you doing there? No don't tell me now, I'll see you when you get here.\" After driving the last 10 miles in a dreamlike state, Josie pulled up outside of Anita's and she gently pulled her fragile body from behind the steering wheel. Gradually, she made her way up the path only to be greeted by Anita as she ran from the house and down the path to meet her. A steadying arm went around Josie's shoulders, virtually dragging her through the front door and into the warmth of the living room. \"Josie, forgive me for saying this, but you look like shit. What on earth has happened?\" She allowed Anita to tend to her, pulling her from her coat and scarf. She felt the boots come off her feet and then her gloves before Anita's hands cocooned hers, one by one, in order to breathe some life back into the icicles that represented her fingers. \"I feel like shit.\" Startled by the outburst, Anita ran off into the kitchen bringing back with her two large mugs of creamy, sweet coffee. Josie gladly took one from Anita and wrapped her hands around the ceramic. Bringing the mug to her lips she drank heartily, sensing the trail of hot liquid as it flushed down her throat. \"I saw him.\" \"Him?\" Anita questioned, knowing what the answer would be but hoping that it would be different just the same. \"Sam, Anita. I saw Sam. When I got the truth from you the other day about his coming over to the office those few months back I thought that maybe I could hope that he would want me. I suppose I took comfort in it a little. So, after finding out where he worked and that there was to be a charity ice hockey match this evening, I went over there hoping that we could at least meet up as friends and talk.\" \"So what happened?\" Anita asked, anticipating the worst. Josie began to relate her story to her, she told Anita of how happy she'd been watching him, the jealousy toward the girl with the dark hair, the game and how close it was. Then the tears welled and fell again as she then told of how she'd seen him, his arms around the girl, kissing her head and after when he'd seen her and followed her into the car park. \"Josie, you didn't even stay to find anything out?\" \"I couldn't. I was so shocked by his being with that other girl that I just couldn't stop myself running away. And once I'd started I couldn't stop.\" \"But that girl could've been someone else's girlfriend.\" \"He was a little too familiar for that.\" \"Not if she was his sister or another relative, Josie?\" \"Rob is never that way with me.\" \"That's not a bad thing,\" Anita hesitated, \"especially considering that he told some of the guys at high school that he slept with you.\" \"He did what?\" \"He was trying to make you sound cool.\" Josie giggled, \"oh!\" She bit her lip. \"Do you really think she could've been related to him?\" \"Why not? It's not as if you know anything about his home life, is it? The pair of you never really got that far.\" Josie covered her face with her hands, \"stupid, stupid. How could I be so God damn stupid, Anita. I've done it again, I've let him slip through my fingers once more.\" She sighed, \"what am I going to do?\" Anita shrugged her shoulders, \"you're asking me after the mistake I made?\" \"Anita, you're still one of my best friends, despite that, and to be honest I've always thought you to be sensible of what I should or shouldn't do. I love you, Anita,\" she hugged her friend, \"I'm sorry for before. I understand why you did it and I forgive you.\" Tears rolled down over her cheeks. Anita started crying as well, \"thank you Josie, you don't know what it means to me to know that and I promise that if Sam Coulson ever asks me to pass a message on to you in future then I'll do it, regardless of what I think about it.\" \"I don't think that will happen, somehow.\" \"Josie, if he was calling your name and wanting you to stop then he'll want to try and contact you. Perhaps you should call him.\" \"Perhaps.\" Josie intimated. \"Hmm.\" Anita pulled away. \"I know what that means. That means you won't.\" \"No, on this occasion it means I might.\" Anita nodded her head, \"ok, whatever. You should take the chance.\" \"And looked what happened last time?\" \"Only because he wasn't aware of what you were expecting of him. What we were all expecting of him.\" \"You believe him then?\" \"After what you've told me tonight, yes. I think that there has just been a series of incidents that have deigned to keep you two apart. You're both hurting. And I think that when you, in particular, do decide to go and do something about it you allow your courage to falter when you should be standing up against it and fighting for what you believe in.\" \"You're right, I'll phone him tomorrow.\" And that's exactly what she did do, leaving it to a decent time to phone on a Sunday morning. At precisely nine am, and before she had time to think about it too much and allow her courage to falter again she picked up her cell phone and called him. But it wasn't Sam that answered, it was a woman and from the tone of the voice it was the same woman that she had seen him kiss the night before. 'But you may have the wrong number,' her mind argued. \"Hi,\" Josie said at length, \"is Sam there?\" \"Yes, I'll just get him,\" said the female voice on the other end. Within seconds he was there, \"hello?\" His gentle voice ran through her body and tingled at every nerve ending. \"Hello?\" He asked again, and then much softer, \"Josie?\" That was enough, she couldn't handle it any longer. Defiantly she hit the 'end call' button and switched it off. How could he? After only showing up at her office two months previously how could he now so easily forget her and take up with someone else. Unless he'd never been sincere, but that just wasn't possible, for Sam was a true gentleman with absolute sincerity. He must have just assumed that she was no longer interested and decided to start again. For the rest of that day Josie hibernated. Both Rob and Aldys returned her calls from the previous evening but she was in no mood to go over old ground. After several hours of weighing up all the possibilities and the inevitable upset that each one caused she finally gave way to the day and from exhaustion rather than need, fell asleep. On waking, she finally resolved that she would make a new start herself, Sam Coulson was no longer on the agenda. After her appointments that Monday morning she decided to make sure that he would never be able to contact her again, especially considering the amount of missed calls that she had received from him over the course of twenty four hours. She also conveyed her news to Anita, who sighed heavily. \"And for God's sake, if he should turn up at the office again, please don't tell him anything. I think its best that we both make a clean break. And this time, I don't want to know either Anita, is that understood?\" \"Perfectly,\" Anita's heart weighed heavily for her friend and thought the move disasterous but instead of giving a voice to her opinions she let it die along with Sam's memory. If this was what Josie wanted, then this was what she would get. Josie decided that she would enjoy her day the best way that she could. She did her interview, posed for the photographs as directed by the photographer and she saw her publisher, who introduced her to one of his friends, Simon, and a literary agent to boot. She was on the cusp of her new career and she was going to damn well enjoy it. It was about the only thing in her life that was left to enjoy anyway. *********************** \"So, Josie,\" her new agent asked, \"how does it feel to be famous?\" \"Give it chance Simon!\" The smile she gave him warm but shy. \"The book has only been out two weeks.\" \"Yes, but with the coverage you've had from the American press with more to follow, you're name is going to be on the lips of every intelligent romantic person in this country.\" His British accent lilted over the words, \"and who knows, if what Cris tells me is true, then you're book is going to not only top the charts here but also in Britain, Australia and New Zealand. And then the world will be on its knees, bowing to your every whim.\" Her eyebrows arched, \"hardly!\" \"The public will love you, you'll be up there with Mother Teresa and Princess Di. I have one question though? Have you honestly never been kissed?\" \"Is it so unfathomable to you, Simon that I have chosen to keep well away from love and romance?\" \"How honest do you want my answer to be?\" \"Totally honest.\" \"Josie, you are one of the most beautiful women that I have ever had the pleasure to know,\" he simpered, \"I find it horrifyingly devastating that you have never experienced that kind of joy.\" \"Joy?\" \"Yes, joy. When you kiss someone for the first time, the expectation you feel, the butterflies in your stomach, the fervour, the heat, the passion that wells. It all adds up to a joy that we all experience from a first kiss and then from the wanting of feeling it again. I fully intend to make sure that you experience this before you die.\" \"Oh, yeah. And who exactly is going to deliver this kiss to me?\" \"I'm hoping that you will allow,\" he stopped, trying to gauge what her reaction would be to him, \"... allow me to be your first.\" \"Simon, I'm very flattered but ...\" \"What?\" He asked incredulously. \"... you're my agent. I do not intend to share my kiss with a man that has the means to break me if he so chooses to.\" \"Josie, you are going to be my star writer. Why would I ever consider severing ties with the woman who has the means to make me very rich? I might ask,\" he continued, \"what it is that makes me so unappealing to you?\" 'You're not Sam Coulson,' her mind cried out, she shook her head to clear it. \"Simon, it's not you, I'm just not interested. My heart has been severely hacked to pieces by two men and I just don't think I could last a third time.\" \"And the man in your book, the one you waited for at the ball game?\" \"He stands even less chance,\" she heard herself say, although she didn't quite believe herself. \"If he ever decided to walk back into my life then I could only ever consider him a friend, I will never ever consider him boyfriend material again.\" She smiled, but it was forced. A man wearing headphones indicated that it was time for her to go on. \"Ok, let's do this,\" she smoothed down her skirt and her hair, as her face was quickly checked by the make-up girl and walked onto set to rapturous applause. There were definite drawbacks to being famous and having to explain yourself in front of a studio audience, whilst millions of others watched you from their homes, was definitely one of them but if this was going to sell her book then what choice did she have? From the sidelines Simon fiddled with the handkerchief in his jacket pocket. If there was one thing he was going to make sure of it was that he was going get Josie Gellar into his bed. He realised it might take a little time and that he was going to have to spend some money in order to get her, but that was nothing compared to what she was going to do for him. He was going to make millions from her; he would have her, make her his own and then drop her after he'd had the best books and years out of her. He walked out of the studio before taking the phone from his pocket and dialling the all too familiar number. \"Hello Geordie, its Simon ... roses? You read my mind ... Where are they going? ... Room 1274, Renaissance Hotel ... yes that's right ... Many thanks ... It's a pleasure doing business with you.\" He looked up at the hoarding on the side of the building, \"Oh, Pacey, by the time I've finished with her she is going to be more famous than you, but perhaps with a bit more notoriety.\" The wide grin that then plastered his face would've put the Cheshire Cat to shame had they ever been seen side by side, but as he sauntered back onto the set to await Josie's return to him after her interview, it steadily withered to the most genuine smile he could muster.

Frank turned his head to the class and he found suspicious the blond kid and he decided to go up to him. The kid is embarrassed' 'What do you press in your palm?'' ''Nothing'' ''Can you open it for me please'' He sighed and opened his palm and it revealed it was a piece of paper ''This is nothing'' he took the piece of paper from his palm. Frank left him; the boy looked at Frank with anger. His name is Sy Spector. Frank went to the desk to take the photographic camera. He went to the window to take photos of Rachel who dance with Alex like that he could imagine being the boy who dance with her. After the course, Mrs Anderson walked the students to the big dinner and she remarked Rachel and Frank walked hand on hand''I know since the beginning you are made to be together'' Alex seemed confused by the last words of the sentence''What does it mean made to be together'' ''You're going to understand those words when you will be an adult'' Rachel looked at Alex with smile''Do you want to visit my dormitory''He took the hand of Rachel and escaped together the crowd that Mrs Anderson tried to control. Meanwhile Frank was against the wall of the corridor of his high school, the head lowered and he raised eyes are red and succeeded to take his revenge against Frank. He destroyed the reputation of good student of Frank. The only hope that stays in the life of Frank it is the little Rachel. It is the only person who can give joy, peace and strength to Frank. … Despite Rachel and Alex knew the ups and downs in the group home as the years passed. Their friendship kept them close. Sometimes when Nikki couldn't be with Rachel in her residence, Alex came to sleep with her. During Frank was completing his high school, he met a new friend Thomas. However he kept on taking photos of Rachel. Sy kept on cheating[Chapter 2] The life was pretty hard for Rachel and couldn't afford to pay rent and charges with their jobs of street entertainers. Today it is the first time Frank will celebrate a birthday party. With the help of a work colleague, he succeeded to decorate the place, even it the modest party. On the table aside the birthday cake, the party food, the beverage and party snacks there are a katana and chess box as Frank gifts. Thomas went in front of microphone. He wore a black suit with a black tie ''Mr and Miss or Mrs…'' The room where he was, was pretty crowded, everybody turned to him. ''Welcome to the birthday party of Frank Farmer'' Everybody applauded him. Frank smiled to him. ''Before the party goes on, I'd like to thank someone. Without that person I would never be where I am today. When I came in New York High School for the first time, I thought that I am a stranger in front of others, but with the help of Frank…'' Thomas and Frank looked each other. ''I found my way''.He smiled ''Now, Frank this is for you' 'He left the front and came at his place a beautiful teenager girl with almond dark eyes and black hair. She wore a long blue dress. Frank recognized her, Rachel grew up and became more beautiful since the last time he saw her in the group home. When she opened her mouth to sing, Frank felt vibrations. She had an angel voice. ''happy birthday to you Frank…happy birthday to you…happy birthday to you Frank …happy birthday to you Frank' 'Her voice succeeded to isolate Frank from the other world.'' Everybody applauded her performance. She entered in the crowd to meet Thomas, Frank froze. Thomas kissed her hand. ''Rachel you were fantastic tonight. I'd like to introduce you, our new birthday victim Frank Farmer.''He directed his hand to Frank. Frank look like a statue. ''Frank are you alright'' Frank shook his head and was shy'' Yeah! Rachel looked at him and found him strange' 'What do you think of her performance'' Frank look at her''Amazing'' Rachel smiled' ' Maybe Mr Farmer didn't still come back from the clouds'' Frank came back in his sense and smiled to her' 'Really'' Rachel murmured''I can prove you'' Sy entered to the conversation. Rachel and Frank keep on looking each other. ''Rachel, I can tell you that you are the next best thing'' Frank turned to Sy''I hope this time you won't use a piece of paper''Sy groaned little loudly. Frank left them ''Rachel at the moment I'm doing an audition for the musical of''The Beauty and the Beast' '' ''Oh my God I did that when I was a child'' Sy put his hands on the arms of Rachel and reassured her ''And I can tell you, you already nailed it' 'Rachel jumped of joy ''See you tomorrow in New York City Hall''Sy left her and she can finally exhale. During that time, Frank was watching Rachel from the one of the corners of the room. You can say that from his eyes he was deeply in love with Rachel[Chapter 3] Another chapter:) Frank preferred to keep his love for her as a secret because it was against the law that an adult became involved with a teenager in a relationship. Poor Frank it would be a great pain for him. The same for Rachel because she started to develop a crush for him. Frank knew from that performance he saw tonight Rachel would have a brilliant future. But that one was not very in the mind of Frank, but if only he and Rachel could have the chance to live their love. Days later, Frank was looking at his birthday photos in his car in waiting the light went green .He checked his watch and found that he risked to be late at work. When the light went green, he sped off his car and a pedestrian passed quickly close to his driving. By consequent, he stopped violently his car. He was lucky because he could knock down him or her. The pedestrian turned to Frank, it was Rachel and he recognized her and she recognized him too. The other cars behind Frank started to honk horns. Rachel went to the opposite place. Frank looked angry at Rachel and drove his car. Rachel went after him. Frank stopped his car in the Secrets Service Agency building. After he went off the car, he bumped straight into Rachel. She was a bit shy and the face of Frank was tense. ''Hi Frank. Why are you angry?'' ''You know why I am; you almost push me to kill you. Today I created a traffic jam and now I'm late all that happened because of you' ''Oh I'm sorry Frank because I risked to be late for my audition too? '' ''I don't care but why you did prove me that you are immature''Rachel was shocked by his behaviour ''Immature, do you know what is immature. Have you got your life since you are teenager because the most important people in your life don't belong anymore of this world?'' Frank started to realize the mistake he made and became quiet' 'Never'' Rachel started to become angry ''But I'm afraid the immature person is you in that case'' Frank wanted to stop Rachel but she left him and he sighed. That day will stay the worst day in the life of Rachel. Her who thought she found the man of her life in Frank has been disappointed by him. She entered in the New York City Hall and started to feel unwell because of the place it looked like ''The place of Devil'', Sy came up to her and offered his hand to hers. Her hand started to burn and she removed her hand from his and Sy started to smile''Rachel tonight will be your biggest night''Rachel seemed confused and lost she didn't know if she had to leave or stay because music had been a passion since she was a child. Frank spent more time in doing football it seemed he would become a future bodyguard. Frank spent lunchtime with Thomas. And Thomas found Frank pale and almost mute in their conversation today. Before Thomas left him ''Frank don't forget we have a chess game tonight' 'It seems like Frank didn't listen what he said. Frank brought in the table a box named'Sweet Memories'', he opened it and it revealed there was some random photos of Rachel he took in secret and it brought back his smile .Suddenly bad memories came back to haunt hurtful word''immature'' he threw to Rachel early. Rachel succeeded to pass her audition as Sy said. She has been cast as the leading role for ''The Beauty and the Beast: Musical' 'She went to Ambassador Theatre for the first night of the show, she found her co-stars very rude through her. But her pain disappeared quickly when she started to sing the first lyrics of the famous hit of ''The Beauty and the Beast'' and it remembered her Frank. Nachos with a small bowl of Skittles were in a table aside of chess of game. Frank who used to be the leader in the game, seemed to lose .Thomas was astonished ''Frank, what's going on? 'Suddenly Frank heard the singing voice of Rachel and came back in the reality' 'I'm sorry, can we keep on'' That night Rachel understood the reaction of Frank through this song and Frank knew that Rachel forgave him through the song he heard spiritually.[Chapter 4] A new chapter, please reviewing .Merry Christmas everyone in advance Love and music 13 years later, Sy Spector became the manager of Rachel Marron became a successful singer and Nikki Marron is her secretary. However Rachel felt pregnant with Alex 9 years ago. The name of their child was Fletcher. Alex lost his life in Yugoslavia when he was a peacekeeper and by consequent Rachel should bear Fletcher by herself. For Frank, his best friend Thomas found the love of his life and often couldn't be with him. Rachel was driving her car when she met Frank on the road. He was fixing his car. ''Frank'' ''Rachel''he was astonished to see her. She wore a white shirt and a blue jean. Frank was dirty ''What are you doing here?''She smiled '' Umh, I 'm fixing my car'' ''You didn't change a lot'' ''Rachel you are too great for me, you are the most successful singer at the moment'' ''Come on, let me give you a lift'' Frank left his car and followed Rachel in her car. Rachel was driving. ''So what do you do these days'' ''I'm bodyguard'' ''Ooh, so you are going to be my bodyguard'' ''Why not?''He smiled ''So who are you protecting at the moment?'' ''The American president'' ''Politicians, I can't stand them'' ''Why'' '' Look at, my husband went to war 10 years ago leaving his pregnant wife behind. He thought he was doing for his country, instead of it was a lie. When he lost his life, the country couldn't even honour him.''She sighed ''I'm very sorry for you, Rachel'' ''That's OK, Frank'' There is a silence between them ''Rachel maybe…this will be sounded inappropriate but… I'd like to...tell that I'm sorry for the insult I threw to you long time ago'' Rachel exploded to laugh''Frank, sincerely if I haven't forgiven you, why I 'm giving you a lift at the moment?'' Frank smiled''I don't know'' Rachel smiled' 'Frank do you remember when I asked you to be my bodyguard'' ''Yeah'' ''I really want it because we know with success comes blessing and curse'' ''I know respect, admirers and jealousy'' Rachel stopped the car in front of the house of Frank. He got out of the car. ''Frank, please I have a son too''Rachel said when Frank head to his home. She looked at him like she begged him. Frank turned to her. ''OK, Rachel I will see''Rachel smiled''But first I have to sleep'' Rachel laughed''Typically Frank''She drove the car. Today Rachel has had to have a rehearsing for her future concert in''The Maya'' but she missed she decided to lie to Sy that her throat is ill. During the dinner, Sy planned to show the design of the outfit for her future performance but he is disappointed and angry with Rachel because he caught her talking and holding the hands of Fletcher with Frank in a park attraction. The next day Rachel met Sy outside her house. He came to bow his head and kissed the hand of Rachel gently. ''Good morning my darling'' ''Good morning Sy, how was your day?'' Sy started to make evil eyes ''You haven't answered me properly about your missing rehearsal'' ''I thought you've already known about it''She seems surprised. Sy is a her businessman and thought Frank took away Rachel from her function as a celebrity'' ''Not at all. What were you doing with a bodyguard yesterday instead of you have politicians, businessmen, celebrities after you''Rachel was shocked she knew what he said it was true ''So for you fame and money matters more. But I'm afraid it is not case for me, Love is above all.''Suddenly she came back in her sense''Firstly I'm not in love with Frank, he is my friend and I want him to be my bodyguard'' Sy made a cynical smile ''From my perspective it doesn't seem a friendship or even worse a bodyguard relationship that it is generally a professional relationship. Rachel to be honest I don't like undisciplined workers and I don't want to hear anything about Frank too'' ''What the hell…'' ''Are you deaf?'' Rachel decided to leave him and walk angry, he followed her. ''It's my private life, not yours.'' He took violently her arm with his hand and pressed it strongly. Rachel felt the pain. ''That's what you deserve as you want Frank as your bodyguard, it could be worse if you want more from him'' He let her fall on the ground and left her. Rachel kept on feeling the pain in her arm and her eyes are red. Poor Rachel. She planned to resign as his employee after releasing her last album but now it's too late. Suddenly Sy turned to her''Oh Rachel, don't forget your rehearsal for today''From that moment Rachel knew Sy was a cruel manager. … Festive days are coming Sy hasn't abused again to Rachel. She preferred to be silent about this subject. Nobody close to her knew about it, not even Frank. Because if she spilled it Sy had a lot of connection and she feared for them. For Christmas, Rachel wanted to spend it at home with family because she used to go in parties and sometimes they can turn wild, but also it is the day Frank will come in the home for the first time. But Nikki wanted Rachel went again. Rachel finished telling the story of Santa Claus to Fletcher''Merry Christmas mum'' ''Merry Christmas my angel''.She kissed his forehead and left him in the bed. Nikki entered in the bedroom, excited''That's good he's sleeping, because we got to leave'' Rachel was a bit shocked''Why'' ''Rachel we have a party in 'Sodoma and Gomorrah' one of the best nightclub in the world'' ''Nikki I'm not into it anymore. Tomorrow it's Christmas and I want to spend it that time with Fletcher and also it will be the first day of work for Frank'' ''OK I can understand for Fletcher, but not for a bodyguard, Rachel you deserve better'' ''I don't understand why everybody is against Frank'' ''Rachel we have to hurry up''.Nikki left the room and Rachel sighed because nobody wanted to listened her …[Chapter 5] Hey another chapter Confessions The party started. Sy guided Rachel and Nikki in a table. R&b; music was played. And it started to become more wildly and Rachel started to feel ill. Suddenly they brought alcohol in the table, but Rachel already quit it .She used to drink, she became vulnerable. So she decided to pretend drinking to please Sy and Nikki and rejecting it when they were distracted. Later Sy presented the drawing of the costume for her future performance. It was made of black leather with metal silver that could be suitable for a woman warrior. Rachel didn't like it, she found it too dark''Rachel, what do you think'' ''Sorry I need a space for myself''. She entered in the toilet. She looked at herself in the mirror and washed her joined her too. ''Rachel, what's going on? You haven't given any answer to Sy'' ''You know the answer; I'm planning to leave him.''She seemed nervous. ''I think you can get on your own now you have work experience as secretary because I want to control my artistic career and spend more time with Fletcher'' ''Are you insane, Sy won't never leave you you worth many millions and he will do everything to destroy our lives. Please Rachel, I don't want to suffer again and I think about you and Fletcher too, do you remember the years spent in the group home and the difficulties to earn money. So …think…before…act.'' Rachel couldn't be disagreed with her sister about that subject so she decided to accept to stay with Sy. In the Christmas day, Frank finally came. It was like a Christmas gift for Rachel and Fletcher. Frank was very handsome and Nikki can understand why Rachel had such crush on him. But for Sy it is evident he never liked Frank, so for him it was not a good news that Frank will be around his life then. For Nikki, she had to work harder to take away Frank from Rachel. The night was clear and it was full moon. Frank sat both knees bent on the grass and thinking and Rachel came smiling'' Frank, what are you doing here'' ''Do you know the expression' sleep on it'''He gave a glimpse of smile ''Yeah I remember my mother used to tell me about it''She joined him''But I don't believe it'' ''Why'' ''Because I tried to follow it but it never worked for me'' ''Because you don't have faith in it'' ''How can I get the faith''? ''It depends what do you mean by faith…faith means believing with seeing '' ''So you ask me to believe with seeing it''Frank lied down relaxing ''Yeah…Like the poor blind man that Jesus gave the sight in the Bible because he had believed in Him first despite never meet Him before.'' Rachel started to laugh''Frank don't start with your bible messages because you remember my pastor'' ''Sometimes it is good to have fun'' That night would stay in the life of Rachel as her best. … Awards season were coming soon. Many movie studios send their movies in the nomination ballot. It was a stressful and anxious time for everyone. For Rachel it wasn't a joy because she couldn't spend more time with Frank and it was the same case for Frank too. The relationship with Sy grew worse for Rachel. She started to talk to Frank about was understandable and comfort her. But Sy knew about everything, became angry and started to abuse mentally of Rachel. Today was a good day she received her academy awards nomination as best actress .She went in euphoria into the bedroom of was astonished. ''Frank,I received academy awards nomination as best actress''Frank was so happy for Rachel,he always knew it was her destiny to become a famous star ''Rachel …to be honest… you deserve it'' ''Oh!Frank you are a wonderful man''She went to fall in his arms. For Sy it wasn't the case,he knew Rachel was talented but the money took over him. ''Sy what are you doing here, you don't join us for the celebration?'' ''I'm not interested''He was furious ''How can you say things like that''Rachel was shocked ''Because you disobeyed me again, what are you doing in the arms of Frank''Rachel sighed''I told you many times I don't want to see Frank in your life'' ''Now,Sy THAT'S ENOUGH this is my business and you are not in charge of life and I'm a grow up woman.'' Sy took the plate and threw it in the risked to explode She went to the bedroom of Frank and sat on his bed with him. ''It started since you came around. Frank, I have never seen that side of him in my life'' Frank thought that it was something related to their past. ''Frank'' ''I was thinking''He came back from his clouds ''You are always somewhere when we are discussing something important''She smiled. Frank smiled at her too and looked at her the same time. He saw a beauty of princess in her. He raised her chin. She was a bit shy and they look at each other for a long time The following day, Frank went to meet Sy. He wore a black suit with a red tie ''Good Morning, Mr Spector'' ''Good Morning, Mr Farmer'' ''I know we never get on well, but I'd like to tell you I don't want to hurt Rachel…it's because…she means a lot to me'' ''So'' ''Sy I loved her and I will always love her''Sy exploded to laugh ''You think I'm going to tolerate that. But I'm afraid Frank that you are going to do it over my dead body'' From that moment Frank was completely lost and abandoned alone and doesn't know how he is going to do.

She always blamed the mess on the smallness of the place, while any sane person wouldn't have had any trouble at all keeping everything in order but Alexa was nowhere near normal, hence the constant mess. The dark haired woman of 29 was currently attacking her not so fluffy carpet with the hoover, trying to remove the tiny pieces of glass she'd noticed the day before. How they'd gotten there, well that was a complete mystery. Alexa Rivers was professional safe cracker that occasionally worked for the police to crack safes that their people couldn't, but she mostly did jobs for companies that make them and needed someone to test them. She spent all her free time with a pair of headphones on and music in her ears, no matter what she was doing. She spent her time alone since she had long since realized that her and the opposite sex just didn't get along, so not having a boyfriend or that many friends made her life pretty lonely. Not that she ever spent it much thought, she hadn't felt lonely in years, she had her music. \" Finally! At last something going my way.\" Her war with the glass pieces stuck in her carpet was finally settled, she coming out on top. Alexa's morning had not started well. First, she was woken up at five just to be told that her job for the day got canceled, then when she tried to go into the bathroom she hit her head in the door. Ten minutes later in the kitchen she had burned her left hand on the tea water, leaving a nasty burn on the back of her hand and wrist. Why did she have to be so clumsy in the morning? She turned off and stuffed away the hoover in a closet, now fully intent on spending her day at the record store. She grabbed her black sweater, pulling it over her lithe form, careful with her bandaged hand. Just as she was about to exit she thought she heard someone outside. She pulled out one of the headphones and pressed her ear to the door. She heard two voices behind it, but from the footsteps echoing in the hallway she guessed there were at least four people out there. \" I like these calm little moments before the storm. It reminds me of Beethoven. Can you hear it? It's like when you put your head to the grass and you can hear the crawling, you can hear the insects. Do you like Beethoven? \" That unfamiliar voice was alluring and smooth, and Alexa found herself glued to the door in case it would sound again. But the voice that answered was a lot gruffer and not pleasant at all. \" I really couldn't say.\" \" I'll play you some. \" Just then she heard what sounded like a gun being fired and someone taking loud steps that faded slightly with each step, the person probably walking into one of the neighbor apartments. ' Probably the family across the hall.' She went away from the door a few moments to pick up her sheath knife that lay on the table, putting it in her right pocket. Just in case something happened. As she neared the door again and stopped to listen, but it was now quiet in the hall. Alexa let go of the breath she didn't even know she was holding and picked up her Mp3, turning on Remedy by Seether just as she opened the door. She closed and locked it behind her. As she turned around she pulled up her black hair with blue bangs in a ponytail, walking with slow and quiet steps so that if there was anyone around they wouldn't notice her. After w few steps she walked by a door that stood wide open, but no one was visible inside. She heard voices from inside and carefully took a step closer. All of a sudden two men came around the corner inside the apartment, one of them holding a plastic bag with white powder inside. ' Drugs?' The word echoed through Alexa's head as the men continued walking towards her, talking between themselves but not noticing her yet. It was then she recognized the wonderful voice she'd heard before, and it came from the very man that held the white powder, clad in a beige suit. \" I told you it was still in the apartment. But now we need to find a new hiding spot til the next delivery. Maybe we could-\" In that second DEA Officer Norman Stansfield looked up and saw the dark haired woman staring at him like a deer in headlights, and he looked between her and the cocaine in his hand, only one thought passing through his mind. ' Shit, a witness.' He handed the powder over to his partner, the shotgun still in his possession and resting safely by his side. He saw her eyes darting between him, the powder, the shotgun and back to him, panic evident in her bright eyes. He raises his hands slightly to show that he's not going to hurt her, but the second he takes another step towards her she bolts, heading for the stairs. Alexa hear a loud \" Fuck! \" behind her but keeps on running, the music loud in her ears. The chorus give her a boost as she takes the steps two at a time. \"Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail And so we go back to the remedy Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie And tell yourself, \"You'll be the death of me\" \" She squeaked as the gun fired and the bullets hit the wall beside her. She runs faster but despite the music and over the music she can hear loud footsteps right behind her. She jumps the last steps and pushes violently out the door, but as she turns to head down the street she feels a white searing pain in her side. She ignores it and concentrates on running, hoping that she know the neighborhood better than the 'crazy men with the guns'. She turns a corner and disappear into the market, then into an alley where she stops to look behind her. She sees no one but keep on running anyway, deeper into the city towards the hotel district. XXXX An hour later Alexa is checked in on ' Duet Hotel' under the false name of Kim Taylor. She doesn't dare go to the hospital, since that would probably be their first place to look. 'Who the shit were those guys? I'll have to be careful with where I go now. And I'll have to move. Damn what a mess!' Alexa got up from the bed where she'd spent the last ten minutes in shock and moved to the bathroom to have a look at her side that was throbbing painfully. As she removed her shirt and looked in the mirror she gasped. The shotgun had grazed her side and it now looked horribly torn and blood ran down her waist to her leg. She got completely undressed so she wouldn't soil any more of her clothes and stepped into the shower, after all it would probably be the most effective way to get it clean. After a few painful minutes of scrubbing it was finally clean and Alexa stepped out of the shower, once again surveying the damage in the mirror. It was then she noticed a hard bump beneath the skin close to the wound and as she looked closer she realized it was one of the small bullets from the shotgun that had lodged itself in the skin. ' I'll never get it out by myself. I need help with this. But who would know how to remove a bullet?' Alexa pondered on this for a few moments before remembering that the only friend she had that she would trust enough was afraid of blood, she would faint if she saw this. But if she was going to do it herself then she would need a forceps, and there was none in the cabinets. She only found a roll of bandages but it would not help her get the small piece of metal out of her skin, she would have to buy one herself. But it would have to wait a few days until some of the heat went away, and she could roam the streets again. As the dark settled in the sound of rain pattering against glass could be heard, creating a calm but depressing atmosphere. That night Alexa went to sleep with a tight, anxious knot in her stomach. 'What the hell have I gotten myself into this time?' DEA Officer Norman Stansfield inspected the drops of blood left on the asphalt, the only proof that the mysterious dark haired woman had ever existed. He sighed and rose to his full height again, one of his subordinates standing behind him. \" Hey Stan, do you want help man? With finding her I mean.\" The man twitched his fingers nervously, and with good reason too. His boss could be very unpredictable when he was angry or frustrated, especially if it wasn't long ago since he popped one of those pills, then he could be down right scary. But Stansfield just sighed and reached for his headphones. \" No, I wanna do this my way. Now go and make yourself useful and don't disturb me, I need to think. \" The lower ranking man left his boss alone, knowing better than to interrupt him when he was listening to one of his beloved composers.[Chapter 2] Hello everyone! I know I've been horribly rude by not updating this story, but I've had to prioritise and when I finally had the time I didn't have any inspiration. But now I am telling you this. I will Update! It might take just a little while longer still, I need to complete the next chapter and all, don't want to disaapoint, but I really like writing this story. So just bear with me, for I will return! Your incredibly slow working but faithful writer/ Allblue95[Chapter 3] Hello again! It is with great pleasure and a lot of laziness that I present to you : The second chapter! Please continue reviewing, it kicks me in the butt and reminds me I need to actually post the chapters I write. :P /Allblue95 P.S: The bits of lyrics used in this chapter come from Nickel Creek's song 'When in Rome'. :D.S. Where can a sick man go When he can't choke down the medicine, The old Doc knows. A specialist came to town, but he stays at home, saying no one knows, so I don't, Honey, when in Rome. Alexa woke with a painful groan, hands clutching the sheets tangled around her pale limbs. Sheets that at some points were oddly wet, sort of sticky. Eyes shooting up in sudden panic a yelp escapes her lips as she falls to the floor in the process of trying to escape the sticky sheets, failing miserably. Another pained wimper as her body hits the floor and she feels for the wound in her side, the small piece of steel still imbedded in her flesh and if she wasn't trying to stay positive she would say it's sunk in even deeper than it originally was. \"Shit,shit,shit,shit, SHIT! Fuck,piss, arse, hell and the devil's stinkin' hole.\" The colorful and occasionally home made string of curses kept flowing until she was free to move without constriction of the blasted sheets and was able to amble her way to the bathroom. When she peeled away the wet-with-blood bandages she cleaned and got a good look at the wound. To her relief it didn't look infected, then again she was no expert but she thought she would be able to tell when a wound was infected. The bandages were bled through and ruined and Alexa came to the conclusion that she must have turned a lot during the night. The memory of ice-blue eyes pierced through her brain and she shuddered even as the warm water from the shower head tumbled down her back. Pulling on her clothes, that thankfully were dark enough to hide the red stains at her left side, she put the sheets in the trash and headed out to hunt for a pair of forceps. Unfortunately for her at the same time one Norman Stansfield was searching for her, clad in a new beige suit since his other one had to be disposed of. He was still feeling angry about that, that bastard ruined a perfectly good suit. But back to the girl, the girl with the black hair with blue bangs, an interesting choice. He wondered what part he'd hit, the blood on the pavement had to be hers, who else's? If he was lucky at least one bullet had stuck in the wound, if not, she got away with a small scratch. But if lady luck Was on his side she would be looking for some type of first aid, tweezers maybe, bandages no doubt. She probably,hopefully, didn't have anyone she would or could trust in this kind of situation, judging by her apartment Stan had sniffed around it yesterday, she seemed to be quite the loner. Hotel it is then! One last thing, how far can she have ran off to before she felt marginally safe or until she got too tired to go on? He thought she'd ran east but he couldn't be sure, she could have changed directions. But if she kept on that side of the town-. Something inside him fell into place, a contented smile spreading across his lips. He knew exactly where she was. Grab a blanket, sister, we'll make smoke signals. Bring in some new blood It feels like we're alone. Grab a blanket, brother, so we don't catch cold from one another Oh, I wonder if we're stuck in Rome. Forceps, bandage, first-aid kit, extra antiseptic, surgical tape, scalpel, thank god she hadn't left her apartment without her wallet yesterday, otherwise she'd be royally screwed. Standing in queue at the pharmacy with security cameras up above had never bothered her before but now she found her palms getting sticky with cold sweat and she almost jumped out of her skin when the cashier called her forward. Packing and paying for the items she quickly exited and began walking back to the hotel. She knew it was a stupid move to go back but she was not feeling so good and she didn't have time to find and then check into a new hotel before fixing herself up. Remove the bullet and bandage the thing, then she could get the hell out of there. Throwing a glance behind her shoulder as she entered she hurried to the elevator, ignoring the receptionist's cheery 'hello'. Heading straight for the bathroom Alexa immediately threw her bloody sweater to the floor, t-shirt following next, now clad in her bra alone she inspected the wound in the mirror, running a finger over the bulge that was the bullet. Bending down she put the supplies on the bathroom counter. Soaking a wad of cotton she went for cleaning the wound, stopping just before she reached it, a noise outside reaching her ears. Taking slow deliberate steps towards the living room she stopped in the bathroom doorway, listening intently. After a few seconds she gave up and turned back to the sink, oblivious to the door that now swung around to reveal a beige clad figure hidden behind it. One step,two step, gun waiting in it's holster, ready. If Alexa's brain hadn't warned her that the beige speck of color in the corner of her eye weren't there before she would have found her face pressed to the mirror in front of her just seconds later but thankfully to her her brain recognized the figure and she soon had the just-bought scalpel in her hand, hazel-green meeting ice-blue as she turned. As their eyes met Stan instantly decided that she was no deer, judging by the scalpel clutched in that hand of hers. 'Small hand' he corrected himself, compared to his own they looked positively tiny. Tempted to look down and inspect the size of his hands just to prove his thought process was correct he resisted the urge, there was no time for that at the moment. 'Focus!' \"So, this is where you've been hiding. I knew you couldn't fly far with your wing bleeding.\" He gestured to her side. Alexa almost shivered at the sound of his voice but chose to narrow her eyes as she caught his little joke. \" What do you want? \" \"Come now, there's no reason to be worried.\" He took a fraction of a step closer and she immediately backed one step. \"Uh-huh, and I'm Johann Sebastian Bach.\" She watched his lips twitch into a small smile, some of his teeth visible making him look more like a smirking predator that a man amused by clipped sarcasm. His eyes turned to the sink where she'd dropped the wad of cotton, and back to her. She wasn't stupid, he'd give her that. But smarts wouldn't be enough, not this time. He carefully moved his hand towards his trusted gun. \"You can't kill me. \" His eyebrows raised, he was clearly amused this time. Alexa wasn't sure how she was supposed to react to the almost childish glint that appeared in his eyes as she spoke, like a kid receiving a lollipop on a wednesday, pleasantly surprised. 'Is this a fucking game to him?' \"Really? Enlighten me, sweetheart, why?\" \" The cops know where I live, who I am, what I do for a living. They see me every week. If I stopped showing up for work they would take notice. Someone would come looking for me and your plan would shatter in a million pieces. They would see the connection, and they would find you. You can't kill me.\" Stan stood stock still for nearly a minute until he finally spoke. \" You work for the police?\" Alexa nodded cautiously. \"That's funny, so do I.\" Face paling she took another step back as the pieces fell into place. His eyes still held that sick amusement. \" D.E.A.\" \"Norman Stansfield, at your service. \" He did a small mock bow and took a step forward at the same time. And another. And another. Alexa tried backing away but felt the cold tile of the bathroom wall against her bare back. Remembering her attire, or rather lack of , she resisted the blush that threatened to take over, now was not the time to be modest. He kept advancing. \" Don't come near me.\" Paying her no mind he kept coming closer until he stood well within arms reach, hands at his sides ready to act. He stood completely still for a moment, eyes running her up and down, taking in her appearance properly for the first time today. Ice-blue met hazel-green once more before his hands came into play. Swiftly grabbing her armed hand he twisted the wrist, making her release the scalpel with a pained yelp, before gathering both hands in one of his larger ones, pulling them above her in a harsh movement that got him a quiet whimper. He'd been correct, she had tiny hands compared to him. His other hand came to rest against her wound, not pressing or stroking, it just lay against it. Alexa stilled completely at the feel of his hand over the wound, he could make this really painful for her if he wanted to. She felt the heat from his body seeping through his white shirt and resisted the urge to shudder, her mind scolding her body for suddenly acting like a horny teenager. He seemed to be thinking it all over, his eyes keeping her own prisoner. He craned his head slightly to the side, the bones giving a sickening pop. His fingers had started drumming against her bruised skin, a very precise beat, almost like he was playing a piano piece, but he seemed conveniently oblivious to the small stabs of pain it gave her. She saw his eyes light up and the breath caught in her body, this was it, she was so dead. \" You're coming with me. \" 'What?' She felt his hands release her, going for the small band-aids instead, swiftly pressing one over the wound before handing her her sweater. For a moment she just stood there as he inspected the rest of the medical supplies, deciding if anything was worth bringing with them, seemingly reaching a negative conclusion as his eyes came back to hers. \" What do you mean I'm coming with you? \" \" I suppose you would call it abduction, but I simply call it...insurance of safety. \" He saw her eyes hardening. \"Mine or yours?\" At this he simply smiled coldly at her before running his eyes down her body again, brow creasing slightly before one lifted. \" You sure you want to go out dressed like that? Or shall I say, undressed?\" This time she couldn't hide the scarlet blush that spread across her face like wildfire. Quickly pulling her sweater over her head she glared at him through her bangs. He walked ahead of her to the door to the hallway, holding it open for her. \"After you.\" Alexa took slow steps, she felt like she was walking to her execution. Eyes darting around for a possible escape route she noticed his hold on the door was very loose, it would be easy breaking it. But could she run? She got closer and closer to the door, and she decided that yes, yes she could. As she was about to walk past him out the door she suddenly grabbed it and roughly slammed it to his forehead, knocking him on his ass, and she ran. It hurt like a bitch, but she ran. She rounded a corner, in hope that the small head-start she had would be enough, that hope was quickly obliterated as she was suddenly tackled to the ground. Letting out a something between a growl and a yell she struggled to get out from beneath the other form but soon felt her hands restrained behind her back by big hands and soon she was pulled upright and her front slammed into a wall to her left. \" That was stupid.\" Alexa bit her lip as she gasped quietly, that voice alone was dangerous to her sanity, not to mention when it was right by her ear. She felt his breath against the side of her neck and it was then she realized how close he was. \" You got guts sweetheart, I'm impressed, but I'm afraid that's not enough. You know who I am and what I've been up to, but you work for the cops so I can't just dispose of you like I usually would. You're a witness, and it has just cost you your privacy.\" Her brow furrowed at this. \"The hell does that mean?\" He let go of her wrists and turned her around, ice-blue eyes glinting as he slightly towered over her. \" It means, and here's the big news, you're looking at the man you're gonna be living with for the rest of your life.\" Where can a dead man go? A question with an answer only dead men know. But I'm gonna bet they never really feel at home, If they spend a lifetime learning how to live in Rome...

I've finally kicked myself in the butt and written another chapter. Hope you like it! The lyrics come from Tom Waits's Tango til they're sore. \" Well ya play that Tarantella All the hounds they start to roar And the boys all go to hell. They drive along the pipeline They tango till they're sore They take apart their nightmares And they leave them by the door.\" \" Ah,home sweet home, huh?\" Alexa just glared at him as they passed the threshold to his condo. 'A quite large condo' Alexa noted, 'he must be on a decent paycheck' Her thought stopped there as she wasn't sure if his 'paycheck' had legal grounds or not, and she wasn't sure if she truly wanted to know the whole story, apart from the bits she already knew. The place looked homey enough for a corrupt cop. He walked past her, heading for another room. \" Come over here, we gotta get that metal out of you before it makes itself a home.\" Raising an eyebrow Alexa looked at him in a disdainful manner. Headed for the bathroom then, Alexa would guess. \" For some reason I seriously doubt your concern for my wellbeing. \" Stan turned to look at her on his route to the bathroom. Now why is that? I need you alive and well, can't have you dying on me for such a silly reason as an infection. That would raise even more questions when the coroner gets his hands on you. Now come on, or do you want me to bandage you up with the bullet still inside? It's up to you. \" All of this was said in an unnervingly calm manner, like he was reporting the weather, and Alexa felt a shiver trickle down her spine. 'This is so not good' Contemplating the front door once more she briefly calculated her chance for survival if she ran now. She didn't like them. Then her mind stumbled upon something in what he'd just said. '\"When\" the coroner gets his hands on me?' \" It's only a matter of time, isn't it? \" Stansfield looked back at her as he removed his jacket, hanging it neatly over a chair. \" What is?\" Alexa looked at him, a mix of fear and partially subdued anger written on her face. \" Before you kill me and I end up in a mortuary. \" He winced at the word kill, now turning fully to look at her properly, smiling that predatory smile again. \" I slipped up, didn't I?\" The expectant look on his face told Alexa that he actually wanted her to answer that, so she settled for nodding her head, now even more worried. His gaze was completely fixated upon her now, and he stood stock still. Two minutes went by, and the amused look on his face had disappeared without a trace. She saw his eyes travel up and down her body, until it settled on her left arm. Stepping closer to her she backed away out of instinct. His eyes seared hers for a few intense seconds, rooting her to the spot, until he resumed his advancement until he stood well within her personal space, it seemed to be a recurring habit of his. Eyes still settled on hers he traced her entire left arm from her shoulder and down until he reached her wrist which he brought up for closer scrutiny. It was only when he brought it up to chest height that she remembered the burn she still had there. She looked up at Stansfield who was looking at her hand. \" How did this happen? \" A finger lightly traced the irritated wound. Alexa swallowed. \" I spilt hot water on it yesterday morning. Why would you care? \" She tried to command her muscles to move her hand out of his soft grasp but they just wouldn't do it. Stansfield ignored her. \" You put any ice on it afterwards?\" \" Uh, no I... I didn't think it looked that bad. \" Suddenly she found herslef being dragged towards and into a large bathroom. Alexa realized what was going to happen once he was satisfied with her hand. 'Oh that thought just sounded wrong on so many levels.' She tried to step away from him but the movement clearly upset Stansfield, and he put his thumb over the painful skin, resting it there like he had rested his hand on her other wound earlier. He rummaged for a few seconds through one of the cupboards until he produced what Alexa guessed to be some sort of anti-septic salve. A few seconds went by as he seemed to consider something, his fingers once again playing a silent piano piece on the unharmed skin on her wrist. Alexa could feel her heart beating quicker, almost matching the fast rhythm of his fingers. His fingers stopped abruptly, now resting against the inside of her wrist, and Alexa realized he was taking her pulse! Abruptly she snatched her wrist away, ignoring the slight scratch of his thumbnail against her burn. Stansfield smiled knowingly at her. Alexa glared. Neither of them moved for one minute, and then Stansfield finally broke the eye contact and put the salve down to unbutton his cuffs and roll up his sleeves. He soon brought out more anti-septic, but this time in a more liquid form, and some cotton. Then came the long tweezers, and Alexa shuddered at the sight, she thought she could feel the bullet pressing against her skin like it too was panicking. \" You need to take off your shirt. \" Alexa's glare intensified. He looked at her with an almost innocent expression. \" I can't get to the wound, and the bullet, if you don't. \" She crossed her arms across her chest at this, almost wincing at the pain shooting from her wound at the action. \" I can get it myself.\" Stansfield raised an eyebrow at her, clearly not agreeing. \" Hold out your hands, palms up. \" She did as he asked, and he put the tweezers and bottle of anti-septic in her hands. Then he strolled out of the room and she could hear him humming as he went. Alexa stood there stunned for a few seconds, staring vacantly at the objects in her hands. He actually stepped down? 'This is too weird.' Normally she would think the male sex completely incapable of listening to a woman, they all had such large egos. This one though seemed to be completely devoid of any need to go to preposterous length to prove that he was right(like a lot of men do). She shook the strange thoughts off and put the tools down and removed her shirt. Standing in front of the full length mirror in the bathroom made her realize how serious her situation was. The wound was not just red, but also blue, violet and the entry wound had an alarming shade of yellow. Alexa prodded it very carefully and almost cried out in pain, biting her lower lip to keep it in. 'Suck it up, Alex! You can do this.' Dousing a cotton ball in anti-septic she put it against the wound, groaning in pain as it stung horribly. She didn't even take notice of her white-knuckled grip on the sink to keep standing. Forcing herself to look at the wound she prepared another cotton ball, this time with more fluid, and pressed it to the wound so the anti-septic could enter the wound properly. She nearly fell over. Suddenly she felt a warm clothed chest against her back and big hands grabbing her shoulders to keep her steady. Leaning against the form behind her she didn't even think of who it was, only that a hand was removing hers and the cotton from the wound, relieving her pain in the process. \" Stupid woman. Pride can't remove a bullet, can it? \" This time she couldn't keep the shiver at bay and her whole body shuddered at the sound of his voice so close, even if he was obviously scolding her attitude. She opened her eyes,( when had she closed them?), and he manoeuvred her so that she was leaning with her back against the sink. Grabbing her hands he put them to rest on the sink behind her and he took the tweezers. Assessing the wound for a few seconds he suddenly, without further ado, plunged the tweezers into the wound going directly for the bullet. Alexa let out something between a choked back scream and a whimper, a painful sound all together, but Stansfield kept searching for the small piece of metal. She tried to grab his shoulder in a half-hearted and subconscious attempt to make him stop but he grabbed her hand and put it back against the sink which she grabbed as if her life depended on it. Finally she felt something move inside the wound and this time she couldn't suppress the small scream from escaping as she felt the tweezers grab the bullet. She felt the metal scraping the walls of the wound on it's way out and breathed out in relief when she felt it leave the wound completely. The clink of the bullet hitting the sink hit her ears like she was underwater and she barely heard Stansfield calling her name before she felt herself slip into unconsciousness. The last thing she knew was strong arms around her back and legs, and the tunes of one of her favourite songs echoing through her memory as her body hit the mattress. \" Let me fall out the window With confetti in my hair Deal out jacks or better On a blanket by the stairs I'll tell you all my secrets But I lie about my past So send me off to bed forever more.\" Oh an please review! Your opinions on how I've managed Stan's personality are very important to get a good portrayal. (He is very difficult to write!)[Chapter 6] Sorry this chapter is so short, but I felt like posting it nonetheless. :) Enjoy! Welcome Amigo Song is: Welcome Amigo by Rick Garcia(Rango) \" Welcome Amigo, to the land without end. The desert and Death are the closest of friends. We sing of his courage in magnificent song, pay close attention - he won't be here long.\" The following day Alexa awoke alone to the rays of the sun slithering through the light blue curtains. Her head ached horribly and her throat and side hurt. When she moved about though she could feel clean bandages against her skin as they slid across the sheets. Sheets? It took Alexa a moment to fully comprehend that she was in fact lying in a bed. A large soft bed, and she couldn't for the life of her remember how she got there. She lifter her left hand to move the cover aside and saw that even her burn had a thin but secure bandage on it. Thoughts flying through her head on why Stansfield had bothered kept her mind preoccupied while she attempted to slowly sit up until she was almost up. Searing pain stabbed at her side and she bit her lower lip as she pushed her body upright, her feet now resting against the pleasant wooden floor. Looking around she saw a number of paintings on the walls, curtains, a clean floor and the sheets in the bed smelled clean. How could such an unpleasant man live in such a pleasant home? 'It even looks better than my own place' Alexa found herself thinking grudgingly. Gingerly she rose to her feet, stepping over to the window and parting the curtains that reminded her of something. Outside the sky was a brilliant blue with feathery clouds traversing above her and she spent a few moments watching the birds fly over New York City. She had never really had an opportunity to see the city from a view such as this. It made her feels small, and she suddenly remembered where she was. Alexa's gaze flickered to the door that lead to the living room, considering it for a second before walking over and turning the handle and stepping forward slightly as she fully expected it to open. It did not. Alexa almost slammed her nose into it when it didn't cooperate and she tried it again, a bit more firmly. Not a budge. The third time she insistently pushed at it while turning the handle, but in her hand she could feel that the door was locked shut. Taking a deep breath she steadied her injured side before bellowing though the door. \"STANSFIELD!\" She waiter a few seconds before pounding the door a few times. Ear against the door Alexa listened intently, utterly focused. It took her approximately two minutes to realize that the condo was empty, save for herself. Turning around she slid down the door until she was sitting on the floor, looking around the room in irritation. The bastard had locked her in! The nerve of that man! Wasn't it enough for him to just lock the front door like everyone else? But it would seem that Stansfield was anything but like everyone else, something that put Alexa on edge. Who knew what he was capable of? He had already managed to damage And rescue her, both in the span of 48 hours. Sighing at her poor stroke of luck she hung her head, resting her chin upon her sternum, and it was then that Alexa realized that she was only clad in a pair of men's boxers(that was almost comfortable in that odd sort of way), the bandages around her ribcage and her black lace bra. Cheeks flaming with a mixture of deep embarrassment and pure rage she rose once more to kick at the door in her anger, letting out a small portion of the frustration inside, but saving some for when Stansfield would return. And she knew he would, after all he owned the place. 'He owns you' a small voice inside her whispered, but she refused to acknowledge the thought. She closed her eyes and took deep breaths, calming her mind to the set of calculative coldness that she used when she cracked safes. Opening them up again she started her search for something useful, and was rewarded almost instantly. Or, rewarded or rewarded. What she found hanging off of a chair to her right by the window was a discarded white dress shirt, clearly men's size 'Gee Alex, what else could it be?' Upon closer inspection of said shirt it turned out to be an Armani. Eyebrows practically sticking out from the top of her head like horns Alexa softly stroked the cloth and it yielded pleasantly at her touch, the finely weaved fabric smooth and soothing on her skin. Looking left and right out of habit, she finally shrugged her shoulders and put it on, not thinking much further on the subject of it's origin as it slipped easily up her arms. It was oddly cozy, the long sleeves reaching just past her fingertips and the bottom of the shirt reaching about mid-thigh. Discrete pearly white buttons went way past her hipbones and the garment fit almost like a dress on Alexa's almost petite frame. She smiled softly at the quaintness of the whole thing. Then the routine state of mind returned and she started searching for the flaws in the security of the room, like one would examine the lock on the safe before you decide on a technique with which to open it. The door was out of the question, she was too weak to even think of breaking it down. Window? Alexa parted the curtains with a flourish and was temporarily blinded by the sun. From the looks of it's position it was around noon, or at least midday. The window was, of course, locked. She was about to pound on the window itself before she looked down and realized she was at least six stories up. In the end she climbed up on the wide windowsill and fell asleep in the sun, leaning against the high glass, dreaming of music and the colour blue. This was how Stan found her six hours later, asleep against the window as the lights of New York cast a soft warm glow on her pale skin. \" As the birds pluck his eyes, the sun bleaches his bones. See his entrails get scattered, watch him lose his cajones, ay yay!... (Spoken) Here in the Mojave Desert, animals have had millions of years to adapt to the harsh environment. But the lizard? He is going to die.\"[Chapter 7] Yet another chapter about our beloved Stan and Alexa! Song: Moment of Madness by Katie Melua Only your Life \" A moment of madness It's happened before It could turn into sadness or a civil war You've got me changing all I ever thought\" Alexa woke up with her left temple pressed against the cold window, her wound throbbing from being in an uncomfortable position too long. Her right hand went to drag through her head but when she moved to lift it her skin brushed against warm cloth instead of cold air. Her eyes settled on the beige thing covering her legs as well as parts of her arms. She lifted it to get a better look of it and at the same moment she realized what it was a distinctively male smell hit her nose. Not a bad smell, just definitely manly. 'Stan...Wait,wait, hold a phone! STANSFIELD! Never \"Stan.\" Jeez girl, wake up already!' She really had not woken up yet. But why did she have Stansfield's probably very expensive suit jacket over her? 'He must have come home while I slept.' That thought worried and enraged her. She should have stayed awake to kick his ass as soon as he entered that door! Said door was now wide open. Alexa pursed her lips in determination. 'No matter, I can kick it now.' Grabbing the jacket she gingerly rose to her feet, muscles stretching uncomfortably as she walked through the door into what she chose to call the living room. Looking around she saw large windows, the door to the bathroom from the day before, 'horrible, embarrassing, thought' , a separate room behind a wall, probably the kitchen, and to her right was a large grand piano that she had somehow missed the day before. She smiled slightly at the sight of it, and upon closer inspection discovered it was an old Steinway. A bit rough around the edges but it looked like a lovely instrument. A smooth voice interrupter her admiration. \"It was my mother's.\" Alexa whirled around at a speed that would impress any ballet dancer to see Stansfield leaning in the doorway leading to the kitchen. The look on his face stopped any further questions that bubbled up in Alexa's mind. 'Something is wrong here' He looked at her so intently she could only stand there gaping like a fish until he caught sight of the forgotten jacket in her hand. She followed his gaze, almost feeling as if she herself had forgotten what she held on to. A menacing but simultaneously gentle grin spread across his lips. 'How does he do that?!' \"Sleep well?\" Alexa swallowed and nodded, worrying her lower lip. He smiled wider, like a shark. \"Good.\" This time his tone was easy, too light to be fully normal. He still hadn't shaved since last she saw him, the slight beard and moustache giving him a rugged look. And, having obviously removed his jacket, he still wore beige pants and white dress shirt. Averting her eyes Alexa suddenly found the hem of his jacket very interesting, his close scrutiny unnerving her more than any kind of violence ever could. His lips were still twitching slightly every now and then, as if he thought of something that tickled him slightly but not enough to smile fully. \" A smiling assassin The demon within\" All of a sudden an alarm sounded from the kitchen, breaking the unbearable tension. Stansfield's face took on a pleased look, turning to walk into the kitchen. \" You like pasta?\" Okay, now Alexa was thoroughly confused, she couldn't resist following him. The sight that met her made her eyebrows practically raise till they were hovering above her head like a cartoon character's. \" You cook? I mean, you Actually cook?!\" Believe it or not, Alexa had never Ever dated a man who could cook. She'd heard rumours they existed but never put any deep faith in them. Here was the proof to prove her wrong. Stan looked at her oddly, now openly amused. \" Problem?\" Alexa narrowed her eyes at him. \" Men don't cook. \" He chuckled, the sound rippling through Alexa's body like a river, teasing something searingly hot inside her abdomen. \" Well, Alexa Rivers, I do.\" She flinched at hearing her full name from his lips, it suddenly flowed in an entirely new way. She frowned. \"I keep forgetting you're a cop. \" While she had been frowning he had poured off the spaghetti and mixed it with some bacon and something else she didn't quite know what it was. \" If that's your way of asking if I've read the file we have on you, then yes, I have. And oh what an interesting file it is. You have quite the colorful past, my dear. \" Alexa instinctively took a step back. \" Well, what did it say?\" Stan looked at her tense stature, eyebrows furrowing. \" Nothing too incriminating.\" He turned and stepped towards her, pointing at her with a spoon. \" What did you think it would say?\" It was only then that Alexa realized her mistake that she had unwittingly alerted him of something she feared. Stan looked suddenly very serious and came closer. Alexa stod stock still in the middle of his kitchen. \" Aah, they missed something didn't they? \" He stood at a close distance now, like a good friend or, heavens forbid, a lover might. 'Shit. He's taller than me.' The hand with the spoon raised slowly to trace the rounded part of the cool metal, gently, against her cheek. \" You got a criminal past, little Alexa Rivers?\" She managed, heroically, to suppress a shiver as he spoke. \" Endorphins are raging Resistance is thin\" Stan seemed to be waiting for something, it was as if he could sense that she was close to her first breaking point. Not her deepest downfall, but enough to maybe spill the beans about her past. He had sensed it when he read her file, it was hiding something. Or she would clam up even more, it could go either way. But that was the fun of it. His eyes watched her entire face and the upper part of her chest around her collarbone. The spoon trailed past her jaw bone and down the side of her throat, Stan now so very close, she could feel his breath against the skin around her collarbone. This time she was defenceless when the spoon hit a certain point on her skin and her whole body shuddered violently and her eyes closed at the sensation. Stan put his free left hand against her hip to steady her and she grabbed at his arm, his jacket forgotten on the floor beside her. This happened only for a few seconds before her eyes flew open in panic only to be met by a vicious smirk. He had won. Alexa shoved him off of her but even when he'd let go she could feel his palm print burning on her hip, her breathing suddenly somewhat ragged, pulse beating like a drum in her ear. She suddenly felt very angry. \" What am I doing here? Huh? Why here?! This is where you live for fucks sake! Why would you keep me HERE?! Only an idiot, a major imbecile, would take that risk! So why, why?!\" While yelling at him she had closed in on him and for once it was he who was against the wall. It was short lived however, and Alexa failed to see the cold rage that spread like wildfire through his ice blue eyes. \" You know I'm not asking a lot, Only your life, I don't want to get what I want, But I'm willing to try, And I'm gonna ask you to stop, But I'm full of lies\" Three red seconds later she found herself against the wall, his right hand clasping her entire lower face as his body towered over her, boxing her in and his left resting against the wall behind her. Only the clattering of the spoon against the floor could be heard. It was Stan's turn to breathe like a raged lunatic and he wanted to yell at her, frighten her, simply be angry with her, but the usual repertoire of scathing words he usually threw at people who pissed him off royally seemed to have vanished. Instead he settled for whatever came to mind, leaning down to hiss calmly in her ear, not missing the way she tensed up. 'Odd.' \" I keep you HERE because it is the only place I know you can't escape from. Now I know that you are not stupid, you crack safes every day, you would have no difficulty cracking people. But I'm not people, sweetheart. I'm like you.\" And with that he released her, leaving her in the kitchen to collect herself while he moved the pasta and some plates into the living room, calling to her over his shoulder, \" I hope you like pasta carbonara!\", his tone back to the easy melody that picked at her insides like a hot poker. Alexa rubbed at her sore jaw, it would probably bruise. It was now that Alexa Rivers understood just how deep in shit she had landed herself, all because of the smooth voice of a madman. \" And you're blowing my mind ' Cause I find that your theories of life Are insane, feed my brain I could listen all night I can't leave till we kiss It's a moment of madness\" Please review guys! Let me hear your thoughts :)[Chapter 8] Just a short chapter, it's all I've got time for at the moment. Blame my school, not me! Enjoy! And please review! Song: Cat People(Putting out the fire) - David Bowie \" See these eyes so green I can stare for a thousand years Colder than the moon It's been so long\" \"Eventually, people will start looking for me, you know.\" Stan looked at the woman who was looking out the window, down at the streets where the bustling movements of life took place every day, ignorant of her imprisonment. He felt a small needle prick at his heart when he thought of the words that would come out of his mouth in the next two seconds. \" No they won't.\" She turned her head to look at him. \" What do you mean?\" Suspicion laced her voice before her eyes widened. \" What did you do?\" He smiled slightly, but it didn't reach his eyes. \" I signed you up for a vacation. You haven't had one in years, according to your records. You're off for at least six weeks, and then you still have a few sick days left to use. So no, no one will think it odd if you don't show up for work for a while. \" His voice had an almost innocent tone to it, the key word here being almost . Nothing about Norman Stansfield was ever completely innocent. It had been almost a week since he brought her to his home. The third day he had gone back to her apartment and packed everything that he thought she might want, like clothes, toiletries, etc. Boring stuff, but it had made the ice in Alexa's eyes melt just slightly. His lips twitched at the memory. She had just been swearing him to hell and back when he abruptly dropped the bag in front of her and left to do something else. She had yet to say thank you. He giggled slightly behind his newspaper at the memory. \" You. You have the audacity to Giggle?! I'll be stuck here for lord knows how long, it's even quite probable that I'll never get leave at all, ever, and you sit there GIGGLING! Shame on you, you-you- you quartz brained MAGGOT!\" She ripped the paper from his hands and tore it to pieces in anger, feeling the need to disturb his existence in return, even if just slightly. It could be ages before anyone noticed she was gone! Who would be there to notice if not her colleagues at work? She was doomed, and she knew it. Stan leaned back and looked at her for a few minutes while she leaned against the window, both hands propping her up. He rose slowly, walking towards her cautiously, like one would close in on a wounded animal. 'Which she is in a way'. When he was right behind her he put both hands on her thin shoulders, they felt bony beneath his palms and ragged breaths wracked her body as she struggled to cope. He felt her stiffen further when his fingers secured his grip but he didn't move further, standing comfortably still as he looked down at the street over her shoulder. \" I think I understand why you are so...upset over my little vacation plan.\" Alexa scoffed. \" Oh yeah? \" \" Yeah. I do.\" \" Well enlighten me then.\" Stan hummed amusedly at her irritation, letting his chin rest on the top of her black-blue tresses. \" You're upset because no one will notice you're gone. Isn't that right? Sweetheart?\" At that word, that single endearment, Alexa knew just how much trouble she was in. While he was speaking Stan let his hands stroke down over her shoulders, smoothing the short sleeves of her green t-shirt down and then stroking down the skin of her lower arms to finally find purchase around her wrists, his fingers closing around them in a warm secure grip, a grip that could tighten in an instant if she made the wrong move. \" I knew when I visited your apartment. No plans in the calender, just work work work. No photos of you and your friends at some party or other event.\" His nose nuzzled her ear. \" No family pictures. You're all alone in the world.\" He was a snake, slithering around her, whispering seductive deceptive nothings in her ear. Or a spider, weaving his sticky web around an innocent fly. Alexa jolted suddenly and started thrashing against his now restraining hands. \" Get away from me asshole!\" He pulled her wrists down, pinning then against her own body with one arm and with the other hand he grasped her chin, forcing her gaze to the street below. \" Look at that. All those people walking past every day, boyfriends, girlfriends, mothers, fathers, families. But not you. You don't have any family down there. No boyfriend that will come to your rescue.\" Alexa struggled against his grip but he held firm, using his body to pin her against the glass. It seemed they stood there for a long time, Alexa trying desperately to break free until she wore herself out. Her wound throbbed, even if it was healing nicely it was still sensitive. \" See these eyes so red Red like jungle burning bright Those who feel me near Pull the blinds and change their minds It's been so long\" \"Why are you all alone, Alexa?\" Said woman was breathing heavily by now, her head held up by Stan. She closed her eyes. Breathing for a minute she opened them again, a new layer of steel coating them. \" I could ask you the same. Norman . Why are YOU all alone? This condo barely looks lived in, you never talk on the phone with anyone other than people from work, I know I eavesdropped, and the only trace of another person is the piano which you say was your mother's. Otherwise, it's just you , isn't it?\" The man behind her was very still. Alexa got the feeling she had said too much. Way too much. She closed her eyes, expecting him to lash out in anger at any moment now. But instead of hurting her, she felt the arm trapping her own against her waist soften around her, just holding gently. The hand holding her chin slid down to hold onto her shoulder so his arm crossed her chest. His answer came whispered in her ear. \" I'm like you.\" and with those words Alexa relaxed and rested on of her hands on his arm circling her waist. Stan rested his head on the top of hers, both looking out at the hordes of people traversing the busy streets of New York, neither of them knowing quite what was happening or what they were going to do about it. \" See these tears so blue An ageless heart that can never mend These tears can never dry A judgement made can never bend See these eyes so green I can stare for a thousand years Just be still with me You wouldn't believe what I've been thru\" ","Summary":" \" Good god you're coming up with reasons Good god you're dragging it out Good god it's the changin"},{"Movie":"Bodyguard, 1992","Title":"Rachel is missing","Author":"CC Niles Forever and Always","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9755937","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It's been a few years since Rachel and Frank have spoken or even saw each other. One day Bill her manger calls Frank and saids \"Frank we need your help, Rachel is missing\". He saids \"What When did this happen\"? Bill saids a week now we don't know if shes has been kidnapped or might even be killed now\". Frank saids \"Wasn't Tony watching her or anything I can't believe she is gone there must be a mistake\". Bill saids \"No mistake she's gone we need you\". Frank saids alright I will be in squirrel hill soon let me pack my things and I will be on my way\". Bill saids ok with fear Rachel is in danger he sends out Tony to look for her and then starts to call the cops. He tells the cops that she has been missing for a week and the last time that Bill saw her was at a restaurant named \"Sadie's Diner\" with some friends. Then described what she looked liked. They said \"they would investigate this situation and hopefully bring her back safely as sound. Then Frank calls and saids to Bill \"I will be there by tonight and I will be hunting and looking for her\". Bill said \"I know you still love her\". He saids \"no I want her to be safe and at home\". Bill saids \"believe what you want but you do still love her and I know she loves you back but didn't get a chance to say it\". There is a silence in the phone then Frank saids \"there were a lot of things that weren't said and I wish we didn't have to go our own ways and that our careers didn't put pressure on us\". Bill saids \"in time it will tell if you're meant to be and I only hope we will find her in time so you can tell her how you feel and she can tell you how she feels\". Frank saids \"well I am about a mile away I will see you then and I will drag Tony with me to find her\". Bill laughs and saids \"Ok you do that and I will remind him why we liked you so much\". Frank saids yeah and what ever happened to Fletcher\"? Bill explains that Fletcher \"years ago moved out and that he graduated from Harvard law school got married and now is expecting his son to be born in a few months\". Frank asks \"Did Fletcher ever talk to Rachel before she went missing\"? Bill saids \"No because when she called him, that morning it went to the answering machine and that was that\". Frank saids \"You don't think there both missing do you?\" Bill saids \"No I don't\". Frank saids \"Ok well I'm in the driveway have tony come out we are going Rachel hunting\". Bill laughs and tells Frank \"ok he's on his way\". Tony comes out and in the car and they head down the road. Frank asks Tony \"Where did you last see her\"? Tony saids \"at the restaurant with Bill\". Frank saids \"ok did anyone look suspicious to you\"? Tony saids no they were all people I meant before\". Frank saids \"ok was there anyone that looked like they were going after Rachel\"? Tony saids \"No but the waiter was very rude to her\" Frank saids \"How were they rude\"? Tony saids \"they told her to hurry her order and that they were closing soon but it was only noon\". Frank saids \"let's stop there first to make sure no one has seen her\". So they head to Sadie's Diner and they ask the waiter some questions regarding a week ago. The waiter saids\"I saw her when she ate here but I did not see her leave here\". Frank saids \"ok did you see anyone that would have thrown her into a car and take here away\". The waiter saids \"no but I did see a guy that was starting at her all threw her lunch\". Frank saids \"what did they look like\"? The waiter saids \"Long dark hair, blue eyes, about 6ft 5, Caucasian and had a red and black shirt on along with jeans\". Frank saids \"ok do you know the guy\". The waiter saids \"No but he drives a black Cadillac\". Frank saids \"thanks for the help\". Then him and Tony head back to Squirrel hill and contact the local cop station and give them some information they know.[Chapter 2] Frank and Tony head to the cops station and tell them all the information they have and then they tell them they will be looking into this case more and more now. Frank and Tony then head back, to Rachel's to find Fletcher there. Fletcher asks \"what is going on where in the hell is mom\"? Frank saids \"we don't know we only know she is missing\". Frank asks him when she talked to you last \"was she hanging out with some old guy friends\"? Fletcher saids \"no but she did say she was having dinner at Sadie's Diner\". Frank saids \"ok do you know if she was going to meet a guy there\"? Fletcher saids \"no but did say my father called her\". Frank saids \"ok and what did he want\"? Fletcher saids\" I don't know all I know is that he wanted to get information about me and she didn't want to give it to him\". Frank saids ok \"do you think he could have kidnapped her\"? Fletcher saids \"no I don't I think he still loves her and wants her\". Frank saids \"ok then what is your biological father's name\"? He tells him \"Jackson Albert Simmons\". Frank saids \"ok well we will see about him and his back ground\". Frank goes and finds Tony and tells him to call the cop station and look up this name. He asks why? Frank saids\" because it is Fletchers father and we need to know if he is a criminal that would kidnap Rachel\". So Tony calls the station and they say that his file shows nothing of a criminal act. Tony saids ok thanks and tells Frank. Then Frank saids\" well then we need to wait until new evidence is placed\". Then the cops call back on the guy at the restaurant and saids he is a criminal of act. Frank saids \"would he kidnap Rachel knowing her bodyguard and manger were there\"? They say \"it's hard to tell he was once arrested for kidnapping his daughter\". Frank saids ok \"so where should we start his daughter or what\"? They say try to the daughter then the ex wife. So Frank and Tony head to Los Angelo's where the daughter is. They ask her when she was kidnapped \"where her father took her\"? She saids \"I don't remember all I remember it was dark and I was 8 at the time of the event\". They ask her if he hit her? She saids no but did threatened to kill me if told anyone. Frank then asks \"Where does he live\"? she saids \"Northern Street\". Then she asks \"is he in trouble\". Frank saids \"deeply we think he has Rachel Marron hostage\". She saids no I think you have the wrong guy he would never do that\". Frank saids I think he would, he kidnapped you don't you remember\"? She saids \"of course, but not a celebrity like her\". Frank saids \"believe what you want but when the truth is out I won't feel sorry for you\"[Chapter 3] Meanwhile at the station, Frank gets a call from an unknown number. He answers it hoping it is Rachel but all he hears is a soft sigh and some crying in the back round. He can't tell if it's Rachel so he politely asks the person to leave him alone and then he hangs up. Tony knows something is going on but can't tell what. He asks Frank what's up. Frank saids I do not know some crazy person called but it's not problem. Then the police tell them that they should ask around to see if anybody has information regarding Rachel. Frank saids I am not going to stand around and wait to see her dead on TV I am going to find her if it kills me. Then he gets another call but this time it is a man's voice telling him to stay away from Rachel before he kills her. Frank asks who this is but they don't answer. He saids to \"leave her be and she is safe\". Frank saids \"no she is not and I am going to ask again who this is\"? They don't answer but hang up the phone. Frank saids shit\" and tells tony to tell the police to track his phone. They start to when all their systems crash. Frank saids \"Tony get in the car we are going hunting for this jack wad. They both start to drive down the road when the caller calls again and threatens to kill Rachel. Frank saids \"Leave her be or you will not like me when I find your pathetic ass\". Tony then takes the phone and saids\" hey jackwad you may want to listen to us or you will be dead when we find you\" and \"Rachel honey we are going to rescue you if it kills us\". The mystery voice saids that if you don't stay away from her I will let this bomb go off and I will kill her. Frank saids I don't think so cause I can track you down and I will find you before you do. Mystery man saids oh you will wont you. Frank saids yeah I will and goodbye. He tells Tony to track the number down while he does that he saids it's from 37Ridgeroad and three houses down. They get there but there is no car there is only a letter saying\" Rachel will die if this continues. They get back into the car to realize the house explodes in the back of them.[Chapter 4] Meanwhile in Rachel's house the phones keep ringing and asking where is she, and Sy keeps telling them we do not know anything once we find something out we will call. Sy calls Frank and asks how the search is going? Frank saids we don't know who it is but they do have Rachel indeed they called me and threatened to kill her if I don't back off. Sy saids Can you track him? Frank saids no because he could be anywhere from here to squirrel hill. Sy saids yeah you are right I have not heard one thing but if I do I will let you know. Frank tells Sy to call the police station and have them look up the one mysterious guy at the restaurant again and have them call the ex wife and see if she has anything to say about this. Sy saids sure thing but I also do not trust that it isn't Fletchers father. Frank saids until I know more I am not going to suspect him into kidnapping her. Sy saids ok and gives the phone to Bill. Bill saids I know Jackson he isn't the type to kidnap and he isn't the one who would try and take her from the celebrity business. Frank saids I know but I do have a feeling that the guy from the restaurant might be involved can you do me a favor and see if he has an email account and has said anything to or about Rachel. Sy gets back on the phone and saids the ex wife saids that he did say something about bringing a new girl home but did not specify what her name was. Frank said thanks Sy I am on my way to find that SOB and he is going to die. So Frank and Tony once again head down the road and go back to the daughter's house demanding her to tell them where her father is and where Rachel is. She saids I don't know where Rachel could be all I know is that he lives over on Kay road in the back hills try there if not then I have no clue only other thought is the log house in the woods on Trey Road. They say we will try these roads thanks. After they leave the daughter calls her dad and saids they are on their way to your house watch it. Tony and Frank head down the road and start talking about a plan. Frank saids you will go in the back door and I will go in the front to startle him.[Chapter 5] So Tony and Frank head down Kay road, they knock on the first door and the guy saids I don't know this guy I know he does not live on this road\". They said thank you and they head down Trey road they find an old log house and Tony goes around back. Frank knocks on the door then kicks it down because of no answer. Frank searches all the rooms but does not find anyone. Then he hears a scream coming from the end room. He goes into the room where he does find Rachel. She is tied from head to toes and screams more for help. Then the guy of the restaurant who turns out his name is Jeremy then tries to head choke Frank. Tony runs to into the house and kicks the shit out of Jeremy and then unties Frank who unties Rachel. Frank tells Rachel to run but then the daughter runs in and ties Rachel back up. Tony then grabs a rope and ties the daughter and Jeremy and they all get in Franks car and head home. The daughter then screams that death will fall on Rachel and that she should pay. Tony then asks himself what the hell this means? Frank does the same and after they are all in the car Frank calls Sy and saids we got her we are on our way home. They drive until they reach the police station where they drop off the daughter and Jeremy and they drive Rachel home. Rachel tells Frank \"thank you for saving me\" Frank saids you are welcome. Frank asks her \"how did this all happen? She saids at the restaurant he started to talk to me and then all of a sudden tied me and put me in his car. Frank saids well now its over and done with, Rachel saids idk he said if I did escape he would come back for me? Frank saids who would come back for you? She saids idk I think someone else is responsible for all of this. Knowing this Frank then realized I need to stay and protect her. Then Frank calls Sy and Bill and tells them everything and then they realize she is more in trouble than ever before we need to keep her safe and away from publicly for a while. Rachel now knowing what this was causing was not sure if she was able to be herself again or not but more trouble was about to occur again,[Chapter 6] When they get back to Rachel's house, Frank tells her go pack your things I am taking you to my dads house for a while. Sy saids why? He will probably go after her there, then Frank saids \"You know Sy I am getting pretty sick of your shit lately all you give a damn about is you and your damn publicity and right now it is causing a great deal of danger to Rachel\" Sy saids \"I don't know why you are considering to take her there when you know there is a great chance he will follow you there and take her away again\" Frank who has enough of this saids \"You know Sy this is what I think of you and your shit and Frank punches him in the face and saids I better not hear any of this nonscience ever again come out of your mouth. Bill walks in to Sy bleeding and saids \"Well now we know where Sy stands in Franks mind. Frank saids \"I will be back I am going to see how she is doing\" He calls upstairs to Rachel and saids \"You about ready it is an four hour trip\". She saids yeah but can you ask Tony to come since there is a possibility that this guy will try something\". Frank ensures her nothing is gonna happen but still saids I will see if he wants to go. Frank askes Tony and he saids no I am gonna stay here tell her that she will be fine there is no need for both of us\". Frank tells her what Tony saids and she agrees. Then askes Frank if he is ready to go, he saids yes. They head down the road and start on a new adventure. They take turns driving but its Rachel who gets a call by a werid number and does not answer it. By the third hour they pulled over for something to eat and Rachel tells him that a weird number has been trying to get a hold of her all night. She gives him the number and he calls it. But they do not answer. He comes back and tells her to keep an eye on it. The waitress askes them what they both want to drink. Frank saids \"Orange Juice\". Rachel laughs. Then, Rachel saids, lemonade. Then about five minutes latter she comes back with the drinks and askes them what they want to eat? Frank orders a steak and potatoes while Rachel just has a salad. Then about 10 mins latter food is out they eat and then hit the road for another hour. After that hour they hit Franks house and they settle for the night.

It was only the second week of school and it was her third trip. The only reason why she was there was because she got into an argument with her English teacher who liked to be a bitch to her. She was starting her senior year at a new school, a public school since she and her mother moved back to Los Angeles. Rachel had called off her engagement to the owner of one of the world's biggest winery. It was too late for Logan to register again for private school so she settled for public. The principal was a strict bitch who looked at Logan and only saw a snobbish rich kid. Having Rachel Marron for a mother didn't exactly help either, but Logan was proud of who she was and where she came from. \"Ms. Farmer you can go in now\" the secretary said to her. Logan went in and sat down \"I understand you had an altercation with a teacher\" the principal said \"Yes I did\" \"Can you tell me what happened?\" the principal asked and Logan went on to tell her the story \"Ms. Farmer you realize this is your third time being in my office\" \"I didn't ask to come here\" \"No need to be smart about it Ms. Farmer, how long do you plan on being at this school\" \"Well with the way things are going I don't think it will be much longer\" \"We have parent- teacher night this Friday and I am sure your parent's would love to come.\" \"I think they have better things to do Mrs. Ashmore\" \"I want to schedule a parent teacher meeting that night also with them. Here take this home and give it to them. And the next time I see you back in here it better only be for that. Go back to class\" She gave Logan the note and excused her. Logan went down the hall to her locker and got her books for the next class. She was already kicked out of the previous so she might as well wait for the next. This was her last class and then afterwards she could go home. She waited by her locker until the bell rung and then she went off to advanced chemistry. As she sat there tuning the teacher out she thought about everything that was going on in her life. She hated this school, she really didn't care to have any friends or much of a social life. She and her mother were close again, thanks to her would have been step father. He turned out to be a jack ass and Logan was glad he was exposed before Rachel made a huge mistake. The biggest mistake her mother ever made was not marrying her father. Frank was running through the park doing his afternoon run a little early. He stopped and sat on a bench to take a rest and not long after a female jogger came and sit by him. \"Hello\" she said \"Hello\" he repeated back \"How is your run going?\" \"I'm getting there\" \"You come here often?\" she asked \"I just started again, but most of the time I jog in the evening\" \"Well it's a little too early for you isn't it\" she joked \"Well I have the rest of the day off but I'm going to be busy later on. So I wanted to get it done now\" \"I'm Ava\" she said extending her hand out to him \"Frank nice to meet you\" Rachel was in her office on the phone talking with Bill. Bill was away on vacation, but Rachel wanted to talk about business. \"Why do you want to retire Bill?\" \"Rachel we can talk about this when I get back you know that right\" \"But it's been bugging me ever since you told me three days ago\" \"I know but I am on vacation Rachel\" \"Just tell me now and I won't bother you again until you get back\" \"Well I've been in the business for three decades, I'm getting old, and my favorite client just got off her farewell tour. So she is going to be retiring soon too\" \"Yeah but you and I still have a business to run, were a team\" \"What business are we going to run Rachel?\" \"Our record label\" \"Rachel are you serious?\" \"Yes I am serious, we already have the talent and my record company is looking to sell and I want to buy!\" \"It's not like it used to be Rachel, it's risky \" \"It's always been a risky business. We both know what we would be doing, we know the business!\" \"Can we talk about this when I get back\" Bill asked as Rachel heard a car door slam and seen out the window that her daughter was home. \"Yeah I have to go anyway Logan is back\" \"Alright, tell her, her godfather loves her\" \"I will bye bye\" Rachel hung up the phone and left the room to go greet her child. Logan walked in glad to be home but fretting to tell her mother about the note \"Hey baby\" \"Hey mom\" Logan went to her mother and gave her a hug \"How was your day?\" \"Boring\" \"Did you learn anything?\" \"Trigonometry wanna learn?\" \"Not really haven't studied that since my days of high school\" \"Which was like what the late 70s?\" \"What are you trying to say your mother is old?\" \"Come on mom you know I'd never say it to your face\" she smiled \"You better be nice\" \"I am being nice\" she said still holding her mother \"And how was your day?\" Rachel let her go and led her to the kitchen \"It was ok, I had a couple of things to do business wise and then I went shopping\" \"Bought me something?\" Logan asked putting down her backpack and taking a seat at the bar \"The bags are upstairs in your room\" 'Thanks mom! So wanna come have lunch with me? I'm buying\" \"Really\" Rachel was skeptic and surprised \"Yeah we've been busy since we moved back and haven't really had any time to spend together. I miss our mother and daughter bonding time\" \"I miss it too sweetheart. I know these last few months haven't been easy for you or me, but I promise to make it up to you\" \"You don't have to make anything up to me mom, as long as were on the same page we have no problems.\" Logan was referring to the fights she and Rachel had had while living in Napa. Logan was going through a rebellious stage and was defying Rachel to the fullest. She hated Rachel's ex fiancé and made it very well known. Now she regretted what she did and was trying to make it up to her mother herself. Logan changed clothes and she and Rachel left to go eat lunch and see a movie. The two ladies were seated at the restaurant waiting for their food to arrive. Logan thought it would be a good time to bring up the principal's note. \"There is parent- teacher night this Friday at school\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah you and dad can come and meet my boring ass teachers… \"Watch your mouth\" Rachel told her \"And see the work I have done so far, sorry\" \"Well I can't wait and you can tell your dad tonight when he comes over for dinner\" \"And you and dad have a meeting with my principal and English teacher too\" \"What? Why?\" \"I got into it with my teacher today and she sent me to the office for the third time\" \"The third time, but school just started. Logan Marron Farmer!\" Rachel said getting upset with her child \"You know how I am with authority figures\" \"Well your going to really have it tough in the real world. What happened?\" \"We had a disagreement like always\" \"Like always? Your supposed to do what your teacher tells you to do, I don't care how wrong she is she is the teacher. Have some respect\" \"I would show some respect if they didn't act like idiots\" \"Logan I want you to apologize to your teacher tomorrow when you get to class\" \"But Mom\" \"No buts, and I will find out if you did it or not\" Rachel always got the final word and Logan had to respect that, no matter how much she hated it. There food eventually arrived and they moved onto other subjects. \"So dad's coming to dinner tonight?\" Logan asked \"Yeah he just got back from New York today and he called and said he wanted to hang out\" \"Hang out huh\" Logan smirked \"Yeah… what?\" \"Nothing\" \"Yeah you want to say something\" \"No I don't, I will keep my comments to myself\" \"Say what you need to say\" \"You and dad have been in contact a lot lately\" \"So\" \"And I'm just wondering what's going on\" \"Nothing is going on, we are still really close friends\" \"Who used to be lovers and have a child together\" \"I still love him, he is the father of my two children. But there is nothing else there between us\" \"Then why haven't you two found love yet?\" \"Because I am not looking, I don't know what his excuse is\" \"Why did you almost get married?\" \"Because at the time I was looking for someone to finally settle with, and that didn't work out like I planned.\" \"Cause your still love sick over dad\" \"I am not, and your father sure isn't either\" \"How do you know?\" \"If we still had a thing for each other don't you think we would have done something about it a long time ago?\" \"I guess your right\" \"I am always right! Can we talk about something else?\" \"What do you want to talk about?\" \"How is your love life going?\" \"I don't have one\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I don't want one, I don't have time for BS! Why should I have to worry about if him dating and some other girl on the side. All they like to do is play games and try to get into my pants. \" \"Frank and I raised a smart girl, I am so proud of you honey!\" Rachel said holding her daughter's hand \"It's the truth, just the other day two girls were fighting over a boy who wasn't even worth it. He wasn't cute or anything but there they were beating each other up over him. That's insane!\" \"What if you were in that situation and you really cared about him, would you fight?\" \"Hell no! If your going to cheat might as well free yourself because I don't want you\" \"That's my girl!\" \"I'm your only girl\" \"And my best friend.\" \"I'm your best friend?\" \"Yeah who else can I trust in this world besides you and your brother.\" \"You trust dad too right? After all he did save your life\" Logan told her mother, which Rachel had to then rephrase her answer \"You three are the only ones in this world that I love and trust, and the only family I have!\" Frank stopped in front the gates of Rachel's home and used the code to enter. He and his girls were going shopping together to pick up the food that was needed to cook. He drove down the long driveway and parked next to Rachel's car and got down. He hoped that they would be ready to go since they always like to take forever getting dressed to go out in public. He thought they didn't need to do anything because they were already beautiful just the way they are. He walked into an empty corridor \"Guys I'm here\" \"We'll be down in a second Frank\" Rachel said from upstairs Frank sighed, he would be waiting for a while so he went into the living room and flicked on the tv Back upstairs Rachel was trying to finish getting ready but Logan kept bothering her \"Come on mom wear something sexy for dad!\" \"I am not dressing sexy for your father and what is wrong with what I have on?\" \"Nothing your always stylish, but this is dad mom! Jeans, a black undershirt underneath, and a white blouse just won't work!\" \"Logan get it through your teenage little head, I am not after your father. And I am certainly not trying to impress him\" \"Fine! Fine… I wonder what he is wearing\" She said getting off the bed and going to meet him \"That child I tell you\" \"Hey dad!\" Logan said coming into the room and Frank stood up for a hug \"Hi honey!\" \"I missed you\" \"I missed you too, how is my princess?\" \"I'm great, and how was New York?\" \"It would have been better if you had come like the last time\" \"I know, school gets in the way of everything\" \"How was school today? Still adjusting to the new atmosphere?\" \"It's like any of the other schools I attended, except less strict and more action… and people\" Logan looked her father up and down. He was looking very handsome, turns out her parents would be wearing something very similar. \"What's wrong you keep looking at me funny?\" he asked \"Nothing dad, you look great! Been working out?\" \"Yeah trying to lose this little cute I've developed with old age\" \"Dad your not old\" \"I'm 55\" \"That's not old your still middle age\" \"Wasn't it a couple of weeks ago you were telling me that I was too old to understand your generation's choice of music?\" \"I was just saying that because you wouldn't let me go to that Little Wayne concert\" \"And I still don't understand how you all can listen to that crap\" \"It's not crap dad, it's quality music, sometimes\" \"Yeah ok\" Just then Rachel came downstairs ready to go \"Sorry to keep you guys waiting\" She said going over to Frank and hugged him \"It's no problem I'm used to it\" \"Alright then let's go Logan said to them grabbing her dad's keys from him.\" \"Wait your driving?\" asked Frank \"Yeah dad come on\" They left the house and Logan got into Frank's 2011 Chevy Silverado. Rachel and Frank tried to decide who would sit in the passenger seat. \"I'll get into the back, you sit in the front Rachel\" \"No I'm fine with sitting in the back\" \"No you can sit in the front, I get paranoid with Logan behind the wheel anyway!\" \"Dad I don't drive bad\" \"So you think\" They got into the truck and headed for the store, but before leaving Logan pulled out her ipod and connected it to the truck's system. \"What is she doing?\" he asked Rachel \"I don't know\" Rachel said back Logan scrolled down to her rap play list and turned up the volume. All of a sudden they heard the bass line go boom and Frank and Rachel immediately covered their ears. Logan hurried up and turned the volume down after getting looks from her parents. \"Sorry\" she apologized[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Frank and Rachel were near the produce picking out tomatoes and other veggies, when Logan came over with the bottom of her shirt filled with candy. They watched as she dumped them into the basket and then gave her a funny look. \"What?\" she said \"Do you really need all of that Logan?\" her father asked \"Yeah\" \"Baby that's just being greedy\" Rachel told her \"It's not for me, my art teacher wants us to come up with some form of art and I am using candy\" \"Oh\" Frank said \"But I still have to stock up on my junk\" she said walking away Rachel sighed \"She get's that from you\" \"Me?\" \"Yes, you have a shelf full of junk food at your place, I can guarantee that!\" \"Not anymore I am laying off the sweets now\" \"You still go running everyday?\" \"Yeah in the evening when it's not hot\" \"Why aren't you using the treadmill I bought you for Christmas?\" \"I rather run outside, I love the outdoors\" \"You should come swimming with me too. Help you get back into shape\" \"I look that bad?\" \"Frank your not fat, you've just put on little bit more pounds now that your older\" \"I am getting old\" Frank said looking at the mirrors above the fruits and vegetables \"Look at these wrinkles and grey's\" \"I love your grey's\" she said sweetly smiling \"Yeah I love yours too\" he joked \"Wait what?\" Rachel started freaking out and looked in the mirror too trying to find the grey's Frank was talking about \"I'm just kidding\" he said wrapping his arms around her waist and giving her a kiss on the cheek \"Frank?\" \"Yeah\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Kissing your gorgeous face\" \"Well can't it wait until later were in public here!\" \"So…\" \"So people love to gossip to the rag mags, if they see us then they'll think the engagement was called off because I was cheating\" \"That's not a good look that I want Frank, and our daughter is some where's around here\" \"Well he cheated first and we'll have to tell her one of these days. She wants us back together just as much as we do\" \"I just wanna wait until everything has died down. Come on get off me\" \"Alright I'm getting off, just like I will be later tonight. I missed you while I was in New York!\" he was telling her, just then Logan came back with more junk food. \"Ok this is all I want okay mom\" \"Ok whatever it's your money\" \"I thought you were buying!\" \"I just bought you over a hundred dollars worth of stuff today. And you can't buy five dollars worth of candy?\" \"I forgot my wallet\" \"I'll pay for it don't worry\" \"Thanks daddy!\" Logan said hugging her father and sticking the tongue out to her mother and Rachel stuck hers back. The three of them continued walking down the aisle picking out food \"So dad what are you cooking for us?\" \"Apricot Chicken\" \"Sounds yummy\" said Logan \"It is\" Rachel said \"You've cooked that for mom before?\" Logan was snooping for information \"No I've tried it while I was in Italy, this was before you were born\" Rachel told her stopping in front of a shelf full of canned soup. Frank and Logan continued walking \"Mmm huh\" she said \"So Logan what's this I hear about you being in the principal's office today?\" \"Oh yeah I got into an argument with my teacher, don't worry I am handling it\" \"How are you handling it?\" \"I'm going to apologize tomorrow\" \"What did we talk about Logan?\" \"I'm working on it dad, I am\" \"You have to change your attitude Logan\" \"Can we not talk about this now?\" Logan asked referring to not saying anything in front of her mother \"Ok I'm backing off\" said Frank, and Rachel came to catch up with them \"What are you two talking about?\" \"Nothing\" Logan said making an exit down the next aisle Later Logan finished clearing the table and her parent's ate the last of their deserts \"Well I'm done for the night\" Logan said to them \"You didn't want any cake honey?\" Rachel asked \"No I'm pretty full from dinner. Thanks dad it was great!\" \"Your welcome sweetie\" \"Goodnight guys\" she said before leaving \"Goodnight\" they both told her \"So I can assume you two are getting along better?\" Frank asked \"Yeah she doesn't hate me anymore\" \"I don't think she hated you Rachel come on\" \"Logan hated me up until two months ago! Everytime we got into an argument she said \"I hate you!\" Our relationship was strained and that jack ass didn't make it any better\" \"So I guess the talks I had with her is really worked, she's turning over a new leaf.\" \"I just hope we stay this way, I never imagined that things would get that bad. I am glad you were there to help me with her\" \"She's my daughter too what do you expect?\" \"I knew I could count on you Frank, I guess I thought you would take her side\" \"I would never take anyone's side if they were wrong, and she was wrong.\" \"I disappointed her Frank\" \"Why don't you two sit down and talk about it?\" \"I don't know if she wants to\" \"Trust me she would be willing\" After finishing their cake Rachel walked Frank outside to his truck \"Thanks for dinner Frank it was great\" \"No problem, I'm glad you both enjoyed it\" They both went into an awkward silence \"So am I allowed to give you a kiss right now?\" he asked \"Sure but just a quick one\" she said and Frank immediately went for Rachel's lips. The kiss wasn't quick because well… that was just Frank. \"What did I say?\" \"Sorry I couldn't resist. Are you still coming over later?\" \"Yeah I'll come over about eleven, I have to make sure that Logan is asleep\" \"I will have the wine waiting!\" Frank snuck one more kiss before getting into his truck. He couldn't wait for Rachel to come over later. \"Goodnight Frank\" Frank drove off and Rachel watched him as he exited the gate. Rachel went back into the house to get ready for her later activities. Around nine thirty Logan came knocking at her mother's door. Rachel was busy in her walk in closet trying on the lingerie she bought for Frank. They hadn't been intimate for almost a month. And tonight she was going to make it very special for the both of them. \"Mom are you still up?\" Logan said from outside the door \"Yeah just give me a second!\" Rachel hurried up and put on her robe and closed her closet, then she went open the door for her daughter. \"What's wrong baby?\" \"I can't sleep, can I stay here for a while?\" \"Yeah sure\" but Logan was already heading for the bed before Rachel could get the words out of her mouth. Rachel got in bed put her arm around Logan as she laid her head on Rachel's chest. \"My body is tired but my mind just wants to stay awake. Just sing to me or tell me a story\" \"I will tell you a story, what do you want to hear?\" \"Tell me how you found out you were pregnant with me\" \"Well it was a few weeks after your father and I went our separate ways, I think that was two weeks after The Oscars\" \"Where dad took a bullet for you\" \"Yeah\" \"That's so romantic\" \"It was part of his job\" \"Yeah but it's romantic because you were in love with each other\" \"Anyway, I was going on a two week tour over in The Netherlands. And just before the end of the tour I found out.\" \"Don't give me the short version, I'm trying to go to sleep here\" \"My story is boring you?\" \"Yeah your not giving many details!\" \"Ok one night after a show I started throwing up and didn't know why. I stayed sick the next day too, and aunt flow hadn't came to visit me at all. So I went to the doctor, took a test and that's it\" \"That's it? I want to know how and when you told dad!\" \"Do you need to know every little thing?\" \"Yes you guys never told me this story before, and I want to know\" \"I got back to the states contacted him voila, here we are!\" \"Mom\" \"Take 2 Tylenol Pms it'll work\" Logan rolled her eyes and got off the bed an exited out the room \"Thanks for the short story\" \"Your welcome\" Later Rachel made sure that Logan was asleep and after locking up and she left. Frank was anxiously waiting for Rachel's arrival, he checked if everything was good enough. The wine was waiting, the candles were burning, and he had on pair of pajama's with the top unbutton in her favorite color. Rachel parked her car inside Frank's garage and got out wearing a trench coat and big black sunshades. She opened the door to the kitchen and stepped in. \"Frank baby I'm here\" calling out to him He came in to meet her \"I thought you were coming in through the front door. Why are you wearing that?\" \"So people won't notice me\" \"Rach it's almost midnight, no one is up\" \"I'm just being cautious\" she said putting her arms around him going for a kiss She gave him a nice long succulent kiss \"Damn girl I wish you would have given it to me back at your house!\" \"I missed you that's all\" she said and he led her to the living room \"Aww Frank you went all out for this!\" she said looking at what he had done. The candles weren't the only things there, he had rose petals on the carpet surrounded by huge pillows for them to lay back on. He had strawberries and whip cream for them and a cd on in the background playing smooth jazz. He helped Rachel sit down and then he sat beside her. A little later they had their wine glasses in their hands and were sitting back relaxed \"It feels so good to be home and be here with you\" \"I'm glad that your back too. Two weeks is too long for you to be away from me Frank!\" \"I know baby and I promise that's the last time for a while. I missed you so much\" he said grabbing for her hand and kissing her knuckles \"What did you miss about me?\" \"Everything that makes you, you. I'm so happy your back in my life Rachel you just don't know. I didn't think you would ever leave that bastard!\" \"I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long, I guess I just wanted to prove to the world that I could make it work out. But towards the end, even I was asking who am I kidding\" \"I'm glad you came to your senses and got back with me\" he smiled \"It amazes me that it took us this long to figure out what we really wanted was right here in front of us.\" \"We always knew that was the truth, we could never be apart no matter how hard we've tried.\" \"Our lives are different now too, so we can actually pursue our feelings without fear\" \"Well not right now since you just went through a very public break up, but in private we can\" \"That's right\" she said taking the last bit of wine into her mouth and licking her lips afterwards. That turned Frank on! \"I wanna see what's under that trench coat!\" \"Then why don't you take it off\" Rachel replied being coy Frank did as she asked and what he found underneath blew his mind… They made love until the candles were nearly gone and now they were wrapped up in a throw blanket. Rachel was laying on his chest as he held her tight. \"That was amazing, but I think we better get some sleep now, you always manage to wear me out!\" Frank said exhausted \"Me? I don't think I will be able to walk\" she told him \"What time is it anyway?\" \"Almost four\" \"Shit I have to go!\" \"What Why?\" \"Logan will notice that I am not home\" \"So, just stay in my arms\" \"Sorry Frank but us getting back together stays between us for right now!\" she said getting up trying to find her trench coat and the other items. \"Rachel wait\"[Chapter 3] I love this story! Frank and Rachel are one of a kind Feel So Good Frank some how convinced Rachel to stay for another hour, but then it turned into two hours. By the time she left it was almost six o'clock and Logan was going to be getting up for school soon. As the sun was coming up she slipped back into her home through the backdoor. She used the kitchen stairs to get on the next floor and headed for her room. Rachel slipped into her room and went to take a shower. Logan's alarm clock went off around six thirty and she woke up and went get ready. Rachel had just stepped out the shower when her cell phone started to ring. It was Frank \"Hey I thought you said you were going to call me when you made it back home\" \"I wanted to take a shower first and then I was going to give you a call. You should be sleeping right now Frank!\" \"I know but I was waiting for you and I couldn't stop thinking about last night!\" \"I can't stop thinking about it either, you really did a number on me! I'm walking funny already\" Well I did my job. So what are your plans for today and do they involve me?\" \"Well first I will see our daughter off to school, I'm having lunch with Blake's mother, and then I'm coming over for another love session\" \"Blake's mother? I thought his family hated you?\" \"No his younger step mother hated me because her husband, Blake's father Sebastian also had a thing for me. Matter of fact he and his father fell out over that\" \"Damn Rach, but I can still see all the guys fighting over you\" \"Sebastian was a sweetheart, but he was a little too old for me\" \"How old was he Rachel?\" \"About 66-67\" \"Well the last one sounds too good to be true! Rachel Marron is coming over to my house in the middle of the day?\" \"It's true but of course I will be in disguise, and will have a taxi drop me off\" \"Your that paranoid of the paps following you?\" \"Yes Frank I don't want them in my business\" \"Because you want to keep a good reputation for Blake's mother?\" \"No Blake's mother has nothing to do with that. Look like I said before I want everything to calm down and then we can come out with the relationship\" \"Your lucky I love you because if it was anyone else I would not go for it\" \"But because you love me you will do anything I ask!\" \"Well I'll let you finish doing whatever your doing. I'm going to sleep\" \"Sleep well my love\" \"Have a great day and call me later\" \"I will, bye bye\" Rachel hung up the phone and finished drying herself off. A little later Logan went downstairs to grabbed herself some breakfast. She really didn't want cereal but that's what she had to settle for. Rachel came not long after to start her day too. \"Morning baby\" \"Well someone looks like they haven't gotten much sleep\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You look tired mother\" \"I am Logan\" \"Why?\" \"Like you, I couldn't go to sleep\" \"Well you should have took the Tylenol's you suggested for me. Really why are you so tired?\" \"I barely got any sleep\" \"Bull mother\" \"Stop being so nosey\" \"You were probably on the phone with Blake all night, he's still begging you to come back?\" \"Logan don't start\" \"I'm not starting anything, I don't want you to fall back into his trap.\" \"I am not going back to him, look eat breakfast and get to school please\" \"What's wrong don't like to hear the truth\" \"Stop it now ok\" \"Fine! Do what you want, go back to him I don't care. Get your heartbroken again!\" she said getting up and leaving \"You haven't finished your breakfast Logan\" \"Well instead of being on the phone all night, maybe you could have gotten up early enough to fix me some real food\" She said right before slamming the door Rachel had gotten a little angry at her daughter, even though what she said was not the truth. If Logan wanted to believe that her mother would choose Blake over her and Frank, then that was her. Rachel didn't want her and Frank's relationship to come out yet, not now. She had too much at stake. Later Rachel was having dinner with the ex Mrs. Collinsworth. The lady was about the same age as Blake's mother, she still looked good, and had plenty of her own money. The lady also adored Rachel and still considered her to be her daughter in law. Side note Queen of the Night was one of her favorite films. \"Fletcher came to see me last week\" Ms. Collinsworth said as she ate a piece of her chicken \"He did, he hardly comes to see me\" \"He was in New York for business he said and decided to drop by for one of my special cookies\" \"Well that's great, but I certainly will ask him why he never travels to see me\" \"Does he at least call you?\" \"He called once last week. I know he's very busy with his job, but the boy hasn't seen me since March. I'm ready for my son to come back home\" \"At least you have a son who cares, mine is too much like his father\" \"Don't I know that\" \"The good thing that came out of this is that you and I have become really great friends. I love you like my own daughter\" Rachel smile at the woman's words. She and Blake's mother were really had a mother daughter relationship, and she stuck up for Rachel when she was going through tough times with Blake. If it wasn't for her she would have never made it through those four years. \"And you how have you been?\" \"Bored, I need something to do that's why I guess I am here. So you said you want to buy your record company and want me to help you run it?\" \"The price that they are asking for is steep and I need someone to sponsor me. That's where you come in\" \"I'm in\" \"But we haven't really discussed much of anything\" \"I'm in, I need to spend my money somehow before I die, and I only trust some charities.\" \"Alright then partner I will get the paper work started\" Rachel was ecstatic about what was fixing to happen. Later Rachel arrived to Frank's house this time wearing some clothes. Like last night she got in through the garage and to the kitchen door, but Frank was there waiting for her. \"I knew you'd come through this way!\" \"Well I guess I'll have to find another way in won't I\" \"Yeah because I like you sneaking up on me\" he pulled her in to a hug and kiss \"Before we get started I have some great news to tell you\" \"Ok what?\" \"I'm buying my record company\" \"What!\" \"Yes my bosses want to sell and I now have the money to buy\" \"That's great baby, but isn't that high risk?\" \"I know but the companies are still doing good and some of the best artist are my label mates\" \"I'm so proud of you honey!\" He hugged her again \"So you said you now have the money to buy it, where did you get it? You robed a bank didn't you!\" \"No Frank I didn't rob a bank, Ms. Collinsworth will be my partner, were going half and half on it, and Bill will be the president\" \"Blake's mother is your business partner?\" \"Yes\" \"Damn Rachel your good\" \"I know and now I have two things to throw in his face!\" \"Be gentle on him\" \"I'll be gentle on you!\" she kissed him hard \"That's not gentle Rachel\" \"You also like it rough don't you?\" \"Yeah!\" Frank took Rachel to bed again and afterwards they laid in bed and talked like they always did \"Your daughter and I got into it this morning thanks to you\" \"What did I do?\" \"Well since I didn't get much sleep because of the same thing we just did now, she thinks I was up all night on the phone talking to Blake\" \"What?\" \"Yeah and she blew up on me\" \"I'll talk to her\" \"Please do because she has this smart mouth and once I get enough you know how I am. Oh and Fletcher will hear my mouth when I call him later today. That boy can go visit everyone he knows but me\" \"Calm down Fletcher lives all the way in Jersey, he can't come visit as often as he wants\" \"But the boy hasn't even called me since last Monday\" \"I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation. Can we just focus on us right now?\" \"Yeah sure, oh and don't forget we have that parent-teachers thing at Logan's school later tonight\" \"Oh yes that. All they are going to do is tell us how horrible our daughter is and that it is our fault\" \"She's not horrible\" \"Logan can be horrible to people, you know that all too well. She has the personality of my late grandmother on my mom's side.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah didn't take crap from anyone, always said what was on her mind. That's Logan\" Just then they heard the front door open and someone coming in. \"Shit!\" Frank said \"Who the hell is that?\" Rachel whispered \"Dad are you here?\" \"Oh shit!\" Rachel said getting out of bed to find her clothes thinking how they were going to explain this. \"Stay here I will go out there to meet her\" \"Okay, don't let her come back here\" \"She won't, lock the door\" he said slipping on his jogging pants and a shirt. Logan went to the kitchen to grab something to eat and Frank went straight there knowing that's where she would be. \"Hey honey what are you doing here?\" \"Just came over to hang out for a little while and talk.\" \"Oh okay\" \"Why were you busy?\" \"No I was in bed I just woke up\" \"Oh I'm sorry\" \"No it's fine I needed to get up anyway. So what's up how was school?\" he asked sitting down \"The same\" \"Made any friends yet?\" \"No all my friends are in private school\" \"Alright well… did you want to talk about anything?\" \"Yeah\" Logan came sit down at the table across from her father \"Mom and I had a little fight this morning\" \"Really what happened?\" \"I think she started talking to Blake again. She's been acting weird lately and last night she said she stayed up all night because she didn't get any sleep. Now why is that?\" Frank was the real reason why Rachel hadn't gotten any sleep, but Logan didn't need to know that. \"I'm telling you dad I know that is what it is. Blake is probably begging her to go back to him and wants to take him back. I thought she would be still hung over you, but Blake must have really put something on her.\" \"I doubt that's what's going on\" \"Dad she still has the engagement ring\" \"Logan don't worry about it too much, your mother is a grown woman and can make her own decisions.\" \"But dad\" \"Listen to me that relationship is over with you don't have to worry\" \"I hope your right\" Rachel was listening to everything they were saying \"Why aren't you doing anything to sweep mom off her feet?\" Logan questioned \"Why don't you have a boyfriend or anyone else to worry about?\" \"Because I don't want one right now. Getting back to the point, your single, she's single\" \"You are single\" \"Come on dad\" \"Come on what?\" \"You mean to tell me out of all these years you never once thought about going back to mom? When she was in the delivery room giving birth to The Wonderful Me, you didn't want to get back together with her?\" \"The thought has crossed my mind a few times, but back then our lives were too hectic and different to be together. I like my privacy and quietness, your mother didn't get all of that and she still doesn't. It was just too complicated honey.\" \"Well it's not complicated now! Come on dad go get her you know you still love her\" \"That I do, but I love her as a friend. We have a really close relationship and that will never change, but we are still just friends\" \"I can change that\" \"You just focus on staying out of trouble, leave your mother and me be\" Whatever dad, you know I always do what I want\" Logan ended up staying for a while so Rachel decided to crawl out the window and call herself a cab. She wanted to get home before Logan did, plus she was waiting on a call from Bill Later that afternoon Rachel was in her office talking to her lawyer about her new business venture. Logan was just getting home and she had a bouquet of flowers with her. She walked in and put her book sack beside the door and went looking for her mother. \"I knew I'd find you in here\" \"Hold on honey give me a second\" Rachel said and Logan took a seat in one of the chairs by Rachel's desk. \"Yeah that sounds great we'll see you Monday morning. Ok you too bye. So how was your day honey?\" \"It was ok. Look I got you something\" Logan pulled the flowers from her side and handed them to her mother \"They're beautiful, but what's this for?\" \"My apology, I'm sorry for the way I acted this morning. I shouldn't have jumped down your throat and getting into your business. I just want the best for you mom that's all\" \"I know you do honey, but you need to stop worrying about me. You have enough to worry about, like tonight at that school function\" \"Oh yeah that is tonight well I better go and get some sleep, thankfully no homework this weekend\" \"Alright honey, I would like for us to have a talk soon so make some time for me\" \"I will mom we need to have a good long discussion, heart to heart\" \"I love you baby\" \"I love you too mom\" Logan got up to go give her a good long hug then she left. Rachel decided to call her other child and see what was going on with him. \"Hello?\" \"Fletcher Michael Marron why haven't you called me this week?\" \"Hi mom\" \"Answer the question\" \"I've had a very hectic work week, I'm sorry\" \"You know I get worried\" Later that night Frank pulled up to the school where Logan and Rachel were standing outside waiting for him \"Sorry guys I ran into traffic\" \"It's ok were just getting here too\" Logan said hugging her father and then he hugged Rachel. They followed Logan in and Frank couldn't keep his hands to himself. He kept gropping Rachel's butt and she constantly kept slapping it away. \"Could you stop, were in public!\" \"I say we lose Logan for a little while and ditch this whole meeting thing, and go find a broom closet what do you think?\" \"You want to ditch our daughter and have sex with me in a broom closet? What if we get caught Frank?\" \"We won't get caught, are you forgetting who I am?\" Rachel rolled her eyes and decided to walk along side her daughter. Frank wasn't giving up on the broom closet thing, he was going to make that teenage fantasy happen for sure![Chapter 4] Off On Your Own (Girl), So We Can Be Alone Frank and Rachel found themselves in Logan's advanced chemistry class as the teacher was saying a few words. They were in the very back of the room so that Rachel wouldn't really get noticed, and so Frank could have a little fun with her. Logan was standing in front of her parents so she couldn't see what her father was trying to do. Rachel was trying to listen to what was being said but couldn't, so she leaned over to Frank to have a few words with him. \"If you don't get your hand from back there I will cut you off from sex for a month\" she said and Frank immediately retracted his hand off her butt. \"I hate when you make threats like that!\" he whispered \"You force me to\" \"Shh\" a parent next to them said and Rachel was ready to shhh them back but she kept her cool The teacher kept talking and it was getting more boring by the minute so Frank started whispering in Rachel's ear again \"You know we can sneak out of here and go find ourselves a broom closet\" Rachel elbowed him in the ribs and he let out a low scow, then he whispered in her ear again \"Your ass is mine later tonight!\" Rachel, Frank, and Logan decided to leave earlier than expected, matter of fact some parents were still getting there while they were talking in the parking lot. Earlier when the three walked in they were immediately met with Logan's principal who was already waiting on them. Rachel and Frank got most of the heat, but in the end everyone agreed to just disagree. \"I told you this would be a waste of time\" Logan said to her parents \"It wasn't a total waste of time\" Rachel said \"Is there anybody at this school you could hang out with?\" her father asked \"Nope\" \"Well can you find you some friends?\" he asked again \"Frank\" Rachel sighed \"Honey don't you think this school year would go smoother if you got involved with some activities or interacted with people?\" \"Yeah but I don't want to do that\" Logan said as they got to Rachel's vehicle \"But why not?\" Frank begged \"Frank!\" Rachel told him \"I just don't feel like making people like me here\" Logan said \"Alright so what are you doing tonight?\" Frank asked his daughter \"I'm actually hooking up with some of my old friends from my other school\" she said grabbing her bag out of the SUV. \"Really? That's good, so your not a total outcast\" said Frank \"Just at this dumb school\" Logan referred \"Where are you guys going to be?\" Rachel asked hearing the first of this \"Remember Sasha from the basket ball team?\" Logan said \"Yeah I think so\" said Rachel \"Well her dad just finished their in home movie theater, talk about nice! Were gonna spend the night there watching movies and catching up, you know. Matter of fact that is her coming to pick me up now\" Logan gestured as she seen her friend's car pulling into the parking lot \"I've gotta go\" she hugged both her parents \"Thanks for not embarrassing me tonight, even though I could careless about those people\" \"When have we ever embarrassed you?\" Rachel asked \"Remember my eighth grade social?\" \"All we did was dance\" Frank told her \"Yes along with a few other parents to some cheesy 80s music\" \"Everyone had fun that night honey\" said Rachel \"Only because my parents were doing the most! Look I'm going now bye\" Logan went off to meet her friend Frank turned to Rachel \"Well what are you doing tonight?\" \"I don't know now, I was planning on having dinner with Logan so we could talk, get our issues out on the table. But I guess that will have to wait, what are you going to do?\" she asked \"I'm hoping you and I could hang out tonight since we don't have anything else to do\" \"Well what do you suggest we do?\" \"Well we can rent a movie from redbox, drink wine, make love\" he smiled \"That last part sounds nice, but I think we should sort of take it slow from now on\" \"What? Take it slow why?\" \"I'm just saying you and I have been sneaking around a lot, what if the tabloids catch onto us? Or Logan what if she suspects something, remember the last time we almost got caught. You do like to get touchy feely with me in public.\" \"So you feel uncomfortable when I do that?\" \"No, Hell No! I'm just saying that you shouldn't try to do it in public. There is always someone who might be watching\" \"Ok so I won't try to cop a feel from you outside of closed doors, gotcha!\" \"Thank you baby. So I'll meet you at your house?\" Rachel said \"Actually how about I come over to your house and spend the night there. Logan will be gone until tomorrow probably around noon so we won't have to worry about getting caught\" \"Frank I don't know\" \"Rachel come on! Who is going to know?\" \"You know me I worry a lot these days\" \"Well stop worrying so much, I'll leave before eleven tomorrow morning, promise\" After a few moments more they leave the parking lot and head to Frank's place so he can pick up a few clothing. He leaves his car home and they drive to Rachel's in her Range Rover. Mean while across town Logan is getting ready to go to a party with her old friends. \"I thought we were going to have a girls night at home\" \"We lied\" Sasha said \"So where are you guys taking me?\" she asked \"There is a party in The Valley, lot's of people and boys\" one of her other friends answered her \"Sounds fun\" Logan said \"It will be trust me, hopefully you'll meet someone and start dating again\" \"I don't want to \"date\" again, not after what Sean put me through\" \"Logan that was a year ago now, time to move on\" \"I know but I don't know if I am ready yet\" \"Well after tonight you'll be ready\" Sasha told her Way later that night Rachel and Frank were cuddled up together on the couch watching and discussing the movie \"Salt\" \"I should have been in a movie where I could play a spy\" said Rachel \"You a spy?\" Frank laughed \"Yeah a spy and what is funny about that?\" \"Nothing\" \"And I would have been a good spy right Frank?\" \"A great spy baby!\" \"That's what I thought\" \"How about we cut this movie short and go play agent 00 in the bed room\" \"So you can play James Bond?\" \"No you can be the female Bond and I'll be the handsome bombshell!\" \"You want to start role playing now huh\" \"Yeah let's spice up our sex life, just promise me you'll bite more! I love when you bite my shoulder\" he winked right before turning off the movie and whisking her up to the bed room. At the party Logan's friends were watching her have a conversation with one of the many college boys in attendance. \"Is that your friends over there?\" the boy asked her \"Yeah they are, their the ones who brought me here. They think I need to get reacquainted with the world\" \"Well I'm glad they did, I could have missed out on the best thing here\" \"Your just saying that\" \"No I'm not, look around do you see any other girls here who look beautiful like you? Look how must of them are dressed, and coming on to all of the guys. But you your not like them at all, I wish I would have chosen your campus!\" \"I wish you would have too\" she smiled Before Logan left with her friends she and the guy she was talking to exchanged numbers, and agreed she agreed to a date with him. Things were starting to look up for her and maybe it is a good idea for her to try dating older guys. The next morning Rachel woke up before Frank and decided to fix breakfast for them both. She decided to let him get some much needed sleep after sexing her all night, and he deserved it! She made eggs, bacon, sausage, blueberry pancakes which was their daughter's favorite, and even coffee. While scrambling the eggs though she received a phone call from her eldest child. \"Hello\" \"Morning mom\" \"Fletcher baby\" she excitingly said \"How are you doing this Sunday morning?\" \"I'm great actually couldn't be more better, how are you?\" \"I'm doing great but I miss you guys so much\" \"We miss you too sweetheart\" \"How is Logan?\" \"She's doing great too, a handful as you know, but she is good\" \"Are you two getting along better?\" \"We have our days but most of the time we are\" \"And how has Frank been?\" \"I haven't really seen much of him often but from what Logan tells me he is doing good\" \"Mom stop lying\" \"Lying about what honey?\" \"You don't see him more now that your back in town\" \"Not really son we are both very busy\" \"So you mean to tell me that your not in close contact with the love of your life?\" \"Why should I be?\" \"Uh because your still in love with him and he is still in love with you! Your both not dating anyone so why not date each other\" \"Whatever you think son\" \"It's the truth\" \"Okay well when are you going to come home and see us?\" \"As soon as I can, I'll try to come around the end of October\" \"Are you bringing someone special?\" \"I might\" \"What's her name?\" \"Jill mom\" \"Jill what?\" \"Mom come on?\" \"I just want to do a background search\" \"Your not going to do any of that, but you will know more about her when you meet her\" \"Alright baby I guess, you know momma has your back right\" \"I've always known that, now I've to go I'm arriving to the hospital right now\" \"I love you son keep making me proud\" \"I love you too mom\" They hung up with each other and Rachel finished the eggs and put them on a plate. Sometime later after brushing her teeth and getting dressed she went back upstairs to wake Frank. \"Frank baby time to get up\" \"I don't want to get up\" he mumbled still asleep \"I made breakfast\" \"I just want to lay with you all day\" he reached out and pulled her on top of him \"Oh you want some more this morning, after last night!\" \"Yes\" \"Really though sweetie I have breakfast waiting for us and it's almost nine thirty so if were going to eat together we need to do it now\" \"Alright I'm getting up\" Rachel got off of Frank so he could get up and go take a quick shower and get dressed. Afterwards they both enjoyed their breakfast together. \"Fletcher called me about forty five minutes ago\" \"Really how is he?\" \"He is doing great, we might get to meet a special someone next month.\" \"We will huh! Do we have a name?\" \"Jill\" \"Well I can't wait to meet this Jill. So what else did he have to say?\" \"He was just calling to check on us and he knows that we are still in love\" \"Anyone can see that\" \"I know but I just told him that you and I are not really in touch like we should be, so stick with that story\" \"I will for right now. How much longer do we have to hide our relationship anyway?\" \"Just a couple more months and then we are home free, shoots we might get married!\" \"Rachel\" \"I'm kidding, we would wait of course. I wish I would have married you when I had the chance. With you being down on one knee after finding out that I was pregnant with your child, I shouldn't have had to make a choice. I should have knew then and there that you were the man that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Now that I am older and wiser I know now that I was an idiot back then for letting you slip away. I'm glad you stayed in my life and not just for me but our children. \"Rachel I could have never imagine leaving you three behind. Not after everything we've been through, I love you and our children. I understood why you didn't think it would be a good idea for us to be together, our lives were different back then. But now after so many years we are still in love and we still want each other. I'm just grateful that you didn't meet another fella and fell in love with him.\" \"Trust me that wouldn't have been possible because no one ever compared to you\" That made the smile on Frank's face grow big and Rachel leaned over to him for a deep kiss. \"I love you so much Rachel, you just don't know\" he said leaning his forehead on hers \"I love you too Frank more than you'll ever know\" she said back and they kissed again Outside the gates of the mansion Logan was sitting inside Sasha's car talking with her. \"Are you going to call him or will he call you?\" \"He'll probably call first\" \"I say you call him first, keep him interested\" \"Trust me he is interested enough\" \"He better be, you stayed talking to him all night\" \"Because we were having a great conversations!\" \"How old is he again?\" \"He is a senior at USC, I told him I am in my sophomore year at UCLA.\" \"Sounds good, maybe he has a friend, so I can get hooked up\" \"I'll see, thanks for taking me out for a change. I've been so miserable for the last year or so, I just didn't think I could ever enjoy the things I used to again\" \"And the things you don't want to do again like drinking\" \"Yeah drinking, not after that accident that almost happened. I still haven't worked up the courage to tell my parents what was going on in my life at that time. I don't think I'll ever tell them, they might never forgive me\" \"Please your parents, the sweetest most understanding people I've ever known\" \"Would you tell your parents that you had a drinking problem and was almost in a bad car accident that could have cost your life?\" \"Yeah that's a tough one\" \"Well I better get going I'm starving, thanks again Sasha\" \"Your welcome, anything for my best friend\" Logan got out of the car and let herself in through the gates. When she reached the house she went inside and placed her bag by the door. Frank and Rachel were still eating when Logan was approaching the kitchen. \"Umm, mom I can smell that delicious food all the way by the front door!\" Logan said taking in the wonderful smells of breakfast. Frank and Rachel immediately turned to each other like what the hell is she doing back so soon. Then focused their attention on their daughter walking through the kitchen. \"Hey\" she said looking at them both surprised that her father is there too \"Hi honey\" Rachel said \"Hey hon!\" Frank repeated \"What are you doing here dad?\"[Chapter 5] The reason it took so long for this chapter was because I would start it (Dec 2012) get frustrated cause I didn't know where I wanted to go with this story, and neglect it for weeks. But now (Feb 2013) I am finally finished with this chapter. I'm still a little iffy about this one and if it makes sense but hopefully to you guys it does. I hope you enjoy and reviews good or bad are always welcome. This one is especially dedicated to Whitney as we come to the first year without her Logan looked between her parents waiting for an answer. They were sitting beside each other eating and looking suspect as hell. But she couldn't jump to conclusions just yet. \"We went jogging earlier this morning\" her dad said \"I picked him up and we went to the park. Afterwards we came back here and now were having breakfast\" Rachel followed \"Yeah but both of you aren't in any jogging attire\" Logan had a point \"I brought a bag of clothes so I could shower here\" Frank spoke again Logan once again looked between her parents, their explanation seemed to hold up, and the setting looked innocent. Yet she still had a feeling that something was suspicious but just couldn't put her figure on it. \"Ok I guess\" she said turning towards the cabinet to grab a plate to eat \"So what did you guys do after I left?\" \"Well I uh…\" He was trying to think of a scenario \"I got together with a few buddies and we played pool at the house\" Frank said \"Alright and what about you mom?\" \"I called it a night and went to bed\" Logan thought her mother's nights were always boring \"So you two didn't get together last night?\" \"What?\" asked Rachel \"I'm saying I left you both alone, why not hook up you didn't have much else to do\" \"Logan we are just friends and nothing more\" said Rachel \"But you don't have to be just friends\" \"Honey your mother and I are only friends just except it\" Frank said \"Since you two won't budge on my advice you two need to get out more\" Logan said sitting her plate down on the table and taking a seat across from her parents \"Well what do you suggest?\" her father asked which Logan addressed as she put her fork back down \"If your not going to date each other then maybe you should start dating other people again, well not you mom because you have a bad track record in the dating department\" \"Excuse me\" Rachel got defensive \"You kinda do Rach\" Frank told her \"Yeah whatever\" she spoke again \"Test the dating waters dad while you wait on mom and sweet mother you should just find a hobby\" \"I have one my up and coming record label\" \"Good luck with that\" Logan took a bite of bacon \"Maybe I should start dating again, that girl I met the other day did seem interested\" Frank was trying to plat along the best way he could, but Rachel shot him a look. Luckily their daughter wasn't paying attention to them. \"Yeah No!\" Rachel said under her breath still looking at him \"You said something mom?\" \"No darling, okay moving on now honey your father and I would like to talk to you\" Rachel said changing the subject \"Why?\" \"Your behavior at school…\" \"And why you are not getting along with your mother\" Frank finished \"What do you mean\" she told them \"Lately you've been jumping down my throat\" Rachel told her Logan let out a huff and spoke again \"Well can I at least eat first before we start this off?\" She also got aggravated easily \"Yeah go ahead\" Rachel said to her Logan picked up her fork and went for the eggs \"Alright so you were saying\" Logan started off after swallowing \"I want to know about school, what is the issue you have with them?\" Rachel asked her \"First off I'm new, I've never attended a public school, I'm looked down on because I am your kid, they assume that I am some rich snob, and yes I have no friends. The teachers are no different, all of them either want to tell me how much they love your music or do what the kids do treat me like shit because I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.\" \"Logan come on your exaggerating?\" her father asked \"No dad I'm not\" \"Because you sometimes can be standoffish\" he said again \"You have to get to know me first\" \"Logan that doesn't give you the right to talk to your teachers anyway you feel like. They don't have to put up with that in their class room. I don't understand this because you didn't give any trouble in Napa\" Rachel knew that it would be hard for her daughter to adjust to a new school the first time, but nothing like this ever happened. \"They didn't give me a reason to, matter of fact they were one of the few people that made things better in my life!\" \"Really?\" said Rachel as she folded her arms and stared at her daughter. Rachel knew where Logan was heading with this. \"Really!\" Logan said back putting her fork down once again and doing just like her mother. Frank was keeping out of this one, he was just going to sit there and listen to each side. If he needed to then he would step in to moderate between them. \"I tried to satisfy everyone, I did everything I could to make the transition easier for you\" \"Why didn't you just leave me with dad?\" \"Because I'm your mother I wanted you with me\" \"You think taking your child away from everything that was important in her life was okay, so you could shack up with some loser?\" \"Yes at the end I realized that I made a mistake, but I did what I thought was right\" \"You didn't even ask me how I felt about moving\" \"I talked with you about it Logan and the only thing you told me was \"yeah do whatever you want it's your life!\" You said it\" \"And you did just that! My opinion wasn't going to change your mind so why fight it? But you didn't ask me about moving you asked me how I felt about you two getting married! Then you whisked me away to Napa.\" \"And you fought me anyway over everything!\" Logan rolled her eyes at her mother \"I know you just didn't roll your eyes at me!\" Rachel began to get up from her seat ready to yank Logan by her hair until Frank stopped her \"Whoa Rachel stop!\" Frank said as he held her back as Logan got out of her seat with her plate and started heading out the kitchen. \"You know what let's just drop this whole conversation okay. I don't want to argue with you today, I'm tired and hungry\" \"You see what I mean, do you see what I mean!\" Rachel was frustrated \"Logan get back here!\" Frank called out to his child but she never came back \"It's always like this Frank she ends up ending the conversation, she has to have the last word. I am so sick of this shit!\" Rachel got up and went dump her food Frank looked at his watch and realized that he had to be somewhere in twenty minutes \"Rachel I'm sorry but I have to go\" \"Your leaving?\" she asked now at the sink \"I'm sorry I have something to do\" \"You just can't leave like this Frank, I need you here to help me talk some sense into her!\" \"I'm so sorry baby\" \"Fine okay go\" she finished rinsing her plate and then she turned to Frank as he came close to her. \"Meanwhile I will try talking to your daughter again!\" \"Why is she my daughter when you two are arguing?\" \"Because I can't deal with her sometimes\" \"Well don't be so hard on her\" \"That's the problem I have never been hard on her, that's why she is the way she is!\" \"Talk to her later you two just get it all out\" \"I've been trying to talk to her again, but it always ends with us being mad at each other\" \"Don't get mad just talk and I will call you later I promise\" Frank looked back to see if the coast was clear and he passionately kissed her. \"Frank!\" she said pulling away from him \"She is in the house\" \"I love you!\" \"I love you too and we will talk about that little dating comment later!\" Frank smiled and stole another kiss before he quickly left Later Logan was on the phone with her brother telling him all her problems while she sat at in front of her tv playing a game on her playstation 3. \"Don't you think your being too harsh on mom?\" her brother asked \"See I don't even know why I called you\" \"Yes you do, you called me because you need someone to talk to about this. Someone who understands you situation. I've been in your shoes Logan yes but I never resented mom for that\" \"I don't resent mom, I resent the fact that the same tired ass conversation keeps getting picked back up. I'm ready to move on\" \"Well then act like it! I know living with that madness for a year was torture, but it's time to forgive and forget. Mom isn't going back to him Logan not ever!\" \"Well like I told you earlier she acted strangely when I asked her about staying up all night?\" \"Maybe she did have trouble falling asleep\" \"No she was on the phone with Blake, that was what she used to do when they first broke up. He would call her at all times of the night begging her to go back to him, and she didn't hang up in his face. I think she still wants him back Fletcher and I'm worried. I hate Blake, I can't stand him!\" \"I think mom still loves dad\" \"I don't know Fletcher I've been dropping hints to both of them and they insist that nothing is there\" \"Oh well Logan it's none of our business…\" Logan cut him off \"It is my business!\" \"No it's not! Look I hate to cut this topic which you think is so important short, but I have to go. I love you baby sis but please find something else to worry about. Mom is almost fifty and she doesn't need anyone telling her how to live her life and who to love\" \"Okay Fletcher whatever, and I'm not talking to her either because I'm still pissed off!\" \"Logan go downstairs and have a conversation with your mother!\" he demanded but Logan was hardheaded just like her mother and stubborn. Logan hung up the phone and paused her game. She picked up her plate from earlier and headed down to the kitchen to put it in the dishwasher. Rachel was still there now on the phone and typing on her laptop. \"Email me those documents in an hour and I will get back to you\" Rachel spoke into the phone as she caught a glimpse of her daughter near the sink. \"Yeah that's fine, okay goodbye\" Rachel hung up her cell phone and pushed her laptop aside. \"So are you ready to talk now?\" \"Nope\" \"Were gonna have to talk sometime honey so you might as well get it over with\" \"I don't want to talk to you!\" Logan left the kitchen again to go back to her room but Rachel followed. \"Rachel leave me alone\" \"No I want to talk to you right now and you will sit down and listen!\" Logan got to her bedroom and slammed the door in Rachel's face. So Rachel busted in and grabbed her by the arm as Logan struggled to get out of her embrace. \"Let me go!\" Logan yelled For the first time in her life was physically pushing her to do something, never before had Rachel gotten this aggressive with her until now. \"No I want to know why your acting like a brat and why you hate me!\" Rachel finally pinned her daughter down to the bed \"Mom come on stop\" she pleaded, Rachel was rough \"Oh it's mom now not Rachel! Talk to me Logan!\" she shouted[Chapter 6] I hope everyone enjoys this chapter, it's not perfect but it's good enough for me. Leave a review and enjoy Rachel still remained pinning her daughter down on the bed. She was tired of this, the constant fights and tears. Rachel no longer wanted to argue she wanted answers and answers was what Logan was going to give her today. Logan has a few issues with herself and her mother, one of them being Blake, Rachel's ex fiance Another issue is the fact that she wants her parents together. For the life of her she could never understand why they never wanted to be together. Was it just a hook up of some sort between bodyguard and client or were they really ever in love with each other? Are they really telling the truth about their lives making everything impossible for it to ever turn into love and be more. Only they know, but she knows this both of them love her very much and she was never a regret. But it still didn't stop Logan from feeling like a child born out of wedlock or how Blake put it to her during one of their many arguments a bastard child. \"Are you going to talk to me?\" \"Are you going to get off of me!\" Logan talked back Rachel rolled her eyes and removed herself from above her daughter. Logan rose herself up and adjusted her shirt and fixed her hair. \"Baby I'm tired\" \"Tired of what?\" \"All this fighting\" \"We hardly fight\" \"Hardly fight? Logan we've fought so many times this year I can't even count anymore\" Logan let out a sigh as Rachel continued her speech. \"One moment everything is fine with us and the next your going off on me for no reason. I can't take it anymore I want our relationship back, the one we had before everything went down south. We need to talk again it seems, because you still have some unresolved issues on your mind. And you have hate in your heart for me\" \"I don't hate you Rachel\" \"Okay look one thing your gonna stop doing is calling me Rachel\" \"I only call you by your name when you've pissed me off\" \"And that's going to stop right now I'm not Rachel to you it's Mom. I'm your mother and your going to respect me do you understand?\" \"Yes mame\" \"So can you please tell me what's going on?\" \"I just…\" Logan paused for a few seconds \"I just want the best for you mom, I want you to have the world\" \"I've had the world baby\" \"I don't mean the world as in your fans, money, fame. I'm talking about love and happiness, someone who loves you for you and not what you can give them. Too many times I've seen those types walk into your life only for you to realize too late that they weren't right for you. Besides Fletcher's father and Dad you haven't had that type of love again. I just don't want you to be alone mom or wasting anymore of your time\" \"I am happy Logan I have the two Greatest Loves Of All in my life, my son and daughter! Who needs anyone else when you've got the love of your kids?\" \"And that's just it your not in love with somebody who loves you\" \"What are you talking about now?\" \"Dad\" \"Come on Logan get off it!\" \"Why not dad?\" \"We've told you before we love each other but were not in love\" \"Why not?\" \"Do I have to explain that now?\" \"Yes\" She didn't want to tell her daughter a lie, especially if it could hurt her in the end. But her mission was to keep everything under wraps from everyone until enough time had passed. Rachel had a record company fixing to start and other things on the line that depended on her keeping this secret. If the public found out that Rachel was already seeing another man during her time with Blake, the press would call her all kinds of names. The state of California loved Blake and his family, but if the public only knew. \"Well I'm not\" \"Then can I ask you something?\" \"Of course anything baby\" \"And be truthful with me, are you planning on going back to Blake?\" \"Hell No\" \"Honestly\" \"Yes Logan I am being honest\" \"Promise\" \"I promise sweetheart I want nothing more to do with him\" Logan was relieved \"Is that the reason why you've been biting off my head?\" Rachel went on \"Yes and No\" \"Well then what else\" \"Months ago when we finally sat down and talked about everything\" \"Yeah\" \"I didn't tell you everything\" \"To be honest I didn't think you had but will you tell me now\" \"Again dealing with Blake, I just felt neglected sometimes like I had become less important in your life. Sometimes you made me feel less important\" \"I did?\" \"Yeah mom you did. You were so focused on trying to make him happy I had to take a backseat. I remember one time during those three years that you were together with him I needed your love and support more than ever.\" Rachel listened intently, her daughter was fixing to confirm she was a bad parent. \"I was going through a tough time and had become reckless. Do you remember that night you and Blake were leaving to go to Paris\" \"I think so July 2008 right, you were 15yrs\" \"My rebellious stage\" \"Yeah how could I forget!\" Rachel started thinking back around that time where Logan was becoming a young woman. A stage in both of their lives when their relationship was starting to become strained. \"So around that time yes we were at odds but I still needed my best friend. Well you two were flying off somewhere on whim leaving me behind, which I normally wouldn't mind at all. Because I was up to no good my damn self.\" \"You were\" \"Yes I was, mom there are so many things I can tell you but you and dad would not be happy!\" \"Well you will tell me after this right?\" \"After I finish this little story I will have no other choice but to. So anyway I had gotten myself into a jam and like I said I needed my mother's advice. That night I didn't get my mother, I got someone else who just simply told me \"Can't it wait until I get back sweetheart were in a hurry\" and then what happened?\" she asked her mother while her eyes started tearing up. \"I'm sorry I don't remember honey\" \"You don't remember?\" Logan started to get angry with her mother again, how could Rachel not notice the pain and worry that was on her child's face that night? It was the worst night of her life and Rachel never knew it! \"That was two years ago Logan, how do you expect me to remember something like that?\" \"You would have if I would have had the chance to talk to you\" \"I'm sorry baby\" Rachel now knew how serious her daughter was being \"It's too late now\" \"No it's, tell me what happened baby\" Rachel demanded \"You might hate me\" Logan cried and Rachel wiped away a lone tear that had rolled down her daughter's eye \"I could never hate my own child!\" Rachel was dying for Logan to spill it \"I needed you that night mom and you refused to be there, my life was turning upside down.\" \"Logan just please tell me!\" Logan took a deep breath and revealed her darkest secret to her mother, finally able to get it off her chest. \"For some dumb reason I went two weeks until I finally came up with the courage to tell you, but I waited too long and just let you walk out. The next day I returned the call to a representative from planned parenthood and went through with my decision. I was pregnant for a whole month and didn't even know it.\" Logan held her head down in shame. \"I can't even listen to your song \"Miracle\" that you did back in 1990, it sings my life with it's words!\" Rachel was in complete shock! She was speechless, hurt, and she was sure anger was on it's way. (Anger towards herself of course) Mother and daughter just sat there both pretty much in dismay, no one had made a move yet until Rachel squeezed her eyes shut and embraced her daughter. The tears finally spilled from her own eyes and her heart started to beat faster. \"Mom I'm sorry\" Logan uttered but Rachel could say nothing, she just held her child tight almost squeezing the wind out from her. Frank walked through the underground parking lot of a building trying to remember where he had parked his truck. He found it a few seconds later, but as he approached one part of the lot he noticed that a woman was standing next to it. \"Excuse me are you the owner of this vehicle?\" she asked as he got more closer \"Yes I am, what happened?\" \"I wasn't watching what I was doing, and the side mirror of this expensive BMW scratched your door\" Frank took a look and it didn't seem so bad \"I am terribly sorry!\" She paused for a moment and took a good look at the man in front of her \"It doesn't look too bad\" Frank said taking a another look at his driver side door \"Frank?\" Frank looked back up to her and realized that she looked familiar \"It's me Ava, we met two days ago at the park\" \"Yeah now I remember, well isn't this something? We meet again under these circumstances\" \"Again I am so sorry, I shouldn't have been on my phone\" \"No it's alright I promise\" he smiled \"Don't worry my insurance will take care of everything\" \"I'm not worried\" \"Look let me give you my information\" Ava went inside of her car to pull out her insurance papers and such. They decided not to call the police since it wasn't much damage to his car. After she and Frank exchanged information Ava still felt bad about the situation and decided to take Frank out. \"It's not a date or anything unless we hit it off\" \"I don't know Ava\" \"What are you seeing someone right now?\" Frank thought about it \"I'm not at the moment\" \"Well I don't see why you should turn down a free meal, so in two hours why don't you meet me down at Lucques on Melrose Ave. for some good chat and real food!\" Frank just nodded his head towards her still in disbelief that he has a date. \"Alright I have to go now, see you tonight!\" she said and left Back at the house Frank's girls were still having a heart to heart Rachel and Logan were now laying down in her bed holding hands facing each other eyes red and puffy. Logan had just finished explaining everything to her mother about the pregnancy and who the boy was that she fooled with. \"Why didn't you make me stay Logan?\" \"I don't know, I was younger back then and confused. I couldn't tell you and dad that I was pregnant at fifteen!\" \"That was our grandchild Logan!\" \"I'm sorry mom, damn!\" \"It's all my fault anyway\" \"How is me getting pregnant and having an abortion your fault?\" \"I didn't pay enough attention to you during that time and I dismissed your cries for help. I've failed as a parent, I didn't even notice you were drunk at any point in time\" \"I didn't drink around you guys, if I wanted to drink I went to my friend's house\" \"How did you manage to stop drinking?\" \"When you have money, you can do anything and that is what I did, got help.\" \"I am at least proud of that, you have a good head on your shoulders, you just got lost sometimes\" \"Are you mad at me mom?\" \"I'm disappointed, but I am more disappointed and angry with myself.\" \"When are we going to tell dad?\" \"Whenever he comes back to the house, I don't know when that will be\" Logan sighed and Rachel just laid there thinking \"You want to get out of the house for a little while?\" Logan asked \"I don't really want to\" \"When I'm upset or having a rough day I get out of the house and do something\" \"What would you like to do honey?\" \"I'm starving right now\" \"You wanna go eat?\" \"Yeah that sounds good, I'll call for our usual table\" \"No I don't want to go to those fancy Hollywood restaurants, I'm picking the place\" \"Alright that's fine honey\" \"Look I'll go shower and get dressed\" \"And I'll find something in my closet that I can dress down with\" Logan leaned over and kissed her mother on the cheek surprising Rachel \"I love you mommy, thank you for being so understanding with me. Not to mention putting up with me all these years and not sending me to boarding school\" \"I love you too baby\" Logan hugged her mother and then exited into her bathroom A couple of hours later Rachel and Logan were seated at their table in the overly packed restaurant. The two of them did have a quiet time just talking about different things past, present, and future. Rachel vowed to never neglect Logan like she did again and Logan promised to be more open about everything with her. At one point during their meal Rachel thought about coming clean to Logan about she and Frank, while Logan took a bathroom break. She needed to call Frank first and get him to come over so they could tell her together. And speaking of Frank they hadn't heard from him since earlier this morning. The check finally came and Rachel paid for their dinner and the girls started to get their belongings together to leave. While on their way out Logan spotted her father across the restaurant having dinner. \"Oh my gosh…, Mom\" \"What dear\" \"I think that's dad sitting in that booth over on the left\" Rachel looked towards the way Logan's finger was pointing and spotted Frank. Suddenly she felt a pang in her heart once she got a look at his female friend who was being all too chummy with him. \"I think dad took my advice and met him a friend!\" Logan smiled, at least one of her parents would be happy right now. Ava passed her thumb across Frank's chin trying to wipe off a smudge of sauce \"Oh what do I have there?\" he asked \"Just some spaghetti sauce\" \"Oh thank you\" \"So Frank why haven't I seen you lately at the park?\" \"I'm a little busy right now, but I'll be there Monday\" \"Great because I could use a jogging partner\" \"You need a jogging partner who can keep up with you, I don't think that's me\" he laughed \"Hey dad!\" Logan said appearing by his side, Rachel stayed behind obviously hurt by the display Ava looked at Logan then back at Frank who was caught off guard \"Honey hi\" He said rising up to greet and hug his daughter \"What are you doing here?\" \"Mom and I just had lunch and are fixing to leave, but I want to know who this lady is\" Logan smiled and forwarded her hand towards Ava. Frank looked around and spotted Rachel who was shaking her head at them. \"Hi I'm Logan\" \"Nice to meet you\" Ava said shaking her hand Frank approached Rachel who was dressed in regular clothes but was still looking good, and she had her favorite sunshades on. \"Rachel I know what it looks like\" \"I don't have the keys to the car so I can't walk away from you!\" \"She is just a friend\" \"Sure doesn't look like a friend with the way you two were acting just now\" \"Can we talk about this privately?\" Rachel left first and went down the hall towards the bathrooms, Frank followed her. \"So are you on a date with my dad?\" \"It looks like a date?\" Ava smiled, she could imagine herself with Frank \"How did you two meet?\" \"At the park we both work out at\" \"Really\" \"Yeah we met this past Thursday and then bumped into each other today\" \"So how many more other women are you trying to juggle Frank, because it can't be just me and her\" \"Rachel I'm not juggling women\" \"Bullshit she looks like an easy lay so I'm sure your going to get some ass, because you damn sure won't get any from me!\" Frank grabbed Rachel and backed her into the wall and tried to kiss her but she refused him. \"Our daughter made a confession earlier today and you would have known that had you answered the phone called I made to you. We were going to invite you to eat with us, but your already here.\" Logan had left Ava to go and find her parents, she found them arguing. \"I promise you Rachel that she and I are just having a friendly dinner, she hit my truck earlier today and felt so bad about it that she wanted to take me to dinner. That's it! I would never cheat on your Rachel never, I love you too much for that!\" Rachel just rolled her eyes and shook her head again, so Frank snatched the shades from off her face and looked her in the eyes again. \"Anytime I make love, the only woman I am making love to is you!\" \"Give me my glasses Frank\" Rachel asked \"No not until I make you believe me\" \"You probably lied to me this morning about having to be somewhere\" \"I didn't lie Rachel!\" He exclaimed \"I can't believe this shit!\" Logan approached her parents, jaw dropped and eyes wide \"All this time you two have been lying to me\" Logan said to them both getting their attention \"Logan I thought you were talking with Ava\" Frank said \"How much did you here?\" Rachel asked getting out of Frank's embrace and turning towards her child \"Enough to know that I was right about everything and my parent's have been fucking each other this whole time!\" Logan just looked at her parents and they looked pathetic \"We were going to tell you honey\" Rachel spoke \"Oh yeah\" \"We were honey\" \"No you weren't and why would you want to keep me in the dark about this?\" \"It's complicated honey\" Frank put in \"I can't believe you two had me thinking that I was crazy because I seen the signs. You kept feeding me these lies about you just loving each other as best friends and nothing more. I thought I was a mistake at one point in my life, just an accident that didn't mean to happen but it did. Just a product of a singer and her bodyguard who had wanted nothing more than a one night stand!\" \"Logan you were never a mistake!\" Rachel said begging her to believe \"We love you Logan\" Frank added \"Both of you just shut up and leave me alone! I can't deal with this shit right now\" Logan passed one of her hands along her forehead. She could feel a headache coming on. \"I've got to get out of here like now!\" She turned and walked away from them both Frank turned to Rachel \"I knew keeping it away from her was a bad idea!\" \"Yeah blame everything on Rachel!\" \"Well it was your idea\" \"Tsk!\" they both left to go after Logan, but she had other plans for them. The restaurant was still packed and Logan was sure that there had to be some Rachel Marron fans in the house. So she announced it out loud and clear that her mother was in the building. Rachel had just heard what her daughter said right before she watched her leave out the front doors. Frank looked towards Rachel and went into bodyguard mode as a stampede of people came rushing towards Rachel. Logan walked passed the people who didn't know what was going on inside, and hopped into her mother's Range Rover driving away. Eventually the place had to be shut down and the police were called.

Lots of love for ya! Enjoy Leo's l'il sista Prologue Tap. Tap. Tap. \"It's almost twelve o'clock on Tuesday evening of August 18, 2000,\" JosienGeller typed onto her laptop. \"But I anticipate the evening more thannothers, for when the hour hand and the minute hand meet at the highestnpoint on the clock, it will be my first anniversary in marriage to thentruly only man I love, my dearest husband~~~Sam Coulson.\" She paused for a moment as she allowed her blue eyes to stare hard at thenname on the screen. She curled her lip, debating whether it wasnunprofessional to put her husband's actual name in her article. Was it corny? Did it sound stuck up? But then she thought~~~did she care? She grinned as her eyes fell on the framed picture sitting next to her deskntop. It was their wedding picture, their first portrait as Mr. And Mrs. SamnCoulson. She'd never liked her pictures and if she was the person she wasnlast year, she wouldn't be caught dead displaying a picture of herself onnher desk. She'd never thought for a second that she was pretty, let alone beautiful.nShe was a nerd, a walking dictionary who's lifetime goal was to correctneveryone's grammar, including what came out of the mouths of people whonwere unfortunate to come in contact with her. But Sam Coulson had changed all that~~~he'd changed her. He made her feelnthat she was beautiful and that she did deserve to be loved. He constantlyninsisted that it was he who was lucky to have found her and not the othernway around. And he loved Shakespeare and having perfect grammar as much asnshe did. He was perfect. And their August Wedding had been as picture perfect as the photo she wasnglancing at. \"And he hadn't complained about being in a penguin suit that day,\" Josienremembered. A flashback from prom materialized in her head when he'd toldnher that she made a beautiful prom queen and that he felt like he didn'tnbelong. \"~~~Wearing these penguins suits~~~it's like I'm at my own wedding~~~\" Actually she had pointed that out to him on their wedding day and he hadnclaimed that he wouldn't have had it any other way. She stared at Sam's name once again and giggled. Of course it had to be there! She'd created the article to convey to thenworld how things were going with her \"mystery teacher,\" one year afternshe'd written the article to win his heart. And Sam Coulson was the only reason she was this happy. And it really had been one year of true bliss. Why not let the world in on how happy she was? This world needed somenliterature that wasn't depressing as Dorothy Parker's works. Plop! Josie reached for a tissue after she was the tear splat again the table andndabbed her eyes. It still got to her. She'd never thought she would be happy. She'd stopped believing that dreamsncould come true after prom and that there was somebody out there that wasnmeant just for her. But after getting her first undercover story as a high school student,nshe'd not only wont he man of her wildest passionate day dreams, but she'dnbeen able to discover herself, gotten the chance to live her lifelong highnschool dream of hanging out with the most popular girls in school, defendednthe denominators against their number-crunching rivals and gotten Rob intonthe minor league, right where he belonged. Not in the lame job at the tiki post with the free lei's.nAnd things had just continued to turn out better. She had now achieved thensuccess of becoming a major reporter for the Chicago Sun Times, married tona man who loved her deeper than any love she could have ever hoped for. Asnfor Sam, he was now teaching at the college, and even managed to squeeze inntime for the local hockey team between spoiling her with romantic eveningsnand grading term papers. She stared at her screen and gasped. She'd written down everything she'd been thinking. She read it through andnto her surprise she found she didn't need to change a thing, which was anfirst for Josie Geller who had managed to find at least one thing wrong innevery paper she'd edited in her life. But it was perfect Life was perfect. She took a composing breath and took the break from her screen as a chancento glance at the cuckoo clock on the wall. Five minutes to twelve. She hit save on the document and waited for the painstaking seconds it tooknto download onto her disk. She heard the shower turn off and grinned, heat creeping into her alreadynflushed cheeks. Sam had five minutes to come out so they could be in each other's arms thenmoment Aug 19 began. She wondered if he would make it this time. He'd beenna devastating one minute and a half late to meet her on the pitcher's moundntwo May's ago. And what nerve he had after she'd taken the risk of totallynhumiliating herself and her reputation by not only writing a full page onnhow she'd been a geek during her high school years, but revealing herntruest feelings to who else but the English teacher she'd deceived whilenshe'd acted as a seventeen-year old Josie Geller high school student atnSouth Glen High last spring by proposing he meet her at the final baseballngame of the season and give her her first real kiss in front of the wholenstadium. \"Hmm~~~\" she thought, reopened her laptop and began typing again. \"A good writer only wrote what she knew,\" that was her motto and she knewnputting her exact feelings down on paper would be the best way to benpersonable with her readers and create an excellent article. \"Josie, you still typing on that thing?\" Sam Coulson chuckled as he closednthe bathroom door behind him. \"It's almost our anniversary.\"nJosie felt her heart jump into her throat. \"You remembered,\" she beamed andnturned around in her seat, dropping everything she was doing for thatnminute. Sam was standing there with only a pair of sweats on. His tanned chest andnabdomen were exposed, and still dripping with water from the hot showernhe'd just taken. The room was filled with the aromatic scent of the soapnthat had been absorbed into his skin. Josie blushed when she saw Sam raise an eyebrow at her. He frequently didnthat when he caught her staring at him. God, could she help it if her husband was sexy? \"Of course I did,\" he crooned as he trotted up to her and slipped hisnstrong arms around her waist and nuzzled his cheek against hers. \"Thisnmarks one year of the best year of my life too.\" \"Sam, that is so sweet,\" she giggled, leaning against his bare chest.n\"You've definitely made it this time too.\" Confusion grew in Sam's emerald eyes and Josie felt humiliated that hendidn't recall what she was referring too. But then he glanced over at thenclock and when he looked back at her, he was grinning. \"Have you beenncounting five minutes till?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Well honey, we've got two more minutes and I don't think it counts ifnyou're focusing on the screen and not me,\" he chided her in a husky voice. \"I'm just saving my work,\" she put in hurridely and let out a contentednsigh when the screen notified her that the process for saving had beenncompleted on both her floppy disk as well as her hard drive. \"Is this your new article?\" he inquired as his wife stretched her arms intonthe air and locked them behind his neck. \"It certainly is!\" she beamed, kissing him on the cheek. \"Wow! I bet Chicago can't wait to read about this,\" Sam praised, placing ankiss on her forehead. \"Remember all the fan-mail you received from thatnfirst article?\" Josie nodded. She did. \"Never Been Kissed,\" had not only bumped her up to the position of majornreporter, but she'd gotten the whole of Chicago to believe in her as wellnas her writing.n\"That's who I'm writing it for. To let everyone know that I'm still in lovenwith you and will be for years to come,\" she stammered. \"And they can allnserve as witnesses that~~~this isn't a dream,\" she added then looked upninto his eyes. \"This is all really happening.\" Sam couldn't bear to see the hurt in her eyes. \"Aww Josie,\" he crooned andnheld her face in his hands as tears continued to well in her eyes andnstreamed down her cheeks.n\"I'm sorry, I've just~~~never been this happy before. I'm afraid that I'mngoing to wake up one morning and you're not going to be by my side. I'mngoing to go crazy if I can never see your sleeping face next to mine.\" Sam's heart melted. She was really the most amazing woman and he alwaysnfelt he didn't tell her that enough. She was so confident and happy, butnthen there were times when she revealed how worried she was that all thisnthat was happening was too good to be true and he found that bittersweetlynreassuring. She was going to stick around for life. \"Josie,\" he scolded her gently and waited for her to look at him. \"Josie,nthis is real. I'm real, you're real and this marriage is the best realnthing in my life,\" Sam promised her. \"And truth is sometimes I startnthinking that I'm dreaming, that life can't be this good, but then,\" hensighed affectionately and gently caressed her face. \"When I look into thosenbig blue eyes and see the love there, all my doubts disappear.\" Josie hid her head, knowing she had to be completely red in the face. He then raised her head and moved his head to hers until he could kiss hernlips. In the next second all of her doubts disappeared. In fact the onlynthing that was left existing was Sam and Sam warm familiar lips kissingnher. The rest of the world slipped away. Except for the cuckoo from the clock. Josie counted them in her mind while the rest of her was attached to hernhusband, both physically and emotionally. Ten~~~eleven~~~twelve~~~ He gently bit her on the lip and broke away allowing Josie time to catchnher breath. He had been counting the chimes himself. \"Happy Anniversary, Josie darling,\" he pronounced then added, \"and let usnpray we'll have many more of these to come.\" She stared at Sam who looked so handsome in the golden lamplight. His lightnhair shone blond and his green eyes glistened even more if that was evennpossible.n\"You know what, I've got something to give you,\" he revealed and to Josienit sounded like he'd said it as an after thought to their previousnconversation. She watched him reach into the a pocket of his coat that had been hangingnon a nearby chair. Her heart jumped into her throat when she saw a smallnvelvet box. She felt as though she were in a good romance movie. \"I~Is that for me?\" she gasped, covering her mouth. \"Of course it is, silly,\" he teased her good naturedly and handed the boxnto her awaiting hands. \"Who else would I buy an anniversary gift for?\" Josie stared at the object in her hand, in awe. And Sam Coulson was a very patient man. He had to be since he actuallynchose to teach kids he was sure didn't want to be taught to. But the dramanof the moment was playing on his last nerve. \"Aren't you going to open it?\" She was startled by his anxious expression and let out an embarrassedngiggle. She calmed her trembling fingers long enough to pry the box open. The next second her mouth dropped. \"Mr. Coulson!\" \"No, Sam, sweetheart. My name is now Sam,\" he smiled, pleased to see hernbeautiful smile that had been caused by his little gift. \"You like it?\" \"L~like it? Sam, it's beautiful!\" she gushed, her eyes glued to the trinketnglistening in the box. Nestled there was a silver ring adorned with anjeweled version of the Adeli penguin. \"I was going to save it till our dinner tonight but knowing you, you'renalways busy with articles not to mention you're working on an extra one fornyour admirers. And you were getting emotional again and our conversationnconveniently led up to it,\" he pointed out and then he dropped to his kneenand dreamily declared, \"you are my Adeli penguin, Josie.\" Sam pulled her away from her chair, not listening to any objection and satnher down on the bed. \"This is a one-of-a kind, Josie honey, so don't losenit okay,\" he pleaded with her as he took her hand and slipped the ring ontonher finger. \"I won't,\" she whispered, afraid to that she would start crying again ifnshe said anything out loud. Sam watched her raise her hand in the air andnhe wallowed in seeing her happy. \"Sam Coulson, you are the greatest! I lovenyou!\" she cried and pulled him impulsively into a hug. \"Hey!\" he laughed, and patted her back. \"Okay, I love you too.\" \"You have no idea how I feel right now,\" she told him, slowly releasing hernhold on him. \"Yeah? Why don't you tell me then?\" \"I am truly~~~lucky~~~to have you.\" \"Ditto,\" he replied then kissed her again and continued the kiss until henfelt a yawn in the back of his throat. He gently peel her reluctant armsnoff of him. \"Sam? You okay?\" she asked with concern. \"Hmm? Oh yeah, just~~~I feel like a loser to spoil this romantic moment butnyou've got an article due and don't you have a meeting with that one guyntomorrow?\" \"Gus?\" she groaned, leaning against him. She'd totally forgotten. \"Yeah. And I have four classes to teach tomorrow and I've got to squeeze innhockey practice before dinner,\" he continued, trying not to feel guilty.n\"So I really need some shut-eye, and you'll need it too if you don't wantnto go to work with bags under your eyes.\" Josie looked less than thrilled. Personally, bags under her eyes didn'tnsound like a bad idea if the cause was staying up with her husband thenprevious evening, even if they were talking about nothing. \"Come on, don't look at me like that. If you'll go to sleep now, I'll editnyour article before I go to work tomorrow,\" he offered as he got under thencovers. \"You're funny Mr. Coulson!\" she giggled and smacked him on the shoulder,nknowing very well Sam had added that comment just to tease her. Grammar wasna sore point with her and no one knew that better than Sam. \"It's Sam, Josie, SAM!\" he laughed. Josie slipped into bed beside him and was trying to get comfortable whennshe spied a thick wad of papers sitting on the table on his side of thenbed. \"Sam?\"n\"Hmm?\" he replied sleepily, his eyelids droopy, almost completely hidingnhis gorgeous green eyes from view. \"Isn't that the book you've been working on?\" she inquired. Sam forced his eyes open and followed her gaze. \"Yeah, I was wondering where I'd put that,\" he muttered, sat up in bed asnhe pulled the papers off the table then straightened them out. \"Will you read me some of that?\" Sam blushed when he heard the question and by the time he turned to look atnhis wife, he was sure his body temperature had gone up a few degrees. \"Josie, I~~~I don't like sharing my writing, especially when it's notnfinished,\" he protested. \"Besides, my work is nowhere near as good asnyours.\" Josie rolled her eyes. Obviously flattery wasn't going to get him out ofnthis mess. \"Says the Yale graduate,\" she grumbled then she clambered ontonhis chest and raised her eyes. \"Please, Sam, just one chapter? You'renalways hearing about my work and I want to hear about yours.\" Sam was thinking about scolding her and suggest they turn out the lightsnbut he didn't want to fight with her now. Besides he never got that far,nnot after seeing the soft golden curls that caressed her angel-like face,ncomplete with the most beautiful eyes, rosy cheeks and pouty lips he'd evernlaid eyes on. \"Please?\" she repeated. Sam sighed heavily, though he had to admit he was flattered that she wantednso much to do with his writing and her support for him was unbelieveable. But still. \"F~fine,\" he exhaled, giving in. \"You know there's no way I can say no whennyou look at me like that.\" \"I know,\" she grinned. He reached his hand to cover up his yawn and peered at the clock. It wasnthirty minutes past twelve. \"Okay, but just thirty minutes, the lights gonout at one.\" \"Okay,\" she agreed. Sam flipped gingerly through the pages and pulled out a chapter that he wasnsure wouldn't embarrass him too much. \"All right, ready?\" he asked Josie, who was currently laying her head onnhis built but soft abdomen. \"Yup~~~\" \"Just to warn you, I haven't edited this yet so it's~~~it's not perfect.\" \"I'm not here to judge,\" she promised him and wriggled around to makenherself more comfortable. He took a deep breath, braced himself for the cringing his wife wouldnprobably do over his bad grammar and began reading, his french accent thicknfrom nervousness. But after half a page, he realized she hadn't made one crude remark aboutnhis writing. He gazed down at his wife and saw that she was smilingnpeacefully. \"Josie?\" \"Keep reading Sam. It's very well written.\" Trust Josie's grammar to be perfect even if she was half asleep. Sam, having gained renewed confidence, plunged forward as his wife slowlyndrifted to a slumber, comforted by the warmth of his skin, the tempo of hisnbreathing and the sound of his beautiful french-accented voice.

Lataz, Total Vaughn Lover Chapter One \"Good morning, Josie!\" Anita greeted her good friend and fellownreporter when she arrived through the double-doors at the entrance thatnmorning, looking fairly rustled that morning. Once again, Anita was doingnher typical thing of being late, hence the reason she'd been fired overnfive times. She was just lucky Gus was her boyfriend. \"Good morning Anita,\" Josie hollered back, grinning from ear to ear,ntrying not to laugh at Anita's appearance. She herself was dressed in anpair of nice black slacks and matching suit jacket, a purple camisolenpeeked out from underneath showing enough of her clevage to indicate todaynwas a special day. Yes professionally she was dressed but there was something definitelyndifferently about her. And Anita couldn't quite put her finger on just what that was. \"There's something going on with you today,\" she accused, pointedlynas she fell into step right beside her. \"Really? You think so?\" Josie giggled as she made her way to herncubicle. She waved at Merck, the young man sitting near her telling whoevernon the phone that he should write down what he was saying and he wavednback, looking astounded and it wasn't because of the lacey camisole. \"Did you just wave at your assistant?\" Anita demanded after a secondnpassed, her hair characteristically flying out of place. \"Yes,\" Josie replied pleasantly, not shook up as Anita was. \"Yup, there is something definitely up with you,\" Anita diagnosed,nnarrowing her dark eyes at her companion. \"The Josie Geller I know wouldn'tnhave waved at her assistant, not unless he didn't hear you the first timenwhen you asked him for your notes,\" the brunette went onto declare, leaningnagainst Josie's desk as the owner of the desk settled in for the day. \"Maybe there is something about me that has definitely changed,\"nJosie proposed, \"I know I've become a different person since I met SamnCoulson, but you know that,\" she reminded her as she took post-it's fromnMerck who had approached her table. \"Okay, but there is something different about you. I mean, did youncurl your hair?\" Josie flipped her head, bouncing her normally bouncy blond curls. \"Mynhair has been curly for an year now, Anita.\" Anita studied her thoughtfully then began mumbling, \"Oh yeah, you'renright. Okay then you must have changed your makeup?\" She shook her head. \"Your clothes?\" She repeated the action, but this time she was trying to keep fromnlaughing. Anita continued to sit there, rambling as she stared at her as thoughnbelieving that if she stared long enough somehow the answer would appear. Josie came to the conclusion that Anita was a lost case and insteadnfocused on her work. She pulled a disk from it's case and uploaded it ontonthe computer. She glanced over at the clock. She needed to get her articlento her boss, Rigfort, if she wanted him to put it in the evening newspaper. \"Uh~~~is there a Josie Geller Coulson at this address?\" Josie snapped her head up upon hearing her name being mentioned.nStanding there was her boss, Gus. He was presently looking very irritated as he conversed with the mannhe was talking to. He was carrying a huge bouquet of flowers and twonballoons. \"Whoa, what's with the flowers,\" a fair-sized black lady interrupted,nbumping Gus on the hip. \"You getting flowers for your girlfriend now?\" She was referring to Anita and Gus flustered noticeably at thenmention of her name. \"Actually these flowers have arrived for a Mrs. Coulson,\" he huffednas he gathered his bearing then pointed to a desk at the other side of thenroom. \"Second desk on the right, it's that bouncy blond.\" \"Thanks sir,\" the flower delivery man said to him then lifted thenparcel and headed over to the desk. Gus harrumphed, glared at the happy people and then went into hisnroom, after telling somebody to ask Josie to come into his office withinnthe next minutes. Josie was meanwhile hurridely trying to erase all the little graphicnhearts her husband had added to her document. He'd claimed he was editingnit when he'd taken a go at her laptop but it seemed as though he hadn'tnfound a thing wrong with her article and had decided to, at the least,ndecorate her work. They were cute and it made her heart swell to see them but shencouldn't possibly hand it into her boss in that condition, not since Gusnwas against anything cute, flowery or romantic, to the dismay of hisngirlfriend. \"Are you Mrs. Josie Coulson?\" \"Um~~~yes,\" Josie replied, not looking up. \"Great. I have a delivery for you.\" \"A delivery,\" she wondered as though she'd never thought she couldnreceive flowers are work, and raised her head. Standing before her was a handsome young man carrying a bouquet ornroses. \"Wow, those are for me?\" \"You are Josie G. Coulson?\" he repeated, looking a little unsure ofnhimself as he re-read the name on his clipboard. \"She is,\" Anita broke in, and the man turned to the brunette. \"Okay, can you sign this? You seem a little less flustered than thenreal Josie,\" he asked her, extending his clipboard and his pen. \"Certainly,\" she told him and jotted Josie's name down onto thenpaperwork. She returned it to the delivery guy. \"Thanks Miss,\" he grinned as he glanced appreciatively at her figurenthen smiled at the blond as he gently set down the gift. \"Enjoy yournflowers.\" \"T~Thank you,\" she replied, flustered, the vase of flowers sitting onnher desk. Anita watched the young man leave, winking at him when he glancednback. Then he turned toward the blond. \"Okay, now I know this is a specialnoccasion. Spill! Is it your birthday?\" Josie didn't hear her companion and instead reached for the messagentag she spied, buried underneath the roses. It read: \"My dearest Josie,n\"But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the East and you,nJosie, are the sun.\" Okay~~~but you know that. I just wanted to let younknow that I'm thinking about you and I'm struggling through teaching \"Romeonand Juliet,\" because I can't remember what I'm supposed to be teaching. Inam anxiously looking forward to seeing you tonight. Meet me at the Ice Rinknthis evening at six o'clock, I've got a surprise for you. Love,nYour Adele Penguin.\" \"Oh My God!\" Josie squealed. \"It's from Sam!\" Anita gave her a look. Josie was acting like this Sam was not hernhusband but perhaps some guy she'd been chasing for some time and hadnfinally noticed her. \"I would hope so. I mean, I can understand a woman cheating on a guynbecause he's boring or unromantic, excluding Gus,\" she added carefully,nmaking sure her boyfriend/boss wasn't in earshot of their conversation. Josie just chuckled. \"But you've got such an adorable, good-looking and caring husbandnwho's obviously extremely romantic too,\" Anita gushed. \"But then that's angiven. He reads, teaches and breathes Shakespeare after all. So whatnspecial holiday is this that obliges Sam to treat you like a queen?\" \"Mmm~~~\"Josie sighed as she inhaled the fragrance of the flowers, itnwas almost as sweet as he was. Almost. \"Josie!\" \"O~Oh, it's,\" Josie mumbled, coming back to reality. \"~~~it's me andnSam Anniversary! Our first anniversary of marriage!\" she blurted out, andnAnita was sure the whole office had heard the announcement. It took a moment for the information to sink in and then Anita andnJosie began screaming uncontrollably. \"Aagh! That's so great! I'm so happy for you Josie! I can't believenit's already been one year!\" \"Read the message he wrote me!\" she urged her best friend, shovingnthe card in her face. Anita obliged, read it through again and then continued hernscreaming. \"JOSIE GELLER! You have got to have the most romantic husband in thenworld! Oh God! Does he have a cousin!\" \"Just wait till I tell you what happened last night!\" Josie beamed,nfeeling like she was in high school again and was gossiping over the onenline her crush had said to her. \"Um girls, sorry to interrupt this little rendez-vous but Gus wantsnto see Josie~~~Now!\" Merck apologized. \"Okay. Tell him I'll be there in a minute,\" Josie promised as shenknelt under her desk to retrieve the papers from the printer. \"Sorry Anita,nafter the meeting we can have coffee and I'll tell you all about it.\" No reply. Anita was staring at the batch of papers clasped in Josie's hands.n\"Is that what I think it is?\" Without waiting for an answer, she snatchedna copy out of her grip and gasped. \"It is! It's the anniversary edition ofnSam and Josie! Oh you've got to let me have this!\" \"No, I've got to get that to Rigfort if I plan to have it headlinednin the evening paper!\" she lamented, holding out her hand, actuallynexpecting to get it back. \"PLEASE! I've been waiting, oh, about a YEAR to read this!\" Josie was touched by her insistence. It just proved there wasnactually people who were waiting for her stories. And that never ceased tonamaze her. \"Okay, just can you print out one more on my computer so I have onento give to Rigfort when I get back?\" she gave in while straightening thenleft over papers in her hand. Being organized was key if you didn't want tonbe ridiculed by Gus during anmeeting. \"I will! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" she cried, placing thenarticle against her chest. \"You have made my day! Tell Sam \"HappynAnniversary!\" for me!\" \"I will and you're welcome,\" Josie giggled, shaking her head as shenwatched her friend dance around the office, waving her article aroundngloating, \"I'm the first in Chicago! I'm the first in Chicago!\"n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"Josie Geller,\" Gus drawled, turning from the window to face his desknwhen he heard her come in. \"It's~~~It's Coulson,\" she corrected immediately. \"I'm married!\" shengushed, like a newly-wed should. \"I remember,\" he shot back. \"I expect that you've got you article?\"nhe added with a huff. \"YES!\" she piped up and confidently handed him the pink folderncontaining her prized-article, minus the hearts. \"T~thank you.\" Josie scrutinized him as he pulled the document fromnthe folder and skimmed it for a second then slammed it down. \"So what do you think? You think Rigfort will put it in the eveningnpaper?\" \"Rigfort might, but I'm certainly not interested in on an update ofnthe story that almost cost me my job!\" Gus barked, throwing the articlenback at her. \"The article I'm trying to get a hold of is the exclusive Inasked you to compile on the President of \"Cookies n' Milk Co.\" \"Oh~~~right,\" she stammered, struggling to keep her bearings. \"It'snalso the story that saved your butt!\" she thought to herself and if shenwasn't careful, she might have said it. She dug into her briefcase for her purple folder and handed it to hernboss who practically yanked it out of her hand. \"YES!YES!\" he shouted, his frown replaced by a big greedy smile.n\"Cookies n' Milk Co: 50 mil or BUST!\" You're a GENIUS! The title alone isnPulitzer Prize material!\" Wow, were those tears coming out of Gus' eyes? \"T~thank you sir. And.\" She took a deep breath, thinking carefullynbefore she said anything. \"Mr. Gus um~~~I've been a major reporter for overnan year but it seems the only types of subjects you're having me cover arenthe not so major ones, like \"Cookies n'Milk Co, they aren't going to be onnthe market till next Spring.\" \"True.\" \"And the other article you have me write was about that d.j thatndidn't want to be a d.j,\" Josie continued. \"Yes, and how wonderful a job you did that you got him out of a jobnhe didn't want to do,\" Gus reminded her, absorbed in her chocolate chipsnand butter cookie filled front page article. \"Gus, I know I screwed up my first undercover but I~~~it's been anyear and a few months. I really think I deserve another chance,\" she statednin a low voice. Gus pulled himself away from the statistics of how many almonds theynplanned to use yearly to produce their chocolate chip almond delight tongive Josie a surprised look. \"You do, do you?\" he snickered. Josie felt her stomach plummet to the ground but nodded politely butnfirmly so he could tell that while she was professional, she meantnbusiness. She was putting herself out there, she wasn't going to back downnnow. \"S~sit down for a second, Josie,\" he suggested and gestured to thenseat. She lowered herself down and stared nervously at Gus, starting tonfeel nauseous. Ugh! She knew she shouldn't have chowed down that bignbreakfast. She'd been feeling unwell earlier that morning. \"I'm getting fired,\" she thought, panicked. \"He's going to make surenI don't work in the news business again!\" \"You're~~~\" \"Oh God! He's serious!\" she groaned. \"Serious!\" \"~~~absolutely correct.\" She blinked twice, so sure she had heart him wrong. \"What did younsay? I thought I heard you say that I was correct.\" \"And I did. Sweetie, we have been giving you those deadbeat articlesnto see what you can do with them and you've passed with flying colors!\" henbeamed, back to being the supportive boss who had sat at the baseball gamenlast May, waiting with her and the rest of the crowd for her \"teacher,\" tonappear. \"And you've certainly earned yourself a story.\" \"Uh~~~thank you,\" Josie murmured as she got to her feet to shake hisnhand, feeling even more sick to her stomach. \"So, when do I get thendetails?\" \"This afternoon, maybe even this evening.\" \"Oh um~~~boss, I~~~it's my first wedding anniversary and I'm meetingnmy husband for dinner later,\" she protested, feeling terrible. \"Not a problem,\" he said to Josie's relief. \"We can arrange for younto get the information tomorrow. I'll take this and send it up and givenRigfort his article,\" Gus assured her. \"Uh~Okay~~~I will.\" Gus looked at his reporter strangely. \"Josie, are you okay?\" \"Yeah, why?\" \"Just, you look like you're drunk,\" he explained, watching her withnworried eyes as she wobbled over to the door. \"And you're sweating.\" \"I feel a little nauseous but I'm sure it's not a problem. I'll justngo out and get some fresh air, maybe get something from the vendingnmachine,\" she told her boss. \"Okay, just~~~take is easy, okay,\" he cautioned her. \"You're one ofnour star reporters and we can't have you getting sick now.\" \"I won't,\" she promised, and exited the door, wondering why she wasnso breathless. \"So, what did Gus want?\" Anita demanded the moment she met Josie'sngaze, standing with a group of females also wanting to know, and perhaps,nwanting a copy of her \"lovey-dovey,\" article as well. \"Oh uh~~~it seems that I was~~~pr~~~pro~~~\" She never finished her sentence and instead collapsed onto the floor. Anita walked to the side she was facing and knelt down. \"Josie? Arenyou okay?\" No reply. Anita let out a scream that was answered promptly by Gus, who camenout the room looking characteristically irritated. \"What? What's going onnhere? Can't we keep order? This isn't high school you know,\" he was barkingnwhen his foot hit the body sprawled on the floor. \"O~okay. Anita. Call 911.nShe's dehydrated.\" \"You sure that's it?\" she chittered nervously, biting her nails whilenGus seemed to have total control. \"Yeah, she was acting strangely during our meeting,\" he reported thennwith a smile he repeated. \"So do you wanna dial that number for me,nsweetie?\" Anita blushed when he called her \"sweetie. \"Y~yes, I'll be rightnback,\" shenreplied, then got to her feet and hurried over to the phone. Okay! Chapter One for ya! Please review! And I left ya'll with a nicencliffie! Oh wait~~~ I think I can hear Sam's footsteps, and they're getting faster!nGive me a review and you'll know what I'm talking about!!! Lots of love for ya![Chapter 3] WOW SO MANY REVIEWS!!!!

Please Continue to Read and Review,nTotal Vaughn Lover Chapter 2 \"May I help you sir?\" the nurse inquired to the sexy man who had rushed upnto her desk. \"H~hi,\" Sam panted, slamming his hand down onto the desk, barely stoppingnto catch his breath. \"My name is Sam Coulson, I received a call that mynwife was brought here.\" \"Okay Mr. Coulson, can I have your wife's name please?\" she asked sweetlynand flirtatiously. \"Josie,\" he stated, closing his eyes to suppress his tears. \"Josie GellernCoulson.\" \"Just a moment,\" she crooned and began typing on her computer, completelynflustered. Sam couldn't believe how calmly and slowly the receptionist wasngoing about things. Didn't she realize he was worry-stricken and that henwanted be by his wife's side as soon as possible. After all, this was theirnfirst anniversary. It wasn't right to spend it alone, let alone in anhospital. \"Hmm~~~I don't' see a Josie Geller on here,\" the nurse mumbled. \"It's Josie Geller COULSON!\" he repeated, his fear of his wife's conditionnmaking his voice sound impatient. \"Sir, you're emotionally distressed so I am not going to call you on it butnyour rudeness is not going to help me get this done any faster for you,\"nshe scolded him, no longer flirting with him. There was no point, he wasnmarried and it was evident from his concern the only woman he had eyes fornwas his wife. Sam stared at her in disbelief, but backed off and went to sit down in thennearest seat. He clasped his hands together and propped his chin onto them. \"Please let me be all right,\" he prayed, closing his eyes. Tears streamedndown his cheeks and mixed with the cold sweat that was forming on his body.n\"Please God, just let her be okay,\" he repeated feverishly as thoughnrepetition was all that mattered. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"It's that man right there,\" the nurse whispered to the doctor thatnhad arrived in the reception area. \"What was he doing to you?\" the doctor demanded, shooting a glare at thenintruding man who, from his point of view,\" seemed to just be rattled fromnconcern. \"I was trying to help him find out if his wife was here but henwouldn't be patient, and you know I'm just learning how to use thencomputer, and the way he was acting made me almost have a panic attack!\" \"Hey calm down,\" he told his usually very obnoxious assistant whonseemed to be having a panic attack. \"I'm trying~~~\" she whimpered, \"but I can't with him in the room!\"nshe started hyperventilating. \"He's a patient, what do you want me to do about it?\" he thought asnhe gently rubbed her back. He glanced at the clock. \"When's the last timenyou had a break?\" \"Uh~~~not for five hours! Cindy was supposed to come in but she neverndid! And she knows I can't~~~\" \"Why don't you take five,\" Dr.Andrews told her, extending a paper bagnthat she promptly put to her mouth and began breathing into it. \"I'll takencare of him, call for a replacement, and man the desk till she gets here.\" \"O~Okay,\" she gasped between gasps. \"T~Thank you.\" \"Yup, take it easy. I don't' want to go out to the Emergency Bay andnfind you've gone hypoctic,\" he warned her. She nodded and went on her way,nwheezing as she did. The doctor kept an eye on her for another second, then stepped up tonthe young man who was now crying, covering his face with his hands. \"Hey,\" he greeted, adopting a friendly tone. \"Can I help you?\" Sam raised his head and gazed at the doctor with his blood-shot eyes.n\"I don't' know. I went up to the nurse and she was too busy being ditzy tontake me seriously.\" \"Um Mr.~~~\" \"Sam~~~Sam Coulson,\" he answered, wiping his hand on the side of hisnpants. \"Mr. Coulson, I understand your frustration but I must ask you tonrefrain from belittling my team,\" the doctor put in seriously. \"This is anhospital and we get cases like this all the time. And we ask that thenfamilies of our patients cooperate with everyone on our staff. I think younrealized your harassing our nurses didn't get you very far,\" Dr. Andrewsnreasoned taking a seat next to him. \"I~I didn't mean to do that,\" he apologized as he leaned forward onnhis elbows. \"It's just that I got pulled out my class for an emergency cal.nFinding out Josie was take to the hospital was bad enough. I thought I'dnbeen called to the wrong hospital when the nurse said she couldn't findnher. It turned out she didn't put in the correct last name. And my patiencenwas running low.\" Dr. Andrews nodded his head with understanding. \"I didn't mean to bark at her,\" Sam continued and his voice crackednhorribly. \"I just wanted to see her, you know. It's my first anniversarynwith Josie and I'm not ready to lose her just yet.\" \"It's understandable, Mr. Coulson,\" he repeated and squeezed him onnthe shoulder. \"And you know what, I can help you out, bud.\" Sam looked at him, his eyes filled with innocence and hope. \"Youncan?\" \"Yeah, your wife is a blond right? Curly blond hair, skin likenporcelain? Big green eyes?\" he inquired, the husband who nodded. \"That's her. Do you know where she is?\" Sam demanded, seeing a ray ofnlight for the first time since he entered the hospital. \"Yeah, as a matter of fact I do,\" he told him with a smile then heldnout is hand, \"I'm Dr. Christopher Andrews. I'm the one who saw your wifenwhen she came in.\" \"She's good. She fainted from what they thought was dehydration atnwork. We assumed that too and so we're giving her fluids right now,\" thendoctor reported cheerily. \"So no worries.\" Sam let out a sigh of relief. \"But there is something I want to discuss with you first,\" the doctornadded, still looking very happy. \"You want to come with me for a second?\" Sam followed the doctor to the door behind the administration desknthen followed him in on his beckoning and sat down on seat before hencollapsed onto the floor, overwhelmed with relief. 'I know what you're thinking. We don't usually allow patients backnhere due to patient confidentiality but somebody needs to watch this desknuntil my replacement comes in,\" Dr. Andrews replied, responding to hisnunasked question. \"And I do have to talk to you. I'm going to keep it realnbrief though since I know you want to see your wife.\" But Sam had already forgotten that. Sure, he wanted to see her, henwanted to see her open her eyes like she were waking up from a dream andnscoop her up into his arms. But he wanted to hear what the doctor had tonsay first. He could barely keep himself from strangling the doctor as heninnocently made a phonecall to page a nurse to take over reception. \"So what's wrong with her?\" he burst out before the doctor had putnthe phone back on its' receiver. \"Mr. Coulson, don't look so alarmed, I never said the news was bad,\"nDr. Andrews chided him as he wrote on his clipboard. \"I just said we needednto discussnsomething.\" There was an awkward silence that followed as Sam waited for thendoctor to finish whatever he was concentrating on. \"Right, the first question I have for you is if you'll be able tontake time off of work to go to monthly check ups with your wife to thenobstrecian.\" Sam was silent. Obstrecian? Wasn't that a baby doctor? \"And the second question is when you'll want to take your pre-birthnclasses,\" he added as he tapped his pen on the table. \"They can be early onnin the pregnancy but we prefer that you take them around 28 to 32 weeks.\" When the doctor didn't get a reply, he look up to gauge the expectingnfather's reaction. Sam was staring at the table and a second later, when he lifted hisnhead, there was a confused but hopeful expression on his face. \"Dr.nAndrews, forgive me for saying this but~~~my wife isn't pregnant.\" \"You sure about that?\" he inquired, looking a bit disappointed.n\"Because we ran a blood test on her, then we ran a pregnancy testnand~~~well, the tests are conclusive.\" \"B~but I thought that she was supposed to have morningnsickness~~~\"Sam stated, then he cut himself off as the wheels started tonturn in his head. \"Wait a minute, she was nauseated this morning.\" \"You two are married, correct? I mean~ you have~~~consumated yournrelationship?\" Sam bit his lip, looking quite uncomfortable to be asked thatnquestion so directly by a medical professional. \"I'm only asked pertaining to the medical reasons, it's either thatnor your wife has been doing something she shouldn't be,\" he hinted and thendoctor chuckled when he realized Sam was taking him seriously. \"I'mnkidding, Mr. Coulson.\" \"Oh,\" he sighed and his face visibly relaxed as he let out a breath.n\"Does she know?\" he asked then, not knowing why his voice had dropped to anwhisper. \"N~No,\" he replied. \"She was out when I was taking blood from her.nI'm guessing she's either bad with needles or can't stand the sight ofnblood. \"Maybe~~~I know I'm not too good with that stuff,\" Sam rebuked,nshuddering at the thought of getting a veni-puncture, or any type ofnpuncture period. \"Well, I think this is perfect. It's your wedding anniversary and youncan tell her she's pregnant. I strongly felt she might not like to hearnabout it from a doctor who just made her miserable. And besides it's anspecial moment between you two, go enjoy it.\" \"Oh I will,\" he beamed, already a proud papa. \"How long has she beennpregnant?\" \"Three weeks. We got her to the hospital just before she wouldnrequire her first check up,\" Dr. Andrews told him as he collected a varietynof pamphlets from the drawers. \"We give these during the first check up,nbut obviously you're not going to require that,\" he explained as he putnabout ten booklets in his hands. Sam briefly skimmed the title. He was overwhelmed, seemed there was anlot more to becoming a parent than he'd realized. He'd been teaching kidsnfor a few years now but right now he suddenly felt nineteen again, not ancare in the world, wondering where the time had gone when he'd amusednhimself with G.I Joe's. He suddenly wasn't sure if they were ready to havena baby. \"Hey Chris, you needed a replacement?\" Dr. Andrews looked up and smiled at the pretty young woman standingnin the doorway. \"Yeah, I've got to take this expecting father to is baby'snmother before he loses his mind. I'll be back in five minutes, will younwatch this desk, page me if you need me.\" The replacement nodded as she took her seat. Dr. Andrews then turnednto Sam, who he couldn't believe was looking more nervous, if that was evennpossible. He literally looked like he was ready to wet his pants. \"Younready to deliver the good news, Mr. Coulson?\" \"Uh~~~yeah.\" \"Great,\" the doctor grinned. \"Follow me.\" `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Meanwhile Josie was nestled in her bed in a recovery room. But shenwas everything but restful. She was in a state that she knew had to be a dream but couldn'tnbelieve it because of how tangible everything was. She was standing in what looked like a college classroom. The rowsnand rows of ascending desks was a dead give away. \"What am I doing here?\" she wondered as she looked around the room.nThe only thing she could conclude was that this was Sam's room and he wasngoing to walk through the classroom doors any minute. She looked over at the good-sized wooden desk that was sitting on thenright side of the room, and went over to it and sat down in the comfortablenlooking desk chair, suddenly overwhelmed by fatigue. She laid back andntwiddled with a pen, waiting for something to happen. Nothing did. \"She tapped her fingers on the chestnut finish then after a fewnmoments began sorting through the drawers not sure of what she was lookingnfor. Then she spied a large pile of papers that looked suspiciouslynfamiliar. And in the next instant, she knew what it was. It was Sam'snnovel. She reached for the bulky object, held neatly together with threenhuge binder clips and set it before her. She then stared at it, feeling as though she were treading onnforbidden ground, therefore her fingers hesitated before she opened it tonthe first page. Sam would never forgive her, even if he loved her. there was justnsome things even wives couldn't do. But then again~~~this was a dream. There was no way he could findnout. And really, what were the chances the novel would even be accurate? She flipped the blank page over and revealed on the next page was antitle page. Actually it was a page of several titles some of them had asterisksnnext to them and others had been crossed out so viciously, it was obviousnthat the writer wanted to make sure they could never be read again. She fawned over the ones he felt were good and then drove herselfncrazy trying tonfigure out what lied beyond the scribbled mess. Finally after she pulled herself away from the titles (i.e \"DearnJosie,\" \"Meant to be?\"). She flipped through another title pate, a lengthynauthor's note and acknowledgements. She debated whether she should readnthrough the dedication then decided she'd seen enough. Some things shenwanted to keep a surprise for later, plus she was sure Sam would be able tonsee through it if she tried to act like she was seeing it for the firstntime. She heard the unmistakable creak of the door. Josie raised her head in shock. There he was, Sam Coulson, swingingnhis briefcase as he bounded down the steps, his heels echoing off the wallsnsounded more deafening in the empty room. \"Crap!\" she yiped as she hurridely shoved the book into its' formernposition in the drawer. Then she scrambled off his desk and decided tonstand next to it, just as Sam reached the ground level. Josie felt herself falling in love again as she watched him seatnhimself in his chair. He was just as handsome at that moment as he'd beennthe first moment she'd laid eyes on him. In face he was wearing the samenoutfit of a white shirt under a nice blue collared shirt, coordinated withna pair of darker blue pants and polished leather shoes. He leaned back, stretched into the air, then popped open hisnbriefcase and pulled out what curiously looked like a picture frame, whichnhe set on the desk. Josie peered carefully over his shoulder. It was one of the picturesnSouth Glenn High's paparazzi had taken of her and Sam when they'd spent annafternoon painting a backdrop for their prom scene. She blushed and stumbled backwards, completely mortified. She made anmental note to herself not to find the picture frame if it even existed. That was until she heard Sam chuckle as he pulled out a stack ofnungraded term papers and then let out a contented sigh. \"I can never get enough of you, Josie, especially in this picture,\"nshe heard him mutter and felt it safe too back over at him. He was staringndreamily at the picture and she could barely stiffle her giggle. \"Especially with that yellow on your forehead,\" he continued,nlaughing. For a second Josie wondered if he could actually see her and wishednshe could vanish on the spot. And hey, it was a dream. Maybe it couldnhappen. \"Hmm~~~better buckle down and get to work it if have any hope ofntalking to Josie tonight before she goes to sleep,\" she heard him mumble tonhimself. Then he shook his body out as though that was all he needed to donto reenergize himself for the tedious task of appreciating term papersnwritten by students who had little appreciation for the English languagenthen set to work. Josie expected Sam to read the first line, maybe skim the body of thenpaper, write some comments and then put a letter grade at the top of thenpaper. But in actuality, he sat there for about five minutes absorbed innthe words, not picking up his red pen once, while she, who was reading overnhis shoulder would have picked up the pen every two lines. Sam howeverndidn't seem to notice it seemed impossible but Mr. Coulson was actuallynreading it purely for context. She watched as he laughed at the amusing quirks and his brow furrowednwhen he he could feel the writer's frustration, and his forehead producedntwo distinct wrinkles at moment of sorrow. It was obvious he liked what he did from the way he acted. He wasnleaned back, with his legs crossed, pure delight in his face as though henwere enjoying a good book. Josie was suddenly angered that his ex-ngirlfriend had once upon a time tried to steal this from Sam, asked him tonthrow away what he loved most and become a part of her firm in New York. She couldn't bring herself to believe that Alice had ever loved him.nShe knew she loved Sam but she could never him to give up what he enjoyednmost, just like she wouldn't expect him to ask her to give up her love fornwords. Quite frankly, she was sure that both of them would go insanenwithout words as a big aspect of their lives. She continued to watch him for a few minutes mores, not a moment ofnit was boredom. He just looked very attractive when he was serious. She hadnto admit his gentle but firm way of pulling a class under control was verynappealing. The door creaked open again, Sam didn't stray his eyes from what henwas doing and hers would have immediately redirected themselves toward thennoise if Sam wasn't acting peculiar. \"Hey Sam.\" Josie's heart gave a nasty squeeze as she recognized it was a femalenvoice addressing her husband. And how heartbroken she sounded too. It was obvious Sam was thinking for his head snapped up the nextnsecond and his expression was that of concern. \"Ms. Leosis,\" he gasped. \"what happened to you?\" That was the same thought running through Josie's mind as she turnednher head, only to witness her former classmate Kirsten Leosis speed pastnher and barrel into Sam, pushing him down against the table, and then tonJosie's horror, began kissing him with her extremely pouty lips. Josie felt her heart shatter into a million different piecesnespecially when she saw Sam's hand come around her head and responded tonher kiss. She was swept by an overwhelming bout of jealousy, which she'dnalways had towards Kirsten who was only the most popular girl of SouthnGlenn High's class of 1999, with her long legs, perfect face, beautifulnfigure and tanned skin while Josie always felt too pale, too blond and tooncurvy. The only one who'd been able to pull her out of that run had been hernhusband Sam, who she'd always feared she would lose to somebody, that shenwould never be good enough for. And now it seemed her worst nightmare was coming true. She could barely keep from breakign down completely as she lookednover at them again. Only this time Kristen was in an utter state of shock,ntotally speechless as she walked away mumbling to herself until Sam grabbednone wrist and jerked her back. \"Sam! What do you think you're doing!\" she shrieked, tears rollingndown her cheeks, staining her perfect complexion. \"What do you mean what am I doing?\" he stammered, looking completelyninnocent. \"You're the one that came up to~~~\" SMACK! Josie watched as Sam stumbled backwards, reacting to the slap Kirstennhad given him. It had to be pretty hard to leave the red handprint that nowndisplayed on his face. \"I can't believe you, Mr. Coulson! You're married, what are you doingnmaking advances toward me!\" Kirsten screamed and Josie found herselfnlooking with disbelief at her husband. The current situation was alteringnher judgement. \"I mean Josie is pregnant! IF you wanted me, you shouldn'tnhave made that mistake!\" \"Kirsten, I'm not going to scream at you because something isnobviously going on with you. Now why don't you tell me what that is,\" Samnsuggested in an eerily calm tone, as he folded his arms. \"No! The reason you're not going to say anything is because you'renthe one who tried to rape me!\" she shrieked tears rolling down her cheeks,nand her body trembled as though there was an invisible draft in the room. \"I should wash your mouth out with soap!\" Sam thundered as he kneltndown to father his papers. \"Lying to a teacher is almost as bad as cursing,nMs. Leosis. I would have expected more respect from you.\" \"Oh no, don't' put this on me! You're the one who's been looking atnme. I saw checking me out at our reunion,\" she put in accusingly, her eyesnflashed with her anger. \"And then you hugged me.\" Josie was sure she's fallen into the depths of hell. Sweet, honestnSam Coulson~~~where had he gone?\" \"Only because it was so nice to see you again. And I also hugged Ms.nKristen Ray, and Ms. Gibby Zarefsky, and I think I even kissed Aldys on thenhand,\" Sam admitted, then his anger slipped and he let out a chuckle. \"Younknow Kirsten, I know you were checking me out all senior year but I didn'tnembarrass you and because you had those feelings, I didn't think that younwould react this way.\" \"Are you trying to justify your behavior towards me?\" Kirsten gasped,nlooking as Sam as though he'd committed the ultimate betrayal. \"Damn,nwouldn't Josie love this?\" \"Leave my wife out of this, young lady,\" he commanded her. \"And justnso you know, you've got two seconds to apologize to me before I got to thenDean and give you restraining order from this institution. \"Hey, you're a teacher so you may not really give a damn aboutnreunions but I do, and if you lift a finger to ruin so much as second of mynweek here, I'll go to Josie myself and tell her what happened,\" she sneerednhaughtily. \"Then I'll go to the Dean myself and file for harassment and Inthink you know what would happen there I don't' know about you but I don't'nthink you'll be able to support your child everywhere without a job andnwhat a father you'll make being a sex offender.\" \"Listen to me, Kirsten,\" Sam said as calmly and monotone as he could.n\"Nothing happened here~~~\" \"Then why are you shaking?\" Sam didn't have a response to that. Then he watched as Kirstennascended the stairs, contemplating exactly what happened here. She found him literally sweating as he sat down at his desk. And henhad good reason to be as far as Josie was concerned. She watched him as henpulled out another paper but she noticed immediately that his eyes wouldn'tnstare long at the paper before his hands got so shaky that that slammed hisnpaper down. \"Three more days,\" she heard him whine. \"She'll be gone in three morendays, Sam, just hold it together.\" Oh no, did this mean Sam had been fighting his urges or did he justnreally miss her? And where was she in this dream? She got her answer the next second. Sam was writing flimsy comments on his paper when his cell phonendecided to ring. He picked it up with a shaky hand and peered at the namenon the screen. Josie. She watched him pick up the phone then smiled at her. \"Josie? Hey,nhow are you sweetie?\" \"You didn't call I was getting worried,\" she heard Sam croon like anlove sick puppy. \"I was just getting ready to call you.\" \"Me? OH, I'm still at school, trying to get through all my papernwork, you know, final papers so I can send these eager college students tonsummer. Hopefully I won't have to keep any of them for summer school,nheaven knows I need a vacation.\" \"Well, I might pull a few strings. I'm going to do the most that Inpossibly can. I~I'm going to need time with the baby to become an adequatenfather.\" \"Well are you taking care of yourself? What! What do you mean mynvoice is shrill? No~nothing's wrong. I~I'm just tired. Yeah, I'm also tirednof going to sleep in an empty bed. So don't you dare tell me you havenanother extension, you need to get homenand get some rest.\" \"I know, I know,\" he huffed, trying not to come off as irritated.n'You're just doing your job, I~I'm just worried about you, I don't' wantnyou getting all stressed out since you're so late into pregnancy.\" \"And I guess I should let you get some sleep,\" he said with a touchnof finality to his voice. \"Okay~~~I love you too, bye bye.\" Josie was now positive this was a dream. It had to be, Sam hadnblatantly lied on the phone to her. She knew he wouldn't do that to her innreal life. Would he? \"I didn't do anything,\" he said to himself feverishly as though henwas having a hard time trying to convince himself of that fact. She assumednhe was probably think why he was freaking out if he hadn't and nothing hadnhappened. She wanted to suddenly materialize there and give him the shocknof his life, but unfortunately that didn't seem to be one of the elementsnshe had control over in the dream world. \"Just get me outta here,\" she pleaded, as tears tumbled down herncheeks. She crouched on the floor and began to cry. \"Josie, Josie,\" she heard a male voice call out to her. \"No~~~not today mister. Give me a few hours to swallow what justnhappened,\" she barked feeling very mean but also feeling perfectly finenwith it. \"Josie~~~\"Sam sounded almost whiny. When had he gotten so pathetic? \"JOSIE!\" she heard say briskly then felt someone grip her wrist verynstrongly. Her eyes flashed open and she found herself staring directly at hernhusband's face which was about one foot away from hers. His brows werenfurrowed, his forehead creased, and his sparkling green eyes had beenndulled with worry. \"S~Sam?\" \"Y~you're awake!\" he beamed, his face lighting up instantly with ansmile. \"Man Josie, you gave me a good scare. You were talking in yournsleep, I thought you were getting delirious but you weren't running anfever~~~I was just about to get Dr. Andrews,\" he continued rambling on asnthough he'd just run home from school and had to tell his mom everything innone minute that he didn't realize Josie was crying, \"Honey? Are you okay?\" She didn't say a word. She instead pulled hesrelf up in her bed then heldnher arms out signaling that she needed a hug. Sam obliged and pulled her into his built arms and rubbed her back,nmaking soothing noises. \"I~I just h~had the worst nightmare,\" she blubbered, her wordsndissolved into ununderstandable sobs. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Josie. But I'm here and I love you. Everything isngoing to be okay,\" he repeated, kissing her on the cheek then on thenforehead. \"Would you feel better if you talked about it?\" he asked then, asnhe loosened his hold so she could move back, she only went far enough sonthat their foreheads were still touching. She saw how concerned and eager to help her husband was and suddenlynfelt silly, a whirling six year old inside of a grown woman's body. \"It's~~~it's probably going to sound really stupid,\" she warned him,ncracking an embarrassed smile. \"Nothing you say is stupid,\" he promised her. \"Okay~~~I just dreamed that you cheated on me,\" she began verynbluntly. \"I was away and I saw you were grading papers and then~~~Kirstenncame through the door, then slammed you against the desk and~~~' she camento an abrupt pause, tears clogged her throat, rendering her unable to speaknthen she let out a sob that sounded as though it'd been suppressed andnfinally exploded from her diaphragm. \"Kirsten?\" Sam inquired, completely clueless. \"Who?\" \"Leosis, you know the beauty queen.\" Sam's eyes widened as recognition hit him. \"Leosis, you mean fromnSouth Glen High?\" \"One of the three that prowled the school like they owned the place.\" \"Well, you just push away whatever you saw because it's not true.nKirsten got into a cheer school along with Kristen and Ms. Zarefsky,\" henreminded her. \"They're nowhere near Chicago.\" \"Yeah, b~but~~~I don't know I'm afraid it's going to happen, not thatnI don't' trust you but it was eerie, it felt so real. None of my dreamsnhave ever been that tangible.\" \"Sweetie, I believe you okay?\" he cajoled her realizing his tonendidn't sound too comforting. \"Is there anything in this dream that seemsnlike something I can tell you will or will not happen in the near future.\" \"W~well, there was me, I was gone, you talked to me through a cellnphone. And then there was your book sitting in your desk.\" \"Did you read it?\" he panicked. \"Because I hope you know Sam's desknin a dream requires the same respect as Sam's desk in real life.\" \"N~No,\" she lied. \"And the Kirsten things, she was in town because ofna South Glen reunion that's supposed to happen spring quarter of next year.n\"And~~I wasnpregnant, that was the worst part, you cheated on me while I was pregnant!\" Josie began sobbing again and handsome Sam's heart broke. He couldn'tnbear to watch her cry. \"Josie, I'm going to be honest with you, one of them that younmentioned is true.\" Josie's face scrunched up as though she was going to start blubberingnonce again. \"Now before you start crying, my book is not in my desk at work. Itnwon't remain private if it was there. And I have the calendar for specialnevents as the special events coordinator and I know there is no South GlennHigh reunion,\" Sam coaxed her, rubbing her tears away with the corner ofnhis thumb, not to smudge her eyeliner. \"And don't you think the high schoolnI taught at would tell me there's a reunion coming up months in advance?\" Josie considered this and to her great relief, what he said madensense. \"But what about Kirsten?\" \"What about her?\" he shot back, nonchalantly. \"Did she like you? I mean, I know you're modest so I'm going to benquite frank, you're the hottest high school teacher I've ever laid eyesnon.\" \"Hmm~~~thanks,\" he said with a modest smile. \"Y~yeah, those threenalways tried to get me to dance with them at Homecoming but ournrelationship is purely, student-teacher, if that.\" \"So what part is the truth then?\" she inquired, biting her lip, shenwasn't sure she wanted to hear this. \"Couldn't you guess?\" Josie shook her head, clearly not getting it. That was also why shencouldn't understand why he looked so giddy, so absolutely pleased. \"J~Josie~~~baby~~~I don't know how to break this to you other thannjust to come out and say it, you're pregnant.\" She just stared at him. \"Honey, did you hear me/\" he whispered. \"We're going to have a baby!\" \"N~Now?\" she gasped. \"Yeah, well, I mean you conceived. It's going to be eight monthsnbefore we'll be able to hold him or her in our arms, but yeah~~~we're goingnto be parents.\" \"Oh my gawd! Sam!' she shrieked, tears starting to form, overwhelmednby happiness. \"I know. I couldn't believe it when Dr. Andrews told me,\" Sam cried.n\"I almost fainted when they told me you were in the hospital. But now itnall makes sense. You being nauseated this morning, your passing out atnwork, it's because your body's going through changes, big changes if younknow what I mean, wife of mine,\" he said with a grin, squeezing hernshoulders. She closed her eyes and tried to swallow everything. \"That means I've got to come to the hospital each month, and I'll getnall those weird food urges,\" she suddenly whined. \"Most likely.\" \"B~but, I hate the hospital. I've never so much as broken my arm,\"nshe whimpered. \"Didn't you hear me? I fainted while they were drawingnblood. I don't think I'm ready to have my stomach cut open.\" Sam found her bout of anxiety cute. \"We'll worry about delivery anlittle bit later down the line. And as soon as I get back to school I'mngoing to tell the good news so they can start dealing with my missing worknone day of the month as early as possible.\" \"Okay.\" \"Josie,\" he said, suddenly a lot more serious. \"I know I'm young andnI have no experience but I promise you, I'm ready to grow up. I will benthere for every doctor's appointment and I will assist you in every way Incan to make these nine months more bearable and let you know that they arenso going to be worth it.\" He was referring to the \"I don't want to grow up,\" speech he'd givennher while they'd been on the ferris wheel. \"Aww, thanks Sam, that's so sweet,\" she murmured as she mussed up hisnhair. \"You've already been a perfect husband for a full year, I don't doubtnyou're going to make an excellent father.\" Sam melted with those words like chocolate on a marshmallow simmeringnon a stick over an open fire. \"I love you so much, Josie.\" She pulled his face to hers and kissed him in response. He prolongednwhat was supposed to be a five second kiss and then after breaking awaynfrom her mouth, he lowered his head to kiss her on the stomach. \"And I lovenyou too.\" Josie giggled when he looked up, blushing furiously. \"What?\" \"Nothing.\" His gaze lingered on her face for one more second as though he didn'tnbelieve her. \"Okay, well, I got the discharge papers, if you want to getnout of here. And maybe we should postpone our anniversary plans, just to bensafe. I should probably get you to bed. You must be exhausted.\" \"Honey, that's life,\" she laughed, rolling her beautiful eyes thatnglittered like sapphire. \"And don't you have to get back to work?\" \"You're right,\" he agreed pulling his cell phone from his pocket. \"Inshould check in telling them that I'm not going to be coming back in, Inshould also call up my teammates and cancel hockey practice.\" \"No, you go back to work and go to hockey practice,\" she cut in. \"Andnour plans for tonight are going as planned.\" \"B~but you just passed out. Are you sure you're up for this tonight?\"nhe stammered, completely ready to drop his plans. \"Honey, I'll have Anita pick me up and take me back to work, you gondo your thing and I'll meet you at the ice rink, like we planned.\" \"D~do you really think that's a good idea?\" \"Sam, I'm not sick or anything. I'm pregnant. That's got to be a signnthat I'm healthy.\" \"Yeah~~~just, I don't want you passing out at work again.\" \"I won't,\" she argued with him. \"I'll see you at the ice rink atnsix.\" \"Fine,\" he exhaled, giving in, \"don't' be late.\" She nodded, gave him another embrace and Sam finally went on his way. Josie's room was now empty and she took advantage of it, by layingndown against the cream-colored pillows, inside her heart was screaming,n\"I'm Sam's baby! I'm having Sam's baby!\" The nightmare long forgotten, no longer preying on the edges of her mind, shenclosed her eyes, intending onto to get a few moments of peaceful sleep. Please REVIEW! Thanks!

THANKS FOR ALL THE REVIEWS! YOU ALL TRULY ROCK! FINALLY I'VEnUPDATED FOR YOU! PLEASE KEEP REVIEWING! I LOVE YOU ALL!!! Never Been Pregnant Total Vaughn Lover Chapter Two Sam Coulson stole the puck from who he thought was an unworthynopponent at the moment, made a quarter turn with his stick then sped off tonthe other end where the ice was clear. Standing in front of him, creating a barricade before the goal postnhe needed to get to to get a score were not one buy three of his semi-nskilled opponents, also former students of his at South Glen High. Three. Okay. So this was an amateur game, similar to a backyard gamenof basketball where making a slam dunk was a matter of jumping a few inchesnif you were six feet tall. But adrenaline pumped through his bodynnonetheless as though he were one point away from winning the NationalnHockey Championship. What could he say, he loved the sport and if he wasn't at home or innthe classroom, on the ice was where he belonged. Not that Josie particularly approved of his obsession with becomingnthe next Wayne Gretzky, especially when he came home, dragging his bloodynknees. But sometimes a guy had to do what a guy had to do. \"Come on Coulson, either score or get off the ice,\" taunted a playernwho was almost as veteran to the sport as he was, one of his formernstudents, Jason Way. Ooh, did Mr. Way make the mistake of challenging Mr. Sam Coulsonnwhile he was in his Gretzky rush? Sam grinned. \"You guys sure about this?\" he teased back, smirkingnlike a smart ass, a teenager like his practice mates and team mates on thenChicago city hockey team. \"Yeah, hurry it up already!\" Guy Perkins, the most inexperiencednplayer boom, sufficing for his lack of skill with his lip, holding hisnstick so tightly that his knuckles turned white. Very poor technique. Okay, they'd certainly asked for it. Sam moved his stick against thenorange puck then he paused as if to think for half a second before henkicked off on his back skate and slice through the barrier of three mennthat crumbled as soon as he was five feet from them. Sam gave it the puck annice smack and it sailed into the net almost too easily. Tommy, Guy and Jason just stared as their former high school teacherngave them another smirk then pulled his stick off the ice and skatednsmoothly over to his sports bag, pausing right before he collided into thenwall that separate the rink from the empty bleachers. He carefully placed the stick against the wall then popped the topnoff his water bottle and took a nice long gulp. Ah! Water, thank god fornWater, he thought to himself as the cool liquid trickled down his throat inna refreshing spray. \"So~~~final score~~~10-1,\" Jason groaned as he skated over to Samnwith thenother two former seniors of Sam's \"Shakespeare \"as you like it.\" \"Hey, you got one point, which is more than I can say for your highnschool term papers,\" Sam teased, leaning an elbow against the glass. \"Andnyou actually earned this one by yourself.\" Guy let out a sarcastic, \"ha, ha.\" He certainly didn't like losing,neven more so, not to his high school teacher who was married to the onlyngirl he'd ever really been attracted to. \"Face it Mr. Coulson, you're better than any of us, even with all ofnus combine you sliced by us like we were a pack of cards,\" Tommy drawled,nrolling his eyes, his voice dripping with jealousy. \"Thanks guys,\" Mr. Coulson said, floored by their genuine praise. \"Honestly, the U.S team can use you. Why did you go for teaching whennyou could be the next thing in hockey?\" Jason demanded, coming to a haltnnext to the ruggedy Yale graduate. \"Well~~~I'm not as skilled as I would like to be, but that's not thenreason either. I just love literature, the power or words, and in some waynI wanted to give something back to the great writers before our time and Inthought I could do that by spreading their words, teaching thousands ofnstudents about them, and if I'm lucky I'll get them to remember somethingnabout Shakespeare, or Charles Dickens or~~~anybody.\" Jason, Guy and Tommy exchanged and awkward glance. They thought Samnwas a great guy, the coolest high school teacher they'd ever had. (He'dnbeen the head of the prom committee! He had to be) And now that theynweren't in high school anymore, they were practically the best of friends,nand so they understood it but really preferred he drop the lecture while onnthe ice and talk about something else. Anything else. Heck they'd actually settle for listening about his marital blissnwith his wife, their former and coolest classmate ever, Josie and that wasnsaying something since all three guys have been unlucky in love sincenthey'd left their high school sweetheart, who had turned out to be justnthat, high school sweethearts. \"Oh and I wouldn't' have met Josie if I hadn't been teaching,n\"Literature,\" at South Glen High to the class of 1999,\" Sam added as annafter thought, heat creeping into his cheeks, a pleasant smile grew on hisnface that he didn't bother to hide. \"Oh heaven forbid if that happened,\" Tommy joked, splattering waternover his sweat-drenched spikes. In his opinion Sam being happy came secondnto a star winning an academy award. He was that freaking happy with thengirl. \"Yeah, really,\" Sam reminded himself. Without Josie, he wouldn't benhaving the best experience of his life, expecting a baby. Hey, maybe henwould have gone to New York and be married to Lara who's last want wasnprobably to have a baby. \"But it you were a big sports star, you could be married to an NFLncheerleader or Miss USA,\" Jason pointed out, which was his dream. \"First off Jase, does hockey even have cheerleaders?\" Guy put innpretty sharply, the way he'd done whenever his friends had teased him aboutnJosie during the spring Josie Geller had been a South Glen High Senior.n\"And second of all, Sam is happy and who wouldn't be with Josie around?\" \"T~thanks,\" Sam replied, not sure if he meant that in a good way ornnot. HE had to admit ever since he'd seen Guy and Josie share their slowndance as king and queen of South Glen's prom, he felt very uncomfortablendiscussing the good of Josie Geller with Guy Perkins. \"Yo! Speaking of Josie, I just realized, isn't today yournanniversary?\" Tommy demanded as he pulled off his t-shirt, which seemednvery foolish since the sweat he'd had was starting to freeze on his body. Sam stared at his former student with surprise. Here was a guy whononly memorized the popular Shakespear lines to woo his sophisticatedn\"sistas\" and other than that he never seemed to remember what pages he hadnto read, or when his assignments were due. Yet somehow, he'd pulled out ofnhis mind the most irrelevant fact to his life, his wedding anniversary. \"Y~yeah, it is~~~I'm surprised you remembered,\" Sam admitted,nadmiration clear in his voice. \"Especially since you never rememberednanything about class except for the fact that you can drink in class.\" \"Well it's not everyday that an undercover reporter falls in lovenwith the coolest high school teacher and then declares it on a baseballnfield before the whole school and half of Chicago,\" Tommy chimed in. Sam laughed good naturedly. Too true that was. He paused and studiednhis buddies for a moment and wondered if these kids could be in Ivy Leaguencolleges had they actually put forth the effort to try and get in. \"Yo! Speaking of marriage, remember what was even better than that?\" Sam rose an eyebrow in his direction. \"No, I'm drawing a blank, Indon't think anything tops my wedding.\" \"Or wedding night,\" he added tonhimself. \"Man, you stud! You're so freaking devoted!\" \"I am,\" Sam stated confidently. \"Well the bachelor party we threw you, that's got to be a closensecond,\" Guy teased, leaning against the wall, his head cocked back. Samnwatched as the three friends slapped high -fives. Yeah. It had been a great party, probably the best one he'd been tonsince his party days in college. And it not being a typical bachelor partynmay have added meaning to that fact. He had one stray thought about that day and found himself rememberingnthe party as though it were just yesterday (flashback) \"Go on Sam,\" Josie urged her fiance as they sat together on their bednwith Jason, Tommy and Guy standing there before them, all decked out innopen shirts and drawstring shorts. Sam had found himself somehow wearing anwhite shirt with the sleeves rolled up and matching drawstring pants,ndressed for the party obviously. \"Yeah come on Sam, this is your last night as a free man where youncan flirt with more than one girl and not get negative feedback, fullfillnyour sexual fantasies,\" Guy boomed, folding his arms, which ruined hisnbalance. The sun hadn't even gone down yet and he already looked like he'dnhad too much to drink. \"Well excuse me but why would I want to go out there and find andifferent girl to spend the night with when Josie is all I want?\" Samndemanded, as he pulled his wife-to-be closer to him by putting his armnprotectively around her. And he felt same himself whenever he was able tonhold Josie in his arms. \"Dude, I know Josie is all you want but this is like traditionalnman!\" Tom put in, his eyes clouded with frustration. \"I mean they probablynhad bachelor parties in Shakespeare's time, only back then they didn't havenany bikinis.\" \"Yeah, baby!\" Jason rooted and pumped his fist in the air followed bynthe hooting of his two friends. They were all grinning like chesire cats,npractically drooling over the prospect of seeing their girlfriend and othernbeautiful girls with almost nothing on. Sam still clung to Josie, his expression becoming stern. He reallyncouldn't believe how immature high school students were. Hadn't they evernheard of the concept of a man in love his whole life with one woman? Or wasnhe one of the only few men left that actually believed in good o'l romance? \"Sam~~~your fiancee is telling you you can go instead of keeping yountied on a leash so you can help her with wedding invitations,\" Guy chimednin, though how he'd retained that information in his stone state amazednSam. \"Probably because Kristin, Kirsten and Gibby threw her a partynequivalent to the one you have tonight,\" Tommy drawled, looking almost asndrunk as their leader. \"Didn't they, Josie?\" Sam gave his fiancee a look. She noticed his beautiful eyes werenstudying her and she felt very vulnerable and her skin flushed to a nicenrosy color. She didn't know what to say. Sam squeezed her shouldernreassuringly to calm her nerves. \"Uh ~~~yeah, I did go, I mean Kirsten, Kristin and Gibby did gonthrough all that trouble to get all those~~~Um, lifeguards at our party.\" Life guards? In other words men with no shirts on, with all thatnbeautiful muscle average Joe's craved for? Had he actually allowed her tongo that kind of party? If he had, he must have been blinded by her beautynand not listened to any of the words for context. What could he say, henwanted to give Josie the world. Even if it included a room full ofnlifeguards. \"Um~~~yeah. I~~~I guess it was kind of cool,\" she replied with angoofy grin that Sam thought was completely adorable. \"But I only looked. Indidn't touch,\" she put in quickly which earned her a very pleased smilenfrom Sam who had just been pondering whether he'd have to start building ansix pack. \"Uh, right~~~so anyway, the parties a starting and we shouldn't keepnthe ladies a waiting,\" Tom put in, slapping his former teacher on thenshoulder. Then he was pummeled in turn by the next two guys. \"Hey guys, I never said I'm going to this thing,\" Sam protested,nglaring at them evenly. Thomas put a hand to his forehead in disdain andnmade to look like he was fainting, having exhausted all his efforts to getnSam to cave. \"Hey Jason, can you go and help Tom out into the hallway? He looksnlike he needs a cigarette really bad,\" Guy asked his friend who happilynobliged. He hoisted Tom's heavy arm around his medium shoulders. \"You coming, Guy?\" \"Yeah. Give me a second. I'll take care of Sam Coulson for ya,\" hencalled back, flashing a white grin at Jason who was falling under thenItalian man's weight. Sam didn't like the sound of that and decided clinging onto Josie wasnhis best bet to prevent being dragged to a night of drinking and sluts, andnmore importantly, away from the only woman he wanted to spend his timenwith. \"Sam Coulson, dude, you know that I didn't like high school, right?\"nGuy began, taking a seat in the makeup chair after moving things off of it.nHe was sure one of them had been Sam's sock. \"Would you be referring to the academic portion where you turned in,nI believe, the final paper, or the social part of which you were king?\" Samndrawled, liking the flattery part but wouldn't be swayed. He knew what Guynwas going to say next. He'd heard the speech every time he'd had to findnsome way to pass him. \"Mr. Coulson, seriously, you know me and the guys think you are thencoolest high school teacher to ever live.\" \"Uh~~~yeah, right,\" Sam replied sarcastically, putting all hisnattention onto his student as he'd done so many times before. \"And we want you to continue to be cool ya know, and going to thisnparty alone is going to get you up there,\" Guy beamed, closing his eyes,nbasking in the warmth only he could feel. Sam exchanged a look with Josie who was flashing Guy a pretty smile.n\"It's going to be ruffus, right?\" Guy opened his eyes at exactly that moment and gazed at her withnlonging in his blue eyes. \"Ruffus, exactly,\" he murmured, his expressionnfilled with wonder. He was always amazed when she said exactly what wasngoing around in his head. A moment that sent handsome Sam into jealousynmode, like he'd experienced full-fledged when Guy and his current fianceenhad swayed on the dance floor for their dance as tradition for being namednking and queen on prom night. \"Super Ruffus,\" Guy added, flashing her a genuine grin. Sam found himself looking at Josie, Guy, then back at Josie again.nThere was a weary connection there and that bothered him a lot. \"Yeah, so uh~~~If you can convince your upstrung hubby to be thatnhe's not in high school, and that he's going to miss a killer party,\" Guynconcluded and kissed Josie on the cheek as he stood up, then took hold ofnSam's hand and gave it a good shake. Sam made sure one of those knucklesnpopped before he let Guy's hand go. He'd make Guy learn not to kiss hisnfiancee. \"Oh~~~\"he winced as he took his hand back and flexed his fingers. \"Are you okay?\" she demanded, then shot Sam an accusatory look. \"Oh yeah, Sam just has a good grip, that's all,\" Guy shrugged as henreached the door that led to the hallway. \"Have a wonderful evening,nJosie,\" he sighed. Seeing them there together stirred a jealousy he hadn'tnknow existed to man, but there was no denying that they looked absolutelynperfect together. \"Don't take too long, Sam. Tommy's going to go crazier ifnhe doesn't get his alcohol fix soon. You know where it's at, right?\" \"Uh yeah, that invitation is laying around here, somewhere,\" Samncalled back then gave him the eyebrow to hint him to get lost. And Guy did. He got up, went to the door to make sure it was locked. \"Alcohol fix?nHigh school guys, can they be anymore pathetic?\" Sam chuckled as he fiddlednwith the chain on the door. \"I mean honestly, they're graduated, they arenadults and yet they just look at life as one big party.\" He felt a tingle go down his spin when he felt Josie's hands on hisnshoulders. Then he felt himself grow hard when she traced her finger downnhis back. He gave a little shiver then turned around and yanked her to hisnbody and kissed her hard, his hands moving feverishly around her as he lednher to their bed and laid her down against it. Josie gently bit his lip and Sam pulled himself a few inches back,nand just stared wordlessly into her blue-green irises full of tease. \"Indon't think there's anything wrong with that,\" she said suddenly and Samngave her a look of perplexion. \"Of viewing life as one big party. It givesnyou a rush and keeps things exciting. It makes you feel alive, and,\" shenpaused to run her hand through his lightly gelled mane. \"And I hope thatnthere's still a little bad boy left in you. I know you're a figure ofnauthority but that's only eight hours a day. Just like I deceive and snitchnon people five days out of the week. It's not who I'm marrying, I'mnmarrying the handsome, beautiful-minded, intelligent, compassionate, fun-nloving twenty-seven year old, Sam Coulson.\" She kissed him between eachnadjective and Sam began to blush. \"You really want me to go huh?\" Sam said with a tired sigh. \"Younthink it's that important?\" \"We breathe Shakespeare, Mr. Coulson, and Shakespeare's life was allnabout being romantic, keeping to the family traditions and a bachelor partynis one of them,\" she explained then added, \" and you'll have the chance tonlive out your most outrageous sexual fantasies.\" Sam glanced down at Josie and smirked. \"Highly doubtful. Of coursenunless you will show up to the party.\" He took one look at Josie'snexpression and rolled his eyes. \"Which you're not, obviously.\" \"Sorry, I'm not a working girl, not in that sense anyway,\" shencorrected, feeling humiliation from her blunder. \"But you should do thenwhole party thing, you told me you used to drink in college.\" \"Yeah, well that was the only way to prove that we weren't a bunch ofnstuffed shirts. And then again, I had nobody to live for in my life. Itndidn't really matter if I made it the next day or not. Nobody was waitingnaround for me. Sure, I had friends but they weren't good enough to miss menif I ever overdosed,\" Sam paused and gave Josie his dreamiest expression.n\"But now I do, I have someone that I not only have to live for but want tonlive to see as many days as our creator will give me.\" Josie felt a tear spring to her eye. Sam's voice was so poetic andnhis words were that much more beautiful. She could spend hours justnlistening to him talk. \"Okay, so you don't want to touch any girls orndrink till you pass out. T~then why don't you just go to please yournfriends? I know the hard work, Tommy, Jason and Guy put it to throw you thenmost ruffus bachelor party imaginable. They do look up to you and as cornynas that sounds, they really did want to do something for you. If not fornanything else, go so they'll know their hard work was worth it.\" Sam tried to think of a protest but nothing would come out, he satnup, joined momentarily by Josie who leaned into his shoulder. \"Okay, so saynI~~~go. What about you? What are you going to do, because I'm not about tonleave you alone in a hotel room five days before our wedding,\" henharrumphed. \"Oh, don't' worry about that. I've got plenty of food and fics tonlast me a week. And Besides, this week and all this planning we've done innthis month has been so hectic, I'm burnt out. I could use the time tonrest,\" she promised him. She then put a hand to her mouth to cover up hernoncoming yawn. \"Y~You sure?' he asked finally to Josie who had pulled herself up tonthe pillows and curled into a ball. She nodded, blinking her sleepy eyes. \"Okay, I guess I'm going since my beautiful, talented, perfect,nhumble, honest and devoted sexy Josie Geller wants me to,\" he sighed andnkissed her between each adjective, landing the last one on her nose. \"Younneed get some sleep then, okay. I'll see you when I get back, and if younneed anything, you've got my number. And maybe you can surprise me by beingnup, waiting to fullfill my wildest sexual fantasy.\" \"And that would be?\" \"You~~~wearing a whipped cream bikini, on top of underwear or not isnyour choice,\" he murmured huskily as he trailed kisses down her soft neck,n\"oh and you've got to be carrying my favorite dark chocolate, Dove. Younknow I'm crazy about that stuff, baby girl and I think I'm going to need itnif I have to hand around a bunch of kids all night long.\" \"Well, we'll see,\" she giggled, arching her neck back. \"You bencareful out there, okay? And the keyword, what's the keyword, Sam?\" \"Not to get stoned or scold others from doing it?\" he put in lamelynas he put his wallet into his back pocket and grabbed his sunglasses fromnthe dresser. \"F~U~N. Baby. Have fun, okay?\" Sam nodded. \"But don't be surprised if I come back in a few hours,\"nhe called back with one hand on the doorknob. He turned his head only tonwitness Josie was deep in dreams. He grinned at the sight then finally leftnthe room, closing the door softly behind him, trying to be excited aboutnwhat could happen the next few hours. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Next Sam found himself visualizing the bachelor party as though itnwere yesterday. He distinctly remembered how many girls had been there. He'd been sonbored and so lovesick for Josie that he couldn't think straight and he wasna grouch to every girl he'd met. He'd actually ended up looking at thengirls, only to be count them like sheep while he downed glasses of iced teanafter the one shot of vodka he'd treated himself to with salt, a slice ofnlime, the whole nine yards. He also could see the huge bonfire, the magical pool that was fillednwith throngs of people he assumed were random college students looking forna good time. It had been beautiful really, just one look at the place andnit was easy to tell that a lot of thought had gone into this set up. Everynbar seat down to every torch had been placed just right to serve its' justnpurpose. It really was a killed beach party. Very hot, with the smell ofntropical flowers floating in the warm summer breeze, a Jamaican band playednbeats that Sam loved listening to and all around the atmosphere wasnpositive with couples making out and other groups screaming with the manyngame booths scattered throughout the tropical paradise. Only over Sam did a black cloud hang. He'd tried to hang out with Guynand his friends but suddenly he felt too old and he didn't want to partakenin their idea of fun anyway. Now he was contemplating on getting another strong shot to loosennhimself up when he'd finished his ice tea, only a certain blond hadnactually caught his eye. She was standing a good few feet away from him,nbut he could still tell her eyes glistened and she was smiling, even if hernwas half-covered with genie-type veil. He actually picked up only subtlenpick-up signs, which was a great change to the direct girls who made itnclear they wanted to strip down. Hmm. She seemed nice enough. Talking, talking was allowed right?nMaybe he'll actually have some fun tonight. This was his first good breaknof the evening and he decided to take it. He slammed his glass down thennstood up eyes on the girl. \"No drink, Mr. Coulson?\" the bartender inquired as he wiped a glass. \"No, maybe later. I think I'm going to go and enjoy myself a bit.\" \"Good choice,\" the barman said approvingly and gave a little wave asnhe watched Sam disappear into the crowd. Sam kept his eyes forward, ducking through couples and raising hisnhead over on-coming people's shoulders so he could still see the blond withnthe expressive eyes and damp curls who'd pulled a towel around her body,nswiveling her hips as she headed to a quiet bench where the action was non-nexistent. Sam walked on, not realizing that he'd just passed by Guy and hisnwannabe's, who's eyes were on him as he went to join her. He stood still by the bench, his posture, half-bent, to duck the hugenleaves of the descending palm trees, his sense directed and calmed at thensame time by the tropical scent of mango and coconut milk as he stared atnthe figure who was facing the other way her back to him. \"Long night, huh?\" he exhaled, stretching into the air. \"What are youndoing over here by yourself?\" \"I~I don't know. I guess I didn't want to be out of there in all thatnnoise. Especially since I couldn't find the Bachelor. I mean I broke myndate with my fiancee to get in this get up and he doesn't even have thendecency to show up!\" Sam bit his lip then cautiously took a seat. \"You mind if I sit downnfor a second? I've been looking for someone to talk to, just to talk.\" She shrugged her shoulders and Sam gulped when the towel she wasnwearing fell off her shoulders to reveal a delicate white bikini thatnreminded him strongly of whipped cream. \"You've obviously already welcomednyourself, so, start talking,\" she quipped and gave a harrumph as she tossednback her head of curls that he began finger combing. \"Wait a second, you're the one who saw me, I saw you smile at me,\"nSam retorted, thrown by her curt tone. \"Well, I wouldn't have if I'd known you were irresponsible bachelor,\"nshe quipped and stood up angry and began to stalk off. \"H~hey, before you get all mad at me, can you just sit and listen tonme, for a minute or two. I have something I've been trying to get out mynsystem but I think it's obvious I haven't gotten far hence that I havennobody around me,\" Sam pleaded, and his words stopped her in her tracks. \"I don't know, Mr. Coulson. I was quite offended when you wouldn'tngive me the time of day,\" she whimpered, folding her arms and leaned allnher weight on one leg. \"I~I didn't know you were hired specifically for me,\" he lamented asnhe clasped his hands together and leaned forward. \"I realized that myself,\" she put in coldly, continuing to give himnthe backbone that he'd learned to hate from any woman. He felt it veryncondescending, and seeing that he was probably enough to be her teacher henwasn't going to take any crap. \"Look~~~what's your name?\" he asked suddenly and slapped a hand tonhis forehead. That was smooth Sam Coulson, real smooth. She didn't reply.nSam shrugged off the insulted feeling he got from that reaction. \"Okay, Injust want you to know that it's not because of you that I'm upset, I'venonly seen your eyes and yet I already think you've attractive. They'renso~~~expressive,\" he explained as he pulled a medium-sized fruit from thentree and tossed it up and down like a baseball. \"Reminds me of Josie,nactually.\" \"Josie?\" she inquired as she took a position of leaning against thentree. \"My fiancee, who I'd rather be with more than anything, no offense tonyou. I really didn't want to come to this party, I never consented to thisnbut my former high school students threw it, and I guess that's why I'mnhere, to show my gratitude for their hard work,\" he sighed as he caught thenfruit in his hand and then stared at the orange sphere. \"You want a mango?\" \"No~~~\"she replied in a sultry voice that hand only a hint of anBritish drawl. \"But there is something you can do for me.\" Sam felt a red flag start flashing in his mind. What she was going tonask him couldn't be good. \"And that would be?\" \"Actually, it's really quite simple and enjoyable,\" she explained to him.n\"When I found out that it's going to take a little something to loosen younup into party-mode, I thought about something I enjoyed that we could dontogether, and I got permission from the owner of his place to go into onenof his huge pools he's got in the back. You do enjoy swimming, don't you?\"nshe inquired in a teasing voice. \"Um, actually, I prefer the ice, but thanks anyway,\" he chuckled nervously.nFor some reason, he didn't think she was going to let him go too easily. \"None of that, Samuel,\" she crooned as she turned around, lowered hernhead and gestured to him to come with her with her finger. \"It's Sam,\" he corrected her, feeling that things were taking a turnninto forbidden territory. \"And I'm not going to a pool house with you.nIt'll be too awkward.\" \"Tsk tsk,\" she tsked him, clicking her tongue. \"Where is your sensenof adventure? OR is this Josie marrying a really high-strung all businessnhigh school teacher?\" \"I've got a sense of adventure, thank you very much. But I'll onlyntake chances with her. I'm ready to settle down now,\" Sam repeated, hisnirritation with her growing. Couldn't the girl take a hint? \"Prove it,\" she challenged him as she walked on. Sam didn't feel thatnhe had to prove anything but he found himself walking after her, only aboutna foot behind her. He found his eyes trailing her neckline and down hernbody. How stupid could he be? Why had be acknowledged her smile? Why was henovercome with the sudden urge to run his fingers through her bouncy blondnhair, and put his hands against her creamy skin and gaze into her intenseneyes? A moment later he realized why. She reminded him of Josie, only hernhair was darker and her curls were dragging, not to mention she had a lip.nAnd of course, he knew what had happened, this all had to be part of a plannto entice a sworn one-woman man with another woman and see if he could keepnhis thing in his pants. And of course Guy had chosen his fiancee's look-alike. Damn, he loved his high school students. He paused when the young woman stopped to put a key into the door ofnthe dark building. Only the moon provided any light and darkness made Samneven more nervous. This was an erotic situation waiting to happen. Henshuffled his feet nervously as the door creaked open. \"Come on in, Mr. Coulson,\" she whispered as she stood in the doorway,nstill though with her back to him which was starting to play on his lastnnerve. Why wouldn't she let him look at her? \"Okay~~~but before I do that, I want to make one thing perfectlynclear,\" he began in a clear firm voice. She cocked her head to prove shenwas listening. \"I'm not here for any kind of pleasure other than what thenwater can provide me. I'm in love with one woman and one woman only.\" \"I know,\" she giggled as she led the way. \"Don't worry, I won't donanything you wouldn't want to.\" She walked over to the farthest pool chairnand dropped her towel then sat onto it and carefully pulled her thongs offnand placed them under her seat. Sam watched her for a minute and then followed her lead, strippingndown until all he was wearing was his pair of blue boxer shorts. He thenntook a deep breath and descended down the ladder into the lukewarm water.nHe laid back and immediately began doing a few back strokes, letting go ofnall the concerns and fears he'd been battling with ever since he'd poppednthe question and made a promise to take care of Josie for the rest of hernlife. He dove under the water then came back up, gasping for breath as henshook out his hair. God, this was great! The water was just right and thenmoonbeams lit up the pool, giving it its' glass-like appearance. He pushednhis hair back and glanced over at the pool chair, only his companion wasn'tnsitting there anymore. She was instead standing there, smiling down at him, holding a platenof what looked like chocolate. \"Josie!\" Now that she'd removed the veil from her face he plainly saw that itnwas his love, his soulmate standing there in a white bikini that was fluffynand white~~~just like whipped cream! She stood thee with a bewitching smilenon her beautiful face. \"Hi Sam. I hope this is okay,\" she murmured, staringndown at herself. \"I knew you wanted whipped cream but this was all I couldnin short notice.\" Sam just gawked at her as he pulled himself out of the pool, leavingna trail of watery footprints as he stood before Josie who looked verynuncertain. \"Josie! What are you doing here? I thought you were asleep.\" \"Happy to see me?\" Was that even a question? Wasn't he beaming like the rays of the sun,nhis teeth gleaming like the romantic moon beams? \"Happy? Oh god, Josie, I'm a lot more happy now that you're here! Howndid you sneak in?\" Josie studied his handsome expression and was overcome by a laughingnfit. Could it be possible that Sam was that naïve? It seemed so. His eyesnwere genuine with surprise and he still kept darting his eyes around thenroom, as though he were keeping a look out for the owner. \"Really Sam. Can you be so gullible? This was part of the plan! Guynand I knew you wouldn't willingly go to your party so we decided that wenwould make it so you couldn't refuse, and then reward you for you effort bynmy showing up and luring you to our own private little party.\" Finally the wheels turned in his head and a bit of understandingndawned on him. He then shook his head. \"Wow, I can't believe it, you foolednme. I knew there was something familiar about you. And now it makes sensenwhy you kept half your face covered and you kept your back turned. I wouldnhave realized it was you if I'd gotten too close.\" \"Exactly, and you know, this was a good thing,\" she put in as shentook his wet hands into hers and gave them a good squeeze. \"I didn't intendnfor it to work out this way but I just realized how faithful you are to menand how much you really think about me when I'm not around. You're thenbest, Sam, the best there is.\" Sam impulsively pulled her to his wet chest and ran his rough fingersnthrough her stringy drenched hair and then nuzzled her head with his strongnjaw. \"No, you're the best. You know me better than anybody. I mean, look!nYou even pulled of my outrageous fantasy. I only told you about thatntonight and look, you read my mind!\" \"Actually, I just stopped by Victoria's Secret to pick up the outfit.nI couldn't believe my luck when I found a marshmallow bra that actuallynlooked like whipped marshmallows on the outside,\" she explained but thensmile on his tanned face told her that he hadn't been the least bitndisheartened by that revelation. He instead took her by the hand and pullednher into the water, then swam over to the chair where the plate ofnchocolate was laying. Josie came up beside him a second later, the wetnessnmade her look even sexier to Sam's eyes. \"So Josie, what do you say we share a piece of this delicious treat,\"nhe whispered as he unwrapped a Dove and slowly placed it into his mouth,nnever letting his gaze waver as he moved closer to Josie, his eye lidsnclosing, his lips puckered as he put a hand onto her shoulder, drawing hernin for a kiss. Only she moved backwards. \"Actually, I don't think we should,\" shenpronounced which earned her a disappointed expression from her partner.n\"Hey, weren't you the one who said you're not here for any other pleasurenthan what the water will offer?\" she shot back, batting her eye lashes, hernface struggling to keep a straight face. \"Oh you're funny, Josie Geller,\" he drawled sarcastically and drewnnearer to her as though he were a shark quietly approaching the unawarenvictim. Josie squealed and shoved him away which sent Sam into a coughing fitnas the chocolate flew down the wrong tube. Josie swam back over to him withna few powerful strokes then gently thumped his back with the heel of hernhand until Sam stopped coughing. \"Sam, are you okay?\" she whimpered, her voice thick with concern. Henhad turned blue for a second and that was a second too long as far as shenwas concerned. And knowing she'd caused it didn't make her feel any better. \"Uh yeah,\" he exhaled and his skin slowly returned to his normalncolor. There was an evil grin on his mouth that didn't particularly calmnher nerves. \"Oh~~~good, you gave me quite a fright there, I thought we were goingnto lose each other for a second,\" she breathed and put a hand to hernforehead. \"Yeah~~~yeah, you're going to pay for that one,\" he promised her.nBefore Josie could react, Sam came up behind her, ducked under the waternthen wrapped his muscular arm around her torso and dunked her squealingninto the water. Sam surfaced first and waited for Josie. He began laughing when shencame up sputtering, spiting at his face. \"SAM COULSON!\" \"That'd be me,\" he smirked, completely amused. \"Do you think that was funny?\" she shrieked, her voice so loud itnechoed off the walls. \"Actually it was,\" he snickered. \"You should see your face!\" \"You've asked for it, Mr. Coulson!\" she boomed then began throwingnwater over at him as fast as her hands would allow her. Sam shook his headnand splashed her back, laughing out loud and for a moment he felt that henwas a teenager again, having an innocent water right with his carefreengirlfriend, not a man that was only five days from making one of thenbiggest decisions of his life. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \"SCORE!\" Sam heard the crack of a hockey stick and that was enough to pull himnback into reality. He cringed when he saw what the other guys were doing.nTommy had assumed the position of a pitcher and pitched an orange disk tonGuy who was currently at bat. Sam was about to skate backwards to escapenthe sailing orange object. That was when he realized he was seated on the ice. Crap! Samnscrambled to his feet just in time to flee the orange disk. He heard itnwhiz past him and let out a relieved sigh. That was too close! \"Oops, sorry Mr. Coulson,\" Guy snickered as he skated over to thenwall with the remains of his broken hockey stick in his hands. \"But hey, atnleast you finally snapped out of it. I was wondering how long you werengoing to look dazed.\" \"Y~yeah, right,\" Sam coughed. Now that his senses were coming backninto action, his butt felt very cold. \"So you ready for another go?\" Tommy inquired, joining the two personngroup of Sam and Guy. \"Nah, I think he needs to get some feeling back into his butt,\" Jasonnjoked. \"Too bad he doesn't have a heating pad for you to sit on.\" Sam let out a sarcastic laugh. \"Actually I've got to ditch. I'mnmeeting Josie and she should be arriving right about now,\" he informednthem, looking at his watch. It was ten minutes to six. \"All right, we're going to hang out a bit longer,\" Guy replied fornthe three of them, though what they were going to do now that they'dnsnapped their sticks alluded the hockey guru. \"Fine. You guys just~~~remember this isn't a baseball field. If younwant to crack at balls, there is an appropriate stadium for that.\" Henskated over to where he'd left his bag, or where he thought he'd left hisnbag. Sam thought hard for a moment then turned around and folded his arms.n\"Okay, that's very amusing guys, where did you put my gym bag?\" A wave of clueless expression traveled from guy to guy then backnagain. \"You talking to us?\" \"No, I'm talking to the walls. Yes, I'm talking to you! Do you seenanybody else on the ice?\" Jason actually checked which earned him a pop on the head from Tommy.n\"Uh, we didn't touch your bag, dude.\" Sam took a deep breath to curb the rage he felt growing inside ofnhim. \"You have to have. Bags don't just disappear. It doesn't have kineticnenergy, Mr. Way,\" he grumbled. \"That means somebody moved it.\" The guys had to agree Sam's explanation made sense, assuming theynknew what kinetic energy was. But they couldn't' say they touched it whennthey really didn't. \"Sam, we're not responsible in the case of the missing gym bag,\" Guynargued, looking clearly offended. \"Yes you are!\" Sam boomed, his green eyes narrowing. \"You all movednit while I was passed out and you know what, I wasn't mad but now I'mnstarting to. I don't' put up with nonsense, and you all know I've got tonleave. I'm going to give you to my old roster and phone your parents andninform them of how immature you are and that you're lucky I cared to evennpass you in senior year!\" Guy, Jason and Tommy actually exchanged looks of fright between thenthree of them. It was rare to see Sam raise his voice and that was becausenthe teacher actually became so condescending it was scary. \"Hey Sam, no, don't do that,\" a female voice protested behind him. All four guys' eyes were directed toward the female presence in thenroom. Standing behind the wall Sam was leaning against was Josie, bundlednup in a nice black business coat, which was worn over her two piece blacknsuit. The top buttons were left open and exposed a generous amount ofncleavage. Her hair was in a messy bun, dangling from her lavender-tippednfingers was Sam's missing gym bag. \"Josie! Sweetheart, when did you get here?\" he demanded as he climbednoff the ice and stood before her. \"About two minutes ago. I figured you'd be running a little late so Incame in here to watch the last bit of your game, since you're just so sexynon the ice.\" Sam turned a deep shade of crimson when he broke away from Josie'snblushing lips. And it didn't help the situation that three of his formernstudents were witnessing such an uncool aspect of their \"coolest\" highnschool teacher. They began hooting, and name-calling towards blushing Sam and \"hot-nstuff,' Josie Geller Coulson. She turned to face them and smiled, a rosyncolor appearing on her cheeks \"All right guys, settle down,\" he chided them, shaking his head. \"So where is goo o'l Sam taking you this evening?\" Tommy sang,nskating up to the bleachers. \"You're not going to find out,\" Sam cut in firmly before Josie couldndisclose any vital information. \"You guys can handle cleaning up, right?\" \"Sure,\" they all cried out, at the same time their intention to tauntnthe young marrieds. \"You guys behave tonight, ya hear?\" Sam and Josie exchanged a glance as he changed into his good shoes,nthen slung his skates over his shoulder. They as they ascended the steps,nJosie leaned into whisper in his ear, \"I think that goes double for you.\" Sam let out a hearty chuckle. \"Hey, I'm not the one who crashed mynbachelor party wearing a marshmallow bra!\" Hey!

YOU ALL TRULY ROCK! FINALLY I'VEnUPDATED FOR YOU! PLEASE KEEP REVIEWING! I LOVE YOU ALL!!! Never Been Pregnant Total Vaughn Lover Chapter Two(cont) Josie slowly cut into her hunk of roast beef, trying not to make anmess. Only she squirmed every time blood seeped out of the meat. She tooknher hands off her utensils and took a deep breath before she reached fornthem to give the meat one more try. Nope! As soon as her fork sank into thentender morsel, a pool of red blood began forming beneath her meat. Sam watched her as he put a piece of his own meat into his mouth andnchewed. God, the savory juices of the meat mixed with the worchestshire wasnproving to be a sure treat for his tongue. He cut himself another piece andnwas about to eat it as well but he burst out laughing instead when he sawnhis wife push away her dish. \"Honey? Do you want help with that?\" he teased her, his eyesnsparkling with amusement. Josie gave him a defiant look, as though it hadnbeen a very big mistake for him to ask her that. \"It's just uh~~~I couldn'tnhelp but notice you haven't been able to cut your meat.\" \"M~Maybe I'm not hungry,\" she boomed, folded her arms and pouted likena little girl. \"N~Not hungry?\" he demanded and held his hands on his head as thoughnhe had a huge headache. \"Josie, honey, we're dining at the Bistro D'orangenpoisson, only the best steak place in Chicago. And the roast beef is out ofnthis world! Here, try some.\" He picked up the piece he'd cut and made tonlook like he was going to put it in her mouth. She batted his hands away and moped sitting in her seat while Samnhissed at shy she was acting this way as he picks up the tainted piece ofnbeef with his napkin then rolled it up before he used it to mop the saucenresidue that had splattered on the pink tablecloth. Then he threw it downnand glared at her. \"Want to explain to me why you felt you had to act that way and wastena perfectly good piece of roast beef? I mean if you didn't want to come outnthen we didn't have to. I would have gladly cooked you anything you wantednat home. I mean I know about the fatigue and weird food urges you get whennyou're pregnant,\" he chided her as he took a gulp of the champagne sittingnin his glass. \"I never said that I didn't' want to come out here. I just~~~I'mnalmost thirty. I don't' need you feeding me,\" she grumbled, staring down atnher food. Sam frowned at her, clearly offended. \"Damn Josie, if I had known younwould react that way, I would have bothered. I thought you'd be flatterednthat I feel like we're just gotten marred even after an year has passed. Inmean, we used to feed each other all the time,\" he scowled, his facenturning red. Then he abruptly stopped speaking, saying only, \"suitnyourself,\" and went back to concentrating on his meal. Josie raised her head and looked over at Sam as he continued to eat.nHe was looking extra handsome that night in a light denim crème button ownnwithout the t-shirt. His hair was a bit coifed into the James Dean thingnand his eyes seemed to have a much shinier spark, only she couldn't judgenthem because his head was down. She bit her lip in shame. What had overcome her to make her way thenthings she'd said? He'd said the meat was practically to die for, now ifnshe could only see the smile to prove it. She dabbed her mouth with hernnapkin No, she couldn't let the evening go like this. \"Um~~~Sam?\" she inquired right when he happened to have a mouthful ofnlettuce. She heard him choke of his salad. He reached for his glass ofnwater before he looked at his wife to acknowledge her presence. \"A~Are younreally mad at me?\" Sam stared hard at her for a moment then the hardness dissolved andnhe was smiling with a raised eyebrow, his eyes crinkled. \"No, of coursennot, Josie. I know today has meant a big change for you and moodiness isnunderstandable.\" God, did Josie have the most understanding husband in the world ornwhat? For a second there she'd thought that he was going to scold her likenhe'd done with his hockey mates. \"So um~~~does the opportunity to have my husband chop up my meatnstill exist?\" she asked, shyly, batting her eyelashes at him. \"Yeah, here,\" he said, wiping his mouth with the cloth napkin thennreached the dish she was extending out to him. He then picked up hisnutensils and began sawing into bite-sized pieces, smiling as he did. Josie watched him concentrate on her food for a few moment, claspingnher hands under her chin. This was exactly what she had wanted to bengrowing up, a wife to someone who let her know everyday that it was he whonwas lucky to be loved by her. And he'd gone beyond her wildestnexpectations. From the days they'd met to the day when he'd finally decidednto make their union real before God, not a day went by that wasn't perfect.nOh of course she would have preferred not to have had that disaster on promnnight but then again that had led to the baseball field even where Sam hadnso openly conveyed his feelings for her. She took a good glance around the room. She'd been here only oncenbefore, but she was sure the restaurant looked a lot grander today. Thenwhite of his walls had a creamy vanilla look as a result of the chandeliersncasting just the right amount of light onto the walls. The pink table clothnadded a soft touch to the elegant floor that was spread with expensivencarpet from Bulgaria. The aroma from the food was nothing short ofnenticing. And the champagne had to the best she'd ever tasted in Chicago.nAnd having someone special to share the fine dining with was really whatnmade dining there just fine. Face it, Sam was the best asset in the world,nwhich was certainly more than she could say for the last time she'd eatennat this place. (flashback) A five years younger Josie came dwaddling into the most expensivenrestaurant. She began hyperventilating under her Victorian-style dress,ncomplete with bell sleeves, and a full skirt, complete with a beadednbodice, all in a soft pink. But that was the only part of her that evennexuded elegance. Her hair was still the boring dull brown in its' low andnmundane ponytail, her face make-up free and pasty. Her disposition was less than perfect, to put it nicely. If onlynAnita had told her about the news of the new hot guy planning to meet hernat the Bistro D'orange Poisson, a little bit earlier than just a few hoursnago, like perhaps the day before, or a week ago. Then maybe she wouldn't benso high-strung. Or she was until she'd stepped into this elegantnrestaurant. Now she was constantly trying to catch her breath as she tooknin the sights, aroma and sounds that flowed throughout the building thatnshouted, \"rich!\" She was sure she'd just heard Mr. Nordstrom call his wifenMrs. Nordstrom. She was greeted by a waiter who came to attention, one hand behindnhis back, the other one clutching a menu to his chest. \"May I assist you, miss?\" he said in a thick French accent, his eyesnclosed and his nose upturned snobbishly. \"Actually, I'm meeting someone for dinner tonight,\" she chittered,ntrying to look like she had herself put together. \"The party's name?\" \"Oh crap!\" she stammered to herself. What was the name of the newnSports Editor? \"Um~~~can you give me a second?\" \"Uh~~~of course,\" he assured her, but he began to burst out laughingnwhen he saw her get up. \"And are you a princess of some kind?\" \"Oh, actually this is a halloween costume from three years back,\"nJosie grinned, executing a full circle to show off the ridiculous lookingncreation. \"But it's so elegant you can't tell the difference can you?\" The waiter continued on laughing as she dialed Anita's number, wherenan equally wired Anita answered the phone, giving her more info than thenname of her date, Stephen Mcelvin. She turned off the phone, apologized tonthe waiter who began guffawing as he led the young naïve Josie across thentables where the formally dressed beautiful people turned to gawk at her. They came to a pause where Stephen Mcelvin was sitting at a tablenwith a different woman that was definitely not her. She was a beautifulnblond in a tasteful blue cocktail dress, currently picking at the cabbagenof her steak dinner. Wait a minute, what was going on? \"Mr. Mcelvin.\" Stephen turned around to acknowledge the waiter, looking quite upsetnabout being disturbed. \"Yes sir, may I help you?\" \"Um~~~this woman is here to join your dinner,\" the waiter announcednwhich earned him a glare from his date. \"Y~you're kidding me, right?\" he hissed to the waiter, while tryingnto calm down his steaming date. The waiter gave him a no-kidding look. He then heard a cry out fromnthe kitchen and quickly went over to find out the problem, leaving Josienstanding, dumbfounded. \"So~~~ma'am~~~,\" he began, addressing Josie but then he paused.n\"Wait, I know you from somewhere,\" he said then, and his voice suddenlyngrew to a whisper as he pondered where he had seen her. \"I~I'm the copy editor at the Chicago Sun Times,\" she beamed,nflattered that she'd been noticed at work. \"Right, right. Now my next question,\" he said with a nice smile, andnJosie felt she was ready to answer anything. Only what he said was far fromnwhat she wanted to hear. \"What are you doing here? And why did you tellnthe waiter that you were having dinner with me?\" Josie bit her lip. \"Well, Anita told me you were crazy about goingnout with me tonight, that you thought I was the most beautiful girl in thenU.S.\" Stephen just stared, thinking of the right thing to say. \"Y~you're kidding, right?\" the slender blond chuckled so hard shenchoked on her food. She then dabbed her face with a napkin as she giggled,n\"you actually thought the Stephen McElvin would want to go out with younover me?\" \"W~well,\" Josie began. \"Yeah.\" This sent the girl into another frenzy of giggles. \"Oh my God! Incan't believe this! For one, I can't believe that you actually thought itnwas okay to walk out in public with that get up. That thing should only benworn at a Halloween party.\" Stephen glanced at Josie with a small smile. Even he thought thisndate's vocal venom was too much. \"Josephina, that's enough. I think shengets it.\" He turned to the other Josie who was struggling to keep herselfntogether. \"Hey, sorry about this. You got all dressed up for me andneverthing. Seems Anita was eavesdropping on a conversation that shenshouldn't have. It would have prevented this whole mess.\" \"B~but she heard my name,\" Josie protested. \"No, she heard my name,\" the other Josie sneered, \"I'm JosephinanGellargiano, Josie Gellar, for short.\" Josie's eyes grew wide. Josephina Gellargiano, as in the top reporternon the New York Times? How could she have been so stupid! \"I~I guess I've made a big mistake.\" \"Y~Yeah, it seems things got mixed up. I~~I do apologize, Josie, butndid you really honestly think that I would want to be seen in an opulentnrestaurant with you, let alone in public?\" Josie's eyes brimmed with tears. \"No, I~~~I guess not.\" And shendidn't wait for them to react and ran for the door before she could benhumiliated for another moment.\"n(end of flashback) \"Josie! Josie!\" Sam called out after he set her plate down at hernplace. \"Honey, snap out of it!\" he cajoled her and began clapping his handsnbesides her when she didn't react. Finally Josie gasped and her eyes popped open, feeling as thoughnshe'd gotten socked in the stomach. Her mouth felt dry and her lips werentrembling. \"Josie, sweetheart, are you okay?\" She couldn't move to acknowledge him, it was as if she was frozen.nSam reached over to touch her hand. She immediately felt warm and it spreadnfrom the area he touched till it filled her whole body. \"Honey?\" he crooned and Josie's eyes lit up when she saw Sam. Sam wasnlooking over at her with his emerald eyes, clouded with worry. \"Are younokay, did you have a bad daydream?\" \"Uh~~~actually, it was a flashback, you know, about the last time Incame out here?\" Sam's mouth became a tight grin. A few days after they'd gottennengaged, Sam had suggested they celebrate at this exact restaurant but he'dnopted for something different after she'd told him about the humiliatingnexperience she'd endured with Stephen McElvin. Sam had wanted to punch thendaylights out of him then and he looked like he felt the same way now. \"Sam~~~I'm okay. It was a long time ago,\" she protested to curb thenfire growing readily in his eyes. \"Fine. But you do know that you mean more to me than anything, right?nBecause I'm only a guy and even though I'd like to say I can read yournmind, I can't, and I need you to tell me if you feel I'm not appreciatingnyou enough,\" Sam demanded, looking extremely serious, as though he reallynwould do anything to take away all the pain in her life and make sure itndidn't happen again. \"N~No, you're perfect Sam. And I know that's just going to grow eachnday.\" Sam blushed yet again, then kissed Josie. They were still hoveringnover their food when he broke away and whispered. \"Well, if you're backnfrom your trip down memory lane, maybe we should get back to eating beforenour food turns cold.\" They stood there for a moment with their foreheads touching, thennthey settled back down into their seats and began devouring their food. Sam watched Josie dip a bite size piece of meat into the dark saucenthen took a bit and began chewing. MMM! The meat really was excellent. Following that minor fight, Sam and Josie continued to enjoy theirnmeal, well, enjoyed their company more or less. They talked aboutntomorrow's dinner, Josie getting an exclusive and the newest assignment Samnhad added to his lesson plan. Josie actually tried to get him to talk aboutnhis novel but he was really being stubborn in that area. She was about half-way done with her meat and Sam had spooned up thenlast of the soup in its' authentic looking ceramic dishware when the samenwaiter who'd humiliated her years ago arrived at their table. \"Mr. And Mrs. Coulson, I do apologize that I had to interrupt yournmeal that you are enjoying, I hope.\" \"Yes, we are. Thank you,\" Sam grinned. \"So glad to hear it, um~~~Mrs. Coulson,\" he inquired and Josie turnednto smile at him as well, \"There are a group of women at the front of thenrestaurant, holding your newest article, wanting to meet you and perhaps,nobtain an autograph.\" Josie blushed. An autograph? She remembered when she'd published hernfirst real article, she'd had fans mailing her from all over Chicago, andnthen some from the friends of those in Chicago. She'd never dreamed hernsecond article would be an equal success. \"Would you let them come and meet you, Mrs. Coulson?\" \"Oh~~~Uh.\" She shot her husband a glance who nodded to her then wentnahead and answered her question. \"Yes, go ahead. Josie would love to please her fans,\" he assured him. Josie shot bemused Sam a look. Did he really just give an okay to letna group of squealing girls into the restaurant and disturb their dinner,ntheir anniversary dinner? Even celebrities asked they be able to completentheir meal before any interactions with their fans. Before she could give any protest she found her table surrounded bynat least fourteen girls, all of them about fifteen years of age. Author's note 2: Okay!

Never Been PregnanttttttttTotal Vaughn Lover Chapter 2 (Part III) \"Josie, The \"Star\" They were all smiling anxiously and in theirnhands was a copy of her latest article. She stole a look at Sam whonlooked a bit embarrassed when he saw the picture she'd submittednfor the anniversary article and the pink hearts that surrounded notnonly the headline, but made a border around the writing. \"No you didn't,\" he mouthed to Josie whonjust grinned in reply as she pulled the cap off the pen she alwaysnkept with her notebook. She then put her focus back onto her \"fans,\"nwho thrust their articles at her and even added comments about hownthey'd actually met last year, some \"constructive criticism,\"nregarding her article, and asking for tips on how they could find anhandsome teacher and then more importantly, get him to fall in loventhem. Josie tried very hard to answer their questionsnand not steer them in the wrong way, much to Sam's relief. But shencould relate with what each of them were feeling. What had happenednto her last year was the type of thing fairytales were made out of,nand she was sure if this had been someone else's article that shenhad read, she would get obsessed with making sure it happened to hernas well. \"Really Josie, I know that you think highnschool students shouldn't date their teachers but when it happenednto you, didn't you think it was okay?\" demanded a sixteen-yearnold girl who reminded the Coulsons strongly of Aldys, former queen ofnthe denominators and the most down-to-earth girl at South Glenn High. \"Well...ye,\" Josie began but she paused whennshe felt Sam's hand on her elbow. \"Actually, if you don't mind the high schoolnteacher's input,\" he began, flashing them a mildly stern look.nAll the high school girls became silent. Josie felt that the girlsnwould probably sit down if desks were available. \"I don't thinknthere's anything wrong with falling in love with a student. Fallingnin love is very unpredictable and sometimes very hard to control,\"nhe said, his frown breaking into a heart-melting display of beautifulnstrong teeth. \"Believe me, I know. But, if you start acting onnthose feelings while you still have that student-teacher thing going,nthen things can get very political and there's a high chance you'dnend up not wanting anything to do with each other because of all thenpain and humiliation you've undoubtedly went through.\" Sam thenncrooked his free arm around Josie's shoulder and pulled her tillnthey were just about earshot. \"I've got to say, I was not onlynlucky she was really twenty-five but that I was able to keep myselfnin check.\" Josie could felt heat flowing upward from hernneck as she closed her eyes, anticipating the kiss he undeniablyngoing to reward her with. He was already close enough and she feltnthe aroma of his dissipating cologne get slightly stronger as hisnface moved in. \"Okay Mr. Coulson,nthen I've got a question for you,\" another \"student,\" pipednup. \"Shoot,\" he urged her as he backed off andnsatisfied his urge to embrace his wife by cocky his head againstnhers. \"You said you were lucky she was twenty-five.nWhat would you have done differently if she had really been eighteennyears old?\" Sam let out a, \"ha, ha, nice one,\" as henpondered what he was going to say. And it didn't help matters anynthat Josie had flipped her head around to study him with a quizzicalnglance. Actually, he'd told himself he'd wait for her to graduatenthen take things from there, part of him just wanting to take thenrelationship fast and get hitched before all his students went theirnseparate ways. But he always caught himself thinking that the scenenwould probably not have played out that way. If Josie Geller hadnreally been a senior, he might be dating her but their relationshipnwould probably have been long distance. 8 months out of the year shenwould be away at college, and he would be in Chicago, worried tondeath and scared that someone better-looking and closer to her agenguy would sweep her off her feet; not married for an year andnexpecting. \"Sam Coulson? Earth to Sam Coulson?\" Josiensaid in a mocking tone as she knocked on his head, \"are you stillnin there?\" Sam came back to life and stared at Josie. Shenwas immediately confused. She'd seen a deep pain and unsuredness innhis eyes. Wow, had that answer really been that tough to come upnwith? He put a hand into hers and then flashed a cocky smile towardsnthe group of anxious-faced girls. \"Well, if Josie was 18, I think that we wouldnhave made it to graduation. Then I would have probably found her atnthe after grad party and declared the feelings that had grown in menfrom the day I first met her.\" There was a bunch of \"Awws!\" \"Then we'd probably have had a nice summerntogether. I'd probably have seen her off with a smile on my facenand then gone home crying because I was so lovesick. I'd alsonprobably be so grouchy at work and hand out a lot of homework just sonthere'd be a lot to grade and I wouldn't have to think aboutnJosie on the arm of another guy,or dreading that she would call me tonbreak up because she didn't think the long distance thing wasnworking. Or maybe she'd claim that the magic had died after wenseparated, that her feelings had changed to ones for a youngnhandsome Ivy Leaguer who could do more then impress her withnShakespeare theories and bad stereo types of guys and how they hurtngirls cause they never want to grow up and make a commitment.\" Sam finally stopped ranting and he realized allneyes were on him. The nice thing was they were all looking at himnlike there couldn't be an Ivy Leaguer that could sweep Josie offnher feet the way he had, though in truth he really didn't rememberndoing anything out of the ordinary until after they'd become annitem. He glanced over at Josie and gave her anhalf-smile. Yeah, how embarrassing that had been, now he'd givennhis wife a good reason to tease him tonight. Only her sapphire eyesnweren't taunting, they were in fact, very soulful and edged with anneagerness to make sure Sam never had to doubt them like that. In about another ten seconds, the waiter camenback, panting, bracing himself with his hands on the table \"MMrnand Mrs. Coulson, I very so do apologize but there's a line ofnforty people all rustling newspapers, wanting them signed.\" Josie felt a very emotional sob come up. Fortynpeople? Forty people were here, wanting to interrupt their dinner sonthey could have a minute with her? This was uncanny! \"Oh my god, sir...I never meant for this tonhappen,\" Josie lamented, \"I supposed you'd want us to leave. Indo apologize.\" \"Oh please do not! I've already spoken withnthe manager and he has said if the people are willing to at leastndine and have a steak, he will admit them,\" the waiter beamed. \"Innface,\" he pulled open his menu and removed his own copy of thenCoulson's anniversary article. \"We have distributed thisnnewspaper amongst our guest and there hasn't been a sour comment.nIf you will stay for a bit longer and take care of their requests,nthe dinner is on us and we will also grant you dessert. What do younsay, Mrs. Coulson?\" Josie checked Sam's soft expression for anynsign of anger or protest but she didn't find any. She turned to thenwaiter with a flattered smile. \"Uh, sure, if it's okay with mynmanager, I'll be glad to.\" \"Splendide!\" he cheered then shyly laid hisncopy onto the table and slid it towards her. \"Perhaps you can startnwith mine.\" Josie let out a chuckle and pulled off her suitnjacket. All the action and attention was making her very hot. Shenthen picked up her pen and scrawled onto it her John Hancock thennreturned it to him. The waiter laid a wet kiss on her forehead thennwent skipping away. \"Well, looks like this is going to be a longnnight,\" Sam stated the obvious. \"Ssorry Sam, we can leave. I don't reallynlike all this attention anyway,\" she cringed but Sam shook hisnhead. \"Oh no, I've known from the moment you readnyour first paper to me that you're an amazing writer. All thisnattention is proof of it and you deserve to milk every moment of it,\"nhe told her in a husky voice. \"But this is our wedding anniversary, Sam. Infeel terrible that we have to spend it all here.\" Sam recognized her, \"I'm going to cry,\"nsighs and squeezed her hand. \"Hey, the night is young and besides,nit's not like tomorrow is not going to be as wonderful as thisnone,\" he crooned and laid a kiss on her cheek. \"There's nonplace I'd rather be right now, though it's not kissing you ornrunning my hands all over your beautiful body, this is your moment tonshine, and that's a close second,\" he beamed, literally glowingnwith pride. He leaned in to touch her lips with his, savoring everynsweet second of it, knowing it was going to be a while before hencould do it again. Author's note 2: Yeah! So the dinner is over!nOkay, so it's getting a bit fluffy but all I'm going to say isnenjoy while it lasts, this sequel is going to have some heavy drama.nYou thought Josie's cover being blown and Sam finding out that shenwas doing a story on him was bad?

Enjoy!!! Never Been PregnanttttttttTotal Vaughn LovernnChapter 2 Part IV \"Dr. Sam Coulson\" Josie was laid stomach down on their comfy bed,ncomplete with ruffles and cute throw pillows, decorated by yoursntruly. She had a magazine open before her, the newest issue of \"GoodnHousekeeping.\" A trail of clothing started from the door that wasnstill ajar, indicating that the owner of the pantyhose, black suitnand heels had been eager to throw them off and get into some morencomfortable clothes. She was currently trying to getnthrough an article that featured Actress Kelly Leeper, the only womannwho seemed to always be pregnant after a sweepstakes, but her suddennheadache and stomach crap forced her to put the magazine down. She'dntried to concentrate on the page once more but her migraine causednher eyesight to blur and all the words melded into one indecipherablenblob. She cocked her ear in the direction of the shower and smiled.nSam was singing, or trying to sing, \"Glory of Love,\" which echoedndue to the acoustics of the shower. Josie wasn't complaining. Itnwas serving as a nice distraction, and it felt undeniably homey. All in all, today had been annextremely wonderful day. She'd woken up to a brief breakfast in bednsince they'd both been running late, found out not only was shengoing to be promoted at her job to star reporter, but that she wasngoing to have Sam's baby! And then, just being around Sam, havingndinner with him, having him cut her meat, all of it had been perfect. The last thing she needed was hernstomach to act up. She still had a few hours to savor of their firstnanniversary and she wanted to do something other than lay down and bengrouchy because she felt so terrible. Her sweet husband probablynwouldn't mind nursing her back to health, or at least try and makenthing a bit more bearable for her, but he deserved better. At thenleast, it was she who should be giving Sam's body a nice rub down.nShe'd watched Sam cringe as he'd stood up at the table and everyntime he'd sat down, and she knew it was because he was havingnmuscle pain. Not that it meant that Sam Coulsonnwas in any way out of shape. He just had a tendency of over-exertingnhimself when it came to his favorite sport. And now the muscles ofnhis legs and upper back had began solidifying himself, hence why he'dnrun into the shower the moment they'd gotten home so he couldndrench himself under the strong gushing water and loosen those musclencramps. Josie felt pathetic but she reallyncouldn't move a muscle. She lifted her hand up about a foot but itnslammed back down like an involuntary muscle. If only her body wouldnallow her to stand up without making it an excruciating endeavor eachntime. But she wasn't counting on it, she would just have to settlenon taking a shower before she left for work. The water turning off and the smellnof clean soap and after shave wafting into the room interruptednJosie's thoughts of self pity. Yes! Any moment now she would havenSam beside her, an amazing man who could probably convince her thatnshe wasn't hurting as bad as she thought and get her to actuallynbelieve it. \"I am the knight who will fightnfor your honor,\" Sam began singing as he took care of his afternshower business and promptly stopped when he overheard Josie'snteasing giggle. \"Okay, so I'm not the next Josh Groban,\" henchuckled and Josie's heart beat faster when she turned her headntoward the glass door that reflected a smoked up outline of Sam,nwearing boxer short, pulling up his pants. \"No, yyou're not,\" she chimednin, putting a hand to her stomach that had gotten worse with everynlaugh. \"Hello, as my wife you'rensupposed to tell me that I can do everything I want to do and beneverything I want to be. Not add more fire to my low self-esteem,\"nhe informed her, his voice muffled, probably because he had a towelnrubbing his head. \"Says who?\" she groaned back,nsqueezing her eyes shut to keep from crying out. \"Somewhere in the marital vows,nbut it's a little confusing because they use old language and itnmakes it sound like it means something else. In other words, itndoesn't actually say I Josie Geller will not tell Sam Coulson thatnhe can't sing, but it's common sense,\" Sam chided her. \"Youndon't make fun of your significant other, since there's alwaysnthat risk that it can turn out ugly and hurt someone's feelings.\" Ugh! She loved Sam but he reallynneeded to leave his lecturing in his classroom, though she did findnthe tone he used to lay down the law quite attractive. \"Take me for instance. I think I'mngolden when it comes to making you feel your best when you're not,nbringing you back up when you're down and you can practicallynguarantee that you can come to me for an ego booster,\" he boastednand Josie suddenly had an image of Sam winning a \"Best EgonBooster,\" medal. \"For example, I'm going to compliment younright now.\" He paused then what he said next came out sounding veryngentle and warm. \"I am betting what happened at the Bistro D'OrangenPoisson is the first time in history that the restaurant actuallynpaid someone other than a sports or movie star to stay to please thenguests who all wanted your John Hancock, if I remember correctly.\" Josie assumed that was correct butnshe wasn't about to validate it. Besides, she believe the onlynreason her article had so many readers was because it was a rarenarticle to be completely happy and the picture of the handsomenbrunette probably gathered a fan following of its' own, not theneffort she'd made to make the words mellifluous. \"I mean, everyone, every singlenperson in that restaurant wanting an autograph, and at the Bistro, nwe're talking execs, movie stars, Ivy Leaguers, and there were atnleast ten parties going on at the same time,\" Sam recalled as henpulled up the bathroom mat. \"And then there was that huge linenoutside we had to go through if we had any hope of getting out ofnthere.\" \"Yyeah, sorry about that,\" shensaid through gritted teeth, clutching the throw pillow against hernsore abdomen. \"No, don't be sorry,\" he toldnher. Then he paused as if he were in a thought and then he explodednin a \"Gawd! Your hands must really hurt! Just give me a second tonmop up the floor and then I'll give them a nice massage.\" \"Actually, it's not my hand,\"nshe stammered but she doubted he heard her since he was rummagingnthrough cabinets. She then heard a high-pitched, \"Aah!\" and shensaw the tall figure of Sam come crashing to the ground.' \"Sam, are you okay?\" shenwhimpered, watching carefully to see if Sam would be able to standnup. \"Yeah, I'm good,\" he told hernas he slowly got to his feet and rubbed the purple bruise that wasnreadily forming on his hip. \"Actually my hip feels a tad better,nother than the impact with the floor, I don't feel it jabbing menanymore.\" \"I guess that's a good thing,\"nJosie through as she curled herself into a ball and pulled the coversnover her body, warming up her abdomen always cured her menstrualncramps. \"Okay,\" Sam exhaled as henwaddled out of the steaming bathroom with a bottle of lotion in onenhand and his hip on the other. \"Let's give your hand SamnCoulson's anniversary special massage, complete with richnbuttermilk lotion guaranteed not only to stop the pain but make younso comfortable that you'll drift off to sleep.\" \"Um Sam, it's actually mynstomach that's bothering me. I mean, I know that my body is goingnthrough extreme changes but isn't pregnancy supposed to be anpleasant part of my life?\" she whined as Sam took a seat next tonher and gently leaned over to kiss her on the cheek. \"And my head,nit's like I'm having a migraine of a migraine. I'm surprised Inhaven't lost my dinner yet. I felt so nauseated when we got home,nbut you were in the bathroom and I didn't have the strength to gondownstairs.\" \"Oh...honey. Jose, I'm sorrynthat you're hurting. You should have told me that you needed to usenthe restroom. My shower could have waited.\" \"No, it's okay, I don't havento go anymore anyway,\" Josie whined, burying her head into hernpillow. \"Besides, you needed it. I saw you, you could barely movenafter you came off the ice.\" \"Probably because I was stupid andnsat down on the ice in my freaking jeans. You know I never wear anynsnow stuff because I never fall down,\" Sam murmured, lookingnextremely embarassed. Then he cocked his chin down onto her forehead.n\"Honey, maybe you can give me a chance to make it feel better. Inthink the same thirty minute massage can do wonders for your tummy.nAnd many you'd like some tylenol for your headache?\" he suggestednthen gazed down at his wife who'd turned away. \"Does that soundngood to you?\" Josie managed a weak smile as shengently brushed her hair behind her ear. \"No, I'm not sure tylenolnis approved to be taken by pregnant women. I'm not about tonjeopardize my baby's life before she's even fully formed.\" \"Okay, but I don't want younfeeling miserable all night long. You sure there's nothing I canngive you? Is there anything you're craving like sardines, ornpickles?\" he inquired, willing to do just about anything to helpnJosie's unfortunate side effects. Josie scrunched her nose in disgust.nShe knew expecting mothers had strange cravings but sardines andnpickles should never belong in the same sentence as far as she wasnconcerned. \"I guess what I'm really craving is to get my hairnwashed. I mean, you come out smelling all fresh and now I feelndirty.\" \"You want me to shampoo yournhair?\" he laughed as though what she was saying was the mostnridiculous thing in the world. \"Honey, you treasure your goldennlocks. Don't you remember the day you complained to me that thenwind was blowing your hair into your face? You went all spastic whennI tried to put it back into a pony tail!\" \"If I remember correctly, we werenjust starting to date and I was trying to hide the good-sized bruisenyou gave my neck from kissing,\" she retorted. Sam turned hisnblue-green eyes away and heat crept up his neck. \"Sam, please, yountold me the massage would make me feel better, I bet a shampoo withnyour fingers kneading away at my strained brain muscles is exactlynwhat the doctor ordered.\" Sam gave her a sideway glance,nlooking as though he were about to reject her for the first time innhis life. But when Josie pulled herself off the pillow and laid ontonhis lap, he was won over. \"Okay, let me treatnyour stomach first and if you are up to it and comfortable enough tonwalk over to the bathroom, I'll think about doing yournhair,\" Sam offered as he gently squeezed her shoulders. \"Okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"Great, well let's get you lyingncomfortably on your back,\" he instructed her. He put down the heftynbottle of lotion then gently tugged her away from the pillow and laidnher down. \"I'm going to examine your belly, figure out where itnhurt, where it's sharp and dull, you know...so I could make annaccurate diagnosis.\" Josie couldn't help it, shengiggled. Accurate diagnosis? It was like he was playing doctor. Samngently moved the covers away them rolled up the hem of her tank top,nthen he began touching her stomach gently, pressing down gently inncertain areas. Josie tried to play along with his \"Dr Coulson,\"nthing but his straight face made her dissolve into giggles. \"Did that tickle?\" he inquirednas he continued his \"examination.\" Josie nodded and then suddenlynlet out a loud, \"Ah!\" He'd hit a tender spot. She could barelynlie still as Sam put his hands back on that spot and felt it morenthoroughly. She could tell he'd made a mental note of it before henmoved on. But the time Sam Coulson hasncompleted the exam, he found three tender spots. \"Okay Josie, I'm diagnosing yournpain as just plain tension. Happens to me sometimes and the bestnmethod of treatment is rubbing heavy lotion into the whole area,nconcentrating on the tender area and make sure we relieve all thatnpressure.\" Josie continued to giggle. \"Jose, did you understandneverything I said because I'm not about to let you sue me for notninforming you enough,\" he demanded in a mildly-stern tone with thenfamous eyebrow raised. \"Yes Dr. Coulson,\" she sang.nSam's eyes crinkled and she could tell he appreciated that comment.nHe patted her on the stomach then stood up with a, \"I'll be rightnback.\" Josie watched Sam as he returnednwith a basin. He set it down then submerged the towel sitting in thenwater and rung it out well till there were no visible drops of water.nHe then turned to his wife's exposed abdomen and washed itnthoroughly. She guessed he was \"disinfecting,\" it before henstarted on her. \"You're a big quiet. You havenany questions before I do my job?\" Sam asked gently as she driednher with another towel he had. She really didn't but looked atnher so expectantly she knew she had to say something. She decided tongo with the oldest question in the book. \"Okay. I just have onenquestion then. When you were feeling me, it hurt in some places, doesnthat mean it's going to hurt now?\" Sam bit his lip as he thought how tonanswer her. He hadn't expected her to ask about pain control. \"Um...Inguess I should be honest with you. I'm doing this to relieve yournpain so truthfully, this should make you more comfortable but yeah...Inguess it's possible that it'll hurt a little till I can get yournmuscles to relax. Maybe closing your eyes and thinking of somethingnelse will help you with that.\" She couldn't believe hownuncomfortable and unconfident Sam had become. He really didn't wantnto hurt her. \"Okay, I'll try that. Just uh...don't get mad if Insquirm a little.\" Sam shot her a mischievous wink.n\"Sweetie, I'm going to reward you for putting up with my amateurnhealing skills.\" Josie felt very content and laid back, thinking ofnwhat she could make her husband for dinner tomorrow night. But Sam'snconversation with her belly interrupted her thoughts. \"Hey baby of mine, it's yourndaddy,\" he cooed as he kissed her on the abdomen. \"Your mommy isnhurting so I'm going to give her a nice massage, so you might feelna little pressure. II'll try not to jolt you too much okay?\" Henkissed her again then added, \"I hope you can hear me because I wantnyou to know I've already fallen in love with you.\" Then he poured some lotion into hisnhands and began working on her stomach. Josie let out a few groans.nIt hurt and she wasn't used to having so much pressure on hernstomach, but it felt so damn good. She'd had Sam give her back rubsnand had him knead the aching out of the soles of her feet after anlong day of walking in heels, so she'd known he was great. But whatnhe was doing now felt so wonderful she was sure he'd found a newnway to get her aroused. \"You know Josie, call me annover-zealous and proud father but...I've already through of somennames for our child,\" he blurted out suddenly. \"Really?\" \"Yeah. I thought Angelina for angirl because we already know our daughters are going to be perfectnand beautiful angels, just look at their mother,\" he teased andnJosie smiled. \"Or Angel, Angelica, there are a few variations.\" \"Hmm and what about a middlenname?\" \"Juliet,\" he answered withoutnhesitation. \"Of course, pulled out of the genius Shakespeareannwork, \"Romeo and Juliet.\" \"Angelina Juliet Coulson,\" Josienthought, trying it out. \"You know, that does have a nice ring tonit.\" \"Course any name will be perfectnwith Coulson on the end,\" he boasted jokingly as he concentrated onnthe task at hand. \"It worked wonders for my name,\"nshe agreed. \"And did Dr. Coulson think of any boy names? Oh, wait anminute, that's easy. Just make him a Jr!\" \"Funny, Josie. Though I'mnflattered and assuming he's going to turn into a handsome and kindnyoung man, I still think he deserves a well-thought name as well,\"nSam explained as he submerged his glistening hands into the basin andnrinsed them. \"So I was thinking, Davis, Miller or Ethan, a goodnstrong boy's name. And Miller could be the middle name.\" \"No special Shakespearean name fornour son?\" she chuckled as Sam wrung out his hands and wiped them onna towel. \"I guess not. I wanted a nicenstrong name for our son, but I didn't want to name him Hamlet. AndnDavid is a name out of the good book, I'm sure he'll be pleased,\"nhe assured her and he gently pulled down the hem of her tank top. \"Great, so I guess we can go withnMiller David Coulson then,\" she suggested and Sam rewarded her withna handsome smile to show that he agreed. \"So I guess I'm done,ndoc?\" \"Yup, I've done all I can do fornyou. How do you feel now?\" he inquired with overwhelmingncuriousity. \"Actually, a lot better. So thatnit? What should I do if I have any more pain?\" she asked as she satnup. \"I'd prescribe that your husbandnlean over and give you two heart-stopping kissed and if that doesn'tnsedate you, I don't know what will,\" he answered, barely keepingna straight face. \"Great, well thanks Dr Coulson,nyou were absolutely wonderful. Hopefully my husband won't getnjealous because I'm coming back if I have any problems,\" shenstated firmly as she got to her feet then put her hands in Sam'snand pulled him up. \"But right now, I've got a shampoo date withnmy husband,\" she added as she dragged a reluctant to wash her hairnSam to their bathroom.

(ya'll know what I'm talking about!!!) \"...Oh, me thinks I see my cousin's ghost, seeking out Romeo that did split his body upon a rapier's point—Stay Tybalt Stay! Romeo! Romeo! Romeo! I drink to thee...\" There was a pause and then the rest of the college class began shuffling books, checking the time and groaning loudly about where they'd rather be or what they should or shouldn't have had for breakfast. \"Um...guys,\" Sam called from the ground level. He was leaned against his desk with one hip sitting down. He looked very professional in his crisp white shirt with a triangle of his white t-shirt peeking about from underneath, and his Josie-ironed slacks looked crisp in their khaki shade. His arms were folded, his bicep huge and definite under the thin white shirt and his mouth was spread in a cocky grin. \"You've got...\" he paused to look at his clock, \"ten minutes and forty-five seconds left. So...you might as well stop shuffling around because I will keep you here till I get through everything I have planned to say.\" His gaze said, \"and you know I will.\" The class began huffing and puffing. Sam was sure he heard a few unsaid curse words in the mix but he didn't think anything of it. He just sat there with a smile on his face as his students reluctantly pulled back out their textbooks and slumped in their seats. Sam looking very satisfied picked up his book to find his train of thought then laid it face down on his lap. \"Very good reading, Ms. Elderson,\" Sam began, picking up right where he'd left off. \"I like how you read that, a lot of passion.\" The nerdiest girl with deep brown hair that really had no sense of style stood up shyly. She had on a bright pink t-shirt and a pair of faded jeans, her knuckles were white because she was clutching the book so hard. The rest of the class looked on, making disgusted faces and rolled their eyes in disdain. But Sam gave her a reassuring smile just like when he's first met Josie and he'd proclaimed that he'd taken a liking to the new student after she'd perfectly given the meaning for \"pastoral,\" including the Latin root. He then launched into the college institutions' shortest lecture which he was making up as he went along. The truth was, he could care less whether his class wanted to stay the last five minutes or not. He'd really not been all there in the classroom all day so he really had not right to say anything to the one who had been day dreaming or zoning out during his hour long lesson. It was just amusing to see how many students actually adhered to his \"threats.\" He'd been teaching the class for almost one year and not once did a student leave his class. And with his luck, the classes had consisted of athletes who couldn't fail if they wanted to make it to the games or girls who gave him looks of affection and claimed he was very sexy when he became irritated. And this was certainly off the subject but even Josie obeyed his every plea, especially when her asked her not to leave the room or get in the shower with him. But that made him wonder it was because his stare was intimidating or if he just had eyes that looked attractive to the opposite sex. \"Another example,\"white snow upon a raven's back,\" two completely opposite ideas, once again, good and evil,\" Sam pronounced, scrawling \"white snow upon a raven's back,\" onto his growing list of examples on the whiteboard. He then glanced down at his watch. He grinned, he didn't want to gloat but he had a gift for B.S and he knew it. Of course he loved literature and had been on top of things in his own college classes, but he'd also gone to some wild parties and he'd procrastinated on one or two term papers. He'd had no other choice but to turn in a four page report and make it sound like he'd retained the text his paper was supposed to be about in his hangover state. He finally turned back to them as he capped his black magical marker. \"Well...that's all I've got to say about that,\" he concluded and headed over to his desk. \"Your homework, should you choose to be wise and do it is to read the next scene and...rewrite it...as though you were a Frenchman and the story took place in Paris as opposed to Verona. All formats for a standard paper apply. I'm not going to give you a limit since I want you to really have fun with this but, I am going to set with you with a minimum of three pages.\" He heard an audible, \"oh man!\" from his most obnoxious student, the QB of the campus football team, Jorge Lechtworth. Sam gave him a sympathetic glance. \"Sorry Mr. Lechtworth but I don't think it's possible to rewrite ten pages of dialogue into one measly paragraph.\" \"Aw man, I know you're cool. It's not your fault you're required to assign a certain number of these freaking reports,\" the QB boomed, the edge of his lips were laced with anger. But then he lowered his voice to a pleading tone as he said, \"but you will give me a few days to get it in, wouldn't you?\" Other athletic jocks, most wearing letter jackets also looked at their most leanient, sport-favoring professor with puppy dog eyes. \"Um...actually guys, this one is cutting it close to midterm so I'm going to need this one on time,\" Sam lamented, looking and feeling just as disappointed as they were. \"But if this alleviates the situation at all, I will accept papers on the Romanticist's Romeo and Juliet till the day before I have to give reports out on your final grade. And for the athletes who make it to the football championships, you have till the first day you're scheduled back. That means about two weeks before the Fall term ends. I think that's pretty generous, don't you guys?\" The athletes mustered a feasible nod, which was more than nothing, especially since college jocks hated the whole concept of homework, shoot, half of them had thought receiving a four-year scholarship meant an immediate degree as well as four years of a promised sports career. \"And I only used five minutes of your time so you are free to use the last five to work on your assignment,\" Sam suggested as he went around his desk and settled won in the chair. \"Oh, I can't get anything finished in five minutes,\" a young lady with dark hair and gothic makeup sniveled, glaring at Sam with almost gaunt eyes as she pulled her notebook splashed with Marilyn Manson back into her bag, just daring Sam to say something. \"Actually, if you actually read the assignment, you'd know what you would want to write and if you really just concentrated for five minutes on the topic, I'm betting you all can whip out a first page, at least a rough draft. I already know you have the capability, heck, you've made it this far,\" Sam reasoned, trying to his class piped up. He had a no-tolerance policy for negativity. The response he received was far from positive. \"Mr. Coulson, no offense but you must be drunk or something because you know I can't even get an introduction without brainstorming!\" the brightest student exclaimed, her voice getting almost panicky. Well that's what happened to students who were brought up in Ivy League level private schools. Sam had to bite his lip to keep from saying what he wanted to say about her over-exerting herself. \"Yeah, I think I should just pack it in and do it tonight,\" another fairly friendly but quiet twenty year old guy said as he followed goth girl's actions. \"Suit yourself,\" Sam thought to himself with half a grin. The good news was that the raid that was supposed to happen that evening wouldn't be including his students since they would be stuck in their dorm rooms, assuming they actually did their homework. \"But I don't want any talking. I'm going to be working on my stuff and I am as important as any one of you. Please give me the respect and be quiet so I can work on my novel. I have a crap load of tests to correct not to mention my wife ...\" \"Is pregnant!' the rest of the class finished for him. Sam turned a brilliant shade of scarlet but then anybody being glared at by a hundred and twenty students would. Guess he had mentioned that already, but he couldn't help it that he was a father full of pride. He leaned over to grab a thick blue notebook and laid it on his desk. He then pulled out the cloth book mark and opened it to a half-filled page, the margins filled with crazy doodles. He'd been having writer's block for some days now but he finally felt he was ready to write. His novel was about a woman seen through the eyes of a man who was completely and devoted to who he finally believed was his soulmate and what would be more perfect than watching the love of his life go through the pain, joy, worry and hope of a pregnancy? He uncapped his pen, placed the notebook against his raised knee and began gliding his pen across the white lined plane. \"I awake to the sound of pitter patter feet and the soft calling of, \"Daddy! Daddy! Wake up! You told me you're take me to the park!\" he wrote, grinning as he did. \"Only I didn't feel like getting out of bed But as soon as the cries become insistent I feel a pinch on my cheek. \"Okay, okay,\" I find myself groaning. The only reason I force myself from a restless sleep is because I know my child would reward me with a smile and make me the center of her world for at least one more day. But then I finally open my green eyes, and I find my room to be dark, empty and too quiet for my taste.\" Suddenly the thought of the students and the handsome teacher absorbed in his writing was interrupted by the sound of a cell phone ringing. \"I swear,\" Sam waited about ten seconds before he put down his pen and decided to comment on it. \"Okay, who is the irresponsible student who forgot to put their cell phone on vibrate\" Sam demanded, leaning back in his cushioned chair. No one made a peep. They just glanced at each other after checking their cell phones to make sure they weren't the culprit. \"Okay, who is the owner of this, \"I swear,\" song? If you don't come forth now, you'll be spending tonight with a chaperone making sure you do your homework for once,\" Sam boomed, actually becoming a bit upset. Still no answer. \"All right. The whole class will write me an extensive report on why we don't allow cell phones to ring in the classroom and how it disturbs our learning environment,\" Sam ordered which upset his students. They were all glaring at him again. But Sam shrugged it off. Hmph! They would learn not to disobey him. He returned to his novel only to be interrupted by a brave rebel of a student who stated, \"we've already checked out cell phones, none of them are ringing. Maybe you should check yours.\" Gasps erupted through the classroom. They all looked as though they were anticipating Mt. Coulson to erupt. The student still wore that intimidating expression but her folded arms looked like they were rubbing against each other because the owner of them was uncomfortable. She was obviously no match for Sam's daunting presence. Sam was like a quiet friendly person who unleashed so much fury that everyone knew not to make him angry. \"Sure, why not?\" Sam boasted, meeting the challenge. He pulled out his cell phone from its' leather holder that was attached to his black briefcase. He flashed a smart ass expression as he showed the cell phone to his class. He practically wanted to shove it into the face of the student who'd had the nerve to try and embarrass him in front of his class. Only his phone started vibrating in his hand and the ring tone was a beeping melodic version of \"I swear,\" that sounded distinctly like the harp selection on a digital keyboard. Wait a minute? Hadn't he set his phone for a Jamaican beat, something a bit more in the reggae channel? So why was his phone playing a very recent pop song? He cleared his throat and pulled up his cell phone. Josie was calling him. Josie! That's who must have set the ring tone. He suddenly remembered that one day he had allowed her to mess with it. She must have done it then! He turned his back to the class and click the answer button. \"Josie?\" \"Hey Sam!\" she sang from the other end, very giddy. But Sam noticed that as giddy as his wife was, she was overdoing it. \"Honey, are you okay? I thought you were going into a meeting with Rigfort at nine?\" It was currently nine-thirty. \"Well actually...I found out already.\" \"Found out what?\" Sam asked gently, wishing the bounciness would leave her voice, at least. \"T....that, oh god, Sam! My prayers have been answered. An year after my exclusive nightmare and I'm getting my next BIG JOB!\" Sam almost toppled backwards from the weight of his heart that had suddenly filled with pride. \"An exclusive? That's great sweetie! Things are just really turning up for you, aren't they?\" Josie's reply was in the form of a giggle mixed with some equally loud sobbing. \"So, what's your undercover project now?\" he injected into a giggle-free moment. \"Actually, that I haven't heard, we're about to go into the meeting to discuss the details,\" his wife answered in a more stable tone. \"But Anita says that the job's been floating around for weeks and everyone known about it and has been waiting to see who would get it. And...looks like, I got that job!:\" Sam smiled broadly. Wow, a major exclusive all of Chicago Sun Times' reporters wanted. If there was anyone who deserved that chance, it was Josie. He was her husband, but for the three weeks of spring quarter, he'd had the opportunity to observe her work and talent as a teacher. To borrow Guy's word, she was going to be ruffus! \"That's great, Mrs. Coulson. Now remember, just know that you belong with me for life no matter how bright your star shines, or how many Shakespearean reads try to woo your heart,\" he reminded her, only half-joking. \"Oh Sam! Don't you know that you are the only man I want, that my heart belongs only to you?\" she assured him defiantly, then in a very sweet and innocent tone she added, \"you're my adele penguin, remember?\" All of the slight worries that had surfaced in Sam's delicate heart disintegrated at the utter of those words. \"Yeah, I'll never forget it.\" He could just see Josie smiling right now. But then she cleared her throat and Sam knew that was probably a sigh she was going to apologize she had to go. \"Okay Sam, I just about have to go, but before I do that...I need you to let me talk to Dr. Coulson for a second.\" Sam grinned as he sat down on the edge of his seat, oblivious to the chattering going on that was all about teasing their very handsome English professor who turned into mush every time he go the chance to play the role of Josie's husband. \"This is he.\" \"Okay, um, Dr. Coulson, yesterday was really great but my stomach is still cramping up and I think my lack of morning sickness made it worse.\" \"Really? Well I'm sorry to hear that. Perhaps I underestimated your problem. Mind you, I didn't want to put a pregnant woman through too much pain but obviously I wasn't aggressive enough,\" he said with a shrug of his shoulders. \"Oh well, not a problem. I guess I'll just have to try a more invasive procedure and maybe I'll prescribe a stronger prescription for you.\" \"Oo, I don't know if I like the sound of that. I'll have to run it by my hubby,\" he heard Joss whimper, she actually sounded scared. \"Well Sam totally agrees with Dr. Coulson with good reason, and so I've booked you for tonight, at around ten, sound good?\" he inquired. \"Yeah... okay.\" \"Great,\" he cheered then he turned back to husband mode. \"So, Josie, when should I expect you home tonight?\" \"Depending on whether I need to do additional research on top of the two articles I have to edit for tonight's paper, no later than six,\" she informed him. \"So I guess I'll try and make dinner by seven. Leave some beef out for me, will you honey?\" \"It's a date,\" he agreed, smiling from ear to ear. \"Love you.\" \"Love you too,\" Josie replied back, but it never got old for him. Josie had a way of making it sound like she meant it everyday. \"Bye hun\" And finally he clicked off and shoved his cell back into its' pocket. He looked up and was shocked that his students were still at their desks. He glanced at his watch, class had been over for five minutes. \"Um guys, what are you still doing here?\" \"Witnessing your transformation from Prof Coulson to pussy-whipped Mr. Coulson... to, dare we say it, naughty Dr. Coulson,\" one of the prettier girls in class giggled as they got to their feet, all three held fluffy pink binder and strapped on their bright shoulder bags. \"Naughty Dr. Coulson? What are you trying to say?' Sam demanded abashed that his conversation could be taken that way. \"And why were you eavesdropping.\" \"You're the one speaking loud enough so the class could hear,\" snickered a young woman Sam had assigned a tutor session to after overhearing her converse with her boyfriend during his lesson in an earlier class. \"Oh, tell you wife good luck on her exclusive, and congrats on your baby.\" \"Oh, thanks,\" he stammered shyly, staring at the ground as he turned red. He saw no one had moved from their seat. \"Okay class, this conversation is over, now get out so I can go on my break,\" he urged them and the class started moving, doing a lot of snickering as they did. \"oh and your papers, don't forget to do your papers!\" he hollered until the class was empty. He then tidied up his desk, picked up a few scattered pieces of garbage as he bounded up the stairs then locked the door to his classroom before he went to the teacher's lounge to take a twenty minute, hiatus, just enough time to recompose himself for his next lesson. 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 \"Miller David Coulson?\" twenty-eight year old Danny Larkin inquired with a raised eyebrow before he laid back in his seat to take a sip of his coffee. \"Angela Juliet Coulson I can understand since all their father know their daughters are going to be angels and Juliet is just fitting because you're like a Shakespearean major. But what is Miller David about? Didn't you want to give your boy a spankin Shakespearean name too? Or at least a strong name. You can always call him junior if you couldn't come up with something good, Sam. That name has sure worked for you these last twenty seven years.\" Sam rolled his eyes as he listened to the words coming out of the college's Dental Professor. He'd actually wanted to tell his colleague and also good friend his good news and naturally that had led to revealing some possible names, but he hadn't expected any negative feedback. \"I'm sorry you don't like it but I wasn't asking for your input anyway,\" Sam retorted, a bit irritated. \"Josie and I agreed on the name so Miller David Coulson it is.\" This comment was followed by Dr. Larkin's chuckling. Sam raised an eyebrow at the young man teaching dental assistants how to be dental assistants, wondering what was funny about what he'd said. \"Man Sam, I was just messing with you! It's your kid after all, if that's the name you want to give him, by all means, I'm certainly not going to stop you,\" the blond, equally good-looking guy laughed as he rubbed the side of his blue scrub pants. Sam gave him a look as though he were dense. \"Well your humor is so dry that I couldn't tell.\" \"Hey, I'm funny!\" the young dentist cried out, looking very offended, while if it was a patient he would apologize for being scary. Sam laid back in his seat and stuck his nose in a parody of Hamlet. He never particularly liked when people thought they had the right to bad mouth the most talented playwright in all the world but he knew that literary work was able to be read many different ways and perceived by many different meanings. \"You just keep telling yourself that.\" He went back to his reading but he could see how offended Larkin was, using his peripheral vision. He was very amused and put a book mark into his book and set it aside. \"Now, you know I'm kidding, right?\" \"Actually, no. Man, you've got as dry a sense of humor as I do, you can't talk!\" his colleague sneered as he grabbed a delicious looking cruller. Sam didn't look at him at him or give him a reaction. Gosh, things were going to well for his wife but all of his students and colleagues seemed out to get him. Instead he decided to try another verbal jab to make up for the last one that turned out lame. \"Dr. Larkin, you do know that doughnuts are bad for your teeth, especially a cruller that's like 99 sugar,\" Sam chided him as he picked out a less sugary cake doughnut. \"You'll end up drilling your own teeth.\" \"Hey, I got attacked by my female students this morning. We were doing root canals and they all got squirmy and started grabbing me,\" he retorted as he took a humungous bit from the shiny doughnut. \"They got all mad saying that I should be nicer, that couldn't I make an exception and not scrub the inside so hard. We had quite a few kids today and I think they were under the impression that the procedures we do on a child is completely different from the ones we do on an adult when then difference is really the happy background, some of the numbing procedures and our level of patience.\" Sam just laughed and was thankful for once that he hadn't listened to his mother and become a doctor. Though he sort of wished he were an obstrecian so he could completely have control over what would happen to Josie till the way he welcomed his child into the world. \"Well I guess if I was bombarded by a bunch of squeamish girls being condescending while I was trying to work as quickly and as efficiently as possible, I might very well need a doughnut,\" Sam teased as he fiddled with the hem of his shirt, untucking it and tucking it back in, in his other hand he held the doughnut sandwiched between a napkin. \"Believe me, with the way they were treating me, it's either satisfying my sweet tooth or sending my assistants out crying and then I'd be forced to comfort them after probably coaxing the kid that I wasn't trying to hurt him.\" Sam nodded as though he understood. Yup, he was glad that the career choice he'd made was not in dentistry. There was times when he could be stern as a literary teacher but not enough to make a student cry. But they drama was pretty much the same for both situations. \"Well Danny, I think something is going around to get us young guy teachers because I'm having the same issues today,\" the ruggedly handsome Yale graduate said with a sigh that perked the interest of the troubled-looking dentist. \"Really, do tell.\" Sam took a scrumptious nibble of his doughnut then went through his anal jock's complaining, the episode with his student griping about the new assignment he'd give them then finally, how he'd scolded his class and threatened to make them write a detailed report when nobody would stand up to take the blame for the cell phone that hand rung in the last five minutes of class. And then how it had back fired on him since it turned out that it was his cell phone that had gone off. Dr. Larkin looked at Sam with tears in his eyes. \"Man, Sam, you're just having a great day, aren't you?\" \"Tell me about it,\" Sam agreed, grimacing as he did. Danny held a beautiful sugar-glazed doughnut in front of Sam's face with a sympathetic glance. Sam eyed it, wondering if that would be a good idea. He'd been pretty careful since he'd like his ability to not get flabby even if he didn't work out. But then again, it was hockey season and the way his opponents played in the past he knew it was going to be a work out right there. He took the cruller from the dentist and hounded it down while Danny said, \"good man.\" They talked for a few more minutes about their classes and mainly how they would get back to their female students who were currently trying to humiliate the gentle, kind, good looking male teachers. It would only be a lot more interesting if Sam's eyes didn't keep darting away to the clock or the cell phone in his pocket. \"Well, you're obviously anxious about something,\" Danny probed as he leaned back and crossed his feet over his other knee. Sam looked up, looking startled. \"Oh sorry, it' just you know Josie's pregnant and that's a big change already, and now she's got this whole exclusive thing, you know, I know how my wife is. She's gives everything she does her 100, only she doesn't seem to get that doing that for five separate situations means that she has to work really hard. Really hard an din her delicate state, she doesn't have a good enough reason to anything hard.\" \"Sam,\" Danny said, laying a hand on his shoulder. \"you said that your wife was how many weeks along?\" \"Three,\" Sam beamed, looking very proud. \"Yeah, three, and it doesn't take a brain surgeon to tell you that she's way too early to miscarriage. I bet you can't even see her tummy yet,\" Danny told him and Sam looked a bit sheepish. \"Which means that you are worrying way too early.\" \"Hey! I may not be able to see her yet but I know he/she is in there. It's amazing, fatherhood,\" Sam sighed, a dreamy glazed look came over his expression. \"You don't even have to hear their little voice or hold him or her in your arms, you just know that you love them the move it's confirmed that they've been conceived.\" \"I, sounds amazing. Course I wouldn't know since I'm just a single man,\" Danny commented with a shrug. \"You're engaged.\" \"Yeah, but that's not quite the same thing,\" Danny reminded him, looking just a tad bit jealous. \"But really, congratulations, I look forward to seeing that face of fatherly pride for years to come.\" \"Thanks Dan, thanks a lot,\" Sam said as he stood up to shake his buddy's hand. He nodded as he picked up his lesson planner. \"You know you're really got to take care of her now, I mean, I know you already do, you're probably the most devoted husband in all of Chicago but now you have to make sure you health is in even better shape.\" Sam rolled his eyes, that was obvious. \"Which means she needs to be eating right and stuff. Like you said, she shouldn't over exert herself, and she shouldn't have any sort of infection in her body, so this is what I recommend you do,\" Danny boomed, rubbing his chin with one hand and slapping his planner against his thigh, actually looking like he knew what he was talking about and excited about it. \"Yeah, I knew that too. So what do you suggest I do?\" Sam said with the most respect he could muster. Which was very difficult since he'd taken the always hyper young dentist very seriously. \"Well, you did say that she's got an exclusive coming up so she's pretty much got her work cut out for her. Why don't you do something for her like cook her dinner, that way you can cook for her and make sure she's getting healthy cuisine at the same time.\" Sam was so ready for a lay off that he didn't attach the meaning to the words until he ran them through his head a second time. And surprise, what he said not only made sense but actually sounded like a good idea. \"You know what, that sounds like a really good idea. I've been thinking of a way to show her how proud I am of her for sticking with it. It's been an year since she's gotten credit for what did for the Chicago Sun Times with her latest article. Only I'm going to have to cook her something extra special,\" Sam ranted, half-talking to himself. \"Oh yeah, since you normally cook for her anyway, right?\" Danny pointed out and felt himself just get a bit infuriated with him because he was so god damn happy. \"Only if she'll let me. Usually I end up cooking beside her, which is fun. I just like being around her, but that means I'm going to have to plan a meal then go to the store to pick up the stuff then make it home before she does, which shouldn't be a problem.\" Finally Sam stopped talking to himself and glanced at his watch. Then he decided to make himself a note. Plan dinner during 5th period test! Run over to the store by 4:30 p.m \"Okay, well my class is starting in eight minutes. I should really head over to it,\" Sam said as he stretched into the air. \"And I suppose what you meant by infection is that she should be thoroughly checked out.\" \"Yeah, pretty much,\" the kind dentist said ,no longer taunting or a slapstick to relieve tension. \"And since the hospital's covering her pregnancy and internal organs I suppose you're going to offer to take care of her perfect teeth?\" \"Yeah and because I want to keep being your friend and because I want to show you that I do care about the well being of my patients psychologically as well as physically,\" Danny admitted, showing just a bit of his soft side, \"I'm going to perform the most kindest root canal or extraction or whatever I have to do if it comes down to it.\" \"Great,\" Sam cheered as he headed to the door and pointed a finger in his direction. \"I'll talk to Josie and get back with you to schedule that, but only if you'll be using a very capable assistant.\" \"Now would I do that to you?\" Danny retorted, looking slightly amused. To this Sam gave him a glance that gave Danny the urge to sock him in the face. \"I don't know Dan, would you?\" 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 Yay! Another chapter where good o'l Sam is sheepish and embarassed. Honestly Michael Vartan looks the best when he's tense, pissed or just plain sheepish! Thanks for your reviews guys and please keep reading! And let's just say...enjoy the fluff, while you can! Toodles, Total Vaughn Lover[Chapter 9] Author's note: Hey, happy new year, and another year for Never Been Pregnant, thanks for all your support last year and here's hoping for another great year! Never Been Pregnant Total Vaughn Lover Chapter 3 Part II Josie's New Assignment \"Okay, breathe,\" Josie instructed herself s she sat down in her seat. Anita plopped down on her left, her loveable big-headed assistant, Merck on the right. But she barely could catch her breath as the various reporters and column writers from the Chicago Sun Times filed into their usual brightly sun-lit meeting room for their usual weekly meeting. In a matter of moment she, Josie Geller Coulson was going to be announced as the reporter assigned to a project that everyone at the Chicago Sun Times was going to kill for. \"Breathe Josie!\" Anita chided her friend as though she were nurse telling the expecting mother to breathe to make labor and delivery easier. \"I'm serious, Josie, I haven't seen you take one good breath in the last five minutes!\" \"Sorry but it's just that I'm sort of on a edge. According to what I've heard , I'm about to get my dream job!\" Josie gushed nervously, reminding Anita of a high school girl giddy that her crush had said hi with her name at the end of it. \"Hey, I know you're nervous. If I knew this meeting was about me, I would certainly be freaking out,\" Anita whimpered, looking a bit hurt from the way her best friend was conversing with her. \"But you don't' have to take it out on me.\" \"SSorry, it's just that I never thought I would reel back from that disastrous situation we had last year. And now it's all happening again,\" she said in her soft, almost cracking voice that she spouted whenever she was on the verge of crying. Her blue eyes looked even more watery. \"Nno crying, I'm not about to spend another day crying because god news just happen to follow you everywhere. I'm not sure, I've stopped all the leaks from last night when you told me you were pregnant,\" Anita whined, dabbing her eyes with a tissue from a packet she always carried with her. Josie pulled a handkerchief from her own purse and wiped carefully at her eyes, not to smudge the mascara. \"Anita, but it's okay, these are happy tears…and maybe a few of them are from anxiety,\" she added as an afterthought as she fiddled with a tube of gloss then applied the gooey stuff to her lips. \"It's just, I know Sam is always saying he's proud of me, just the way I am but I never feel it. And I want to. I want to feel good about myself and impress Sam, that I can do this, that his exclusive is only going to be the first of many exclusives to come!\" Josie didn't realize she had her fist pumped into the air until she received questionable glances from people around the room. She turned her face down and started to internally chided herself for making herself constantly do embarrassing things. She was about to bury her head in her arms but she paused when she felt a warm hand squeeze her shoulder. She turned her head to see her best friend, giving her the most beautiful and encouraging smile. \"I know I'm not a handsome hunk of burning love who always knows exactly what to say to make everything all right, but I can tell you this, I've known you for years and I've known that your ability to put words together so perfectly and your dedication towards the craft was going to take you far and here it is. And Josie Geller Coulson, I know you have what it takes to do anything you set your mind to and that you will make our little Chicago paper shine!\" Josie just gazed at Anita with love, the kind of love you could only have for your best girlfriend. She felt the knots loosen and her nerves were overcome with a calmness. And now it was time to break the connection before the rest of the people in the room started making up stuff that was none of our their business. \"This coming from the woman who's broken the record for the number of times getting fired?\" Josie shot back with a wry smile. Anita nodded her head then rolled her eyes so as not to be taken seriously and that was enough to get away from the heavily touching moment. Josie decided to change the subject but her process of coming up with a topic was interrupted by the sound of someone's hyperventilation and it alarmed her just a tad because the individual was so close. Back when she's been a 100 nerd, who loved homework so much she often forgot to brush her hair, whenever Bill Prince was in her presence, she'd used to hyperventilate which led to, of course, speechlessness and concluded in her humiliating herself in from of the hottest guy in school. This person's hyperventilation sounded worse. As if everything would be up to this very moment. This actually bothered Josie a little. She had the exclusive so why should there be anyone in the room more nervous than she was? Suddenly a horrible thought struck her. What if her getting the exclusive meant the end of the line for someone else? The Chicago Sun Times staff was like family and she certainly didn't want to the be one responsible for pushing another co-worker out of a job. If that were the case, she would deny the job, it wasn't like she needed the work. Sam was a college professor. Now of course she understood guarantee wasn't huge in the educational field but for now, he had a job and she was confident the only reason he would be parted from the job would be on his own accord. Seriously, how could they benefit from parting from one of the few teachers who will care passionately about filling young minds with knowledge? So it wasn't like Josie had to work, only she knew that because she was as passionate about her word as Sam was, it would be hard to leave. A married couple who enjoyed being also married to their jobs. Were they perfect or what? But Josie would be willing to drop all of that for a fellow employee, and she was sure Sam would be proud of her. After all, she had San, nothing in life could top that. Suddenly Anita jabbed Josie in the side, gently but hard enough to get her attention. Josie turned to her best friend with a pained expression. \"Anita!\" \"Ssh, I don't want him to notice you're looking but look on the other side of you. Look at Merck,\" Anita hissed. Josie gave her best friend an awkward glance but did so and let her eyes stray to the side. She could barely keep from laughing. Merck was the one hyperventilating? It seemed to weird to see him unconfident about something when it was known he was pretty much overly confident 95 of the time, with co-workers under the \"Merck,\" spell, constantly writing down the wise saying that came out of the smart aleck's mouth. \"Merck, are you okay?\" \"Yeah,\" he stammered, but it came out extremely high-pitched. Anita and Josie both raised their eyebrows. Merck looked around to make sure none of his self-created Merck fan club members were witnessing his brief phase out of character. \"Ok…no!\" he admitted, his eyes looking bigger under his porcupine hair. \"Come on, Josie, the whole office knows someone's bout to get a big exclusive and I know for some reason, I know you're going to get it. And that would mean a possible promotion for you and of course, some kind of promotion for me and I…\" he lowered his voice as though the worst was yet to come. Josie and Anita leaned in, expecting him to say something life-altering or catastrophic. \"Well I…I don't have a speech!\" he shrieked, looking panicked. \"How do you think it'll look to the rest of the Merckees if their wise one actually fumbled in a situation like this. A possible leadership position, me and my fans live for these! I can't let them down!\" Josie was so sure she'd heard him wrong. She had to have. That couldn't have been what Merck said. Josie looked at Anita who'd completely lost it. She was quiet but because there was so much she was trying to suppress, her face was noticeably red. Apparently, she was going to have to get this under control herself. \"Merck…Merck,\" she said soothingly then squeezed his hand until he looked over at her with innocent eyes, teary eyes. Oh boy. \"I wouldn't get too worked up about it, not when we don't know anything yet,\" she cajoled him in her gentlest calmest tone. \"And if that moment does come, I am very confident that you'll be able to come up with something…positively inspirational. There was an awkward silence that made Josie feel just a tad bit regretful and a tad out of line for saying what she'd said to someone who worked for her. Sure there was nothing wrong with making friends out of employees. Heck it might be the best way because that meant you probably spend forty hours with the girl and guy an you liked them enough to see them even more. But not when the employee took it the wrong way like Merck had done, now giving her a subtle brow raise. \"So…do you want to get coffee after this meeting or something?\" he asked then, behaving a little more like a normal person than usual. \"Or do you think your husband would think of it as infidelity?\" Oh no. Josie didn't think that for a moment. Sam was not the jealous type and she was working on getting to that point. In fact, she was sure Sam would actually ask her is the \"merck,\" had actually tried to pick up his wife. \"Um…actually, since I'm pregnant, I'm trying to stay away from coffee,\" Josie admitted truthfully. But when Merck looked so disappointed she added, \"but if you're paying, I guess I can join you for a scone or two.\" \"Really? Josie, Mrs. Coulson, thank you!\" he beamed then added. \"I just didn't realize that you noticed my talent, my wiseness and I thought, what better way to give you more of an insight on me than to talk over a cup of coffee?\" Josie forced a smile. That hyperventilation must have affected his brain. If it was possible, Merck had gotten more confident on himself than previous and the only explanation could be lack of oxygen to the brain. She could only hope. \"Yeah, I'd like that,\" Josie replied as genuinely as she could. Unless of course her ultra handsome hubby decided to surprise her by showing up for lunch. \"Good morning, everyone. A great new day at Chicago Sun, is it not?\" That was the sound of Rigfort's voice. Usually that got everyone's attention and made them all quiet and ready to take notes. But today, the tension was thick, everyone was dying to know what the \"Big Job,\" was and which gifted reporter was going to receive the chance to appreciate it. Everyone except Josie, of course. \"So everyone assembled or should I take attendance?\" Not one of them was in the mood to joke. \"Mmm…tight bunch this morning. Did I not provide enough doughnuts, Gus?\" \"No, it was fine, boss. It's just…well, it's not a secret that one of us here is about to gain the opportunity of a lifetime.\" He winked at Josie which made her blush just slightly. \"Well, well, if that's the case, then I think we should cover everything else first so that no one will have a reason to leave the meeting till it's over,\" Rigfort chimed in, resulting in, \"you got to be kidding,' stares from all of the ones besides the pretty chipper ones included in Josie's clique. \"So, let's start, shall we? Okay first, Sharron.\" This repetoire continued for some time and though it lasted for the usual five minutes because of all the tension in the room, it felt like fifteen. The weekly assignments included two big sport coverages. Fortunately they'd graduated from covering scholastic high school sports to the major university where Sam worked…which had it's good and bad aspects. The good was that her work area supported the team Sam's students play in …and the bad was that she was never assigned to cover sports and her co-workers, unfortunately for Sam, loved how romantic the English professor was and liked very much to tease him. Then of course there was the team that was required to cover the huge fire, or the ten truck pile up on the freeway, the astrologer who actually thought predicting futures and writing horoscopes was her most important job in life. The fashion page led off by the most beautiful girl had a different style every week and then there were the other frequently over looked articles. Finally of course, there was the \"Today's feature,\" which meant writing for the front page and two continuation pages at good places within the paper. The pages that were just about to be assigned to the team of can't stop smiling Josie Geller and can't stop hyperventilating assistant, Merck. \"Okay, and last but most definitely not least, I'd like to present this very special, \"This week's feature to…\" Rigfort began very dramatically then suddenly broke into a rare smile, \"Josie Geller!\" Josie was surprised at the enormous amount of screaming and cheering that went along with the announcement that she didn't realize she hadn't corrected him with Coulson as she usually did. She'd received the most coveted job at the Sun. There had to be someone who was jealous, or could the miracle really have happened that every single on in the room was succumbing to her talent, or were they all just fans of Sam and Josie article, #2? It had to be the latter. Josie had already received her one miracle in life…Sam. \"Uh Ms. Geller, it might be wise to pull out a notebook as I am about to cover, not only your one time article but the possibility that this can become a more long term project.\" Josie was sure her face was red but she wondered if it was because of his calling her on not paying attention and gushing or if it was because she couldn't believe this opportunity could possibly get better than it already was. \"Now, wait a second,\" a particularly buxom blond with the snippiest attitude said coming to a stand, slamming her fist down on the notes she'd taken for this week's subject of her regularly featured what's in column. \"Yes, Ms. Golden.\" \"No offense to the awesome Josie Coulson,\" she snapped, but turned for a second to say, \"by the way Josie, congrats on making it through your first year, you have to buy me makeup remover, I cried and my waterproof mascara ran!\" Josie nodded to her, obviously oblivious to the point her co-worker was trying to make or she was doing a good job making it look like it didn't affect her the way it should. \"Mr. Rigfort, the first article Ms. Geller certainly deserves…but if this is going to be a long featurette, don't you think other reporters who have been here longer than Josie should get a chance to contribute?\" Josie tried not to get all worked up about it but somewhere inside she felt a little scared, that suddenly they would realize she was a fake and would give it to someone who was perhaps more experienced that she was. \"Ms. Golden, I know it may be very hard to understand but we evaluated every reporter in the Chicago Sun before coming to this decision and though Josie has only recently become an actual writer, her articles were so influential that it made more money for the paper in a day than we could have ever hoped to make in six months!\" Ms. Golden obviously knew she'd lost the battle and sat down, glaring at nothing in particular, to the relief of expecting Mrs. Coulson. \"In fact, our paper was so influential that someone posted it on a website and that is where this exclusive idea came to play,\" Rigfort said excitedly then turned the floor over to Gus who stood up and started blushing when Anita started hooting like he was some kind of rock star. \"Thank you everyone. Now as Rigfort was saying, our little Chicago article was ready by the newest up and coming actor, Markison Aames and he sent us a…fan letter.\" Gasps erupted through the room. It seemed everyone knew this Markison Aames, except the ones who should. \"Mr. Aames apparently found out about our star Josie through her ex in high school, who happens to run in that same circle. Why Josie never told us, I don't know.\" All eyes turned to her. Merck with those almost seducing eyes, and Anita's red with fire, demanding why she hadn't been informed of the ex, an ex on the hollywood scene, nonetheless. \"Mr. Aames is like a lot of young up and coming actors, a pretty boy, as like all pretty boys, his hope is to reach out to the female audience and build his rapport from there. And he thinks Josie can possibly do it for him,\" Gus went on, looking very proud at her while she flushed form all the attention and pressure. She was still reeling from the comment that the newest young thing on primetime had found out about her through her ex in highschool….especially since she didn't have an ex, her first kiss had been with her husband. \"Josie, Mr. Aames was definitely impressed by not only your innate talent to put words together but your ability to convey a warm emotion while sounding completely genuine. In fact, his letter reads like this: I must have her and only her write my first article. Her ability to make words sing is astounding and what better way to make friends than through a song? I'd love to the Chicago Sun Times to allow her to be my temporary publicist, speaking for me at Premieres and award shows as well as making damn sure that everything written about me in the paparazzi columns be countered with my exact quotes. My first event is the week of Halloween, my premiere for my first big movie and if that goes well, I'd like to have her continually pain me with her mellifluous words and in a few months, feature with me in a special I'm creating for my fans so they can get to know the real me, the real Markison Aames. All expenses will be paid by me as well as for her write my article will come strictly from my pocket. I'm also willing to make a generous donation to the paper as I am now your number one fan!\" Gus concluded the speech then looked around the room. All mouths had dropped in shock, shock and…shock. Josie's mouth kept opening and shutting as though she were some kind of confused fish. Josie looked over at Anita who couldn't get her jaw to roll back up and tears of joy, sparkles in her eyes. Josie was just mouthing, \"oh my god! Oh my god! OH MY GOD!\" when she felt a pair of strong hands take hold of her shoulders. \"So, Ms. Coulson, despite the fact that you're having some personal circumstances, you think you can handle the assignment?\" Josie already knew he answer but she felt a lot more confident about giving it when she felt Merck lean against her shoulder and her best friend grab her hand. She looked her intimidating boss directly in the eye and gave him her best confident smile as she stated, \"Yes, I'll do it to the best of my ability.\" \"We know you will,\" Rigfort said proudly then turned to the rest of the room. \"So, your first job will be on Halloween. Mr. Aames will be giving us transportation information as well as Hollywood protocol, dress code, behavior, ect. Meanwhile, we'll see what we can do to keep you busy till then. Maybe Gus will be nice and give you the time off so you can prepare for your body for the weeks to come?\" Josie looked over at Gus with puppy dog eyes while Anita's were like daggers. Gus's response was, \"we'll see.\" Rigfort then turned the to the room once again. \"Well, I guess there's two congrats in order, one for the story and one…for the baby.\" Now all negativity went out the door and all the employees had stood up to congratulate her. And Josie felt just as special as special as when she'd gotten prom queen through her second experience in High school. Only this time, she had earned it herself. No Rob. No Sam. Just her. The only draw back was of course going to be missing Sam. She was doing her best not think too much about that right now. 000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \"Well, Congrats Josie!\" Merck said, sounding just a tad sat that Rigfort, not even Gus, had allowed him a speech. \"Aww, they didn't even ask me to say anything and I'm relived!\" Josie told him, finally catching her breath. \"But had they wanted me to, I would have definitely allowed you to speak for me.\" \"Just like Mr. Aames is going to allow you to speak for him!\" Anita chimed in from behind them after managing to push herself through the fashion police so she could jab her in the side. \"Hey Anita!\" Josie groaned, putting a protective hand to her tummy. \"I don't think Angela or Miller is going to appreciate that.\" But Anita went on as though she hadn't heard Josie say anything. More important matters were at hand. \"I still can't believe you didn't tell ME that you have an ex. Nevertheless in the holly wood scene!\" Anita hissed as they headed back to their respective desks. \"I thought you told me that your first love is your Sam Coulson.\" \"Uh yeah, really. I'm not sure what's going on either,\" Josie admitted but instead of pondering it, she changed the subject. \"I hope that Rigfort was serious about giving me time off. It looks like if this takes off, I'll be away from Sam a lot and…well, you know what Hollywood could do to happily married couples.\" Anita noticed Josie's, \"girl talk,\" signs and turned to the spiky haired assistant who was still punishing himself for some reason. \"Merck, we'll call you when we want to go out for lunch. Why don't you go and answer some of Josie's messages.\" \"Coffee,\" Merck corrected immediately. \"Whatever. Go on and answer the phone or something. We need a moment for girl talk,\" Anita said quickly and Merck went away, looking quite rejected. But of course, Anita didn't seem to notice. \"Jose, Sam is the most devoted guy in Chicago, if no the U.S. The only thing you need to worry about is making sure you don't overwork yourself,\" Anita told her as she seated herself on the edge of the desk. \"You know, we should celebrate. Lunch is on me.\" Josie didn't mean to look at Anita the way she did but she knew that Anita had a tendency of getting fired, in other words, she couldn't have had a steady income. But then she didn't want to insult her friend who looked eager to applaud her that she said,\" oh thanks Anita,\" instead as she pulled out a bright pink folder and slipped in her copy of the fan letter written by Markison Aames. \"But I should go light. I feel like making a huge dinner for Mr. Coulson tonight.\" \"Look at you, calling Sam, Mr. Coulson.\" And then of course, as usual, happy moment must be interrupted by those who were either jealous or didn't approve of others beings happier than them. \"Anita, shouldn't you be doing something useful like…you job?\" Ms. Golden jeered, pausing with the rest of the fashion police that was hanging around her like worker bees. \"No wait a second, as long as you're dating Gus, he'll always rehire you.\" Josie usually didn't get upset but it was obvious what they were trying to do. She also knew what Anita would do had they provoked her so she instead motioned for her to leave. After all, the target was Josie Coulson, herself. Anita looked reluctant to leave but she did, praying that Josie knew what she was asking for, after all, Ms. Golden was the equivalent of the snobby Kirsten Josie sat up in her seat and straightened her cardigan then placed her hands before her and grinned, glancing at the small diamond ring on her wedding finger for luck. \"Ms. Golden, I was expecting you. How can I be of assistance?\" \"Oh, you don't need my help, after all, you're the star of this little office,\" Ms. Golden harrumphed, obviously a little shocked at the fact that Josie was not afraid of her. \"If anything, we should be asking you for guidance, so if you'll allow us just one minute out of your happily ever after lifestyle.\" Like Josie was going to deny them that. It was clear their intention was to intimidate her and she wasn't about to give them that satisfaction. \"I'm listening.\" \"Well since it seems like you're not going to do the smart thing and offer the job to someone who will definitely know how to make a star shine, I just want you to think about how much Sam is going to miss you. Assuming someone else doesn't make his eyes stray,\" she teased, tossing her blond hair behind her shoulders, followed by everyone else doing the same thing in her group. And really, everyone in that group looked like they belonged on the silver screen or at least a vidal sasoon hair commercial, any of them could stray a man's eyes from her. Except Sam, because Sam was her husband, her Adele penguin. Not theirs, hers as he continually reminded her. So of course Josie was not going to let them win today, not when she had Sam's strength in spirit. \"Ms. Golden.\" \"Yes, Geller,\" she said, as though expecting her to say something stupid. \"I just have to say I am absolutely…disgusted that you didn't mature beyond high school.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Because had you, you'd know that you try to make others feel lower because you have no confidence in yourself except when people are more miserable than you are,\" Josie sighed, shaking her head. \"I, on the other hand, am so confident that Sam is truer than anyone and that he'll not only support me but make sure that our love will only grow stronger. I have put all my faith in him, while you probably only dream of doing that with a man.\" She stood up and put her fall jacket on then shouldered her dainty everyday purse; while they all looked on, waiting for what high and mighty move she was going to make next. \"Oh and Ms. Golden, I know that there's a reason why I'm not writing the fashion column since I don't know why stripes would be in this week yet next week it'll be a faux pas, but I know this much. You would need to have mastered more than color coordination and putting people down to make Markison Aames shine.\" Josie then walked so she was only an inch away from Ms. Golden and in a demanding tone said, \" excuse me.\" Josie smiled sweetly back at them then walked over to Merck who was covering his desk with his quotes of the day. \"Merck, you busy?\" Merck glance up, looking embarrassed. He immediately began shuffling through his post it's trying to find the ones for Josie while pulling down the ones for him and began putting them into two piles so his desk looked somewhat presentable. \"As always, but never too busy to assist you, Ms. Geller-Coulson.\" \"Good,\" she smiled with approval. \"Let's go get that coffee then and bring those post it's along. I'll make sure they're grammatically correct.\" Merck would usually be insulted by a comment like that but ever since her amazing transformation, Josie was like a ray of light and he would have to apologize to Sam because her confidence and flirtatiousness was down right sexy. \"Right behind you, Josie.\" As soon as he'd grabbed his wallet and quotes, Merck hurried to catch up with Josie who'd already reached the door. Meanwhile Ms. Golden just stood there, feeling really humiliated in her skin-tight suite in a pale cold that matched her perfect styled platinum hair. Her other goldenettes had gone to their respective desks as though trying to make it appear they had nothing to do with the fashion columnist, and certainly didn't know why her tanned face had turned a few shades of purple. Had they, maybe then someone would have heard it when Ms. Golden whispered, \"you'll learn what happens when you mess with Ms. Golden. In fact I'll mess with your life so much you'll quiver at the sound of my name.\" And maybe someone would have had it in their heart to warn poor happy and oblivious little Josie. 0000000000000000000000 Dun dun dun…DUN! So sorry my updates are so slow but my new year's resolution is to get these up as fast as possible so you don't have to wait so long. Please review and let me know you're still reading!!! Thank you. Oh and yes, next chapter we get back to some good ol Sam and Josie with Chapter 2 Part III: Something delicious is cooking in the kitchen, and it ain't Sam's dish. Total Vaughn Lover[Chapter 10] Author's note: Yo! Another great chapter and yes, we are finally back to seeing more of that awesome romantic Sam Coulson and Josie Coulson chemistry in the same room, (no none of this over the phone crap…or wait, maybe a little uf04a) Thanks for your reviews last time around! And please keep reviewing! Never Been Pregnant Total Vartan Lover Chapter 3 Part III \"There's something delicious brewing in the kitchen… and it's not Sam's cookin!\" 6:00 p.m. Sam Coulson pulled his dark green convertible into the driveway of his and Josie's split-level suburban. He looked at the parking lot as he brought his vehicle to a stop and sighed with relief. The parking spot next to his was empty. Now usually this would upset the devoted husband a bit as he really enjoyed Josie's company. To Sam, there was two things he really came to appreciate of married life, waking up next to Josie and seeing her makeup free glowing face and the other being, coming home, opening the door and immediately hearing Josie cooking in the kitchen. It made waking up to teach students who didn't care about anything other than getting a degree and working hard each day anyway something he worth doing. Loneliness and wondering if he was going to stay that way forever was the one thing he'd hated about returning to his bachelor every night since he'd left the comfort of his parents house. Hence the reason why he'd decided to spend as many nights with Josie in what turned out to be her brother's house before they'd legally wed. But today, he was okay. In fact, he was really glad that she hadn't shown up yet. He vaguely remembered her sandwiching in that she needed him to leave beef out for her and coming home now would usually be considered late. And since she hadn't picked up the phone when he'd called her earlier, he'd predicted that he'd come home and be mildly scolded by his wife who liked things in acceptable order. He found himself smiling as he opened the trunk and pulled out the three paper bags filled with french bread, his favorite dessert wine, some chocolate, assorted other groceries after somehow balancing the strap to his briefcase on his shoulder. Today, Josie would learn just how amazing of a husband he could be. Not that he didn't try everyday, but today was a special day and he really wanted to do something for her, he really wanted to show that he could help her. Yes, tonight's dinner was not only to celebrate her assignment and job but a celebration of their days together just being blissfully happy and proof of his commitment to enjoy together their new project becoming new parents. And if he were lucky, he would not get yelled at for not leaving the meat out. He just had to make sure he didn't burn the main entrée into an inedible black crisp. Sam carefully waked up the cobblestone walk way to the doorway then with his partially free hand, he fished the ring of keys out of his pocket. Somehow he managed to open the door without his tomatoes or block of Parmesan cheese tumbling onto the ground. He quickly dropped the lot on the bar-sized counter in the kitchen then ran upstairs to put away his manuscript, stash away his briefcase. Then to erase any hint of his professional-image at work, he pulled himself out of his perfectly starched clothes and changed into a looser pair of dark slacks and a light colored v-neck sweater. Of course he really wanted to look a bit more presentable but he wanted to be comfortable and this was just going to have to do. Maybe he'd put in a bit more gel into his lightly mussed up hair if he had time but he wasn't going to bother with it right now. Especially since he had to cook and unfortunately, out of all the books he'd studied throughout his life, none of them had been titled \"cooking for dummies.\" But he'd shown interest in his mother's cooking whenever she made French cuisine and he was confident he'd win Josie over with his attempt at being romantic if he couldn't please her palate. He gave himself a quick shave in the master bathroom, leaving only a graze of six-o'clock shadow then lightly patted on his after-shave before he looked at his watch, thinking it was a good idea to do it now. It would be one less thing to worry about. Only now it was…No! It couldn't be 6:25! Damn! Had he really spend twenty-five minutes talking to himself through his thoughts? Josie was supposed to be home a little before seven as she didn't give any indication that it would be otherwise. Or was it six-thirty? Either way, at this rate, dinner was going to end up being stick veggies and sliced sandwich meat, or maybe he could warm up a t. dinner and discard the box so she'll never know. \"Nope,\" he groaned. \"Highly doubtful.\" He'd always been able to tell whether the food sitting on his plate was an already prepare meal or homemade with his tongue. Josie, being more classy since she'd done that month of tasting and reporting on up-and coming restaurants who wanted exposure would probably find it insulting if he tried to trick her. And carrot sticks and ranch would be a healthy choice, but definitely not romantic. Wait! There he went again, wasting time he didn't have! That was it! He was not going to make any more stops or let anything interrupt him from heading down the stairs. No more talking to himself or getting an anxiety attack, worrying about how Josie would react to his bad attempt at making gourmet cuisine. He was just going to do it. End of story. Besides, they had a t.v in the kitchen after he'd begged her all summer long so he could always watch coverage of his favorite hockey team there. Now all he had left to do here was grab the picnic floor mate, their wicker-basket and some scented candles…now where were they? B…Bring! B bring! Sam stopped and stared at the phone on his bedside table with an expression which was a mixture of annoyance and disbelief. This could not be happening. Didn't Dr. Larkin know that he was too busy to be betting on who's team was going to kick ass and who'd be buying the loser lunch tomorrow? \"All right, one minute…no, thirty seconds…thirty seconds is not going to kill me,\" Sam told himself as he transferred all his things into one arm so he could reach for the cordless with the other. \"Hey man,\" Sam greeting, assuming it was Dan on the line though any sane person would think it'd be smart to say, \"hello.\" \"I know you want to convince me that the Rangers are going to win again tonight but I seriously don't have the time. Josie's going to be home soon and I'm really kind of busy trying to…\" \"Hello, Sam? Honey, I'm glad you picked up.\" Sam felt the color drain from his face. Crap! Josie! He'd been blabbing away to his wife about the hockey situation and hadn't she interrupted at the time she did, he would have told her what he was really doing while letting his wife thinking that he was home, writing his stories, ironing his clothes, correcting his papers o watching the hockey game. \"Oh HI JOSIE!\" he said a bit too cheerily that he sounded more squeaky than chipper, but that was because he was trying to smooth things over and he wasn't good at that. And whatever Sam Coulson wasn't good at, he panicked when he executed it. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine Sam,\" she replied in her cute voice. \"Even better now that I'm talking to you. You sound surprised to hear from me. I'm sorry. Are the Kings playing tonight? I can never remember!\" \"NO!\" Sam replied immediately then corrected himself. \"Okay, well yeah, the Kings are playing but you're not interrupting anything. And if you were, you have the eternal right to barge into my conversation at a moment's notice, wifey,\" he added in a warm tone, trying to out of the awkwardness by buttering her up. \"That's sweet Sam. It's just you sounded so shocked.\" \"Really?\" he inquired surprised. \"Nah, not really. Just a bit surprised.\" \"Sam,\" she said after a beat of silence in a slightly scolding tone. 'You didn't by chance, break something?\" \"No!\" he cut in once again, of course in that higher tone, making him seem that more suspicious. He could imagine her raising an eyebrow at his outburst. Another pregnant pause. It was so long that Sam had convinced himself Josie was having a dawn of realization, in other worse, off the hook. He was just about to say, \"so…\" and wrap up the phone call when she tugged him like little kid right before he went out t play as if to say, \"now just a minute young man…' \"Did you forget to leave the meat out honey? Because you know that means either you or I have to buy take out and I really don't feel up to fast food,\" Josie whined, sounding the tiniest bit frustrated. \"Plus, since we went out last night, tonight was supposed to be my night to treat you.\" This time she sounded a bit forlorn and Sam knew very well what Josie was trying to do…guilt-trip him. And well, if his wife knew what he was actually doing, then she wouldn't be pulling that stuff. Hmm, the playful side of Sam told him this was the time to have a little fun. \"Now just a minute there, Josie Geller Coulson,\" Sam cut in. \"Are you trying to say that I wouldn't remember what my adorable wife asked of me just this morning? You're the most important thing to me, I live to do what you ask me to do.\" \"Ha! Take that Josie!\" he snickered to himself as he gathered all the things he'd previously collected into a basket, ready to take it down the stairs. \"Well, that's really sweet of you to say, Mr. Coulson but you get so caught up in your work. You have to admit that you've forgotten in the past an we ended up eating instant food, remember?\" she shot back in a tone that was strong yet still slightly unsure. \"Oh, so you're checking up on me now, are you?\" he accused, making his voice go slightly lower. \"Nice, you just admitted that you don't trust me. Josie, I'm seriously hurt.\" Sam thought he was doing very well, making her re-think her innocent thoughts, only didn't realize how well until he heard her stutter on the other end. \"S…sorry Sam, I…I really didn't mean to come across that way,\" Josie apologized in a way that hurt her handsome supposed to be joking around husband. \"A…Are we fight…ing?\" she asked then, lowering her tone, obviously not wanting anyone to get the slightest implication she was fighting with the can't do wrong husband she continually gushed to everyone about. \"Because I…I don't want to fight with you.\" Sam couldn't bring himself to falsely answer that honest question. \"No, Josie, we're definitely not fighting. We're both definitely attempting to push a few minor buttons but it's nothing serious,\" he promised, wishing he could just reach through the phone and wrap her up in a bear hug. \"I don't like fighting with you either, Josie.\" There was a warm pause and Sam imagined her breaking into a smile, shivering just slightly because her voice had the capability to cause goosebumps to form on her porcelain-like skin. \"Well, now that I know we're okay, I guess I'll get to the reason why I called you,\" she said in a rushed voice. \"I know I told you I'll be home at six-thirty but um…I'm having coffee with a co-worker right now.\" \"Oh, you mean Anita?\" he chuckled, not at all alarmed. In fact he was happy and hoped her best friend managed to keep her there for a while. \"N…No, not Anita.\" Not Anita? Sam felt a twinge of jealousy crawl up into his heart. \"\"Well, who then?\" \"OH! No one that would bother you. Just uh, he was having a confidence problem and I was spending today helping him out of it. And who else better than me to know the importance of self-confidence?\" Sam knew that he ought to be a little upset about her revelation, who wouldn't when their wife admitted to spending time with a man that wasn't him? But he couldn't help but feel admiration towards her willingness to help when she'd never gotten it when she'd needed it herself. \"Yeah, that's definitely your style. So who is this man who needed an ego-booster?\" \"Um…don't laugh okay, he's standing right over there.\" \"I'll try to contain myself,\" he replied wryly. \"Okay, it's…it's Merck.\" Sam knew he'd said he'd try but…Merck? \"Sam.\" \"Sorry but Merck has more confidence than a normal human should,\" he guffawed then put a hand over his mouth. \"I might to as far as saying he's a bit snobbish.\" \"Sam!\" Josie huffed. \"I didn't believe it and I wouldn't have unless I spend today talking to him. He's turned out to be a pretty sensitive guy.\" \"Well, I'm not going to argue with you.\" \"Great. I'm going to be here a little while,\" she put in, a bit taken aback. \"We're still discussing how we're going to go about planning out accomplishing this daunting project in my delicate state but no later than 7:45, okay?\" \"Okay, but please Josie, feel free to take all the time you want, it won't bother me,\" Sam assured her. \"Sam…are you sure you didn't do something and you're trying to keep me from coming home and finding out?\" she demanded in a deeper tone and Sam was sure her eyes were narrowed. \"Oh yeah, you have no idea\" he drawled, trying to appear sarcastic. \"No seriously, go ahead and take it slow coming home. I love you, Josie.\" \"I love you too, Sam,\" Josie replied, made an adorable kissing noise and then finally hung up the phone. Sam pushed the off-button on the cordless then tossed it on the bed. The green numbers on the watch were reading 6:35. Sam sped out of the room with his basket, sliding down the hallway in his socked feet, telling himself if he was Gordie Howe he could make it downstairs in record time and it would actually make a difference. 00000000000000000000 7:15 p.m. By this time Anita had shown up with their blushing boss and was just convincing Josie to stay longer. Usually this was the time she would politely decline saying she needed to get home and make dinner but since Sam was so insistent on keeping her out of the house she agreed to down at least another cup of decaf. Sam was meanwhile in the midst of making his surprise dinner and he was learning that he wasn't an avid a chef as he thought he'd become since becoming Josie's sous chef. The only thing he'd accomplished so far was setting up the living room so they could have dinner in something he felt had a romantic aura. Due to his training off-duty to be next American hockey star, his arms had the build so he could move all their heavy wood furniture and leather couch fairly effortlessly. And his \"hard work,\" had resulted in a room that looked more like an outdoor picnic area in the Paris on a quiet evening than a quite modern looking traditional living room. For what he could move he'd draped over it a cloth and pillows that closely resembled grass or plantation like their fifty-inch high def t.v and china cabinets filled with what other than their china. In the middle area he'd cleared out laid a cherry red and white checkered picnic blanket on top of fuzzy dark Easter grass. And then in every imaginable spot there were porcelain figurines he'd purchased at a dollar store on his way home. They included a L'arc de Triomphe, selected stores off the Champs Elysees, a school figure that looked more like a castle than a l'ecole, the famous cathedral Notre Dame and his favorite landmark, the pride of the French people, Tower d'Eiffel, or the Eiffel Tower. From selected areas shined a candle placed within a lantern giving the whole area a soft warm moonlighted effect. He wished he say the same about his progress in the kitchen. Unfortunately he'd spent 75 of his time in there planning what he was going to make for his wife. Test correcting had taken a lot longer than he'd expected so the length of time left made the choice for him. He'd made something that he could make quickly, a cocke monsieur (a grilled ham and shredded cheese sandwich) and a cocke madame (the same with egg). The two sandwiches currently were sitting on charming red dishes decorated with a strand of parsley. He was currently standing by the stove stirring a concoction of mixed cheeses carefully watching it to make sure it didn't burn. After all, if it did, it wouldn't be fondue now would it? He took a look at his wrist. Good, seemed he was making good time. Maybe he'd even have time to make some chocolate mousse. He looked at his cheese for another second to make sure it was okay then walked over to the cutting board and cut some of the french bread into cubes and then tossed them into a basket he'd lined with napkins. Finally he took a breather and wiped his hands on the front of his dainty white apron he had tied around his waist before he put a palm to his sweaty forehead. Damn, this cooking thing was really wiping him out and all he'd done the other part of the day was lecture, lecture and…lecture. So why did he feel like he was finally finished running a marathon? He obviously had to getting shape after all, now that Josie was expecting, he didn't want her to slave over a hot kitchen no matter how amazing she was a cooking or multi-tasking. Or maybe it was just that he still got goosebumps thinking about his wife. Yeah, right now he did feel like he was in one of those hours he used to spend getting ready for a date, no matter how casual it was. He sifted through the cheese once more then looked around as though he thought someone could be looking then dipped a spoon into the pot and did a taste test. \"Mmm,\" he declared, smacking his lips. The taste was tantalizing that he almost reached over for a cube of bread but stopped himself. The consistency was also perfect, in fact it had turned out just as it would had his mother made it and he knew if he started eating now, he would end up scarfing it all up. He decided to let it simmer just a tad more and while the stove took care of that, he took care of collecting utensils, wrapping them in their individual napkins before he placed them on the tray he was getting ready, already set with the two plates of sandwiches and two of his favorite wine glasses. Now all he had left to do was put the fondue together. He had not had the time to create a succulent dessert but he'd selected an alcohol-free dessert wine and if she wanted chocolate he'd picked up a bag of his absolutely favorite Dark chocolate by Dove. After doing a quick overview of Josie's collection of bright dishware in their cabinetry, he reached for a complimentary cream bowl. He then grabbed a wooden laddle and slowly spooned the frothy liquid into the bowl, not waning to stain her glass top kitchen stove. \"I'm HOME!\" Sam hoped he's imagined hearing that. He wasn't ready yet! Any minute she was going to come in, Damn! He needed to hurry and pour this stuff in and then somehow sneak out to the living room before she knew what was… \"Ugh!\" Sam cursed and then bit his lip to keep from shouting out in pain. He'd been preoccupied with his thoughts that he'd forgotten he'd still been pouring. His finger did though, now that the steaming broth had dripped and burned his index finger. \"Sam? Honey, are you in? I'm sorry I was late, I'll get dinner ready in a second. Do you want me to pop you some popcorn while you wait?\" Josie's voice echoed, getting louder as she came closer. Apparently she was assuming he did what he usually did, sit in front of the t.v with the hockey game turned down so he could read his student's papers. \"Well when she appears in the doorway, she'll know,\" Sam thought, feeling just a bit lightheaded as the throbbing worsened. Damn! Why hadn't he turned down the burner? \"Sam?\" Sam heard Josie call very near him which was followed by a gasp. \"Sam? Sweetie, what happened, are you okay?\" Before Sam could protest and be all, \"yeah sure,\" and remain cool, Josie rushed up to him, dropping her bags of groceries on the floor. Oranges and bananas didn't hesitate to run and rolled away in all directions. Worse yet, she pulled on the hand he was hiding behind his back, squeezing his throbbing finger \"God Damn, Josie!\" Sam cursed, his eyes becoming clear and alert from the pain. \"Yank my injured hand why don't you! I don't remember being so harsh when you had that tummy ache last night.\" He was actually smiling but Josie would never had figured that out from listening to his voice. \"Sam, I'm sorry! You should have said something!\" she scolded him as though she'd not suddenly come upon him without giving any notice. \"If you'd told me it hurt, I wouldn't have been so abrupt.\" Sam just smiled, one because he was too tired to argue and second because he didn't really blame Josie for reacting the way she'd done. She always got excited when something was wrong. Had she reacted any other way, it would not have been normal. \"What did you do, Sam?\" \"I uh…I burned it on that pot I was using,\" Sam answered, indicating the copper pot with his uninjured thumb. \"I guess you're right, Jose. I guess I am not as mature as I thought I'd be at 28,\" he added with a chuckle to lessen his wife's worry load. \"I could have sworn I turned the heat down. I should write the national hockey league. They addiction they've caused me is proving to be a safety hazard.\" \"Stop joking around,\" she cut in a she placed her coat on a chair, leaving her with a conservative enough tank top. She then reached for his hand again at which Sam happily obliged. She carefully bent it to check it's motor function then very gently she felt the tender part of his index finger. Sam winced, as babyish as it probably looked. \"It looks bad, honey, did you soak it in water?\" \"Nah, I didn't have the chance. It just happened, right as you walked in,\" he shrugged, trying to make it seem like it didn't bother him at all though he really wished she'd stop touching it. \"Okay, well why don't I soak it for you and then I'll put some first-aid cream on it before I take care of the dinner, okay?\" Sam smiled, touched by how much concern she was exerting over a burn that had just slightly blistered his poor finger. \"Ok, thanks Jose.\" Josie gave him a \"you're welcome. Sorry if it stings a little,\" smile as she moved the cutting board from the double sink then rolled back his sleeve and gently massaged his finger under the lukewarm water. She heard Sam bite back a sharp gasp. \"That apron looks really good on you with all it's laces and ruffles,\" she complimented to get his mind off the pain. \"Really, you probably wear it better than me you handsome man, you!\" She finally elicited a chuckle out of Sam. \"So, you were keeping me away to keep me from finding out you were tinkering in my sanctuary?\" she said then, gesturing to the used pots and pans that were scattered around. \"Maybe,\" was the only thing Sam replied and in quite a mysterious tone and Josie couldn't help but think Sam was hiding something. But then maybe he was just trying to be nice and hide the truth: he'd tried to cook dinner because he was hungry and couldn't wait for her to come home. Sam had never really been good at saying no as she couldn't so they always ended up compromising, as seemed to be the case this time. She could feel tears well up in her eyes so she kept her head turned away as she switched the water of and patted his finger dry. She then reached for the first aid cream in one of the cabinets above the sink. \"Why don't' we do the rest in the living room?\" she suggested. Sam was completely okay with the idea but something was not right and he didn't answer because he was preoccupied with finding out what's wrong. \"Sure but wait, Josie…what's wrong?\" \"What do you mean?\" she chuckled as she led Sam to the…dimly lit living room? Sam pulled on her arm so that it flipped her around and she was forced to face him. He saw just as he predicted her deep blue peepers were watering and the tears had stained her cheeks. \"Why are you crying, baby? Because if Merck…\" Josie was suddenly pulled against Sam's chest and felt a warmth only her husband's embrace would provide her with and a vulnerability she could only reach at the sound of her husband's heart in her ear. \"It wasn't Merck, Sam,\" she murmured as she pulled herself back and clasped her husband's injured hand in hers and kissed it while he watched. \"It's just that thinking it's my fault, my selfishness and my trying to take advantage of your kindness that you ended up hurting yourself.\" Sam knew this was the worst time to laugh but what she was saying was ridiculous. Jose, what are you talking about?\" \"If I was home you wouldn't be hungry and you wouldn't have tried to make dinner,\" she blubbered and turned away, not wanting to see Sam's ridiculing expression. \"No, baby…you've got it all wrong,\" Sam assured her as he put his hands on her shoulders then gently pushed her towards the romantic scene of Paris he'd spent the last two hours putting together. Josie gave an audible gasp and put a hand to her mouth. Sam smiled as he wrapped his arms around her neck then nuzzled her shoulder with his just-rightly scruffy cheek. \"You see, I was in the kitchen making what's turned out to be a bit of a mess because I wanted to cook you dinner,\" Sam revealed. \"So now you know why I burned my finger and found me in this ridiculous ruffle creation. And why I didn't care to let you amuse Merck a little longer. Go ahead and sit down, I've got the appetizer still hidden in the kitchen.\" Josie did seat herself on the picnic blanket she hadn't seen since one of her first dates with Sam. Then looked around the room in awe, immediately feeling she was in one of the romantic European countries she'd read about. \"You did all this?\" \"Yeah. I was surprised I got this far before you came home,\" Sam admitted, looking pretty proud of himself. \"This is Sam Coulson's \"A Paris Night to Remember.\" Do you like it Mademoiselle?\" \"Am I not a Madame since I'm married?\" she teased, back to her blushing smiling self. \"You can be married fifty years and you'd still look like a lady to me,\" he told her with a wink. \"Enjoy the scented candles. I'll be right back with the fondue.\" 0000000000000000000 Sometime after 8:00 p.m. This would be a sight for their neighbors to see, only then all the wives would start nagging their significant others to be as romantic as Sam was. But didn't they know there is never enough perfect husbands to go around. So maybe it was better that they didn't know. It sure didn't seem to bother Josie and Sam who were nibbling away at the sandwiches and drinking responsible amounts of dessert wine even though there wasn't any real alcohol in it. Sam was finishing up talking about his day and he'd just gently broken to her the news that he wanted to take her to see Dr. Larkin. \"Sam, I don't know. I don't like dentists,\" Josie admitted sheepishly as she wiped her hands on a napkin. \"Honey, I don't think anyone actually likes the dentist,\" Sam said wryly as he dipped a hunk of sandwich meat in the fondue. \"But I think Dan's got a point. The doctors are going to check you every month to make sure your body is in tip-top shape but no one there is going to give a damn about if you have cavities or not. I'm just asking you to go once. There's probably nothing wrong with them but I just want to hear it from someone who knows what he's talking about.\" Josie chewed silently, obviously trying to find a way out of going and Sam knew it. He watched her with shining eyes, wondering what she would come up with. \"Okay Sam, I'll go,\" she gave in reluctantly. \"Great! I knew you'd see this will be good for you!\" \"But only if you go to Dr. Larkin for your check up first. Since he's your friend that shouldn't be a big deal for you, right?\" she added firmly, staring at Sam who shook just slightly. Seemed he didn't like dentists either. \"Well, yes, he is my friend, which is why it shouldn't be a big deal to you,\" Sam replied soothingly. \"But I can go when I need to and my teeth feel just fine. You're the one who's pregnant. You're the one who needs it, for the baby.\" \"Ugh! How judgmental is that?\" Josie retorted, huffing. \"If you want to get technical I didn't cause this pregnancy to happen by myself.\" \"Josie, sweetie, I'm not trying to be judgmental,\" he crooned. \"I'm just looking out for you.\" \"Well, just so you know, you can sweet talk me all you want but I'm not going unless you go first, husband of mine,\" she stated with a superior-looking grin. Sam sighed and decided to quit while he was ahead. He was not going to win this argument, at least not right now. \"All right, that's enough talking about that,\" Sam put in. \"Let's talk about your day now.\" Josie began and told Sam everything about it including the hyperventilation bit that Merck had gone through. Sam thought he could have learned about his wife's day in full even if she'd decided to leave that out. He did however enjoy hearing about how Anita had made Gus blush (again!) and about how the decent-sounding people of Chicago Sun Times staff had taken Josie getting her exclusive very appropriately. When she mentioned that her assignment was on Markison Aames, he was sure Josie was putting him on. \"Josie, you're kidding right?\" \"No,\" she argued and showed Sam the letter her boss had received within the fan mail that had poured in featuring their support for the Coulsons. She saw Sam's eyes get large. \"Do you know who he is?\" \"Yeah, a major hollywood player. The freshmen girls in my class are always gushing about him and some of the running-start students had him plastered on their binders,\" Sam told her as he read on. (A/n: running start in my state means gifted senior and juniors taking classes in college in place of some highschool courses!) \"But you didn't like to go to high school with him or anything did you?\" Sam tried not to make Josie feel stupid as he said, \"well, the kid is like seven years younger than me so I probably graduated before he became a highschooler. Why?\" She told him about the other letter he'd addressed specifically to the head of the firm, Rigfort, asking that she be put on the assignment because somebody she knew before had let him in about her. \"Hmmm…I don't know. You sure you're not hiding any ex-boyfriends from me?\" Sam taunted as he finished his glass of wine. Finally Josie told him about Ms. Golden and how she predicted her being away a lot to be the publicist for an year would ruin their marriage. \"Really? Ms. Golden said that we'll get divorced because your job is to help a new action get some good exposure? And is this Ms. Golden married because if had to be from self-experience that she gained this bogus information.\" \"Sam, are you sure you're okay? I mean sure this is the 2nd chance they're giving me to make the Sun Times proud but I would gladly give it to Ms. Golden if you'd rather I not do the project,\" Josie told him confidently. \"I'd drop anything and everything for you Sam.\" \"Which you're not going to do, baby,\" he cut in firmly and fixed her with a serious gaze. \"I'm okay. I mean I've never been happier than the day I married you so of course it'll be hard returning back to a bachelor life part of the time but…we are going to be fine. You will take this job and make them regret ever making a big deal out of the high school fiasco. It was obviously meant to be.\" \"But Sam, you pass the magazine stands. Brad and Jenn got a divorce along with Angelina and Billy Bob, Demi Moore Bruce Willis. Relationships in the Hollywood limelight don't last. What if they start printing rumors about me being a gold digger or something?\" \"Jose, remember that sex-education class when you mentioned that thing about Adele penguins. The moment you said that, crazy as I knew it was, I knew you were mine. That connection is stronger than Romeo and Juliet,\" Sam murmured in a husky voice. \"And if you need more proof, technically,\" he continued and reached for her hand that was holding a fork loaded with food and pushed it down. \"We are a successful teacher and student love story and it turned out to be heaven. God let us be so lucky in love and tonight…as I've done before, I'm going to prove it you all over again.\" He pushed aside the food that was sitting between them before he reached for her face with his hands and began kissing her. Josie remained tense for a second but gradually relaxed and gave into her desire to connect with her husband physically, emotionally and spiritually and together they would climb to cloud nine. After a feverish session of embracing and rolling around on the blanket it was Sam who gently broke away and gazed down at her with intense green eyes. \"Come on,\" he urged her in a whisper and gently pulled her to her feet then led her toward the stairs. Josie couldn't help but notice the left-overs that were just sitting there. \"Sam, what about the dishes?\" He replied to this by picking Josie up in his arms and whispering, \"don't worry, the dishes will be there when we wake up tomorrow. Right now it's more important for me to be with my wife.\" 00000000000 So sorry it took so long but I am definitely working on it. I don't' think I'm that over a month!

Total Vartan Lover ","Summary":" Hey! I feel like a \"Loser,\" but I just saw this movie a few weeks ago whennit was shown on WB and"},{"Movie":"King's Speech","Title":"Lovebirds'","Author":"hbcmad","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9836427","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I do not own the king speech nor do I own Helena or Colin, I am writing this fan fiction as a respectable fan and apologies in advance if I offend any of you, feel free to review and just generally enjoy! Helena I slowly arose from my fathomless sleep. My heavy eyelids opened and then quickly shut when the bright morning sun rays blinded me, {I don't remember having the windows right opposite my bed unless I fell asleep on Tim's sofa of course…} I thought to myself, those thoughts were interrupted when a deep mumble emerged next to me, I turned to face the source of this noise and cautiously opened my eyes expecting to see my Tim lying next to me. It wasn't Tim though, this was a different man, a man who is tall, has a very smooth defined face that was ageing gracefully and was topped with small brown curls that looked delicious and chocolate-like. ''Shit.'' I subconsciously said This is Colin. Colin Firth, my king for the film that i'm currently filming ''SHIT, SHIT SHIT SHIT!'' My voice was cracking with obvious realization, I looked under the covers to reveal my naked body. 'Mmm.' Colin stirred, slowly waking from his sleep. I quickly pulled myself from his chaise and started searching for my clothes, now the sleep fully shaken from my tired body and fully aware of the situation. With my clothes from the previous day chucked on I ran from the rooms nearly tripping over the cat that led peacefully outside of Colin's room. ''Move.'' I hushed pushing the ginger animal a side, letting the stairs welcome me generously. Before I knew it I was outside and the cold November morning air attacked my body harshly, Shivering and cursing I ran down the familiar cobble London streets praying that nobody sees me, the paparazzi in particular. I found myself arrive into the local retailing services and brought myself some aspirin and a black coffee as well as a bottle of Fiji water from a small convenient store hoping that it would put an end to the banging in this head of mine. ''Excuse me miss...'' A broad Scottish voice rang in my buzzing ears. {Shit, great well done Helena. I shouldn't of borrowed some sort of sunglasses and hat to be less recognisable } As I was getting lost in these pestering thoughts the female cleared her throat bringing me back to reality. \"Yes?\" I said painting a fake yet kind smile onto my face ''Sorry'' the tall lady said obviously noticing my bad mood, ''Its just your any shoes not wearing shoes...'' ''What?'' I questioned her before looking down at my now dirty bare feet { shit, thats why you couldn't feel your feet.} My cheeks flushed a bright shade of pink bring a burning sensation that warmed up my skin as they did so, I quickly recovered from this glitch and told her a pathetic story of how my shoes broke and I was too ashamed to wear them. The women looked at me strangely and with that left. Colin I n the distance I heard a anxious yet soft voice that was slowly bringing me back to reality yet my inappropriate dreams were pulling me back, these dreams were filled with the beautiful cries of pleasure and heat between two sensual bodies inter joined into one magical night, as reality was dragging me back into the real world I was attacked with a sudden pang of guilt that hit the pit of my stomach making it stir and causing me to feel sick, my mind instantly started calling for the dream to return with its passionate atmosphere contained in it. I awoke, my eyes slightly blurred. At first I didn't even recognise my room but my heavy eyes soon adjusted to the bright light shining through my window, I sat up right and led against the headboard trying to remember how I got into this state, naked and feeling very rough, I noticed some petite crimson coloured heels at the bottom of my bed, I picked them up cooing at the size of object, this definitely wasn't a pair of Livia's shoes, after all she was in Paris with her mother and sister and it was illegal for her not to take every single item sat in her wardrobe, therefore there was nothing in the house to remind me of my spouse. I sat there confused about the whole shoe situation, I then decided to assume that Livia forgot some and decided to run myself a lovely warm bath. The warm water swallowed my body and that's where I led until that warm water turned cold and my body was covered in more wrinkles than before. As I removed myself from the familiar tub my phone rang the sound of ducks filled my ears as I entered my room and found my phone on the floor just behind the door. ''Ugh Helena.'' I sighed forgetting she had changed my ringtone after my duck story that I shared that time on set. It was Tom, I quickly answered as he was the director after all. ''Hello'' I croaked surprising myself as well as Tom at the roughness in my voice. '' You alright Colin? It sounds as if you've had an eventful night.'' I gave a hearty chuckle . ''I would say yes if I could remember any of it!'' I exclaimed I could almost hear Tom's smile. ''Well I hope you sound royal for later, how was your drinks with Helena last night then?'' ''My what sorry?'' I asked, having no memory of this '' You went to Vanilla last night with Helena to get to know each other better?'' ''Oh that's right..yes.'' I answered hoping that he couldn't hear the confusion that projected from my voice. ''Um...alright then mate I just rang up to see how it went but i'll see you on set later then'' he replied unconvinced ''See you Tom'' I responded but before ending the call he said ''Oh and Colin, go and get some soothers would you! You're need it to fix that throat of yours!'' And with that I ended the call, a rush of questions flowing through my mind {Drinks with Helena? Why can't I remember this? Please say they're not her shoes…}[Chapter 2] Helena I entered my front door and was welcomed by what felt like a herd of children that led me to nearly topple backwards into the cold air. ''Mummy!'' Nell practically screamed in my ear. ''Where have you been?'' ''Morning darling, I got up early and took a stroll around Primrose hill. Have you had a good morning?'' ''No.'' Billy moaned ''Why what-'' I was interrupted by Nell's intimidating roars ''Be quite Billy, It was your fault you shouldn't of broke Keke!'' Bill shrugged and ran into the kitchen. { finishing his drawings, just like his father} I thought to myself and ended up smiling. Nell looked up at me her recent annoyance drained from her face and filled with a new happiness. She hugged my legs, took my hand and led me to follow Billy's footsteps. When we entered the light kitchen Nell rushed over to the counter and took some scissors from the draw below and ran from the room. ''Nellie Burton where do you think your going with those scissors!'' I ran after her through the hall and into the living room where she sat cutting some paper whilst watching Charlie and Lola. ''What are you doing?'' ''Making a kite.'' She replied simply ''Very clever'' I said kissing her on her head, making some blonde strands fall out of place.''Can you come into the kitchen and do that please baby?'' I asked. ''But Charlie and Lo..'' ''Ah, we'll put it on in the kitchen.'' I interrupted. ''Now come on my little monkey'' I picked her up whilst she squirmed and shouted for Billy to save her. ''BILLY! HELP. MUMMYS DOING IT AGAIN!'' Nell screamed ''NO MUMMY NOT THE TICKLING NO NO NO!'' she exclaimed as I attacked her with tickles and blew raspberries all over her, she lost control and laughed helplessly. I carried her into the kitchen sat her down in a chair opposite her brother and stuck Charlie and Lola on the small flat screen by the fruit bowl. I started to make myself some sugar puffs and felt myself slipping into another world but was soon stopped by Billy's quiet question. ''Are you playing a witch or the queen today mum?'' I erupted into giggles and clutched my aching sides { well...that pretty much sums up my life} a few minutes later after I had calmed down and replied. ''The queen today baby.'' I finished my cereal just as I heard the front door open and footsteps coming towards us. ''Hello?'' My mother's warm voice floated into the room as the kids and I ran up and welcomed her with hugs. ''Hiya mum.'' I said after Billy and Nell returned to their place at the table. ''Thank you for this.'' ''No problem darling, shouldn't you be getting ready? Where's Tim?''she asked ''In the office working on his new ideas, you know what he's like...In his own world. Im telling you If i had never seen how happy he is on set I would of thought he was -'' I realised that I was waffling by the look that my mother gave me. ''Go and get ready!'' She exclaimed ''Yes, yes you're right. I'm going\" and with that I thanked her and pecked her on the cheek. ''Bye kids love you!'' I then moved on to sabotage my children with hugs and kisses before leaving the room and heading to the shower hoping to wash the events of last night. Colin \"Is Helena not here yet?\" I asked Tom as I arrived on the set ''She's on her way, just received a text from her.'' He replied with a warm smile I sat there practicing my stutter with Geoffrey when a infectious cackle filled the room, Helena had arrived. She ran in her hair windswept yet her curls still framed her heart shaped face perfectly, her milk like skin was tinted with a natural shade of pink from the cold air that awaited outside the building, her eyes shining bright with excitement and I couldn't help but let my eyes explore all the curves that her body possessed, realising my inappropriate behaviour I tore my eyes away from her body and focused on her eyes, immediately getting lost in their own mysteries that live in them. ''Hello Colin'' her smile melted my heart along with the soft words that escaped her full luscious lips... {what on earth are you thinking Colin, this is Helena Bonham Carter for Christ's sake, way out of your league} ''H..hell..o'' I subconsciously stuttered. ''Wow'' she chuckled ''You've got that stutter down to a T!'' ''Morning Geoffrey'' she smiled whilst planting a kiss on each of his cheeks. {Surely he must be thinking the same thing! If so how is he so calm about it!} ''Hello Helena'' he greeted no nerves shown in his voice whatsoever. {well what do I expect, the mans a bloody genius!} I didn't even notice Tom come over until he placed a hand on my shoulder making me jump and receiving yet another adorable laugh from Helena. ''Today we'll be filming scene 4, Helena will be taking Colin to meet Geoffrey or Lionel for the first time-'' Tom explained the situation and then left the three of us to go and get into character. After I was all kitted up and ready for filming I left my dressing room and was greeted by Helena. ''Ready?'' She asked ''Always.'' I smiled ''Colin I need to ask-'' Helena was interrupted by a small bald man. ''You're needed on set now.'' He ordered. ''Ok'' she kindly replied ''Colin can we talk after work?'' she whispered before leaving me alone with my thoughts in the hallway.[Chapter 3] Helena ''Action!'' Tom's voice echoed through the dusty set. I cautiously open the rusty old door to the elevator and was surprised at how tight the elevator actually is, I just about managed it yesterday. {Colin's much taller than me..how will we both fit in} ''Cut!'' Tom demands ''What's the problem?'' Feeling immediately bad for delaying the filming but my mouth doesn't follow my mind and spontaneously asks ''Are we both going to fit in here?'' This question results in an explosion of laughs from the whole film crew but the one laugh that caught my ear was the sweet and gentle laugh that belonged to Colin. I looked up to him and smiled ''Come on then Bertie.'' I winked getting back into character I was right about the space. It was tight and claustrophobic but somehow comfortable, my body fitted perfectly against Colin's. I knew that nobody else felt this moment maybe Colin didn't even feel it, it didn't matter that there was a big camera in the lift with us. I smiled devilishly at Colin, hundreds of inappropriate feelings rushed down in my abdomen, making my knees shake a little {Colin's beautiful} I thought to myself {He really is...} I let my eyes take in his soft pinkish skin, his deep brown eyes, his big hands that I wanted to touch so desperately {If only there wasn't a camera here..} Colin Helena's fragile body was forced upon my in the steamy lift causing my trousers to grow tight and uncomfortable. {shit..i hope its not noticeable } the smell of Helena's hair floated up filling the once musky lift with a light floral scent making me want to feel her lips crushed against mine, making me want to hold her tightly and never let go. I felt my manhood go harder and as a result received a omniscience grin from Helena. {no no..she can't know, she's with Tim, God he is a lucky man...getting to do whatever he pleases with her whenever he wants} I grew very angry at myself for losing control but soon calmed. Being tall has it's benefits especially when a beautiful women is crushed against you, I had a perfect view down the front of Helena's exquisite dress, causing me to squirm with the adrenaline pumping through my craving body. ''That's a wrap!'' Tom shouted ruining the perfect heated moment I think we both experienced in that small tight lift. I left the set and entered my dressing room immediately falling asleep from todays work. I woke up two hours later to the sound of knocking on my dressing room door. ''Come in'' I offered. Helena wondered in, now dressed in her own eccentric yet beautiful clothes. ''Colin..I didn't expect you to be here.'' If i wasn't mistaken I would of said that Helena blushed... ''I must of fell asleep..'' I replied '' It was a long day'' she muttered ''It sure was'' ''Colin..Do you think we could rehearse the lift scene quickly? Just to go through a few things..I don't think I did the best of my ability I-'' Helena's eyes shined with hope and shined even brighter when I accepted. ''Thanks love!'' She exclaimed practically running out of the room. I ran after her and we soon found ourselves entering the lift once more. The heat immediately returned just as it had before only this time it seemed more strong, more real.[Chapter 4] Helena ''Bertie I-'' Colin shut me up by gently kissing me. A rush of energy was dancing all around my body, my hands craved him. I put my hands around his neck pulling him closer and making the kiss more passionate. His soft hands ran up my leg lifting my skirts as he does so exposing my legs causing me to moan into our kiss. I break the kiss as I slowly bend down towards his man hood rubbing it gently, adjusting the treasure to my touch. Colin's jaw drops as I pull down his trousers with my teeth stroking his legs, memorising every part of him that I possibly could, my hands continue to rub Colin. ''Stop teasing.'' He grunts and pulls me up from my position. He slams my body hard against the wooden wall, aggressively ripping my shirt of and using his warm expert fingers to unhook my bra in a matter of seconds my chest is exposed, he ran his fingers along my upper back sending chill down my spine, he then cupped my breast before pullinh me in for another passionate kiss but this time it was more intimate, the perfect mixture of sharp teeth biting and being soothed by his soft lifts curing any pain. ''Fuck'' I whisper. Colin Helena tilts her head to the left letting me reach more of her neck, I move further down her fragile body planting kisses in places that I've only ever dreamed of touching Helena, I take one perfect rounded nipple into my mouth and bite it gently causes a low moan escape from Helena's mouth. I move my hand slowly down to Helena's legs removing her skirts and lace pants which were already drenched in her pre juices. As I push her muscular legs apart the heat from Helena's core hit me. Licking my lips in pure satisfaction from what awaits me I lick the side of Helena's thigh savouring every flavour that I receive. I was interrupted by a gentle hand stroking my curls giving me permission for my dreams to become a reality. Without a second thought I kissed Helena. Demolishing her, sucking on her whilst gently caressing her nipples. ''Mmmmm'' Helena moaned urging me to continue with my movements. I continued to taste Helena until I felt her juices trickle onto my tongue, I then entered two fingers inside of her. ''Ugh Colin'' Helena moaned whilst rotating her hips, guiding me to her special spot. Helena began to tighten around my wet fingers letting me know she was nearly at her climax, to push her even further I entered a third finger, this sent Helena of edge. ''Colin'' her screams echoed through the deserted building, her eyes fluttered shut as her orgasam shoots through her body letting her breath escape in short desperate gasps, she stood still for a few seconds and then let her weight fall slightly on my fingers. I rose from my position to steady her shaking body her breath trembling against my skin. Helena's eyes fluttered open, giving me an insight of the lust that she's feeling. Without taking her eyes of me she lowered herself until she was on her hands and knees, softly biting my thighs until she reached my boxers, her hands worked quickly and desperately to reveal my manhood, she winked at me before putting me in her mouth. I grabbed her tangle of hair guiding her further and further until she stopped looked up at me and raised her eyebrows,instantly reminding me who's in charge. Helena returned to me and takes more of me in with each movement results in me grunting telling her how much I appreciate this in my own way ''Mmm Helena'' Before I reach my climax, delaying the ecstasy I push Helena away and pick her up and push myself into her. Harmonious cries fill the lift as I do so, ''Collin-'' she moans as I fasten the pace of my movements. But her words are mumbled as I drown them in my lips. The strong legs that were wrapped around me started to tighten, gaining control of my movements and making them deeper with each thrust. This caused Helena to tighten her grip on his shirt and hair ''Collin...ugh...mmmm'' she screamed as I felt her contracting around me causing me to reach my climax simultaneously. It fell silent and all that could be heard was the recovering pants that left our mouths. Helena gave me one last kiss and walks away unsteadily, her legs still shaking from the ecstasy I put her through.[Chapter 5] Helena I leave the building as quickly as my shaking body could take me { What on earth just happened} I thought to myself whilst checking my phone. \"Shit.\" I muttered realising that Tim had called me 4 times. Sorry baby, have to work late tonight. As I sent the text I tried to fix together what on earth just happened through there, I realised that I couldn't just leave the situation as it is and headed back to the building. The building was still warm from today's work and the lights were still on which meant that Colin was still here. \"Colin?\" I called hoping that he would still be here and up to chat. \"Hello?\" my voice bounced off the walls and echoed throughout the eery set. \"Helena!\" Colin met me halfway down the hall \"I thought you left?\" he questioned \"I..well yes-\" I smiled \"Look Colin we need to talk about this love.\" \"Im sorry I shouldn't of-\" I interrupted his apology \"NO! don't be silly I certainly enjoyed myself\" \"It was wrong and I-\" \"Colin will you please shut up and listen to me!\" I ordered sounding bossier than I intended. \"Look-\" I took his hand and sat down on the wooden chairs nearby \"Colin this morning I woke up in...well..your bed.\" I waited for what seemed like hours for a reply. \"Oh..\" \"Yes...oh, I just…\" My voice cracked, feeling instantly annoyed that I gave him a glimpse of my feelings \"Colin-\" \"Helena\" he hushed, pulling me in for a tight hug \"Shh...don't say anything.\" I sniffed trying to hold back the tears. \"Look\" I did so and he smiled, putting a piece of hair behind my ear \"I don't know why this keeps happening, but I am certainly glad that it did. Tim is such a lucky man to have you, I would do anything to trade places with him but you're not mine, Helena...what i'm essentially trying to say is that..well, I love you Helena.\" And with this he leaned down and slowly kissed me. \"Hello?\" a new voice appeared from the doorway. \"Helena! Collin!\" It was Geoffrey. \"I um…\" I broke the kiss immediately and pulled away from Colin, leaving the warmth and softness that I had just felt with him. \"Geoffrey!\" I exclaimed. \"We were just-\" I stopped in mid sentence { What's the point in even trying to explain this, even I don't know what's going on here.} \"Oh not to worry Helena\" Geoffrey winked surprising me with his reaction to the kiss. \"Anyway I'll leave you two lovebirds to it.\" and with that he left. I smiled up at Colin \"Lovebirds is one way of putting it I suppose.\" The End ","Summary":" I do not own the king speech nor do I own Helena or Colin, I am writing this fan fiction as a respe"},{"Movie":"Bodyguard, 1992","Title":"Bodyguard forever","Author":"nippyfan4ever","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8661552","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 Frank was very immersed solving a case of two ex-politicians who get involved with the death of a mayor. It seemed they stole some national security investigations and were discovered. As he was reading one of the plenty of newspapers there were at his desk, he was also watching some videos of the public speech given by the now deceased mayor. Frank Farmer had always had this very keen sense of smell for such cases; he had always been clever to smell if something was going wrong. This ability took him to be hired by one of his clients who recommended him to a high FBI chief, the ex-bodyguard accepted the job because it was very well paid and thought it was a good change. He wanted less drama and action in his life. It was almost eleven pm and he was feeling tired but suddenly Garret opened the door and sat down in a chair. He was his best friend, he reminded Frank to the cookie-black chauffeur of her famous ex-client. –God damn it Frank! You have less than four months and you already solved the fucking case. You´re good man. By the way, have you heard the entertainment news? Frank look at him with an ironic sight and answered him –Yeah, I don´t miss it, you know I love it! Of course he has never liked the spotlight and nothing to do with it. –I think you wanted to know that the famous Rachel Marron had an accident an hour ago. Just by hearing these words, Frank´s body got cold and tense –My Rachel? he looked horrified to his friend – What you have just said, your Rachel? Garret said and the man sitting in front of him couldn´t believe he said it aloud. Is she alright, how, how it happened? He could hardly spoke and react but disciplined as he was, Frank got up quickly and decided to go home and before leaving the office, he said to Garret, -Someday I´ll tell you the whole history, but now, please watch my back while I disappear for some days. His fingers felt clumsy when trying to dial the number; a number he wanted to dial so many times but never had the courage to do so. Frank tried to convince himself that the \"thing with Rachel\" was just a phase and no more. She was the most famous singer and actress and how could she put her heart on him, -C´mon boy, you are not for her and she is not for you! But what the hell he was doing right now? A deep voice answered the phone, -Frank is that you? She got you in her cell. It was Bill. Frank took some stuff from his house and by this moment, he thought it was good to work with the FBI, because due to contacts, now was flying to L.A. Minutes seemed like hours but at this moment he realized that he was desperate to be with her, that without thinking, just impulsively guided, Frank was in a plane and flying end to end of the country. –What am I gonna tell her when I see her? How is she going to react? Why am I doing this madness? These were the questions that went through his head as he reached his destination. Chapter 2 She couldn't sleep well because she was worried, too many things to think, besides, her left foot started to hurt a bit. She opened her eyes, -How you doing Rach? Frank approaches to her. She can´t believe what she hears, what she sees. Did he just call her \"Rach\"? The only thing that comes from her mouth is –Frank! Her heart starts to beat very strong and for a moment, she forgets how to breath till Frank says to her, -It wasn´t a good idea, was it? Before they can exchange words, Shelley, Rachel´s cousin, enter the room hospital and say –Oh well, well honey how you feel? There are some silent minutes and then Rachel, still watching Frank, answers her –I´m just feeling alright girl, how´s Tony, Henry and Louis? Shelley tells her that they have little injuries, nothing to worry about. Then, Fletcher shouts of surprise and runs to Frank who finally moves and picks him up getting a strong hug from him –Frank, how good you´re here! I missed you a lot. Farmer feels great with that emotive welcome and kiss the little boy´s head. –I missed you more Fletch. Rachel look at them and a tear runs through her cheek, she doesn´t know if that´s happiness or nervousness. –Okay boys, time to left the room. I´m gonna help Rachel to get prepared and go out of here. Frank´s hands shakes a little, his heart is beating a lot and he begins to remove his sweater. -I heard you had an accident, was nearby and decided to come. Bill, Tony and Louis were talking with Frank when Rachel and her cousin met them out of the room. Of course the ex-bodyguard and the famous singer had many questions to make each other but it wasn´t the time or place. Frank offered to carry Rachel, because now she was in a wheelchair. –Thank you Frank, you´re so kind. When they disposed to leave the hospital, the doctor who treated Rachel, came and told her –Take care of yourself and also the … Oh.. well you know. Nobody heard those words (Bill, Tony, Louis, the cousin and Fletcher were distracted by the people and reporters waiting outside) but Frank, Frank was so sufficiently near to hear the words.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 She couldn't sleep well because she was worried, too many things to think, besides, her left foot started to hurt a bit. She opened her eyes, -How you doing Rach? Frank approaches to her. She can´t believe what she hears, what she sees. Did he just call her \"Rach\"? The only thing that comes from her mouth is –Frank! Her heart starts to beat very strong and for a moment, she forgets how to breath till Frank says to her, -It wasn´t a good idea, was it? Before they could exchange more words, Shelley, Rachel´s cousin, entered the room hospital and said \"Oh well, well honey how you feel?\" There are some silent minutes and then Rachel, still watching to Frank, answers her \"I´m feeling alright girl, how´s Tony, Henry and Louis?\" Shelley tells her that they have little injuries, nothing to worry about. Then, Fletcher shouts of surprise and runs to Frank who finally moves and picks him up getting a strong hug from him –Frank, how good you´re here! I missed you a lot.

I´m gonna help Rachel to get prepared and go out of here. Frank´s hands shakes a little, his heart is beating a lot and he begins to remove his sweater. \"I heard you had an accident, was nearby and decided to come\". Bill, Tony and Louis were talking with Frank when Rachel and her cousin met them out of the room. Of course the ex-bodyguard and the famous singer had many questions to make each other but it wasn´t the time or place. Frank offered to carry Rachel, because now she was in a wheelchair. \"Thank you Frank, you´re so kind\" She felt secure again around him. When they disposed to leave the hospital, the doctor who treated Rachel, came and told her \"Take care of yourself and also the … Oh.. well you know\". Nobody heard those words (Bill, Tony, Louis, the cousin and Fletcher were distracted by the people and reporters waiting outside) but Frank, Frank was sufficiently near to hear the words.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Once they passed through the crowd, Frank took Rachel in his arms and helped her to climb into the van. She felt his strong arms and remembered the time when they went out of the Mayan and now he did the same, but this time it felt different because he was embracing her very carefully. Before, Frank would have sat beside Henry but he was no longer her bodyguard, so he took his place in the back of the van with her, Fletcher and the cousin. \"So, you were her ex-bodyguard. Rachel why you didn´t tell me about Frank?\" Shelley spoke first and biting her lips, she looked him up and down. It was obvious she was flirting at him, Fletcher realized it but Rachel and Frank didn´t noticed it because they were looking at each other. Shelley was waiting for an answer and cleared her throat; it made Rachel blush and withdrew his gaze from Frank. That was the timid Rachel reaction, something that her ex-bodyguard saw few times but got him crazy, she looked so human and tender. But the diva quickly put on her mask and said \"Yes, he used to protect me. I have to tell you he is very talented\". \"¡He is the best bodyguard in the world and he taught me how to fix boats! Right Frank?\" said Fletcher hugging Frank, \"I´ll show you the things I´ve fix and the robots I created myself!\", he continued. Frank replied him \"Oh, I think you´re gonna be a great industrialist and inventor Fletch. You´ve always been a smart kid\". While touching his arm, Rachel said \"I'm grateful that you've motivated him to this Frank, he won a technological invention contest in his class\". Henry was listening to their conversation and asked Frank about his current life. As it was expected, Frank Farmer´s answers were short. But one thing that surprised everyone was that now he was working for the FBI. \"Seriously? I guess you´re in a great position, Frank\", said Tony. \"Kind of, I had an assignment to protect a priest but I got a good offer from the FBI and so I took it. Besides, being a bodyguard was getting tired for me\". At this statement, Rachel gave him a little and fake smile. \"By the way Farmer, have you heard Rachel´s latest song? It´s terrific and I think you´re going to love it! I know you´re not in the showbiz and knows nothing of it but I will always love you is heard everywhere\", said Tony and Frank replied \"Yeah, I guess it´s a good song\". Of course he heard it hundred times. That song became his favorite after they danced at the restaurant and the first time he heard it sung by Rachel, was perplexed and mesmerized. Rachel expected him to say \"Hey, it's the song we danced and you sang it\" or \"I love you too Rachel.\" But she just heard a \"Yeah, it's a good song.\" It meant nothing to him? Didn´t he know that she sang it especially for him? Rachel Marron was very disappointed.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 \"God, I´m starving. I had a little meal at the hospital and it wasn´t enough\" said Rachel while finishing her steak. \"Hey sweetheart, you have already interviews to give. E Entertainment wants to know what happened and right now I have arranged a phone call\" Shelley said then she got up, said goodbye to the guests and left. The whole scene was very bizarre to Rachel, she felt that Frank was so close yet so far at once. When they were in the van, they exchanged glances but now she noticed that he was trying to avoid her. \"Frank when did you go? asked Fletcher interrupting Rachel´s thoughts. Frank answered that as soon as he can, that he just wanted to know if they were OK. Fletcher grimaced and his face got sad. \"I´d like you to stay longer\". The sun was falling. \"Mommy I don´t wanna go to the pj´s party if you´re this way\" said Fletcher. Rachel was walking to her room by the help of Frank and her son, \"But baby, there will be a bonfire and all your friends expect you to go, my ankle is a little twisted, that's all. Got prepared, I already told Shelley to take you to the party\". Frank stopped and said \"I´ll take care of your mother, Fletch. Go and have fun\". They entered to Rachel´s room, son and mother said goodbye. Fletcher also said goodbye to Frank and the ex-bodyguard said to him \"We´ll see each other again, I promise.\" Rachel and Frank were finally alone; they were sat in her bed. Although the night was a little bit chilly, Rachel wore a little dress because it was easy to put (she had a splint on her left foot) and she also was wearing a jacket. She began to shiver, was not only cold but nerves. \"Good thing the accident didn´t came to worst! And I'm glad it wasn´t a fucking crazy fan\" Frank said calmly. \"Thank you for coming Frank, I really appreciate it. But… may I ask you something? Rachel put her hand on Frank´s arm. That touch and question made the ex-bodyguard got tense. \"You could´ve make a call to ask if I was alright, why did you come? The singer didn´t know that the man with her flew across the country to see her, she thought he was still living in L.A. Frank pondered the question, he didn´t want to tell her what he done, he was unsure about his feelings about her and also her feelings about him. \"Umm… Why should I call if I was so close to here?\" He felt stupid saying it, Rachel was silent for a minute and suddenly a tear rolled down her cheek. She tried to hide her face so that Farmer wouldn´t see. She was very confused because, what was the point that Frank has gone to the hospital to see her, that for a moment he behave friendly and seconds later was treating her like shit? She had set his heart on that song without intention to became success and his former bodyguard seemed not to have reacted to it. She wondered if he loved her or was another one of those bastards that because of money and fame, came to her. It was hard for her to think about this, because she knew that Frank was not that way, and that´s why she was in loved with him. But all his actions till now, say otherwise. \"Rach\" he softly wiped his tear with his finger, \"Rach\" he called her by the second time but she had her face looking down and then she felt a warm kiss in her cheek, then another one and he was getting closer to her. His arms surrounded her, his lips were in her neck and they tried to reach her mouth but she refused him. Farmer began stroking her back and put his lips into hers, he opened her mouth with his fingers and she couldn´t resist him anymore. As the kissing became more passionate, also caresses and hugs. She circled his neck with her arms and put his fingers in his hair. A warm hand was going through her waist and rose under her breast, touching it slowly. She began to unzip his jeans. Her nails dug into his body, Frank Farmer carefully lay her down and lifted her dress, he already felt his bottom began to heat up, to swell and he had to release it when Rachel, sighing, said \"I´m pregnant, I have three months\". He froze, closed his eyes and sat up. He saw her for a second and turned away. He stood like this for a while and finally said \"I can´t do this\". Rachel couldn´t believe it and started to cry \"Oh my God, I should´ve knew it! How stupid I am, I mean, I thought you were in lo… (she cut the word and sat in the bed). Why the hell you came Frank? She yelled at him. \"I don´t want…\" he tried to say but was interrupted by her \"This reminds me exactly to Fletcher´s fath…\" Farmer took a deep breath \"For God sake. I don´t want to make love with you because I don´t wanna hurt you nor our baby!\" She was petrified, her eyes full of anger began to sweeten. Frank knelt in front of her, he took her hands \"So, we´re gonna have a baby?\" Rachel smiled. Frank put his hands around her waist and gave a soft kiss to her belly. \"Forgive me, I have just made you cry. When did you know this? Why you didn´t tell me Rachel?\" With the sleeve of his sweater wiped her tears. Sobbing, she said \"First I thought it was the stress of going up and down due to my tour, that my body got unbalance and two weeks ago I decided to go to the doctor to give me some tranquilizer pills. Then I found I was pregnant. Oh Frank, I still can´t believe it. I was so nervous, insecure but so happy. I haven´t told anyone about this, I do not know how, you know what I mean? At this point in my career and you were already out of my life. This is too much!\" she finally said. All this information caught him off guard, Frank didn´t know exactly how to react or what to say to Rachel, he even didn´t know if she wanted to have the baby. He often wondered if \"this thing\" was love or too much of physical attraction. Having a baby with this superstar when he didn´t even know if he felt love for her and vice versa? But at the same time, the image of a baby with her made him very happy. He always wanted to have a family but never find the time. \"Rachel, this caught me off guard, in my plans there was no babies\" and before she could reply to this, he kept saying \"But I do want to have this baby. Would you do the same? Rachel put her hand on Frank´s, who was stroking her belly \"Our daughter wasn´t in my plans, but when I knew of her, I realized that I loved her\". \"Oh my God, and the accident. If something would have happened…\" he said as he dipped his head into Rachel´s body. \"Wait, you said our daughter?\" he reacted. \"Yes, I feel it´s a girl. She will be your princess!\" and she ran her fingers over his hair. \"If that´s so, we will be just perfect. Fletcher and me, two strong men and you two, the most beautiful ladies on earth. By the way, does Fletcher know about this?\" Frank sat beside Rachel, and started to kiss her, this time with less passion but with more love and sweetness. \"I haven´t yet told Fletcher\" she said.[Chapter 5] It´s been almost a month since my last chapter. I´m very sorry and I apologize to all of you… so very sorry. Real life is getting hard and I had no time for this. I´m really ashamed but here you are Chapter 5. And I also started with Chapter 6. Thank you very much for your reviews! Chapter 5 It was morning and Rachel woke up, she expected to find Frank at her side. She didn´t realized when she got sleep but she knew it was in his arms; now there was no trace of her ex-bodyguard. She was trying to get up while the door was opening slowly, Rachel saw some balloons entering the room and quickly she covered part of her face the same way she did once when Frank was breaking up with her on their first date. \"Oh he is so sweet\" she thought but when the man holding the balloons was not Frank the singer was surprised. It was John Harris, her boyfriend. John was a very good looking guy and Rachel knew him even before Frank started to work for her. The thing Rachel loved the most about John was his humor: he always cheered her up. After the \"the Framer thing\" (like Sy used to name their relation), Rachel was devastated and John was there to support her. \"There you are my little flower. I called Bill last night and he told me that you were O.K. I couldn´t get out of that reunion, you know what the guys would´ve said if I was to tell them that I have to leave them. The party was great! Besides I would have to travel many hours to come here\" John was trying to find a place to put the big arrangement of flowers and all the balloons he brought for her. He thought that she wouldn´t complain of his oblivion with all these presents. The true was that Rachel did feel angry at him, she had an accident and he was just two hours away… and surely he was drunk that night. If the situation would have been another, at this time she would be screaming at him but Frank had appeared in her life. \"I need to talk to you John\" said she. \"Oh yeah my girl, say what you want but first I´m gonna kiss that beautiful face of you\". John became very heavy when drinking and started to kiss her and hold her very strong that she was feeling pain. \"Stop John, I can´t breathe\" she said laughing while trying to push him but he was stronger and didn´t give up. Frank didn´t spend the night in Rachel´s house. He stayed at a nearby hotel but decided to go and bid her good morning. This was the proper time to talk to her and expose his feelings. He bought a beautiful bouquet, he knew that although she was a superstar, she was simple and this little present will cheer her up. If Bill would have been in the house, he would´ve prevented Frank his meeting with John. But no impediments were for Frank to get into the house and into Rachel´s room. Frank felt his knees bent, his heart stopped and that there was not enough oxygen in his lungs. His breath must have sounded very strong because the couple lying in the bed turned their eyes toward Frank. \"Get off me\" Rachel reproached to John and desperately told Frank \"Let me explain you Frank, please!\" But the almost petrified man turned around and walked away. He threw the flowers on the floor. \"Oh fuck… Look what you´ve done John. It was Frank!\" Rachel tried to stand up but felt pain. \"You mean, Frank, Frank your… the…\" John was helping her to find her slippers. \"Yesss… the man itself!... Hurry and try to fetch him!\" John ran to the window and shouted \"I´m gay! Hey Frank, I´m gay do you hear that?\" but it was too late because Frank was far enough away and didn´t hear the scream. John returned to the bed and said \"God damn it. I lost my opportunity to meet the hottie one\". He was very disappointed: \"I couldn´t see him, your big head hindered me\". Rachel rolled her eyes and with a bit of effort went into the bath. Rachel was already taking a shower and John couldn´t believe what had happened. \"He is gonna think that you are my lover\" Rachel said and her voice started to crack \"He came to see if I was alright. If I was alright! But now this… and you know what´s the worst? I´m pregnant and he might think that the baby is yours!\" John jumped of surprise \"Are you pregnant Rachel Marron? Of his baby? Oh my God when all this happen?\" He could hear that she was sobbing. No words came from her. Finally she came out of the bath and her eyes were red. \"Oh sweety you have never been this emotional. You are for surely pregnant! Come and tell me how it happened\" John helped Rachel to beautify her while she was recover her voice \"Well, I don´t need to tell you how it happened… but yesterday he came to the hospital. Frank accompanied us to the house, he was speechless at first but when we came to my room, he started to kiss me! The things were going hotter so I have to stop it… I said to him that I was pregnant. He didn´t know how to react but he said to me that the news caught him off guard, that in his plans were no babies\". John interrupted her \"What the hell, he is such an asshole\" \"But then he said that he wanted to have this baby with me and that Fletcher, the baby girl he and me would make a perfect match\" \"And what the deuce we are doing in here. Let´s find him!\" said John hugging his best friend.[Chapter 6] Things between Rach and Frank are getting harder! It´s a short one but I hope you enjoy it Chapter 6 Rachel asked Henry to take her to Frank´s house. John insisted to go with her but she said that it was better for him to stay. \"C´mon sweetheart I have to meet him. You´ve been talking to me about this guy all this months and now you don´t want me to go\". It was true, Rachel cried at his shoulder during months and it was unfair for him. \"Alright babe, just because you were there for me and I have a big heart. Besides, I need someone to help me, my ankle still hurt\". They were climbing into the van when Shelley came across and asked them where they were going. \"To fetch the hottie\" said John with a big smile. \"For God sake Rachel, you know you can´t go out. You have an appointment at 12:00 with Oprah… remember? You´ll talk about your terrible accident. And then of your new album\". Rachel and John were already accommodated in the van. \"And who the hell is the \"hottie?\" \"I promise you I´ll be by there at 12:00, just let me go and get my man\" Rachel said waving her hand to her cousin. \"Oh my God I´m so nervous. Is just that I want everything to be perfect\". Rachel get off of the van and walk to the very well-known house of Frank. Two knocks and a gorgeous blond woman opened the door. Who was this woman? What was she doing in there… in Frank´s house? \"Hi, may I help you?\" said the woman. Rachel was astonished and insecure \"Uhm, is there Frank Farmer?\" \"Sorry, this is the Thompson´s house. We moved here three months ago. Mr. Farmer sold us the house\". Rachel was very disappointed, she didn´t knew that Frank was not living here anymore. \"Do you know where can I find him?\" The blond was looking at her very curiously. \"Have you ever been told you look a lot like Rachel Marron?\" \"Yeah, all the time\" was the singer reply. \"Sorry, you are just like her. And no, we don´t know where is Mr. Farmer new address\". The two ladies say goodbye and Rachel climbed into the van. John was waiting for her \"And so?\" It was a hard day for Rachel. Going up and down with the three interviews she had, her ankle, the pregnancy discomforts but above all, that she couldn´t find Frank and explain him, was killing her. She was finally at home and Fletcher ran to her when she entered the house. \"Mommy where is Frank? He promised me we will spend a time together\" Rachel took his hand and told him that Frank was upset with her because maybe he believed that John was her boyfriend. \"But he is gay\" was Fletcher´s reply. \"Oh Fletch it was a misunderstanding and I don´t know where Frank is\" Rachel started to cry. She couldn´t help it, but it was her hormones in action. \"Mommy we will find him, please don´t cry. He will understand\". At meal, Rachel just watched her soup. She tasted only some bites. Soon, all the house knew what had happened with the ex-bodyguard. But just John knew about the pregnancy. Bill and Fletcher were very worried of Rachel, she was very sad and pale but she didn´t want to talk to. She stood up quickly and went to threw up. When she return to the table the old lady who prepared the meal said \"Oh ma'am, this man seems to make you sick\". If they would know that in fact, Frank Farmer was the one who indirectly made her \"sick\" in body and soul. … For the next chapter, I want to explore how does Frank feel about the situation. Please, let me know if you like it or if I should stop! Thank you all P.D. I try to improve my English… Sorry for the mistakes![Chapter 7] Chapter 7 That night Frank Farmer was incredulousness, he couldn´t believe what had happened. He was about to have a baby with Rachel Marron. Not only \"Rachel\" the woman he desired and loved, but with the huge star and diva. He didn´t spend the night with Rachel because he had to think so many things alone. Certainly he wasn´t prepared for having a relationship with an actress. God, if she would only be a simple girl: a teacher, lawyer, doctor… anything but no a public figure. And now the idea of being a dad! He was living in the other side of the country and had a lot of work. He didn´t care for money, he had a considerable amount for all of those very well payments and never spent the money because he was single and didn´t have obsessions. Farmer was in his hotel room holding his head. There was only one person to whom he could trust all his worries, it was his father. It was too late but Frank knew that his father was awake: \"Hey dad, how are you?\" Herb answered by the second ring \"Frank are you all right?\" his voice showed a concern. Frank could sense it and quickly responded \"Oh don´t be alarmed dad, I´m alright… well…\" and he hung the sentence. \"Something very important should be happening for you to call me at this hour of the morning son. Tell me, what is it?\" Frank was hesitating and after some silent seconds he resolved to say \"Dad, Rachel is going to have a baby\". His father was waiting for him to continue, but not hearing anything he said \"Rachel? That beautiful girl you brought with you the last winter? Her sister Nicki and little Fletcher? She should be very happy. If you were more intelligent you would have had her. I saw how she gazed at you. If I were you, I wouldn´t have let her go. But you are such a case son and now you are regretting. That´s life, you let it go and might never come back!\" Frank patiently waited for his father to finish his sermon, he closed his eyes \"Dad, the baby is mine!\" \"God Lord Frank, why didn´t you go to the point? Those are great news son, I was thinking very seriously in adopting a little boy as my grandson. Finally I´m going to be a grandfather!... But… you don´t sound very happy Frank. What´s so?\" Frank smiled at his father reply, the old man had a sense of humor \"I´m very happy indeed dad, is just that, that I don´t know how am I supposed to do this. She is in showbiz, she is in the top of her career and many people put their eyes on her, and you know that I don´t like that. I have always been in the shadows of important famous people, not in the spotlight!\" There was a pause \"Do you love her?\" Herb said. \"I think so. She is a sweet girl, she cares for people but sometimes she is so stubborn and spoiled. Rachel has the most beautiful smile I have ever seen; even when she is crying she is truly an angel\". His father was laughing at this \"Oh well, that sounds like a man in love but listen son, you must be sure that you love each other. If you have a strong love, nothing will separate\". Herb was a phenomenal father; he made his son to have confidence. Frank Farmer was still concerned but now was smiling, he had made his decision: he will tell Rachel that he loves her with all his heart. … This was a short chapter but I wanted to get into Frank´s thoughts... Did I achieve it? Or what you think would have been Frank´s thoughts at this? The next chapter, Rachel team is going to do everything to seek \"the hottie\" Frank Farmer. Any critics are welcomed! Thank you[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 \"So, now you are gonna tell me what´s going on girl\" said Shelley who was approaching to Rachel. The singer was sited in a comfortable chair near the pool. She didn´t want her cousin to know about her pregnancy nor \"the Farmer thing\", Rachel did love her but she knew that Shelly would disapprove Frank as did with Robert, the boyfriend who left her while Rachel was pregnant with Fletcher. \"Hey kiddo. You win, be sited and I´ll tell you everything. Frank Farmer was the bodyguard who got shot in the Oscars, do you remember? Well, while he was working for me, we had some chemistry: we flirt a little and had a date. He took me to dance and the song that was playing in that place was I will always love you. After he got shot we had to separate, I felt that that song was just perfect for us and I sang it for him. And I was very surprised when he came to the hospital because I thought that he had already forgotten me. When we came home and he helped me to get to my room, he told me that he loved me. Do you believe that?\" It wasn´t true, Frank had never told Rachel he loved her and she felt a kind of pain musing about this but her cousin must believe that everything was ok with this guy. Rachel was lying to herself and her cousin, but what could she do? She didn´t wanted to happen the same thing that with Fletcher´s father and she was sure that she will find Frank. \"You were saying that he loved you?...\" Rachel stood in silence and her cousin brought her into the earth. \"Oh yes, and this morning he came to my room with some flowers and in that precisely moment John was hugging me and kissing me. You know that sometimes he is very clingy! That´s why I went to seek for Frank but I didn´t succeed\" Shelley was open-mouthed \"Oh my… and he thought that you and John… poor Frank\". Bill shouted to Shelley \"Shell you got a phonecall\" and the cousin left. \"My honey I promise you I´ll find your daddy. He is the best man in earth and you are going to love him!\" Rachel said to her belly caressing it \"And I´m also gonna tell your brother about you. Just give me some time to work this out\". Fletcher came to her and interrupted the little talk that her mommy was having with his unborn sister \"To whom you´re talking with?\" said Fletcher embracing her mother. \"Oh I was thinking out loud Fletch\". \"Mommy I know how can we find Frank. We can call Frank´s dad and ask him his new address\" Her mother gave him a big kiss \"You are a very smart kid\". Rachel called to Herb \"Good afternoon Mr. Farmer I´m Rachel Marron, do you remember me?\" she said cheerfully. \"My sweetheart how are you? Good to hear you, I´m so happy for you… I´m speechless and believe me, you have made me the happiest man on earth!\" When Rachel and her family spent the winter at Herb´s house, the old man never referred to Rachel as \"sweetheart\". She realized it. \"That´s so sweet of you, thank you. Fletcher and I always remember you and we hope you to be fine. The reason of my call is to know which is the new address of Frank\" Herb said to himself that his son was very strange because he didn´t say to Rachel his new address but he didn´t give a lot of importance to this. \"Ah yes, it is 2700 17th Street Northwest, Washington, DC\". She couldn´t believe her ears, did she heard well? \"Did you say Washington, DC?\" They exchanged some other friendly words and said goodbye. Rachel was sure that Frank was still living in L.A. and the worst thought crossed her mind, he had already returned home: far away from her and his baby. Before sleeping she called John and told him what she had found out just. She was sobbing and his friend said to her \"I did this mess and I´m gonna fix it my dear. Stop crying because the little baby girl in your stomach is getting upset too\". John would go to Washington, DC and explain the things to Frank. … How Frank is going to react when John appears in his house? Will he believe it? Oh, I didn´t expect this fanfic to be this long, is my first one and I don´t want to screw it. But I have more chapters in my mind… I warn you that there will be more drama but of course they´re gonna end together. I love them so much and I can´t imagine for them to be apart! Sorry I apologize once more for my lack of English, is just that Google Translate doesn´t help that much! ","Summary":" Chapter 1 Frank was very immersed solving a case of two ex-politicians who get involved with the de"},{"Movie":"Never Been Kissed","Title":"Truth about Josie","Author":"kitsune jewel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8802850","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (Disclaimer, I would like to give the credit to the real author Beth Mott since i didn't know who wrote this story before I couldn't give credit where credit was due. Thank You!) I have something to tell you. Josie's words still hung in the air as she looked up from turning off her camera and into Sam's emotion filled eyes. \"I have something to tell you too.\" He told her, his voice husky with feeling. Josie blushed and looked down at her feet for a moment before looking up and smiling at him. \"Can we go somewhere and talk?\" He asked softly. She nodded her head, then shyly asked. \"Can we finish this dance first?\" Giving her a warm smile he replied. \"I'd like that.\" She smiled back and he slid his arm further around her waist to pull her a little closer to him. Josie responded by lacing her fingers through his and giving his hand a gentle squeeze. They spent the rest of the song staring deeply into each other's eyes, their hearts racing with excitement. When the song ended both Sam and Josie felt a wave of mixed emotion wash over them. They were disappointed that the song was finished, yet at the same time they were excited about the conversation that they were about to have. \"Shall we go outside and talk?\" He asked as he led her off the dance floor, their fingers still intertwined. Josie nodded shyly and he gave her hand another quick squeeze before releasing it. Then taking her by the elbow he let her lead the way through the crowd to the door. They'd almost managed to escape unnoticed until they reached the 'in-crowd' table. Gibby, Kirstin and Kristen all looked up as Josie passed. \"Josie, where are you going?\" Gibby asked curiously, giving the other girl a friendly smile. \"Why don't you join us?\" \"Thanks, Gibby.\" Josie acknowledged, giving the three Barbie girls a polite smile. \"But I think I'm going to go get some air. It's kind of stuffy in here.\" \"Hey, we'll go with you!\" Kirstin volunteered, looking at the other girls for agreement. Josie tried to suppress her grin as she felt Sam's grip on her elbow tighten in alarm at Kirstin's suggestion. She could also tell he was holding his breath as he awaited her reply. \"That's okay, Kirstin. I appreciate the offer, but Mr. Coulson and I have something to discuss about my college application anyway.\" \"But it's Prom.\" Kristen complained, giving both of them a pleading look. \"Can't that wait until tomorrow?\" Josie felt her patience waning with these three, but keeping her lid on her temper she said. \"Don't worry, the night's still young. I'll be back shortly. Besides, I'm curious to hear what Mr. Coulson has to say.\" She felt a tingle of excitement shoot through her as Sam squeezed her elbow again. \"Okay, but don't be too long.\" Gibby pouted slightly. \"Guy will be looking for you soon.\" Now it was Sam's turn to feel Josie tense at the mention of her date. \"Don't worry, I'll be back before he even misses me.\" She commented after glancing over to where he was dancing with Sera. Looking back at the trio she smiled and said \"Excuse us\" before heading for the door. \"Poor Josie.\" Gibby sighed, watching her friend disappear through the door. \"Imagine being forced to discuss college on Prom night.\" The other two added their agreement before turning their attention back to the party around them. \"Josie!\" As soon as Josie stepped outside the door of the country club she heard someone call her name. Turning towards the sound of the voice she saw George rushing towards her. \"What is it, George?\" \"We lost the feed!\" He quickly told her. \"Gus is going nuts!\" He stopped suddenly when Sam appeared through the doors and stood beside Josie. \"Tell Gus that I must be experiencing some technical difficulties with the feed...\" She told George seriously. \"But Josie…\" The Black man tried to interject but she cut him off. \"Tell him that I must be experiencing some technical difficulties with the feed and that you'll try to get my attention as soon as possible so you can fix it.\" \"But Josie…\" \"Tell him George.\" She told him firmly. \"But don't tell him more than that.\" When he looked unconvinced she softened her tone and added, her eyes begging him to understand. \"Please?\" George noticed that Josie had wrapped her hand protectively around Sam's arm and that Sam had placed his other hand over hers. He fought back the smile that wanted to break over his face as he realized what was going on. Secretly thrilled that Josie was finally taking matters into her own hands he only nodded and released an exaggerated sigh of resignation. \"Okay, I'll tell him. But I want your 'technical difficulties' cleared up in ten minutes and you back on the air. After all, its Gus who signs the paychecks, not you.\" \"Thanks, George.\" Josie gave him a grateful smile. Reaching over he squeezed her arm and grinned. \"You go girl.\" As George walked away, Sam turned to Josie and asked in confusion. \"What was that all about?\" Josie closed her eyes and took a deep breath. There was no turning back now. \"Mind if we sit? I promise I'll tell you everything.\" \"Sure.\" He nodded and led her to a stone bench so they could sit down. Once they were settled he looked at her expectantly. \"So, who's George and Gus and what's all this about 'technical difficulties'?\" Josie closed her eyes again for a moment, trying to collect her racing thoughts. When she opened them again she found him looking at her with concern in his beautiful eyes. Swallowing slightly she began. \"Before I tell you what's going on, will you promise me something?\" \"Anything.\" He assured her, reaching over to take her hand in his. \"Name it.\" \"Promise me that no matter what your initial reaction is to what I have to say, you'll give me a chance to explain.\" Her eyes looked into his pleadingly. \"Promise me.\" His heart sped up when she saw the intensity of emotion in her eyes. \"I promise.\" Josie put her free hand over the one that held her other hand and took a deep breath. \"I'm not a high school student. I'm an undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times.\" \"A reporter?\" Sam repeated in surprise. Josie nodded and quickly related her history. \"I graduated from high school eight years ago, then I attended Northwestern for three years majoring in English Literature and Journalism. I've been working as a copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times for the last five years, but my greatest goal has always been to be a reporter. I kept pitching story ideas to Gus, he's my editor, hoping to get a chance to prove I could do it. But anytime he liked one of my ideas he always gave it to another reporter. I was beginning to feel that my dream wouldn't come true. Then one day Mr. Rigfort, our publisher, decided that he wanted to do an undercover story on high school kids today and he gave the assignment to me, I guess because I looked young enough to be a high school student. Well, I was excited and terrified all at once. My first high school experience was a nightmare and I was sure that this one would be the same.\" Seeing the questioning look in Sam's eyes she quickly said. \"But that's another story. I promise I'll tell you about it sometime, but not now. Not here.\" When Sam nodded in agreement she continued her story. \"My first few weeks at South Glen South were not much better than my years in high school.\" She smiled at him and squeezed his hand. \"Though your class always made my day.\" He smiled back at her and put his free hand over the one she had placed over his. \"After three weeks undercover and no story Gus felt could be used, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He had George set me up with a hidden camera and microphone.\" She freed one hand and pointed to the wings pin on her dress. \"You've been filming me?\" His eyebrows raised in alarm. Josie nodded her head sadly. \"You and everyone else too.\" Clasping his hand again with her free one she exclaimed adamantly. \"I didn't want to and I felt so awful about doing it, but I had no choice. Rigfort had made it very clear that if I botched up this assignment both my job and Gus' were on the line.\" \"So why are you telling me all this now?\" He asked curiously. \"Aren't you risking your job by telling me the truth?\" \"I had to tell you.\" She told him, her tone full of emotion. \"I wasn't going to let Gus hurt you.\" \"Why would Gus want to hurt me?\" Sam asked in surprise. \"I don't even know him.\" Josie dropped her eyes down to their hands, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. \"He thinks that you're attracted to me so he wants to jump on this stupid idea of 'Student/Teacher Relationships – How Close is Too Close?' I told him I wasn't going to do it, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. He's already pitched it to Rigfort who loves the idea. But I won't do it!\" She looked back to his face and added firmly. \"I'm not going to hurt you like that and I won't let Gus hurt you either. I'll hand in my resignation first!\" Sam was surprised by the intensity of Josie's tone. Examining her face for a moment he finally asked, his tone husky with emotion. \"You would quit your job and give up your dream of being a reporter to protect me from your boss?\" \"In a heartbeat.\" Josie whispered truthfully as she squeezed his hands tightly in hers. Sam flashed her a warm smile. \"You are definitely amazing, Josie Geller.\" When she had first told him that she wasn't a seventeen-year-old high school student but an undercover reporter his first reaction was to be hurt at her deception. But as she revealed the events that led up to her current situation his feelings of hurt soon turned to those of compassion, understanding and then love. He realized that she hadn't wanted to deceive him, it was just the dictates of her job that had been responsible for the charade. And the fact that she was willing to risk her job and her dream to protect him from Gus, his unknown adversary, made him forgive her all the more. Looking deeply into her expectant eyes he commented gently. \"I guess there's really only one question left for me to ask.\" He paused for a moment as she watched him carefully. \"How old are you?\" Josie giggled slightly as a wave of relief spread over her. \"I'm twenty-five.\" She informed him. Sam closed his eyes tightly for a moment as joy and relief spread over him. \"Thank you.\" He whispered softly to himself. When he opened his eyes he found Josie looking at him curiously. Smiling shyly at her he explained his reaction to her answer. \"I've been wishing for weeks that you weren't my seventeen year old student but that you were older and more experienced with life.\" He couldn't help the excited grin that broke over his face as he continued. \"Josie, I have been aching for weeks to tell you how much I love you.\" \"You l-love me?\" She stammered in surprised. When he nodded her next words came out choked with sobs as tears sprang into her eyes. \"I hoped you would, but I never thought it was possible. I didn't think there was any chance someone as wonderful as you could care for someone like me.\" \"Someone like you?\" He repeated in surprise, finding it incredible that she didn't seem to realize her own wonderful qualities. \"Josie, you are the most amazing, intelligent, incredible woman I have ever met. You're smart, you're funny and you are so beautiful that I feel breathless just looking at you.\" \"Really?\" She questioned, still finding it hard to believe that he was really saying these wonderful things about her. \"Really.\" He assured her. \"I'm absolutely crazy about you.\" \"I love you too.\" She told him sincerely. \"I've loved you from the first day I met you.\" Now it was Sam's turn to be surprised. \"Really?\" She reached up and touched his cheek tenderly. \"Really.\" He smiled at her for a moment before leaning forward and gently pressing his lips to hers. Josie responded to his kiss by wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing him back. They were so engrossed in their kiss that they didn't even notice that they were no longer alone. Rob quickly scanned the courtyard looking for his sister and Mr. Coulson. He'd heard Gibby tell Guy that the two of them had gone outside to get some air and discuss Josie's college application. Knowing that Josie wasn't going to college Rob had a feeling that the conversation probably involved more than just Dartmouth. Quickly he had offered to go find Josie for Guy, leaving the Prom King to dance with Tracie. When his eyes fell upon the kissing pair on the stone bench he was glad that he'd been the one to find them and not Guy. \"Rob!\" The young man turned to find George rushing towards him, an anxious look on his face. \"What is it, George?\" He asked, concern filling him at the other man's serious look. \"I need you to help me get Josie back on the air.\" George told him urgently. \"Gus said that if her 'technical difficulties' were not cleared up in the next five minutes he is going to come down here himself and fix everything.\" \"I'll talk to her.\" Rob promised, then in a somewhat pleading tone he asked. \"Please don't tell Gus what's really going on. I don't want him ruining things for Josie. I've never seen her so happy.\" George gave him a reassuring smile knowing of Rob's fierce loyalty for his sister. \"Don't worry, Slugger. Her secret's safe with me. I happen to be a romantic at heart.\" \"Thanks, George.\" Rob gave him a big smile. \"We both appreciate it.\" \"You just get your sister back on tape.\" Was the other man's parting words. As the other man moved off Rob turned his attention back to his sister and Mr. Coulson. They were still heavily engrossed in their kiss. Hating to be the one to interrupt them, but knowing that Josie's job was at stake if he didn't, he cleared his throat, trying to alert the couple of his presence. After the third try he finally got Sam's attention. The look on his face when he saw Rob standing beside them was absolutely priceless. It was a look that Rob would tease him about for years to come. \"This is not what it looks like.\" The English teacher quickly tried to assure Rob, greatly worried about what the other man must be thinking about what he'd just witnessed. \"I can explain.\" Rob contemplated for a brief second about giving Sam a hard time about kissing his sister, but he decided the wiser course was to reassure the distressed man. After all, it was highly likely he was going to be his brother-in-law one of these days. \"It's okay, Mr. C.\" Rob quickly assured him. \"I expected something like this when I came looking for the two of you. That's why I told Guy I'd come find you instead of letting him do it.\" Looking from Sam's surprised expression to Josie's glowing one he ventured. \"I take it he knows the truth.\" When Josie nodded in confirmation her brother quickly relayed George's message. \"We've got to get you back on the air before Gus has a heart attack. George says he's threatening to come down here.\" \"What are we going to do?\" Josie asked him with wide worried eyes. \"We are going to get you back on the air.\" Rob told her seriously. \"And we're going to do it in such a way that Gus isn't going to suspect that you were aware of the problem with the transmission.\" \"How are we going to do that?\" She asked, her eyes filling with more worry. She didn't regret cutting the transmission and telling Sam everything about what's been going on, but she didn't know how she'd ever get away with pretending the 'difficulties' with the feed were real. Rob thought for a moment, a grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. Looking at her with dancing eyes he said. \"I've got a plan.\" \"Should I be worried?\" She asked, her own lips tugging in knowing expectation. \"Not at all.\" He assured her innocently. \"This is what we'll do. The three of us will go back inside. Mr. Coulson will loose himself in the crowd while you and I hit the dance floor. We'll pretend we're in the middle of a conversation, perhaps 'rehashing' the last few minutes, when your camera will suddenly start to work again. Hopefully our 'recap' will satisfy Gus as to what happened over the last few minutes.\" \"But when I shut if off, I had just told Mr. Coulson…\" She looked at Sam and blushed slightly \"…Sam…\" He flashed her a warm smile and reached over to squeeze her hand as she continued. \"…that I wanted to tell him something.\" \"Okay, that's no problem.\" Rob assured her. \"We'll say something about Guy cutting in on you just as you were about to tell him about…what were you discussing when you said that you wanted to tell him something?\" \"I had just asked Josie if she had given anymore thought to Dartmouth.\" Sam supplied. \"Perfect.\" Rob grinned. \"Guy interrupted you before you could tell Mr. C. about your college plans.\" He winked mischievously at her. \"Though we know that wasn't what you wanted to tell him.\" Josie blushed again at his teasing. \"I don't know Rob. I'm so sick of all this lying and deception, pretending to be something I'm not.\" \"Jos, listen to me.\" He crouched down beside her and took her free hand in both of his, his eyes searching hers intently. \"You are a great writer and you will make one hell of a reporter. All you need is to master this assignment. Don't you want to prove to Gus and Rigfort and all those losers from high school that you can do this, that you can get your story and be a success?\" \"Of course I do!\" She told him, her eyes tearing up. \"Well then, let's do it!\" He gave her shoulder a light punch. \"Don't worry, I'm right behind you. I'll help you through this.\" \"We both will.\" Sam echoed, squeezing her hand tightly in his. Josie looked from Rob to Sam, tears dotting her cheeks. \"I am so lucky to have you both.\" She squeezed their hands tightly. \"And I'm lucky to have you.\" Sam told her earnestly, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and pulling her to him for a quick hug. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She returned, planting a light kiss on his cheek. \"Come on, Jos, we have to get this show on the road.\" Rob urged uncomfortably. He hated breaking up his sister and her new love. When the three of them rose to their feet, Josie turned to her brother and wrapped her arms around his neck. \"I love you too, Rob. You're the greatest.\" \"Hey, better be careful, Jos, you're going to make Mr. C. jealous.\" Rob teased as he hugged her tightly back. Josie smiled and slowly released her brother. Turning to look at Sam she said. \"I suppose I should introduce you two properly.\" \"No, wait, let me guess.\" Sam stopped her before she could continue. \"He's a twenty-five year old undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times.\" \"Actually I'm only twenty-three.\" Rob corrected. \"And I don't even read the Sun-Times let alone work for them.\" Holding out his hand to Sam he introduced. \"My name is Rob Geller.\" \"Geller?\" Sam raised his eyebrows in confusion and looked at the pair before him. He felt his heart constrict slightly at the news. Realizing what Sam must be thinking Josie quickly clarified. \"My brother.\" \"Your brother?\" Sam's relieved smiled nearly split his face. \"He's your brother?\" \"For the last twenty-three years.\" Rob told him proudly as he flung an arm around Josie's shoulders. \"That's what our parents say anyway.\" Josie teased, shooting her brother a sly look. \"Personally I think he was switched at birth.\" \"Oh Josephine you cut me to the heart.\" Rob placed a hand over his heart and staggered slightly like he'd been stabbed. \"You nut!\" Josie laughed as she slapped his arm playfully. \"Hey, don't hit me!\" Rob exclaimed in mock-annoyance. Then with a wicked glint in his eye he threatened. \"Or else I'll tell Mr. C. about your high school nickname.\" \"Rob, don't you dare!\" She exclaimed in alarm. \"Well than quit beating up on me and get yourself back on the air before Gus comes down here and skins both our hides.\" Rob said as he started to usher her towards the country club. \"I thought you weren't scared of Gus.\" Josie commented, giving him an amused look. \"I'm not – as long as he's on one side of the city and I'm on the other.\" Rob shuddered slightly and added. \"In person that man's scarier than Attila the Hun.\" Both Sam and Josie laughed at the look on Rob's face as he ushered Josie inside. \"Okay, I want you to start laughing like I'm in the middle of telling you a funny story.\" \"I can't do that, Rob.\" Josie exclaimed in despair. \"I'm not an actress.\" \"Come on, Jos.\" Rob encouraged seriously. \"Don't make me get dirty.\" He emphasized his point by gently poking her in the side. Josie jumped slightly and giggled. \"Don't Rob!\" She pushed his hand away from her side. \"Why shouldn't I?\" He asked, poking her in the side again. Josie laughed harder, expectation making her giddy as his finger continued to hover at her side. When her laughter became almost hysterical Rob quickly cued. \"Turn on the camera and follow my lead.\" Continue to laugh Josie reached up and turned on the camera. \"…and that's not all,\" Rob started saying as the camera came to life. \"After that he…\" He leaned forward as if to whisper something in her ear and poked her in the side to make her laugh. Josie let out a boisterous laugh, then reached out and clamped a hand over her mouth. She glanced around to see if anyone had paid attention to her outburst, but all the rest of the crowd seemed to be engrossed in their own partner. The only person she made eye contact with was Sam, who was standing by the dessert table holding a plate with a piece of chocolate cake. It was the piece that she had set down earlier when he'd asked her to dance. She flashed him a bright smile before turning her attention back to what Rob has said. \"He didn't do that!\" she exclaimed, managing to sound genuinely shocked. \"Scouts honor!\" He said, his eyes sparkling with mischief. Josie rolled her eyes and then changed the subject. \"Oh, Rob, this had been such a wonderful night. I can't believe I'm here. It's everything I dreamed my prom would be like.\" \"I'd say you're the belle of the ball, Josie.\" Rob commented proudly. \"You're the Prom Queen, you're one of the most popular girls here and your dance card has been full all evening. You even have guys fighting over dancing with you.\" He chuckled slightly. \"You should have seen the look on your face when Guy cut in on you and Mr. Coulson. You looked completely surprised. Mr. C. on the other hand looked a little disappointed. What were you two talking about anyway?\" Josie's eyes widened momentarily in panic. The moment had come. She knew she had to sound convincing or else Gus would suspect that something was up. She felt Rob squeeze her hand encouragingly and forced herself to speak. She was surprised at how calm her tone sounded. It completely belied her racing heart. \"We were talking about college. He asked me if I had given anymore thought to Dartmouth. I told you that he had gotten me an interview with the admissions guy there.\" Rob nodded in confirmation. \"Well, I was going to tell him that I had decided to try Northwestern so that I could stay close to home and my family. But Guy kind of interrupted us and I didn't get a chance to tell him.\" \"Oh, I'm sure you'll get a chance to tell him.\" Rob told her confidently. \"I'm sure you'll get a chance to tell him everything.\" Josie's eyes widened and she shook her head at him warningly. But he was undeterred. \"I think you two would be good for each other. You both have a lot in common, and I wouldn't mind having him as a brother-in-law.\" \"Rob…\" She warned her eyes flashing nervously. \"Don't worry, sis, I'm not about to blow your cover, and I'm not suggesting you do it either. Gus would likely kill me if I did.\" Looking right into Josie's camera he grinned and prompted. \"Wouldn't you, Gus?\" He grinned wider as he pictured Gus replying 'You'd better believe it, Geller'. Turning his attention back to his sister he continued. \"I guess I'm just hoping that you'll find happiness one day, and Mr. Coulson seems to make you happy.\" \"Thanks, Rob.\" Josie gave him a big smile, her tone a little choked from emotion. \"I appreciate that.\" \"You're my big sister, Jos and I care about you.\" He admitted honestly. \"All I've ever wanted was to see you happy. And if Sam Coulson makes you happy then you should go for it. I only hope he'll understand all this when it's all over.\" \"Me too.\" She agreed a little sadly. Taking a deep breath she added, for the benefit of the camera, especially Gus. \"He's just so wonderful, Rob! I don't want to loose him if there's any chance that he cares for me too.\" \"I think he does care for you Josie.\" Rob replied seriously. \"I think he cares for you very much.\" \"I hope so.\" She said, then sadly added. \"Not that it'll matter in the long run. The story Gus wants me to do has basically ruined any chance I have with him. There's no way he'll forgive me if I create a scandal about him. I just wish I could come up with another story. One that won't hurt and humiliate the man of my dreams. The only man who's ever made me feel special, complete.\" \"Don't worry, Jos.\" Her brother comforted kindly. \"You'll get through this. We'll think of something.\" \"You'll help me?\" She asked, her tone full of hope. \"Of course I will.\" He assured her with a bright smile. \"We are brother and sister after all. We stick together no matter what.\" \"Thanks, Rob.\" As the song ended she put her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly. \"You're the greatest brother in the world.\" \"I know.\" He teased as he hugged her back, causing her to slap him playfully in the back of the head. A voice behind them interrupted their embrace. \"Hey, Rob! What are you doing with my Queen?\" The Geller siblings parted and turned towards Guy and Tracie. Guy slipped his arm around Josie's waist and commented teasingly to Rob. \"Get your own girl, this one is already spoken for.\" Josie blushed hotly and glanced over to where Sam was still standing by the dessert table watching them. She couldn't help but smile when he caught the jealous look in his eye as he watched her with Guy. The arm around her waist gave her a light squeeze drawing her attention back to her younger companion. \"Want to dance, Beautiful?\" Guy asked her warmly. Josie gave him a shy smile and nodded in approval. \"Rufus!\" He smiled back. He took her hand and turned towards the dance floor. But before taking a step he turned back to Rob and said. \"By the way, there's a few of us going down to the lake after Prom to party. You and Tracie are welcome to come if you like. Josie and I are going and most of the group.\" Josie looked at Rob, her eyes wide with alarm. There was no way she was going 'partying' at the lake with a bunch of underage teenagers. All that could possibly lead to was trouble with a capital 'T'. But, like always, Rob was on top of things. \"That sounds great, Guy, but I'm afraid Josie and I can't make it.\" At both Guy and Tracie's questioning looks he added. \"Our parents are having a small little get-together after the Prom. Nothing elaborate, basically just us and our parents.\" \"Aw, Rob.\" Tracie pouted slightly. \"Couldn't you guys do that another time? It's Prom night!\" \"Wish we could, Trace.\" Rob lied gallantly. Secretly he couldn't wait to get away from her. \"But we promised our folks we'd be home as soon as Prom was over.\" Noting the disappointed looks on both Guy and Tracie's faces he grinned slightly and suggested. \"Why don't you two go to the party together? That way Josie and I can make our plans with our parents and you two still get to go to the party. How does that sound?\" Guy looked at Tracie for a moment than shrugged. \"Fine, I guess. At least that way we won't be the only ones without a date. Sound okay to you, Tracie?\" \"Sounds fine to me.\" She agreed eagerly. Then looking at Rob she asked. \"How will you get home?\" \"Don't worry about us.\" Rob assured her. \"My car's in the parking lot.\" When he received surprised looks from all three of his companions he explained. \"I thought you might have plans after Prom, so I thought I'd bring my car so Josie and I could get home afterwards. I'm not without my resources.\" Josie rolled her eyes as Guy started tugging on her hand. \"Come, on Beautiful. Let's hit the dance floor.\" As they moved off Brett approached Tracie and Rob. \"Hey, Robster! Mind if I steal Tracie for a dance of two?\" \"Be my guest.\" Rob replied eagerly as he handed her over to Brett. He watched them go, more than relieved to be devoid of her for a few minutes. He liked Tracie and all, but he knew she liked him far too much for comfort, especially since she was only sixteen and he was twenty-three. \"So, how'd it go?\" A voice suddenly asked, causing Rob to jump slightly in surprise. \"Fine.\" Rob replied, giving Sam an amused smile. \"I think we were convincing enough that Gus shouldn't be too suspicious. I just hope Guy doesn't say anything to give us away.\" \"I'm sure Josie will keep a handle on the conversation.\" Sam assured him. \"She knows what's at stake.\" \"Yeah, but she's not as good at the deception stuff as I am.\" Rob said, grinning wickedly at his companion. \"She's got too good a conscience.\" \"Well, I must admit I'm glad to hear it.\" The older man commented seriously. \"I had enough deception and manipulation with my last girlfriend.\" \"Josie said you two were together for five years.\" Rob casually remarked. \"She must have had come good qualities for you to stay with her for so long.\" Sam flushed a little bit and admitted. \"I think all her good qualities existed only in my memory.\" Seeing the expectant look on Rob's face he explained. \"When we first met we were in college, life was lighter, easier. Once we graduated and she landed that high power job in New York things changed. She changed. All of a sudden appearances meant a lot to her. She wanted the perfect job, the perfect apartment, the perfect boyfriend…which I wasn't.\" \"What do you mean?\" Rob asked, eyeing him carefully. \"She couldn't understand my love of teaching or my fascination with the written word. She hated my job, my hobbies – almost everything about my life that I hold dear.\" Sam explained. \"Everything that Josie loves about you.\" Rob told him honestly. \"Really?\" Sam gave him a hopeful look. Rob nodded in confirmation and watched as a bright smile spread across his face. After a moment he said. \"I put in a good word for you.\" When the other man gave him a puzzled look he explained. \"Back on the dance floor when Josie and I were talking, I told her and Gus via camera, that I hoped once all was said and done you would find it in your heart of forgive her for deceiving you.\" Looking at the other man seriously for a moment he added. \"Because I have never seen her as happy as she's been since she met you.\" \"Really?\" Sam looked at him hopefully. \"Really.\" Rob nodded. Then looking at Sam for another moment he added. \"I know I haven't known you very long. In fact I think tonight's the first time we've really talked, but that doesn't mean I haven't been keeping my eyes and ears open.\" Sam raised his eyebrows in surprise as the younger man continued. \"I can tell from what I've learned about you that you're a pretty decent guy. Your students like you, your co-workers like you and your friends really like you.\" \"You've been talking to my friends?\" Sam exclaimed in profound surprise. He hadn't realized that he'd been so thoroughly checked out by the other man. Rob nodded. \"Coach Romano mentioned one day that you and he were good friends, so I asked him a few questions about you, nothing really personal, mostly just general stuff.\" He grinned at him and added. \"Seems that you're quite well liked by most everyone you know.\" His eyes twinkled slightly as he added. \"Your ex-girlfriend on the other hand…\" Sam flushed again in embarrassment and acknowledged. \"There never was much love lost between Lara and my friends. I guess because they saw all along what I just started seeing recently. Actually, I guess in a lot of ways I owe Josie for that. She's the one that opened my eyes and made me realize that it is possible to have a relationship where two people share the same interests. That daily fighting isn't part of a normal relationship.\" Rob regarded him carefully for a moment. \"I love my sister, Mr. C. She means a lot to me. I don't want to see her get hurt.\" Sam met Rob's serious look confidently. \"I wouldn't do anything to hurt her, Rob. You have my word on that. She's a very special girl and I have nothing but the highest respect for her. I care about her very much.\" Rob smiled reassuringly at him. \"I can see that you do. But just promise me one thing.\" \"Anything.\" Sam quickly vowed. \"Take things slow and easy with Josie.\" Her brother urged. \"She's only fallen for one guy before you and he hurt her very badly.\" At Sam's concerned look he continued. \"It was many years ago, she was a Senior in High School, but its caused Josie to have serious doubts about herself where guys are concerned. She's afraid of being hurt again.\" \"What did this guy do to her?\" Sam asked anxiously, his eyes suddenly widening in fear. \"He didn't hurt her, did he?\" Rob, understanding what he meant, quickly shook his head. \"He didn't hurt her physically, just emotionally. But don't worry, his pain was a lot more physical when I got through with him.\" When Sam's eyebrows shot up questioningly he added. \"Let's just say he spent the rest of the summer drinking his meals through a straw.\" The other man chuckled in amusement and clasped the younger man on the shoulder. \"Remind me never to get on your bad side.\" \"Hey, you keep making Josie happy and you and me will get along just fine. \" Rob assured him. Sam watched Josie and Guy as they moved slowly around the dance floor. \"Rob, I promise to spend the rest of my life making Josie happy.\" \"That's just fine with me, Mr. C.\" Rob grinned widely. \"I think you'd make a pretty cool brother-in-law.\" Sam smiled at him and returned. \"I think you would too, Rob.\" They watched the dancing couple for a few more moments than Rob asked suddenly. \"You doing anything tomorrow?\" Sam glanced at his new friend and asked. \"What did you have in mind?\" \"Nothing major.\" The dark-haired man told him. \"I was just wondering if you'd like to join Josie and me and our parents for a barbecue tomorrow afternoon. Dad loves showing off his barbecuing skills for new guests and Mom has been dying to meet you for weeks now. She keeps trying to come up with some new excuse to go down to the school and meet you. So far I've managed to stop her, but I think her curiosity is getting the better of her. I many not be able to hold her off much longer.\" Sam laughed in amusement as his hart started beating a little faster. Josie must have been talking about him to her mother for the other woman to be so adamant about wanting to meet him. \"Well, I guess I should put her out of her misery than, shouldn't I? I'd love to come for a barbecue.\" \"Great!\" Rob exclaimed eagerly. \"Josie will be pleased. And I must say I'm looking forward to getting to know you a bit better myself.\" \"I thought that you already knew everything there was to know about me.\" Sam teased lightly. He knew he should be a little miffed at Rob's prodding into his personal life, but he wasn't. In fact he was rather impressed that the young man cared enough about his sister's welfare that he would do some checking on a perspective love interest. \"Not everything .\" Rob defended. \"Just a few things. Enough to know that you'd be great for my sister. You two have a lot in common.\" Sam grinned happily at that and mused. \"Maybe Josie and I can come to the barbecue together.\" \"You'll have to arrange that with Josie.\" The other man told him. \"I don't know what her plans are for tomorrow.\" \"That maybe a little tricky.\" Sam commented a little sadly. \"What with her camera and everything.\" \"You leave that to me, Mr. C.\" Rob's dark eyes sparkled as his mind formulated a plan. \"Meanwhile why don't you grab my sister for a dance.\" \"Do you think that would be all right?\" Josie's admirer asked hopefully. \"Sure, why not.\" Rob shrugged non-chelantly. Then with mischievous eyes he added. \"Especially since Guy so rudely cut in on you two just as Josie was about to tell you something important about Dartmouth.\" Sam chuckled slightly and nodded in understanding. \"Yes, that was rude of him wasn't it?\" The two men laughed and parted company, Rob going to work the room and Sam to find Josie. Once again he found her at the dessert table, attempting for the second time to eat a piece of chocolate cake. \"Hello again.\" He greeted as he came up beside her. Josie smiled at him and self-consciously wiped at her face. \"Hi.\" \"Enjoying your evening so far?\" He asked, trying hard to keep his tone light and steady. Now that he knew the truth about her, that she wasn't his seventeen year old student, but a twenty-five year old woman who was just as crazy about him as he was about her, he was finding it even harder to act calm and natural around her. All he wanted to do was hold her in his arms and kiss her senseless. \"It's been wonderful.\" She told him sincerely. \"The decorations, the costumes, the music – they're all wonderful.\" Her eyes told him that wasn't all that she found wonderful about the evening. \"I'm glad that you're enjoying yourself.\" He told her warmly. Then after a brief pause he added. \"I was just wondering if you'd mind finishing the dance we started earlier.\" When she looked at him puzzled he smiled and cued. \"You know, before Guy cut in and interrupted us.\" She gave him a look of surprise, a slow smile creeping up her face. He'd obviously been talking to Rob. \"That would be nice.\" She told him sincerely, her eyes revealing the deep feelings she had for him since she couldn't voice those feelings aloud. Reading what her eyes were trying to tell him he gave her a warm smile and took her hand to lead her to the dance floor. This time as they danced he dared to hold her a little tighter and lace their fingers together. Josie flashed him a tender smile as he squeezed her hand tightly. \"So what were you going to tell me about Dartmouth?\" Josie's eyes widened slightly in alarm, but she quickly regained her composure when he gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. Taking a deep breath to steady her voice she replied. \"What I wanted to tell you was that I really appreciate your kind offer, but I was thinking maybe I'll just apply to Northwestern. That way I'll be able to stay with my family.\" \"But you are going to go to college?\" He pressed, trying his best to keep the conversation on a teacher-student level. \"I think you owe it to yourself. I really think you could make it as a writer.\" Josie gave him such a love filled look that it took all of Sam's self-control to keep from pulling her into his arms and kissing her. \"Nobody has ever encouraged me in my writing like you have. You have been a real inspiration to me and I don't know how to thank you.\" He gave his trademark smile and said lightly. \"I'll think of something.\" Josie blushed slightly at his comment, imagining all the things she'd be quite willing to do to thank him. \"How about you dedicate your first book to me and we'll call it even.\" Josie grinned slightly, knowing that comment was strictly for the camera's sake. \"It's a deal.\" She told him, then she mouthed very carefully so he'd understand. \"I love you.\" Sam's smile nearly split his face as he replied, trying hard to keep his tone in check. \"Wonderful!\" \"Oh, Rob this night has been everything I dreamed my Prom would be!\" Josie exclaimed to her brother as they drove down one of Chicago's busy streets later that night. \"Everything was so wonderful – the costumes, the decorations, the food. And I was crowned Prom Queen! Me, Josie Grossie – Prom Queen!\" \"Hey, I keep telling you, you're not Josie Grossie anymore.\" Rob said seriously. \"You are a wonderful, beautiful, intelligent woman who happens to look very sexy in that dress.\" \"Really?\" Josie blushed at the compliment. \"Really.\" He nodded in confirmation. \"You've changed so much in the last couple months. I'm proud of you.\" \"Thanks, Rob.\" She looked at him with tears in her eyes. \"I never could have done it without you.\" \"My pleasure.\" He gave her a bright smile. \"I just wished I had done this eight years ago when we were still in high school. Maybe Billy Prince would have invited you for real.\" Josie's happiness dimmed slightly as she remembered her first Prom. \"Maybe.\" She murmured sadly. \"Hey, you wanna go and get some coffee before we go home?\" He asked as he pulled the car to a stop at a traffic light. \"I know this nice little place down the street.\" \"That sounds nice.\" Josie replied then giggled when she looked down at his bare legs. \"You know, Rob, I know most restaurants only have signs that read 'Shirts Must Be Worn', but I think that's probably because they figure that pants are a given.\" \"Are you kidding? Any waitress would die to see these sexy legs.\" He retorted, pretending to be insulted at her comment. When Josie rolled her eyes he added. \"Don't worry, I have a pair of pants in the back.\" \"Let's just hope we don't get pulled over between here and the coffee shop.\" She remarked as she shook her head slightly. \"You'll have quite a time explaining why you're pants are in the back seat to a police officer.\" \"I'll just tell him that you're my Prom date and you couldn't keep your hands off me…OW!\" He yelped when she hit him in the arm. \"Take it easy will you! I'm driving here and I'd like to get us back home in one piece.\" Josie just laughed and turned her attention to the traffic outside as the light turned green and Rob drove through the intersection. \"I never did ask you how your car…\" She looked back at him and corrected. \"… My car got to the school.\" \"I drove it over earlier.\" Rob explained. \"I caught wind that Guy and some of the other cool kids were going to continue partying after the Prom and I figured they'd want us to come too.\" He looked at her and said. \"Well to us that could only spell trouble with a capital 'T', so I brought the car over earlier this afternoon so we could make a get-away if we had to.\" \"I'm glad you did.\" She admitted. \"I could only imagine what could have happened if the party had gotten out of hand and we were found with a bunch of underage kids, who would no doubt have been drunk. Not a good idea.\" \"I agree.\" He echoed. \"I don't intend to spend the next five years of my life in jail for 'influencing' a minor.\" \"Me neither.\" She agreed. \"I don't think that would do much for my career, such as it is.\" \"Don't worry, Jos.\" He reached over and gave her arm a reassuring squeeze. \"Everything will work out. Mr. C.'s a cool guy, I'm sure he'll understand everything once this is all over.\" Josie looked at Rob and sighed. \"How can he after I ruin his career? I can't do it, Rob. I can't! But I don't know what I'm going to do about it. Gus won't yield. He smells blood and he's ready to go in for the kill.\" \"And you're the bait.\" Rob commented sympathetically. \"Yeah, I'm the bait.\" She sighed. \"He's using me to incriminate a man that I am hopelessly in love with and would give anything to have love me, but at the same time if he does love me than I have to ruin his life. Sounds fair don't it. Either way one or both of us gets our heart broken.\" Rob reached over and brought his sister closer to him, wrapping a protective arm around her shoulders. She laid her head on his shoulder and snuggled comfortably against him. \"Don't worry, Jos.\" He assured her lovingly. \"We'll think of something.\" He kissed the side of her head and turned his attention back to the road. After a couple of minutes he spoke again. \"Hey, Josie, can you do me a favor?\" \"What kind of favor?\" She asked, but didn't lift her head from his shoulder. \"Can you maybe loose the camera?\" He requested seriously. \"I mean Prom's over, its after midnight meaning its now Saturday and frankly I'm tired of Gus and all your co-workers watching my every move.\" \"I guess you're right.\" She agreed as she sat back up in her seat. \"I am basically 'off-duty' for the weekend.\" Undoing the wings pin she held it up so Gus and everyone else got a close up of Rob. \"Say goodnight, Rob.\" \"'Goodnight, Rob'.\" He said into the camera, flashing everyone at the Chicago Sun-Times a cheesy grin. Josie laughed and then turned the camera towards herself. In a cheery tone she said. \"Nigh everyone. Thanks for watching.\" The she clicked the camera off and slipped it into her bag. \"Here we are.\" Rob announced as he pulled the car to a halt in front of a quaint little coffee shop. Josie looked up and noticed the 'NO PARKING' sign posted beside them. \"Rob, you can't park here. It's a 'No Parking' zone.\" \"I wasn't planning on parking here.\" He told her mysteriously. When she gave him a puzzled look he added. \"I plan on parking in the driveway at home.\" \"But I thought we were going for coffee.\" She commented, her brow furrowing deeper in puzzlement. \"'We' are.\" He said with a sly smile. \"But 'we' is not you and me , it's you and him .\" Josie looked out her window when Rob pointed to something behind her. There, standing on the sidewalk with a lone rose in his hand, was Sam. Josie smiled warmly as he opened the car door and held out a hand to help her out. \"Good evening, Miss Geller.\" He greeted with a charming smile. \"Good evening, Mr. Coulson.\" She returned as she allowed him to pull her to her feet. \"Fancy meeting you here.\" \"For you.\" He handed her the rose he held. Josie accepted it and buried her nose in its fragrant petals. \"It's beautiful. Thank you.\" \"Shall we?\" He gestured towards the coffee shop. \"I'd love to.\" She nodded. Then turning back to Rob she leaned through the window and said. \"Thanks for the ride, Rob. I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.\" \"Have a good time, Jos, Mr. C.\" He called back. Sam looked at Rob through the open window and said. \"See you tomorrow, Rob. And thanks for everything.\" Seeing the intense feeling in Sam's eyes when he looked at his sister Rob smiled warmly and acknowledged. \"My pleasure. You two kids have a good time.\" Then putting the car in gear he squealed the tires of Josie's Buick and headed off into the night. \"My poor car!\" Josie cringed as her brother and her car turned the next corner. \"Your car?\" Sam smiled in confusion. \"I thought that yellow car was yours.\" \"Actually that yellow boat belongs to Rob.\" She gestured down the street adding. \"That was my car that my brother just went screaming into the night with. I traded cars with him when I first began this assignment because I thought his car looked more like something a teenager would drive than mine.\" Sam laughed. \"Well, you got a point there.\" Then reaching out he took her hand and gently pulled her towards the coffee shop. \"Come on, let's get some coffee and you can tell me all about Josie Geller, undercover reporter.\" With a bright smile she nodded her head in agreement. \"…And then Rob starts tumbling head over heels down the side of the mountain! I thought for sure he'd killed himself.\" She shuddered slightly at the memory. \"I still can't believe I let him talk me into skiing Dead Man's Curve. I was sure we'd never get back down again alive. But we did, and I lived to bury Rob face first in a snow bank for scaring me like he did.\" Sam smiled and remarked. \"You two sound very close.\" \"We are.\" She nodded. \"He has helped me out a lot the last few years. I don't know what I would have done without him – or my parents. They've all been great. But Rob's been the best. He's one of the best friends I've ever had. I couldn't ask for a nicer, more supportive brother.\" \"Or a more protective one.\" Sam smirked in amusement. \"What do you mean?\" Josie looked at him expectantly. Sam continued to chuckle as he explained his amusement. \"Rob informed me tonight that he's been 'checking' me out.\" \"What do you me he's been 'checking' you out?\" Josie asked suspiciously. \"I mean that Rob's invented his own 'Are You Eligible To Date Josie' test.\" Sam told her, his eyes twinkling with amusement. \"What did he do?\" She asked warily. \"Nothing bad.\" Sam quickly assured her. He just gave Scott Romano the third degree about me, that's all.\" \"Scott Romano? You mean Coach Romano?\" Josie gave him a surprised look. When Sam nodded she asked. \"Why?\" \"Rob found out that Scott and I are good friends, so he decided to see what kind of a guy I am.\" Sam explained, his eyes still twinkling with amusement. \"Guess he wanted to find out just what my friends thought about me. Get an idea of what kind of guy was interested in his big sister.\" Josie rolled her eyes and groaned fiercely. \"I'm sorry about that. He had no right to be so nosy.\" \"Sure he did.\" He assured her seriously. \"He loves you and he wanted to make sure that you weren't going to get hurt. You are his big sister after all. And I don't mind, really. I have nothing to hide. My life is an open book, especially to you.\" She flushed slightly but gave him a bright smile. \"I want you to know everything about me too.\" \"Good.\" He reached over and squeezed her hand lovingly. \"Because I want to know everything there is to know about you.\" He paused for a moment before prompting. \"Like what was so dreadful about your first High School experience that made you dread coming to South Glen South.\" Josie paled slightly and dropped her eyes to her plate. Reaching over, Sam put a finger under her chin and lifted it so she would look at him. \"Hey, its okay. You don't have to be afraid. And you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I shouldn't have been so nosy. I'm sorry.\" \"No, it's okay. Really.\" She assured him, giving his hand a warm squeeze. \"I want you to know about it. It's just not a time of my life I'm particularly proud or fond of. In fact, I don't usually talk about my high school experience, especially my Senior year.\" \"What happened?\" He pressed, squeezing her hand encouragingly. She gave him a brief smile before replying. \"All through High School, all through school really, I was a real nerd. I had braces, long stringy hair, a face full of pimples – the complete nerdy look. And I also had brains, and I wasn't afraid to use them. I spent most of my spare time doing extra homework I requested from the teacher.\" Sam smiled teasingly. \"So that's why you did so much extra work for me. I thought it was because you liked me.\" \"I did! I do!\" She flushed as she amended. \"I only wrote extra work for you. I guess it was my way of reaching out to you, of letting you know little things about myself that I couldn't tell you out loud.\" \"And I treasured each and everything that you wrote.\" He gave her a loving smile as he admitted. \"I use to keep yours till the last so I could devote my complete and undivided attention to what it said. I'd commit every detail to memory. In fact I treasured your writings so much that I made a copy of each and every one of them and placed them in a special folder in my briefcase that was only for your work. I guess it was my way of keeping a part of you with me at all times. Sometimes at night when I couldn't stop thinking about you, I'd pull them out and read them over and over again. I think I could probably recite each and every one of them.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" She gave him such a loving look that Sam felt his heart start to race wildly. \"That has to be the sweetest thing that anyone has ever done for me.\" Tears sprang into her eyes and she closed them, trying desperately to hold the tears back. \"Hey, what is it?\" He asked as he reached over and gently brushed a stray tear form her cheek. Opening her eyes she looked at him and admitted. \"I never thought I'd ever find anybody who'd love me so much that something as simple as my writing would mean that much to them.\" \"Josie, everything about you means a lot to me.\" He told her seriously. \"I have memorized every detail that I could about you. I remember every word you've ever said, every look you've ever given me, every outfit you've ever worn since the first day I set eyes on you in my classroom.\" A grin tugged at the corners of his mouth and his eyes started to twinkle as he teased. \"I especially liked that white shirt with the white boa around the neck.\" Josie groaned and hid her face in her hands. \"I still have to kill Anita for picking out that outfit. I didn't realize what a sick, twisted sense of humor she had.\" \"Who's Anita?\" Sam asked curiously. \"She's my best friend.\" Josie told him. \"We work together at the Sun-Times. She's in Classifieds.\" Then with a slight giggle she added. \"You probably know her better as 'Pam Kitterman'.\" \"Pam Kitterman?\" He exclaimed in surprise. \"You mean Pam Kitterman from the Sex-Ed lecture?\" \"That's her.\" Josie smiled awaiting his reaction. He gave her an amused smirk. \"I wondered why you two seemed to know each other.\" He shook his head. \"I hope none of the other teachers hear about this.\" \"You won't get in trouble will you?\" Josie asked in alarm. \"Anita didn't mean any harm. She was basically just in the wrong place at the right time.\" \"And since I was so desperate for someone – anyone – to come and take that lecture I readily assumed that Anita was Pam.\" He chuckled at himself and at how petrified he'd been that day. There was no way he'd have been able to give that lecture if Anita hadn't shown up and rescued him. He briefly wondered what happened to the real Pam Kitterman. \"Remind me to thank her sometime.\" Josie couldn't help but smile at the humor in the situation, but her eyes still held concern. \"You won't get in trouble will you?\" He smiled ruefully and shook his head. \"No parents complained so I won't get in trouble. It's more like I'll never live it down. Scott and Adam Christiansen will laugh me into next week if they find out.\" \"Well, I guess it'll just have to be our little secret then won't it.\" She gave him a bright smile. Sam gave her a warm smile in return and then brought the conversation back to their original topic. \"So what happened your Senior year of high school?\" Josie's smile dimmed slightly as she continued her story. \"During my Senior year I developed a crush on one of the 'popular' boys in my class.\" She blushed slightly. \"I guess I kind of made a fool of myself over him. One time in English class the teacher asked me to read my work assignment in front of the class. We had been assigned to write a poem. The poem that I wrote had been about him.\" She blushed deeper as she admitted. \"I thought for sure that it would make him like me. My biggest wish in high school was that I was the most popular girl in school and that he would ask me to the Prom.\" \"What happened?\" Sam pressed gently, watching the different emotions playing across her beautiful face. \"He asked me.\" She replied, her tone very controlled. Sam encouraged her with his eyes to continue. There was a slight catch in her voice as she related. \"So I got myself a beautiful dress, at least I thought it was beautiful at the time. I did my hair and make up and I got all ready for the Prom. But things didn't go exactly as I'd hoped.\" She looked into Sam's concerned face and continued. \"As I stepped outside the house, the limo came down the street and my dream date appeared out the sunroof…and so did a beautiful cheerleader.\" Sam's brow furrowed and his grip on her hand tightened as she said. \"The next thing I knew he was pelting me with eggs and taunting me to write a poem about it. Then he called me a geek.\" \"Oh, Josie.\" Sam felt his heart almost break as he imagined the depth of her pain and humiliation that night. \"I spent most of the evening in the bushes beside the house because I didn't want Rob or my parents to know what had happened.\" Tears fell down her cheeks as she looked into Sam's concerned eyes. They were so filled with sympathy and love that Josie's words started coming out in sobs. Sam moved around the table and slid into the booth beside her, wrapping his arms around her. Finding solace in his embrace, Josie managed to continue her story. \"After a couple of hours Rob spotted me from his bedroom window and come out and got me. Heartbroken, I told him the whole story. The next day Rob found him and confronted him for what he did to me. I guess Rob messed him up pretty good.\" \"Yeah, Rob told me that the guy was pretty much drinking his meals through a straw for the rest of the summer.\" Sam grinned in spiteful glee. \"Serves him right too!\" Josie looked at him with wide eyes. \"Rob already told you this story?\" Sam quickly shook his head and assured her. \"All he told me was that you'd been hurt by some guy that you really liked and that Rob had beaten him up because of it.\" He grinned slightly as he said. \"I think it was Rob's subtle way of warning me that if I ever did anything to hurt you he'd make sure I answered for it.\" Josie couldn't help but giggle at the thought of Rob beating up on mild mannered Sam Coulson. \"He does try to protect me.\" \"And so he should.\" Sam gave her shoulders a gentle squeeze. \"He's a lucky guy to have you as his sister. Just like I would be a lucky guy to have you as a girlfriend.\" Josie's eyes widened as she repeated in surprise. \"Girlfriend?\" Sam chuckled slightly at her expression and asked teasingly. \"Do you have a problem with that?\" \"No, no, of course not.\" Josie quickly assured him. \"I just never thought I'd ever hear you say that to me. I've dreamed it many times, but I never felt that I was ever good enough to be your girlfriend.\" Sam smiled tenderly at her and reached up to push a loose piece of hair off her forehead. \"Josie Geller, I don't just want you to be my girlfriend. One of these days, in the not too distant future I hope, I want you to be my wife. I want to be able to have you in my life forever. To wake up beside you every morning and to fall asleep with you in my arms every night.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" She leaned into him and buried her face into his chest as tears continued to fall down her cheeks. Hugging her tightly to him he pressed kisses into her hair before venturing to ask. \"Does that sound like a future that would interest you?\" Pulling back to look at his face she blinked a couple of times, trying to clear the tears from her eyes before shyly nodding her head in response. Sam's face broke into a wide grin as he admonished. \"Remember that answer. I'll come in handy one day.\" Josie giggled slightly as more tears began to flow. Throwing her arms around his neck she hugged him tightly. Sam couldn't help but echo her feelings when he heard her whisper softly. \"If this is a dream, please, please don't ever let me wake up.\" \"Well, here we are.\" Josie said as she indicated for Sam to pull into the space behind Bambi. \"Welcome to my humble neighborhood. Sam looked up at the quaint looking building and smiled. It was just the type of place that he'd pictured her living in. \"I like it.\" He told her honestly. \"It suits you.\" Josie smiled brightly at him and blushed. \"Want to see the inside?\" She invited innocently. Sam smiled at her warmly but declined. \"I should probably be getting home.\" Glancing at the clock on his dashboard he chuckled slightly and said. \"It's already after two-thirty.\" Josie looked at the clock, her eyes widening in alarm as she read 2:37. \"Oh, my! I'm sorry for keeping you out so late! I didn't realize the time!\" Sam laughed slightly and reached out to grab her hand. After bringing it to his lips and kissing it he said. \"Don't apologize. There isn't anyplace one earth I'd rather be right now than with my beautiful girlfriend.\" \"Girlfriend.\" Josie closed her eyes dreamily as she repeated the delightful word under her breath. She still couldn't believe that she was Sam Coulson's girlfriend. All her dreams of the past two months were suddenly coming true. She'd even gotten her first kiss, a kiss so tender and so full of love that it more than fulfilled all her expectations and fantasies. When Sam kissed her, there was nothing in the world but the two of them. Opening her eyes she looked at him warmly for a moment. \"There's something I think I should tell you.\" Sam felt his pulse start to race nervously at her words. \"Please don't tell me you've changed your mind and you just want to be friends.\" Seeing the worry in his face she couldn't help but smile slightly at his obvious concern. To think that she had that much influence on his happiness was enough to take her breath away. Reaching a tentative hand up to touch his face she quickly assured him. \"Of course I want to be your girlfriend. I love you very much.\" She watched his expression relax as she continued. \"What I wanted to tell you was that…\" She paused for a moment as a warm flush stained her cheeks. \"You know that first kiss we shared? The one on the stone bench outside Prom?\" Sam nodded eagerly. He didn't think he'd ever forget that kiss. It had been a kiss he'd been dreaming of and wishing for for weeks. \"Well, that wasn't just our first kiss…that was my first kiss, too.\" She looked up to see shock filling his eyes. She squirmed slightly in her seat, not sure what to make of his expression. Finally Sam found his voice. \"I'm the first guy you've ever kissed?\" Completely embarrassed Josie dropped her eyes to her lap and in a cracking voice hastened to explain. \"I've always believed that there is someone that you're 'meant to be' with. And I didn't want to go kissing a whole bunch of guys to try to find my one special guy, someone that I would want to spend the rest of my life with. He would be someone that I could share anything with, who would love me for who I am, not for who they wanted me to be. Someone who would never, ever do anything to hurt me. I figured if I ever met him, I'd know it and then, and only then, would I finally get my kiss. And he would be the one I'd kiss for the rest of my life.\" When Josie finished her monologue, Sam reached over and lifted her chin to make her look at him. Giving her the most loving, tender look that she had ever received in her life he said. \"Do you have any idea how much that means to me?\" When Josie's eyes searched his face for a moment he continued. \"It is like a special gift that you have reserved for only me.\" He paused for a minute before whispering huskily. \"Thank you.\" With tears in her eyes she whispered back. \"You're welcome.\" Leaning in he placed a soft kiss on her lips and then pulled her in for a warm hug. \"I love you, Josie Geller. I'll love you forever.\" \"I love you too, Sam.\" She whispered back. They pulled back after a few moments and Sam asked. \"So, do you want me to pick you up tomorrow afternoon or should I just meet you at your parents?\" \"I think I'll just meet you there, if you don't mind.\" She replied seriously. Jabbing a finger at the car in front of them she explained. \"I want to return that monstrosity to Rob and get my car back before he totals it or something.\" \"I noticed he redecorated it.\" Sam commented. \"At least I'm assuming you didn't have that lovely detailing done yourself.\" Josie rolled her eyes and shook her head slightly. \"Certainly not. But that's what I get for telling him he could do whatever he liked with it if he'd loan me his car. But he's promised me that he'll have it fixed up by tomorrow night.\" Giving Sam a skeptical look she added. \"I'll believe it when I see it.\" \"You're brother sounds a lot like mine.\" Sam commented with a laugh. \"A little irresponsible, but with a heart of gold.\" Josie looked at him curiously. \"How many brothers and sisters do you have?\" \"I have one of each.\" He replied. \"An older sister named Abigail and a younger brother named Russell. Abby's about three years older than me and Russ is about three years younger.\" \"And how old are you?\" She inquired. Sam smiled. \"I'll be twenty-seven in August.\" Josie returned his smile with one of her own. \"So we're fourteen months apart. I'll be twenty-six in October.\" \"Sure beats nine years.\" He told her seriously as he reached over and touched her face gently. \"I can't tell you what a relief it is to know that you're really my age and not seventeen. Even though I was quite ready and willing to pursue a relationship with you if you were interested, I still couldn't help but view the age difference as a problem.\" \"Because I was your student?\" She asked curiously. \"Not just that, though that was one of my major hang ups.\" He admitted. He ran his fingers over the side of her head, rubbing some of the loose wisps of hair between his fingers gently. \"But I was more concerned that because you were so young, that whatever feelings you might have for me now might change in a few months or years. I wasn't sure if you were old enough to know your heart yet and that I might just be setting myself up for heartache because I knew I wanted more than just a few months or years. I wanted a lifetime.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" Tears returned to Josie's emotion-filled eyes. \"I am so sorry for having deceived you. I never meant to cause you so much pain. When I first started here I didn't think my presence would have much effect on anyone. I certainly didn't affect too many people's lives when I was in high school the first time, except maybe to give them somebody to torture.\" \"Didn't you have any friends in school?\" He asked with concern. He couldn't imagine her going through high school completely friendless. She must have caught the attention of someone. \"I did have one good friend, Sheila Davis.\" Josie replied. \"She and I had been close friends since grade school. But after high school we both kind of lost touch. I went to Northwestern, she went to NYU and we've never seen each other again. I feel kind of bad about it, but I guess these things happen. It's hard to keep track of people once school's over.\" \"It's hard.\" Sam agreed. \"But not impossible.\" \"Don't tell me you still know your best friend from high school?\" She looked at him with surprise. \"Yup.\" He nodded. \"In fact I've had the same best friend since grade one. His name is Jonathan Harper and he and his wife, Joanne and I have known each other for over twenty-years.\" \"That's great.\" Josie told him sincerely, secretly wishing she could boast the same thing about Sheila. There were times that she deeply regretted not staying in touch with her old friend. But she had no idea where to go about looking for her now. \"How about you, Russ and Abby? Are you guys close too?\" Sam nodded. \"We're very close, just like you and Rob. They're two of my closest friends. In fact Abby is my confidant. There isn't anything that I don't tell her.\" \"Have you told her about me?\" Josie asked curiously. \"Anything except about you.\" He told her honestly than hastened to explain. \"But that's only because…\" \"Because you thought you were falling for one of your seventeen year old students and you didn't want to admit it to yourself let alone anyone else.\" Josie finished for him. \"That's very perceptive of you, Miss Geller.\" He gave her an amused smile. \"I am supposed to be a reporter.\" She commented lightly. Then with a sigh she added. \"Though I'm obviously not a very good one.\" \"Hey, don't sell yourself short.\" He scolded her seriously. \"You are a wonderful writer and you will make a wonderful reporter. Like I told you yesterday, all you have to do is find your story.\" \"Thanks, Sam.\" She gave him a grateful smile. \"I can't begin to tell you how much your vote of confidence means to me. Nobody, except for my family, has ever believed in me the way that you do.\" \"I love you.\" He told her sincerely. \"I love you, too.\" She returned and allowed him to pull her in for another tender kiss. When they parted she regretfully said. \"I guess I should go inside. It's almost three o'clock now.\" They both glanced at the dashboard clock which now read '2:57'. \"I had a wonderful time. Thank you for a terrific evening.\" \"Thank you for making it a terrific evening.\" He smiled lovingly at her. \"And thank you for telling me the truth about yourself. This evening turned out even better than I had hoped.\" \"Me too.\" She echoed. \"So I'll see you at your parents' tomorrow afternoon. What time?\" Josie shrugged. \"I'm going over around three, so any time after that would be fine. You have the address?\" He patted the breast pocket of his tuxedo where the piece of paper she'd given him with the address rested. \"Got it right here close to my heart.\" Josie smiled at him. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" As she opened the door he quickly grabbed her arm and said lightly. \"Don't I get a good night kiss?\" Josie looked at him and grinned slightly. \"I guess I could give you one before I go.\" Leaning over she met him halfway for one of the sweetest, most loving kisses they'd shared yet. \"Goodnight, sweetheart.\" He whispered as they separated. Josie blushed with pleasure at the endearment. \"Goodnight, Sam.\" As she watched Sam's black Volkswagen drive off down the street she whispered pleadingly to herself. \"Please don't let this be a dream.\"[Chapter 2] It was a little after three thirty when Sam unlocked the door of his apartment and stepped through the doorway. After dropping his keys on the table and shrugging out of his jacket he grabbed the portable phone and flopped down in his favorite leather chair. Dialing the familiar phone number he waited patiently for a reply. After about five rings a groggy voice replied. \"Hello?\" \"Hey Abby.\" Sam greeted cheerfully. \"How you doing?\" \"Sam?\" Abby's confusion was evident in her voice. \"Yeah, its me.\" He chuckled with amusement. \"Did I wake you?\" \"What time is it?\" He heard her fumble for the clock beside her bed and then moaned when she read the time. \"Sam, it's after one-thirty in the morning.\" \"I know it's late.\" He acknowledged repentantly. \"I just couldn't wait to tell you my news.\" \"What news?\" His sister asked, her question was punctuated by a yawn. \"Abby, I'm in love.\" He told her seriously. Abby's ears perked up at his announcement. \"Something tells me that Lara is not the object of your affection.\" Sam smiled and quickly informed her. \"Lara and I broke up last week.\" \"Thank you.\" Abby whispered in a barely audible tone. Then in a more normal voice she ribbed. \"You certainly didn't waste anytime finding somebody new. I kept telling you there was more fish in the sea.\" Sam blushed slightly and admitted. \"Actually, I knew her before I broke up with Lara.\" \"Oh, this is getting better and better.\" Abby said as she sat up in bed, settling in to get all the details on her little brother's new love. \"So was she the reason you and Lara split up?\" \"Yes and no.\" Sam replied somewhat cryptically. \"Meaning?\" Abby pressed. \"Meaning she was part of the reason, but not the whole reason.\" He clarified. \"I had already been thinking about breaking up with Lara, but I just couldn't make myself do it. I knew I didn't want to move to New York and give up my life in Chicago, but I kept telling myself that five years was a long time and that maybe I should give it a chance. But then I met Josie and I realized that I didn't want to give Lara and I a chance in New York. What I wanted was right here in Chicago. So, that's when I finally told Lara it was over.\" \"And how did Princess Lara handle that?\" Abby asked curiously. \"Surprisingly well.\" He admitted. \"In fact she said that she was beginning to wonder if there was much of a future for us too since I was being so stubborn about moving to New York. Believe it or not we actually parted on somewhat good terms. I'm not saying we're going to be best buddies or anything, but I think we can at least have a civil relationship if nothing else.\" \"Well, I'm glad she's out of the picture.\" His sister told him seriously. \"She wasn't right for you. She was too stuck up and bossy. You need somebody sweeter and kinder. Someone more like you.\" \"Well, I think I've found her.\" Sam told his sister seriously. \"So tell me about her.\" She prompted eagerly. \"What did you say her name was? Josie? What's she like? Where did you meet her? How long have you known her? Was it love at first sight?\" Sam laughed in amusement at her barrage of questions and set about patiently answering them. \"Her name is Josie Geller. She's an up and coming reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times and she is the most amazing woman I have ever met. She's smart, she's funny and she is so talented. I just love reading her assignments. When I'm doing my correcting, I always leave her work to the last so that I can give her writing my undivided attention.\" \"Correcting?\" His sister repeated in confusion. \"If she's a reporter for the Sun-Times, why are you correcting her work? Wouldn't they have copy editors to do that?\" Sam smiled and said \"Maybe I'd better start at the beginning.\" For the next twenty minutes Sam filled his sister in on everything that he knew about Josie and about his feelings. Abby listened with rapped attention, feeling instinctively that this was definitely the right girl for her younger brother. \"She sounds wonderful, Sam.\" Abby commented when he had finished. \"When do I get to meet her?\" \"I was thinking of seeing if she'd be willing to come with me to Mom and Dad's the holiday weekend in July.\" He told her eagerly. \"Do you think you, Bill and Emma will be able to meet us there?\" \"Actually, we've already made plans to be at Mom and Dad's that weekend.\" Abby told him excitedly. \"We figured we'd arrive on Friday and stay until Monday. Bill has to be back to work on Tuesday.\" \"That sounds great!\" Sam exclaimed delightedly. \"I can't wait for you all to meet Josie. I just know that you're going to love her!\" \"If you love her, than I'll love her.\" His sister assured him sincerely. \"You didn't feel that way about Lara.\" He commented teasingly. \"Neither did you.\" She stated matter-of-factly. \"You're right.\" He surprised her by saying. \"I didn't. I'm just glad that I realized it before I did something stupid like marry her.\" \"Me too.\" Her sister said seriously. \"You're a great guy, Sam. You deserve much better than that witch, Lara. She didn't appreciate you for who you are, all she wanted to do was change you to suit her ideals. But this Josie of yours sounds different. She sounds sweet and caring and just perfect for you. I'm glad you found each other, and I'm glad that she's not really your seventeen year old student.\" \"Me too.\" He echoed wholeheartedly. \"I've been feeling like such a horrible person these last few weeks believing that I've been in love with one of my students. I can't begin to express my relief when she told me the truth tonight. I almost felt like I must be dreaming again since my deepest wish had come true. Josie is twenty-five years old and as deeply in love with me as I am with her. At this moment my life couldn't be better.\" \"So when's the wedding?\" She teased lightly, knowing her little brother wasn't about to let Josie go now that he'd found her. \"That is in my plans.\" He admitted, blushing slightly as he said it. \"But I don't want to rush her. This is her first real relationship and I don't want her to feel pressured. I want her to enjoy it, to realize that there is someone besides her family who cares about her and about her welfare. She's been hurt badly in the past and I want her to know that she can trust me not to do the same thing to her.\" \"She sounds like a very sensitive person.\" Abby remarked perceptively. \"She is.\" He agreed. \"She can be very sensitive, but it's part of her charm.\" \"Boy, you are in love.\" His sister laughed teasingly, feeling a great relief flood over her. She'd been so worried about her little brother and the loveless relationship he had with Lara. She knew that there was someone better out there for him, but she was having a hard time convincing him of the fact. She was so glad that he had finally found someone who loved him for him, exactly the way he was. \"I am in love, Abby.\" Her brother wholeheartedly agreed. \"I most certainly am.\" Josie yawned and stretched as consciousness slowly seeped into her tired brain. Opening her eyes she grinned at the sunshine coming in her window. She had just had the most incredible dream about herself and Sam Coulson. She had dreamt that during the Prom she had finally worked up enough courage to tell Sam the truth about her undercover status. She could still picture the intense look of relief in his eyes when she'd told him that she was twenty-five and he'd told her that he had been wishing for weeks that she wasn't his high school student but that she was older and more mature. And the kiss they'd shared! Shivers continued to run up her spine as Josie remembered the sweetness and tenderness of their first kiss. Smiling dreamily she looked at her Rosalind costume hanging on the door of her closet. \"I hope Sam reacts the same way when I tell him the truth tonight.\" She mused wistfully. The phone beside her bed suddenly started ringing, causing her to jump with a start. She glanced at her alarm clock and silently wondered who would be calling her at six o'clock in the morning. \"Hello?\" She answered, her voice still husky from sleep. The voice that greeted her ears caused her to start again, but this time from confusion. \"Morning, Beautiful.\" Sam Coulson's voice greeted cheerily. \"I hope I'm not calling you too early, but I just couldn't wait any longer to hear your beautiful voice.\" There was a pause of several seconds before Josie tentatively asked. \"Is that you, Mr. Coulson?\" Sam laughed in amusement, realizing that Josie mustn't be fully awake yet. \"Mr. Coulson, is it? Very well than, Miss Geller , two can play that game.\" Another long pause followed his teasing statement. Finally he heard her whisper softly to herself. \"I must still be dreaming. Mr. Coulson wouldn't be calling me. He has that beautiful girlfriend and I'm just Josie Grossie.\" Sam felt his blood chill when he heard what she'd called herself. That must have been the nickname that Rob was referring to last night. Sam decided, cringing slightly at the thought of anyone pinning that horrible nickname on such a wonderful creature. Deciding it was time to bring Josie out of her sleep induced stupor he gently said. \"Sweetheart, time to wake up. Come one. I want you to wake up and talk to me.\" \"I'm awake.\" Josie informed him then giggled as a yawn punctuated her protest. \"Okay, I'm half-awake.\" Pulling herself into a sitting position she asked stupidly. \"What day is this?\" \"It's Saturday.\" He told her, amusement still evident in his voice. \"Are you sure you didn't get any spiked punch last night at the Prom or something. Or are you just one of those types of people who can't hold their coffee?\" Trying to awaken her sleepy brain long enough to grasp the conversation, Josie finally commented. \"So, am I to gather from the fact that you are calling me at six o'clock in the morning that that wonderful dream that I had about telling you the truth about myself at the Prom was really true? I really did tell you that I'm an undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times and you really did tell me that you love me?\" \"You're an undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times?\" Sam exclaimed in complete shock. When Josie failed to respond he chuckled lightly and assured her. \"Yes, you told me that you were an undercover reporter and yes I most certainly did tell you that I'm in love with you. And if you don't believe me I'll tell you again. Josie Geller, I love you with all my heart and I will continue to love you for the rest of my life.\" Josie's eyes misted slightly. \"I love you too, Sam.\" She was so relieved to know that all the events that she remembered from the Prom had really happened. \"So, what are you doing this morning?\" He asked curiously as he stretched out comfortably on his bed. \"I thought I'd make an attempt at writing a story about my experience at South Glen South. But I'm having a hard time coming up with something as 'sensational' as a teacher/student scandal. I wonder if the Chicago Chronicle is looking for a copy editor or maybe I should just put in an application at McDonalds. Would you like fries with that?\" She mimicked sarcastically. \"You'd look cute with a fishnet over your head.\" Sam teased lightly, trying to make her smile. Then in a more serious tone he added. \"Don't give up, honey. I know you can do it. I have complete and utter faith in you. You'll come up with something wonderful.\" \"I don't know, Sam.\" She commented uncertainly. \"I don't have a clue what to write about.\" \"In order to write well its best to write what you know.\" Sam told her seriously. \"So just write something about what you've learned while you've been at South Glen South. Wasn't that the original topic of your article? Finding out about kids today?\" \"I don't know if that topic's good enough anymore.\" She sighed slightly. \"I have a feeling that Gus and Rigfort want something more sensational than that. They want a scandal.\" \"Don't worry, Sweetheart.\" He told her comfortingly. \"We'll think of something. We're in this together.\" \"I can't tell you how much it means to me to hear you say that.\" She told him sincerely. \"I am so sorry for dragging you into the middle of this mess. I wish I'd never accepted this stupid assignment. Gus was right, I'm not cut out to be a reporter.\" Sam frowned at her comment and replied. \"I don't know this Gus character but I'm beginning to really dislike him.\" \"Oh, Gus isn't all bad.\" Josie defended loyally. \"He's one of those type of people who's all bark and no bite. He acts all gruff and mean, but deep down - way deep down - he has a good heart. And he's usually more right about things than I'd like to admit.\" She sighed slightly and added. \"He tried telling me that I wasn't cut out for a reporter's life, but I wouldn't listen to him. I was stubborn. I wanted to write, but I guess I didn't think about what was involved. I just saw the writing portion of it, not the lying, deceptive angle. I guess I don't have what it takes to be a reporter.\" \"You may not have what it takes to be an undercover, dirt stirring reporter, but that doesn't mean that you don't have what it takes to be a good writer. I have never known anybody with the talent or the passion for writing that you have. Anybody can put words on a page, but you make the words come to life. That's not something anybody can teach you, that's a gift that you are lucky enough to have. All you have to do is find you niche. We'll find it together.\" Josie blushed slightly at his wonderful compliments and said. \"You really are wonderful, you know that? How did I get so lucky as to have found you? As much as I'm frustrated with this whole assignment, at least one good thing has come out of it.\" \"And what's that?\" Sam asked, feigning innocence. \"You of course, silly.\" She laughed gaily, knowing he was teasing her. \"I still can't believe I'm actually talking to you on the telephone. I feel like I'm still dreaming.\" \"What can I do to help convince you that this isn't a dream?\" He asked, an expectant smile spreading across his face. Josie pretended to think for a moment before replying. \"How about if you came over for some breakfast. I make a mean omelet and even better French Toast.\" \"French Toast!\" He exclaimed delightedly. \"You just said the magic words. I'll be there in half an hour!\" Josie's heart jumped into her throat when she heard a light knock at her apartment door. Taking a deep breath she smoothed the skirt of her light blue dress before opening the door for her visitor. \"Hi.\" She greeted nervously as she flashed him a warm smile. \"Hi.\" He returned with a large grin. \"You look beautiful.\" \"Thanks.\" She blushed as she gestured for him to come inside. \"Nice place.\" He told her as he glanced around with appreciation. \"Did you decorate it yourself?\" \"My mom helped me pick out the colors and Rob helped me paint.\" She told him as she followed him into the living room. \"Though I don't know what was more covered in paint me and Rob or the walls!\" Sam chuckled. \"I thought you seemed pretty adept at paint fights when we were painting the backdrop for the Prom.\" \"I've had a lot of practice.\" She laughed remembering all the paint wars that she and Rob had had over the years. Sam's eyes fell upon the large collection of books that she had on a bookcase on the other side of the room. Crossing curiously to see her collection he was delighted to find several of his favorites. \"' Pride and Prejudice' , ' Jane Eyre' , ' Anne of Green Gables' , ' Wuthering Heights'... \" His eyes started to twinkle as he pulled out one of her books and looked at her in amusement. \"'The Hardy Boys'?\" Josie shrugged her shoulders and blushed slightly. \"Rob got me hooked when I was about twelve. I've read every Nancy Drew and Hardy Boy book ever written.\" \"So have I.\" Sam admitted proudly. Then looking at the book he held he smiled. \"And this one happens to be one of my all time favorites.\" \"Mine too.\" She acknowledged. \"Rob bought me that book when I graduated grade school.\" As Sam returned the book to its spot his eyes lit up as he noticed a series of red, hard-covered books. \"You have the complete works of Charles Dickens? That's an impressive collection!\" \"I inherited it from my Grandmother.\" Josie told him. \"She was a real bookworm just like me. In fact it was her that got me hooked on the written word. When I was young she use to read to me from Dickens all the time. I love Oliver and Pickwick Papers the best. By the time I was in High School I was reading a book a day.\" \"Wow, you were quite the bookworm!\" Sam acknowledged, his eyes sparkling with delight. It was a welcome change to have a girlfriend who shared his love of literature. \"One night when I was in High School I was having a hard time sleeping and ended up reading three books and doing three book reports for extra credit.\" When he looked at her in surprise she shrugged slightly and added. \"I told you I was a nerd.\" \"You weren't a nerd.\" He told her seriously as he turned from her book collection to face her. \"You were a teacher's dream, you were a dedicated student.\" Putting his hands on her shoulders he added in a soft whisper. \"You're definitely this teacher's dream come true.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" With tears in her eyes Josie threw her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" He returned as he hugged her tightly to him. Then pulling back so he could see her face he gave her a bright smile before leaning in and kissing her gently on the lips. Josie responded eagerly to his kiss and soon they were locked in a passionate embrace. It's unknown how long it would have been before the pair would have come up for air had the phone not rang and interrupted them. They both groaned in annoyance and pulled apart. \"I guess I'd better get that.\" She said reluctantly as she moved out of Sam's embrace. Walking over to the bar between the kitchen and living room she picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" She greeted pleasantly. \"Hey, Jos!\" Rob's excited voice greeted her ears. \"How's it going?\" \"Great!\" Josie smiled as she recognized her younger brother's voice. \"You're up early for a Saturday morning. It's barely eight o'clock.\" \"Doug Archer called me just now and told me that there's a baseball game on at ten o'clock at the ball diamond if we can get a team together.\" Rob told her eagerly causing Josie to smile knowingly. \"We have most of the team in place, but we need someone to play Centerfield. Think your boyfriend would be interested?\" \"How should I know?\" She chuckled slightly, deeply amused by her brother's obvious enthusiasm. Nothing got him excited like baseball. \"Why don't you ask him yourself?\" \"I would, but I don't know his phone number.\" Rob retorted a little crisply. \"What makes you think I know it.\" She commented innocently. \"Come on, Jos! Don't fool with me!\" Her brother exclaimed impatiently. \"You've probably memorized every detail of that guy's life. Now come on, give me his number.\" \"Okay, calm down.\" She admonished reprovingly. \"It's just a game.\" \"It's not just a game .\" He objected. \"It's a baseball game . Now can I please have Mr. C.'s number?\" \"It's 555-7265.\" She told him quickly, sending Sam a mischievous look. Sam watched her curiously, wondering who she was giving his number to. \"Thanks, Jos.\" Her brother acknowledged excitedly. \"See you later.\" \"But Rob...\" She tried to stop him but he was gone. Laughing she hung up the phone. \"What was that all about?\" Sam asked curiously. \"Rob wants to know if you would be interested in playing a pick up game of baseball today.\" Josie told him. \"Game starts at ten and they're looking for someone to play Centerfield.\" \"My specialty.\" He grinned cheekily. Then with a mild frown he noted. \"But you didn't tell him if I'd be interested or not.\" \"I told him he'd have to ask you himself.\" She told him seriously. \"So I gave him your number.\" \"But I'm right here.\" He pointed out, his lips twitching slightly as he fought a grin. \"I know that.\" Josie acknowledged. \"But Rob didn't give me a chance to tell him that. Once he got your number he was gone.\" \"Should I call him at home?\" Sam asked eagerly, excited at the thought of playing baseball with Rob and his friends. Josie shook her head and laughed. \"He'll call back once he realizes your not home.\" Just then the phone rang. \"Told you.\" Her eyes twinkled with amusement as she picked up the phone. \"Hello Rob.\" \"Mr. C.'s not home.\" Her brother informed her in a near panic. \"Do you know where he might be?\" \"Calm down, Rob.\" She urged, trying to suppress her building laughter. \"I can't calm down, Josie, this is serious!\" Rob told her with mild panic. \"It's two hours before game time and we don't have anyone to play Centerfield.\" \"You take baseball way too seriously, Rob!\" His sister commented as she rolled her eyes and gestured for Sam to come to the phone. \"Here's your missing Centerfield player.\" She handed the phone to Sam and warned. \"He's on a rampage again. He gets like this when he so much as smells a baseball game.\" Sam chuckled and took the receiver. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, Mr. C.!\" Rob greeted eagerly. \"How are you this morning?\" \"Fine.\" Sam smiled, noting the excitement in the other man's voice. \"Good.\" Rob acknowledged excitedly. \"You up for a baseball game?\" \"Sounds good to me.\" Sam replied, eagerness filling his own voice. \"Where should I meet you?\" Rob gave him the directions to the ball field telling him he'd meet Sam there at 9:30. \"The game starts at ten but we need a few minutes to plan our strategy.\" \"I'll see you then.\" Sam assured him with amusement in his voice. \"Oh, and Mr. C., a word to the wise.\" The younger man quickly added. \"Stay away from Josie's French Toast.\" \"Why's that?\" Sam asked, watching Josie as she pulled down a bowl and gathered the ingredients for the dish under discussion. \"Because it's far too addictive!\" Rob told him seriously. \"One piece is never enough and we have a very important game ahead of us! I'd hate to see us loose because our Centerfield player ate too much French Toast for breakfast!\" Sam shook his head and chuckled. \"I promise to do my best not to eat too much of Josie's French Toast.\" Josie looked at him and rolled her eyes heavenward. She knew exactly what her brother was telling Sam. She'd heard him rant about it before. After saying goodbye and hanging up phone he looked at Josie and started laughing. \"Is your brother always this passionate about baseball?\" Josie groaned and rolled her eyes again. \"You don't know the half of it. When he first heard that I was at South Glen South the first words out of his mouth were 'they have a killer baseball team'.\" Sam laughed again and settled on a bar stool while Josie moved into the kitchen to fix their breakfast. \"I know Scott has loved having him around the last few weeks. He says he's a very knowledgeable player, very talented too. Josie glanced over her shoulder to Sam, a thought formulating in her mind. \"Do you think that Coach Romano would be interested in hiring an assistant?\" Sam smiled broadly at the idea, immediately understanding what she was thinking. \"I think Scott would love to have Rob as an assistant.\" \"I'm wondering if we should approach Coach Romano about it before the big game.\" Josie mused, obviously still deep in thought. \"I'd hate to see the Rams disqualified from the winning the title because they had an overaged player on the team.\" \"I'll talk to Scott if you want.\" Sam offered. \"I might be able to persuade him to hire Rob as his assistant. Though, I'd probably have to tell him why Rob shouldn't play in the big game.\" Josie nodded. \"I guess under the circumstances it's hard to avoid.\" \"Don't worry, honey.\" He quickly assured her. \"Scott will keep our secret. And to be honest I think he'll be happy to have Rob working for him.\" \"I hope so.\" She smiled a little uncertainly. \"I know Rob would be thrilled. After all he lives, breaths and eats baseball.\" \"I kind of got that impression.\" Sam chuckled with amusement. \"So are you going to come to the game?\" Josie looked at him with surprise. \"You want me to come?\" \"Of course!\" He told her eagerly. \"It would be nice to have my girlfriend watch me play ball at least once in my life!\" She gave him another surprised look. \"You mean in the five years that you and Lara were dating she never once went to one of your baseball games?\" Sam shook his head. \"Not one. But then she hated sports. Her only interest, besides her career, was Operas. She loved Operas.\" Looking at Josie seriously he pleaded in a half-serious tone. \"Please don't tell me you love the Opera.\" Josie hesitated for a moment, pretending to be thoughtful before letting a slow grin spread across her lips. \"I've never been to an Opera, so I guess I couldn't really say.\" \"Good, then you don't know the boredom that you're missing.\" He exclaimed in delight. \"Looks like we'll never have a fight over going to the Opera.\" \"Or about going to baseball games.\" She added, removing some golden French toast from her griddle. \"How do you feel about hockey?\" He asked curiously. \"Black Hawks rule!\" She exclaimed, causing Sam to grin foolishly in return. As Josie placed the plate of French Toast before him he grabbed her around the waist and pulled her close. Kissing her cheek he exclaimed with great delight. \"Honey, if we can live on love, baseball and hockey we will be two of the happiest people in the world!\" \"I'm going to sit up in the bleachers and work on my story while you guys warm up.\" Josie told Rob and Sam as they walked from the cars to the ballfield. \"Maybe I'll get a wonderful idea and write a great award-winning article - or else maybe I'll just beat my head against my notebook a few times and crash down into the despair of writer's block.\" \"Don't worry, Josie.\" Sam quickly assured her, putting an arm comfortingly around her shoulders. \"I'm sure you'll come up with something brilliant. \"I have complete faith in you.\" \"Thanks, Sam.\" She gave him a grateful smile as he gave her a gentle squeeze. \"Just make sure that while you're doing all this brilliant brainstorming of yours that you don't forget to pay attention to the game.\" Rob admonished her seriously. Josie rolled her eyes heavenward and assured him. \"When you start playing, I promise to give your game my undivided attention.\" Looking up at her new boyfriend she added slyly. \"Especially when your Centerfield player is on the field.\" Sam grinned at her and leaned down to kiss her gently on the lips. \"Okay you two, none of that.\" Rob interrupted them, slipping completely into his Team Captain mode. With a wave of his fingers he dismissed his sister. \"Go write your story. I have to have a strategy meeting with my team.\" Glancing around them Josie commented sarcastically. \"Well, don't let me interfere with your important meeting. Especially since you and Sam are the only players here - for either team.\" \"That's fine.\" Rob told her seriously. \"That gives Mr. C. and I time to throw a few balls, get use to each others style. It'll help give us an edge on Doug's team.\" Josie just shook her head slightly. Looking at Sam she said. \"If he gets too obnoxious you have my full permission to hit him over the head with a bat.\" Sam chuckled with amusement.\" Hopefully it won't come to that, but thanks for the idea.\" Placing a gentle kiss on her lips he gave her another quick squeeze. Giving him a loving smile, Josie said. \"I'll be right over here if you need me.\" As the couple separated Rob encouraged his new friend. \"Come on, Mr. C. I'll pitch you a few practice balls.\" Tearing his eyes away from Josie Sam nodded and clasped Rob on the shoulder, an amused smile on his face. \"Rob, do me a favor will you?\" \"What is it?\" The younger man asked curiously. \" Please stop calling me, 'Mr. C' when were not in school.\" Sam requested. \"I'm not your teacher, I'm not even four years older than you and I'm dating your sister. I think it's okay if you call me 'Sam'.\" A broad smile split Rob's face. \"If that's what you want, Mr...Sam.\" Mr. C. nodded his head, a large grin on his face. \"It's what I want.\" \"Okay then, Sam, let's get on the field and I'll pitch a few practice balls to you.\" Sam chuckled in amusement as he followed Rob onto the baseball field. As they walked Rob talked animatedly about the upcoming game, about different strategies that he wanted to use and what some of his secret signals were. Sam found himself getting caught up in the young man's obvious excitement. It felt so good to be playing ball again. He'd given up playing baseball about two years ago in an attempt to appease Lara. She was always complaining that he was much more interested in playing ball with his friends than he was in coming to see her in New York. Tired of the repetitive argument, he'd finally quit playing ball - right before the big championship game. Lara had been delighted - for a while - that is until Hockey season started. Then she started in on him all over again about how he loved playing hockey more than he loved her. Again, trying to be the peacemaker he once again gave up something he loved to appease Lara. As Sam took a few practice swings with the bat that Rob had brought he stole a glance towards where Josie was typing away on her laptop. As he watched her he started to wonder if there might be a chance that he could spend his summer and winter months playing the sports that he loved so much. \"Sam!\" Rob's voice calling his name got his attention. Giving the younger man an apologetic look he asked. \"Sorry, what did you say?\" Rob rolled his eyes and huffed slightly. \"If you don't stop gawking at my sister we'll never win this game!\" \"Sorry.\" Sam apologized again, but then with a twinkle in his eye he added. \"But she's just so nice to gawk at.\" \"Hey, that's my sister you're talking about there pal! You'd better watch what you say!\" Rob pretended to threaten pointing a finger at Sam warningly. \"And don't let me catch you staring at her again.\" \"You won't.\" Sam quickly assured him before deliberately shifting his gaze to Josie. Rob chuckled in amusement as he called out. \"Good, then let's play ball!\" The two men hit the ball around for the next ten minutes, until the other players started to show. All of Rob's team was on the field warming up when Doug Archer and his players arrived. \"Hey, Geller!\" Archer greeted eagerly as he approached where Rob and Sam were talking. \"You ready to get your butt kicked?\" \"By you and what Army, Archer!\" Rob called back challengingly. Even though is words were dripping with venom his eyes were dancing with amusement. \"I don't need an Army to whip your sorry butts.\" Doug returned, both his tone and his expression mirroring his friend's. \"We'll see who's butt gets whipped by who.\" Rob exclaimed as he stepped up to the other man. \"Let's get this show on the road.\" \"And may the best team win!\" His opponent said with building excitement as he extended his hand to Rob. Grasping the offered hand Rob gave him friend a mischievous smirk and replied cheekily. \"Oh, don't worry. We will!\" \"He went to Yale for four years majoring in English Literature and minoring in Creative Writing. He played Left Wing on the Yale hockey team and graduated in the top ten of his class.\" \"Sounds like he's a very talented young man.\" Janet Geller commented, a broad smile on her face as her daughter whole-heartedly agreed with her. \"He is. He is so well-read - and so much fun. He always makes English class enjoyable. I'll never be able to look at Shakespeare the same way again. I've always enjoyed his plays, but now I love them.\" \"Are you sure its Shakespeare you love or your English teacher?\" Her mother teased, looking at her slyly. Josie blushed slightly and admitted. \"Both.\" Her mother gave her a warm smile and asked. \"So when do we get to meet this wonderful, talented, fun man of yours?\" \"He should be here any time.\" The young woman replied as she glanced at the clock on the wall. \"He wanted to go home and shower and change after the game and then he has to stop by to talk to Coach Romano about something.\" \"Coach Romano?\" Janet's brow puckered thoughtfully. \"Isn't that Rob's baseball coach?\" Josie nodded and lowered her voice as she replied. \"Sam and I talked about it this morning and we've decided to tell him all about Rob and me.\" \"What made you decide that?\" Her mother asked curiously as she set about chopping some vegetables for a salad. \"I was worried that if Rob played in the championship game on Monday night that the team could possibly be disqualified if it became known that they had an overaged player on the team.\" Josie explained as she popped a piece of celery into her mouth. \"Especially if they won the title.\" \"Rob's not going to be very happy with you if you get him kicked off the team.\" The older woman remarked knowingly. \"You know how seriously he takes baseball.\" Josie rolled her eyes in understanding. \"Oh, yeah! I think Sam knows it now too. He got a good dose of Rob's obsessiveness this morning during that little pickup game of theirs.\" Shaking her head she chuckled. \"I don't know what we're going to do about him.\" \"My question is what you plan to do about him and the championship game?\" Her mother questioned seriously. \"Sam's going to ask Coach Romano if he'd be interested in hiring Rob as an assistant.\" Josie explained. \"That way even after this assignment is over, Rob will still be able to be around the game he loves so much.\" Janet gave her daughter a look of approval. \"I'm sure Rob will love that.\" The younger woman shrugged slightly. \"It's the least I could do after all the help he's given me during this assignment. There's no way I could have ever gotten in with the cool kids on my own. If it weren't for Rob's help, I'd still be on the outside looking in; still wondering what it would be like to be popular. Even though its not all its cracked up to be, the experience of being accepted has helped me to put so many things into perspective that I never would have been able to if it hadn't have happened. Do you know what I mean?\" Her mother smiled and nodded. \"It sounds to me like you've finally found yourself. That you have finally experienced everything you wanted to experience in High School and have put it all in the proper place.\" Pausing thoughtfully for a moment her mother suggested. \"Maybe that should be the theme of your article.\" Josie pondered the idea silently for several moments, considering its possibilities. \"So, have you told Rob about this job idea yet?\" Josie shook her head. \"No, not yet. I want to wait to see what Coach Romano thinks about the idea first. If he's okay with it and everything is a go, then I'll tell Rob.\" Just then the doorbell rang, interrupting their conversation. \"That's him!\" Running a nervous hand through her hair and then over her clothes she asked anxiously. \"How do I look?\" \"Like a woman in love.\" Her mother commented, deeply amused by her daughter's obvious excitement. \"Now go and open the door for that wonderful young man of yours.\" Josie flushed slightly but quickly dashed off to obey, leaving her mother chuckling in the kitchen. She stopped briefly to check her reflection in the hall mirror before reaching the front door. \"Hi.\" She greeted warmly as she pulled the door open and found Sam standing on the doorstep. \"Hi.\" He smiled broadly in return. \"Why don't you come in?\" She invited, gesturing for him to come inside. Stepping inside Sam waited until Josie had closed the door behind him before producing a bouquet of flowers from behind his back. \"These are for you.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" Josie took the flowers and buried her face in them. \"They're beautiful.\" Lifting his hand to gently touch her face he whispered softly. \"Not as beautiful as you.\" Leaning down he planted a loving kiss on her smiling lips. Josie deepened the kiss by wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling him closer. They were still locked in each other's embrace when Rob descended the stairs two at a time. \"Not again!\" He groaned in mock-disgust as soon as he saw the pair. \"Do you guys mind, we're going to be eating soon.\" Looking at her younger brother Josie commented very sweetly. \"If it bothers you that much than you're more than welcome to go someplace else - any place else.\" \"And miss harassing you.\" Rob argued wickedly. \"Not on your life.\" Giving Rob a sly look Sam remarked seriously. \"If I were you, Rob, I would be thanking your sister instead of harassing her.\" \"Why's that?\" The other man asked curiously. \"Well, let's just say that because of your sister you are now the new Assistant Coach of the South Glen South baseball team.\" With a slight smile he added. \"With a little help from me, of course.\" Rob stared at the pair for several moments, deep puzzlement engrained on his face. \"I don't understand. What do you mean I'm the new Assistant Coach? I'm just a student there. It doesn't make sense.\" \"After the ball game, I went and talked to Scott Romano. I told him everything about you and Josie and Josie's undercover assignment.\" Hugging Josie to him he added, giving her a tender look. \"I even told him about Josie and I.\" \"You did?\" Rob looked at Josie, trying to gauge her reaction to that piece of information. To his surprise it didn't seem to fizz her in the least. It was like she already knew that Sam was going to tell Coach Romano the news. Seeing her brother's expectant look Josie jumped in to explain. \"I was thinking that if the Rams won the title Monday night and it became public that you - an overage player had played, then maybe they'd be disqualified and loose the championship. But I also knew that you would be very disappointed, if not upset, if you couldn't have something to do with that game. So, between Sam and I we came up with the idea to see if we could get Coach Romano to hire you as his assistant.\" \"And he was more than thrilled about the idea.\" Sam told him honestly. \"He had been dreading the thought of loosing you after graduation. He was happy to learn that you were twenty-three and a real baseball nut.\" \"I'm the Assistant Baseball Coach at South Glen South.\" A bright smile spread across his face as he repeated. \"I'm the Assistant Baseball Coach at South Glen South.\" He repeated that line five more times, his excitement building with each repetition. By the time he finished he was virtually bouncing up and down. Impulsively he lunged at Sam and Josie, wrapping an arm around each of them and giving them an exhurberant hug. \"Thanks you guys! You're the best!\" \"You're welcome.\" Sam laughed, slapping the other man good-naturedly on the back. \"I'm sure you'll make a great coach.\" \"Just don't drive the players nuts with your obsessiveness.\" Josie warned teasingly as she hugged him back. Rob gave her a mock-injured look. \"I am not obsessive! I'm dedicated.\" Josie rolled her eyes. \"You're way past dedicated! You're closer to obsessive compulsive.\" Before Rob could respond Josie grabbed Sam's hand and encouraged. \"Come on, I want to introduce you to my parents. I assure you, they're better behaved than Rob is.\" Rob frowned at her as she lead Sam into the kitchen where her mother was peeling some potatoes. \"Mom, I'd like you to meet Sam Coulson...\" Smiling shyly at Sam she added. \"...my boyfriend.\" Janet noticed with pleasure the delighted look that appeared on Sam's face at her daughter's choice of title. \"Sam, this is my mother, Janet Geller.\" \"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Sam.\" Janet gave him a warm smile. \"Josie has told us so much about you - especially after last night.\" She shot her daughter a teasing look causing the young woman to blush again. \"It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Geller.\" Sam said, returning her warm smile with one of his own. \"Josie's told me a lot about you too.\" Handing her a paper bag he held in his hand he added. \"This is for you and Mr. Geller.\" Janet accepted the bag and pulled out a bottle of red wine. Reading the label she recognized it as being a very expensive wine. \"Thank you, Sam.\" She acknowledged kindly. \"That was very thoughtful of you.\" Setting the bottle on the counter she addressed her daughter. \"Why don't I put those flowers in a vase for you while you take Sam outside to join the guys at the barbecue. Maybe he can keep your father and your brother from sacrificing dinner.\" The two Geller women chuckled knowingly at the family joke. \"Isn't sacrificing dinner the whole point of barbecuing?\" Sam asked innocently, his eyes dancing with mischief. Both Josie and Janet rolled their eyes in mock-exasperation. \"Looks like we've got another charbroiler.\" Janet moaned in mock-despair. \"He should fit in very nicely with those two renegade chefs out back.\" Josie tugged on Sam's hand and encouraged. \"Come on, I want to introduce you to my dad.\" Sam's face twisted into an expression of exaggerated fear as he said to Josie's mother. \"It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Geller. I hope to see you again.\" \"Oh, I'm sure you will.\" Janet assured him, an amused grin on her face. \"Oh, and just in case you need to know - the fire extinguisher is in the closet by the back door.\" \"Thanks.\" He acknowledged. \"I'm sure that piece of information will come in handy. You never know when something might catch on fire in the back yard, especially with three charbroilers on the loose.\" Janet laughed as her daughter pulled Sam out of the kitchen and towards the back door. Another chuckle escaped as she heard her daughter scold gently. \"Of all the guys in Chicago, I had to find one as nutty as my brother!\"[Chapter 3] Tom Geller flipped the steaks on the barbecue, listening attentively to the conversation going on between Sam and Rob. The three men were casually sitting around the barbecue shooting the breeze while Josie and Janet put the finishing touches on the rest of the meal. Tom was welcoming the opportunity to get to know Sam better without Josie around. He'd received glowing reports about him from both Josie and Rob, but he wanted to judge for himself what kind of man was interested in his only daughter. From what he could tell so far, he seemed like a very likeable person: amiable, outgoing, fun and obviously well educated. Closing the lid on the barbecue he returned his barbecuing utensils to their place and reclaimed his chair beside Sam. After waiting for a lull in the conversation between the other two men, Tom casually remarked. \"So, Sam. I understand you went to Yale.\" \"That's right.\" Sam nodded in confirmation, giving the older man his full attention. \"Good school Yale.\" Tom commented thoughtfully. \"When did you graduate?\" \"Class of 1995.\" The Yale graduate told him. \"And how long have you been teaching?\" The senior Geller inquired. \"I've been teaching for three years now.\" Sam smiled, knowing instinctively that he was being 'checked out' by the other man. \"I started teaching at South Glen South the fall of 1996.\" \"Josie says you're a very good teacher.\" Tom told him and smiled slightly when the younger man blushed faintly at the compliment. \"That means a lot to me coming from her.\" Sam admitted truthfully. \"I'm sure I don't have to tell you that my daughter thinks very highly of you.\" Mr. Geller informed Sam seriously. \"Almost since the first day she met you she's been singing your praises.\" His face darkened slightly. \"It's the first time I've seen her show any real interest in a guy since High School.\" Sam, understanding the reason for the other man's stormy look said. \"Josie told me about what happened to her in High School, especially at Prom.\" When both Tom and Rob gave him a look of complete surprise Sam continued, his tone becoming very serious as he looked at Josie's father and said. \"Mr. Geller, I want you to know that I would never do anything to hurt Josie. I think she is the most amazing woman that I have ever met. She's smart, she's funny...\" He chuckled slightly as he thought about her 'performance' at Delloser. \"...she's crazy. And I have never seen someone with as much talent for writing as her. I have a great deal of respect for your daughter, sir, which is why I've spent the last two months wishing that she wasn't my seventeen year old student and that I was allowed to act on my growing feelings for her.\" \"What would you have done if she was seventeen?\" Tom asked curiously. \"If I'm not mistaken Josie said that you'd told her at the Prom that there was something that you wanted to discuss with her. And that was before she had told you she was twenty-five.\" Sam blushed slightly and admitted. \"I was planning to tell her to truth. That I wanted to be part of her life after High School was finished, even if it was just as a friend. I had decided that I cared about her too much to loose her, but at the same time I didn't want to put any pressure on her for a serious relationship if she wasn't ready. I was more than willing to wait for her even if it took a few years.\" \"What attracted you to Josie?\" Her father pressed, his eyes never leaving the young man face. \"What made you pick her out from the other girls in your class, do you think?\" The English teacher chuckled slightly as he thought about the other girls in his Senior Lit class. \"For one thing, none of those girls have any sweet clue what Literature is. Their biggest literary achievements are reading a complete article in Teen Beat or one of their fashion magazines. The first day Josie came to my class I asked if any of my students knew what 'pastoral' meant. One girl replied that that's what they do to milk.\" Tom and Rob both chuckled at that. \"Josie was the next one to raise her hand and not only did she define the word but she also gave the origin of the word.\" He looked thoughtful for a moment before adding. \"I think I was hooked from that moment. There was something about her that I just connected with. I don't know if it was because she shared the same love of literature and the written word that I did or if it was her spunky personality that attracted me. All I know is that I was hooked before I even realized what was going on. Suddenly I found myself counting the minutes until my Senior Lit class, I attacked my correcting assignments with a renewed energy because I was eager to read what Josie had written for me.\" He blushed slightly as he admitted. \"I have a folder in my briefcase full of copies of all of Josie's assignments because I hated giving them back to her. I felt that each one was a piece of her, like a gift from her soul. With every assignment I read I found myself falling more and more in love with her, which I have to admit scared me to death given I thought she was my student.\" Pausing briefly he continued. \"I felt like such a heel for falling in love with one of my students. I'd read about cases of such a thing happening, but I never thought it would ever happen to me. I never thought I'd ever fall in love with a seventeen year old.\" \"But Josie's not seventeen.\" Tom pointed out. \"She's twenty-five.\" \"I know that - now.\" Sam acknowledged. \"But I didn't know that when I was beating myself up for having feelings for my underaged student. I guess my only consolation is that since she's twenty-five she obviously seemed like a very mature seventeen-year-old.\" He looked directly at Tom and said. \"I can't begin to tell you how relieved I was when she told me she was twenty-five. It was like this huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I was finally able to freely tell her how I feel about her and not feel like I was 'robbing the cradle' so to speak.\" \"But what are you going to do next week?\" Tom asked curiously. \"Josie said that nobody at her office knows that she's told you the truth yet, so she'll be going to class on Monday just as if nothing's happened.\" \"Well, I guess I'll have to rely on my High School Drama Club days and do some pretty convincing acting for the camera.\" Sam remarked with a wary smile. \"So are you enjoying yourself?\" Josie asked Sam, as she set the plate she had just washed in the drip tray. \"Very much.\" He told her as he leaned down to place a kiss on her lips before picking up the plate and drying it. \"I really like your family. They're very nice.\" \"What were you, Dad and Rob talking about before supper?\" She asked curiously as she set another plate in the tray. Sam smirked slightly in amusement as he remembered the conversation. \"I was going through part two of the Geller men's 'Are You Eligible To Date Josie' test.\" Josie gave him a look of alarm. \"They didn't give you the third degree, did they? Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry! I didn't think Rob would feel the need to grill you any further after your game today. He was so impressed by your playing that I thought he'd leave you alone now. I am so sorry.\" \"Sweetheart, take it easy.\" Sam put his hands on her arms and looked into her distressed face. \"It's okay. Rob wasn't the one asking the questions, it was your father.\" \"My father!\" Her eyes widened in horror. \"That's even worse. Rob I can understand, but my father! Oh, Sam. What you must think of them.\" \"Josie, it's okay.\" He gave her a reassuring smile. \"I didn't mind. Really. He was only trying to find out more about me, that's all. It wasn't anything any concerned father wouldn't do.\" \"Concerned?\" Josie repeated in surprise. \"What could he possibly be concerned about?\" \"I think he's concerned about you getting hurt again.\" He told her seriously. \"He's just trying to protect you.\" \"But you'd never hurt me.\" Josie argued softly. \"Especially not like that.\" \"I know that and you know that, but your Dad was just trying to reassure himself of that.\" He told her seriously. \"He loves you very much and just wants the best for you.\" He touched the side of her face with his hand and stroked her cheek tenderly. \"And so do I.\" They smiled at each other for a moment before Sam leaned down and kissed her. The sound of the doorbell ringing finally brought them up for air. \"I'll get it!\" Rob called from the other room. \"So, what was the final result of the test?\" Josie asked as she returned to her dishes. \"I passed.\" He told her proudly. \"Meaning?\" She pressed, giving him a mischievous smile. \"Meaning that I'm allowed to do this.\" Leaning down he kissed her again. Josie responded by sliding her arms around his neck and pulling him close. The pair were completely lost in their kiss until an urgent whisper interrupted them. \"Josie! Sam!\" Looking at her anxious looking mother Josie whispered back. \"What is it?\" \"Gus and Anita are here!\" Her mother informed her seriously. Josie's eyes widened as she heard Gus' gruff bark. \"Geller!\" She had just enough time to propel an astonished Sam behind the kitchen door before Gus and Anita walked in. Jumping back from the door with a guilty look on her face she managed to stammer. \"Gus! Anita! What are you doing here?\" \"We're selling Girl Guide cookies.\" Gus snapped sarcastically. \"Why else would I be here? I came to talk to you about your story.\" \"What about it?\" Josie asked, her eyes darting quickly to Sam's, who she could see from behind the door, then back to Gus'. To everyone's surprise, especially Josie's, Gus' response came in a softer tone. \"Look, Geller, I know you have feelings for this Coulson guy and that he seems to have feelings for you. After listening to that conversation that you and that meddlesome brother of yours had last night.\" He narrowed his eyes and pointed a finger at her as he added. \"Which I know was had entirely for my benefit.\" His expression softened again as he continued. \"I've decided that if you can come up with another story by next Monday's deadline I'll let you do it.\" Pointing his finger at her again he informed her. \"But it better be something wonderful or else we go with the original idea. I don't intend to loose my job just because you fell in love with your story. Do you understand me?\" Josie nodded her head and then threw herself at her boss, wrapping her arms around his neck to give him a grateful hug. \"Thank you, Gus! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" \"You're welcome, Geller.\" He told her as he returned her hug awkwardly. Then after a couple moments he pushed her away with his usual rebuke. \"Don't make me send you my memo on inter office hugging.\" Josie and Anita exchanged knowing smiles over Gus' shoulder. They both knew that with Gus most times his bark was worse than his bite. \"Well, we'd better go.\" He told Anita a trifle gruffly as he turned on his heels and left the kitchen. Anita and Josie immediately followed him. \"So what are you guys up to this evening?\" Josie asked curiously noting with great interest the way they were both dressed. Anita was wearing a calf-length blue floral print skirt with a blue short sleeved sweater while Gus was dressed in black dress pants and a hunter green polo shirt. Josie had never seen them looking nicer. Looping her arm through Gus' Anita looked at her best friend and announced proudly. \"Gus and I are going to the movies.\" Josie raised an eyebrow in surprise but managed to smile brightly at the pair as she exclaimed. \"That's great! What are you going to see?\" \"There's a little movie theater downtown that's replaying Titanic .\" Anita told her, her eyes dancing with delight. \"Oh, I love that movie!\" Josie exclaimed, her eyes mirroring her friends. \"I've seen it about a dozen times, but I still cry when Jack dies.\" \"Well thanks, Geller.\" Gus mumbled grumpily. \"You just told me the ending.\" Josie gaped at him in surprise. \"Are you telling me that you haven't seen it yet? I thought everybody had seen Titanic by now. It was one of the biggest, most widely played movies of this century!\" \"Geller, the last movie I went to was my Senior year at Dartmouth. I saw Back to the Future .\" With an annoyed grunt he huffed. \"And I'm still waiting to find out where they were going at the end. It's been fourteen years, you'd think they'd have released a sequel by now!\" Josie and Anita both gaped at him in surprise. \"Ah, Gus.\" Anita began hesitantly. \"They made a sequel to Back to the Future already.\" \"They have?\" Her date looked at her in astonishment. \"About ten years ago.\" She informed him. \"They made two of them actually.\" \"You mean to tell me that there are three Back to the Future movies now?\" Gus looked at both women for confirmation. \"That's right, Gus.\" Anita nodded. \"Oh.\" He looked thoughtful for a moment. Josie couldn't help but chuckle in amusement. \"You really do have to get out more.\" To her surprise Gus merely nodded his head in agreement. \"Maybe I do. Maybe I do.\" Then looking at Anita he asked. \"Are you ready to go? The movie starts at seven.\" \"Ready.\" She nodded. Then releasing Gus' arm she moved to Josie and pulled her into a warm embrace. \"I'll call you later.\" She told her cheerily before whispering softly. \"And I want all the details.\" Josie looked at her in astonishment as Anita released her. Swallowing hard Josie searched her best friend's face anxiously. Seeing only delight and mild curiosity she nodded and in a controlled voice that completely belied her beating heart she said. \"I'll be home.\" Anita gave her a reassuring smile and squeezed her arm, silently telling her that her secret was safe. \"Don't forget, Geller.\" Gus addressed as he opened the front door. \"Staff meeting Monday at four. And try not to be late this time! You know how Rigfort can get when people aren't on time.\" \"Don't worry, Gus.\" Josie quickly assured her boss. \"I'll be there at four o'clock sharp.\" Then as Anita followed Gus out the door she called out. \"Have fun.\" At her words Anita poked her head back inside and said. \"You too.\" Then with a sly wink she was gone. Staring at the closed door Josie started to shake her head and giggle slightly. \"What's so funny?\" Sam asked as he emerged from the kitchen. \"She knows.\" Was Josie's simple reply. \"Knows what?\" He looked at her curiously. \"She knows about us.\" She told him in mild disbelief. \"I don't know how she knows, but she knows.\" \"Think she'll tell Gus?\" He asked with concern, putting a comforting arm around her shoulders. Josie shook her head. \"There's no chance of that. Anita's my best friend. She'd never do anything to hurt me.\" \"But she is dating your boss.\" Sam pointed out still a little worried. Josie looked at him with an amused look on her face. \"There are on a date, aren't they?\" Sam chuckled slightly and teased. \"Well, I'd call going to a movie a date, but what do I know? I'm only an old English teacher, I'm not as hype as you young High School kids.\" Josie laughed and slapped him lightly on the chest. \"You don't understand. Gus and Anita have always been antagonists. They fight all the time. The day before I started this assignment he threatened to fire her - for what would have been the ninth time. He's fired her eight times already.\" When Sam's eyebrows raised in surprise she chuckled and added. \"After the first couple of times it's just become an office joke. There's actually a pool speculating the date when Gus will reach ten.\" Then looking at the closed door she added. \"But judging the way things are looking now, they just may not reach ten.\" \"Sounds like they have an interesting relationship.\" Sam laughed, then slyly asked. \"Is that why she moonlights as 'Pam Kitterman – Sex Ed Expert'?\" Josie blushed and laughed at the memory of Anita's sex lecture a few weeks ago. \"Well, I don't know if I'd call her an 'expert'. But she is definitely well acquainted with the subject.\" \"And certainly not shy about it either.\" He remarked with a chuckle. \"Tell me about it.\" Josie rolled her eyes. \"Believe me, I've heard her comment on the subject many, many times.\" With a thoughtful look on her face she mused. \"I wonder how she found out about us.\" \"Guess you're just going to have to ask her.\" Sam replied, giving her shoulders a gentle squeeze. Josie nodded in agreement, greatly anticipating her upcoming conversation with her best friend. It was eleven-oh-one when Josie stepped into her apartment that night. After leaving her parents place at nine-thirty, she and Sam had arranged to meet up at Perks, the coffee shop they'd been at the night before, for a coffee. They'd spent an hour talking and laughing and getting to know each other better. Josie found that the more she got to know him, the more in love she fell with him. He was so warm and caring and fun. She loved the way his eyes sparkled when he laughed. And the tender looks that he would give her was enough to make her heart melt. She felt so happy and so scared at the same time. It was liked she'd told Anita and Cynthia that day at lunch - she felt so lucky to have such a precious gift as Sam's love and so scared that one day she was going to loose it. She'd just flopped down wearily on the loveseat when the phone started to ring. \"There's Anita.\" She remarked knowingly as she pulled herself off the sofa. Answering on the fifth ring she greeted the caller brightly. \"Hello, Anita.\" \"Hello nothing!\" Her friend returned on the other end. \"Don't waste time on unimportant things I want details!\" \"About what?\" Josie asked innocently as she settled herself on a stool beside the phone. \"About what?\" Anita repeated in surprise. \"Don't play coy with me young lady! I want to know what that gorgeous English teacher of yours was going hiding behind your kitchen door?\" \"What?\" Josie nearly choked at her friend's words. \"How did you...?\" \"I saw him in the kitchen will you when Gus and I first came in the house.\" Her friend told her proudly. \"The two of you were somewhat preoccupied at the time.\" Josie blushed as she remembered the kiss that she and Sam had shared just before Gus and Anita had come into the kitchen. \"So come on, give me details! What happened and when? And I gather that Gus doesn't know about it since you hid that poor boy behind the door.\" \"No, he doesn't know.\" Her young friend admitted. \"And he'll probably kill me once he finds out.\" \"Not if you get that alternative story in by next Monday.\" Anita assured her. \"And don't worry, your secret is safe with me. But I want details! Every single tiny, juicy detail!\" \"Okay, okay, I'll talk!\" Josie laughed at her friend's insistent tone. \"But only if you promise to give me all the details on you and Gus.\" \"Deal.\" Anita answered quickly. \"Now, come on. Spill your guts!\" Laughing Josie complied. \"Well, you remember last night when I was experiencing those 'technical difficulties'?\" \"Yeah.\" Anita acknowledged. \"Well, they weren't really 'technical difficulties'.\" The younger woman admitted. \"I cut the feed.\" \"I knew it!\" Anita cried triumphantly. \"I knew you cut the feed! So what happened? Did Guy really cut in on you and your teacher?\" \"No.\" Josie replied. \"That was just Rob's story for Gus' sake. What really happened was that after I told Sam...\" \"Sam? Ooh, were on a first name basis now are we?\" Her friend teased excitedly. \"I should hope so.\" Josie exclaimed before baiting. \"I am his girlfriend after all!\" She laughed in amusement as her friend took the bait hook, line and sinker. \"What? How did that happen?\" Smiling Josie continued her story. \"After I told Sam that I had something to tell him and cut the feed he told me that he had something to tell me too.\" Josie grinned as she remembered the tone in his voice as he'd said it. It was so full of emotion - and so was his face. \"After the song was over we went outside to talk.\" She deliberately paused to drive her friend crazy. Sure enough Anita's eager \"And?\" quickly filled the phone. \"And...I told him everything.\" The younger woman concluded. \"Everything?\" Anita prompted. \" Everything! \" Josie replied with great emphasis. \"And what did he say?\" \"Well, it turns out that he's just as crazy about me as I am about him.\" Josie told her. \"Oh, Josie!\" Anita exclaimed delightedly. \"I am so happy for you! I knew I was right! I knew he loved you! So when's the wedding?\" Josie blushed slightly at the question when she remembered what Sam had said to her the night before. \"He did tell me that he wants to marry me someday.\" \"He told you that!\" Her friend exclaimed in great surprise. \"He actually brought up marriage? When?\" \"Just after he asked me to be his girlfriend.\" Josie told Anita seriously. \"He said that one day he wanted me to be his wife.\" \"Oh, Josie, you are so lucky.\" Her friend said, a trifle enviously. \"You have found yourself one terrific guy. I'm jealous.\" \"Speaking of guys,\" Josie started to smile expectantly. \"What's going on with you and our fearless leader? I tell you, I leave the office for two months and I'm out of the loop. Some friend you are! Not even bothering to tell me that you and Gus are now an item.\" \"We're not an item !\" Anita denied emphatically. \"I've just been helping Gus catch up on some of his work the last couple of weeks.\" \"Uh, huh.\" Was her friend's only reply. \"I swear that's all.\" The older woman exclaimed somewhat defensively. \"You know what Shakespeare would probably say.\" Josie questioned mischievously. \"What?\" \"'The lady doth protest too much'.\" The young woman teased impishly. Figuring she'd better quit while she was ahead Anita continued her story. \"Last night while we were going through some story ideas I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies with me tonight. At first he balked, reminding me of his policy about 'interoffice dating', then he complained that he had too much work to do. It took a little convincing, but he finally agreed to go with me.\" \"And?\" Josie pressed curiously. \"And we had a wonderful time.\" Anita even blushed slightly as she admitted. \"He even put his arm around my shoulders when I started crying at Jack's death.\" \"Gus?\" Josie couldn't believer her ears. \"Gus Strauss?\" \"Gus.\" Anita smiled and confirmed. \"So, what happened after that?\" \"He invited me over to watch all three Back to the Future movies tomorrow afternoon.\" Anita told her, trying to keep the grimace on her face out of her voice. \"Now that sounds like a romantic afternoon.\" Josie laughed in amusement. \"I know, doesn't it!\" Anita laughed sarcastically. \"But hey, its a start. At least this time he asked me .\" \"That's definitely a step in the right direction.\" Josie acknowledged with a chuckle. \"Maybe there's hope for him yet.\" \"Maybe.\" Her friend agreed secretly hoping that there might be some hope for her and Gus. \"So what are you and Mr. Coulson doing tomorrow?\" \"I'm helping him move.\" Josie replied excitedly. \"Move?\" Anita's eyes widened in surprise. \"Don't tell me he's moving in with you already!\" \"No!\" Josie quickly exclaimed, her cheeks flushing at the thought. \"He's moving to an apartment closer to the school.\" \"Uh, huh.\" Anita acknowledged expectantly. \"It's a cute little place over on Elmwood Drive.\" Her friend continued. \"Three blocks away from you.\" Anita mused thoughtfully, then in a teasing tone added. \"Convenient.\" \"Anita, he sighed the lease for the apartment two months ago!\" The younger woman informed her seriously. \"It's just a coincidence that its so close to my place.\" \"I bet it is.\" Her friend replied, completely unconvinced. \"What do you mean by that?\" Josie asked, sounding a little annoyed at her friend's knowing remark. \"I just mean that I'll bet you anything that if you asked him if part of the reason he took that apartment was to be near you he'd say 'yes'.\" Anita told her seriously. \"But two months ago we hardly knew each other.\" Josie pointed out. \"Besides how would he know my address?\" \"Josie, it would hardly take a genius to find out your address.\" Her friend told her. \"Besides, he probably had it in his Student Roster. The office probably gave it to him shortly after you enrolled.\" \"I don't think I had anything to do with his choice of apartment.\" The younger woman continued to deny. \"You won't know unless you ask him.\" Anita told her. \"But...\" \"Ask him!\" The older woman exclaimed firmly, a hint of exasperation in her voice. \"All right, I'll ask him!\" Josie cried out in surrender. \"Good.\" Anita grinned triumphantly into the phone. Sam woke up early Sunday morning to the sun shinning in his bedroom window. Today was the day he was moving into his new apartment. He'd taken possession of it on the fifteenth of the month, but with preparation for finals and the Prom he hadn't had the chance to do much in the way of moving. He'd planned on doing the bulk of his packing done yesterday since his best friend, Jonathan was coming with his pickup truck today to help him move his stuff over to the other apartment. But when Rob Geller had invited him to join the family for a BBQ yesterday evening, Sam knew that his packing would have to wait until later. There was no way he was going to miss the opportunity to spend time with Josie. Especially now that things had finally gotten straightened out between them. He'd been so pleased when she'd offered to help him pack today. That meant spending another day with her. He knew he was going to have to savor each and every moment of the day since starting tomorrow they were going to have to go back to pretending that they were just student and teacher. He didn't know if he'd be able to make it through a day, let alone a week of pretending that she didn't mean anything more to him than any of his other students. Like he'd said to Josie's father the night before, he was going to have to rely on his High School Drama Club days to get through the coming few days. His one consolation was the fact that at least they both knew how they felt about each other. There were no more guessing games or charades with each trying to figure out where they stood with the other. Despite the fact that they couldn't yet announce it to the rest of the world, they both knew that they were in love and that regardless of what happens, they would be there for each other. Closing his eyes he replayed the memory of their first kiss – her first kiss. His heart had started to pound so hard when she'd told him that he was the first man that she'd ever really kissed. He knew that she had given him the most precious gift in the world. Nobody but him had ever kissed his Josie. \"And nobody ever will.\" He whispered solemnly to himself. Glancing at the clock beside his bed he'd decided that he'd better get up and moving. Josie would be there in less than an hour and he still needed to shower and get dressed before she arrived. Throwing the covers off of him he got up and began his morning routine. It was scarcely half an hour later when Sam heard a light knock on his apartment door. Quickly pulling a white T-shirt over his head he padded out to the living room in his bare feet. Looking through the peephole he was both surprised and delighted to find Josie on the other side of the door. \"Good morning, beautiful.\" He greeted as he pulled open the door. \"I wasn't expecting you yet.\" \"I know I'm early.\" She quickly apologized. \"I hope I'm not disturbing you.\" Holding up a cardboard tray she held in her hand she explained. \"I just thought we could have breakfast together before we got started. I got coffee and muffins.\" \"You're a lifesaver.\" He smiled broadly at her. \"I haven't had a chance to put the coffee on yet and I'm almost dying for a cup.\" He gestured for her to come in, closing the door behind her. Relieving her of the tray he leaned down and gave her a gentle kiss on the lips. When he pulled away he grinned mischievously and teased. \"That's what I call an appetizer.\" Josie blushed slightly and playfully responded. \"Wait until you see what I brought for the main course.\" Sam gave her a surprised smile and led her to the couch. \"So what did you get?\" He asked curiously as they settled on the sofa. \"I got three different kinds of muffins, since I wasn't sure what kind you liked.\" Taking the paper bag off the tray she opened it and asked. \"Would you like blueberry, apple cinnamon or chocolate chip.\" \"Touch choice.\" Sam commented thoughtfully. \"But I think I'll start with the chocolate chip.\" Josie grinned slightly as she pulled a chocolate chip muffin from the bag. \"That's my favorite kind.\" \"Did you want it?\" He asked, offering it back to her. Shaking her head she pulled another chocolate chip muffin out of the bag. \"Thanks, but I got two of each kind.\" \"Just to make sure that you got your morning sugar fix, eh?\" He teased as he started peeling the paper off the bottom of his muffin. As they ate Josie glanced curiously around the apartment, taking in the collection of sports pictures and trophies that lined the walls and several shelves, each item proving just how much Sam loved athletics. There were also several shelves and bookcases lined with books, evidence of his deep love of literature. Josie always felt that you could tell a lot about a person by how they decorated their apartment. And everything she saw confirmed to her the things she loved and admired most about Sam. \"Are you casing the place?\" Sam teased as Josie's eyes passed over the room a second time. Josie blushed and dropped her gaze to the muffin she was holding. \"I'm sorry.\" She apologized contritely. \"I didn't mean to snoop.\" \"Hey, it's okay.\" He quickly told her, reaching over and lifting her chin so she'd look at her. \"I was only teasing. I don't mind you looking around. In fact, you're free to look around as much as you like.\" Josie's eyes lit up slightly as she scanned the room again. When her eyes fell on his many trophies she rose and moved closer so she could examine them better. She couldn't help but smile when she spotted one that read: Most Improved Player 1982 . Picking it up she turned towards him and grinned. \"Did you get this one after your father bought you that Gordie Howe helmet?\" Sam chuckled slightly and nodded. \"I told you I got better.\" As Josie returned the trophy to its place he commented seriously. \"You know I should have realized when I told that story that you were older than seventeen.\" \"Why's that?\" She asked curiously as she continued to examine his trophies. \"Because you were the only one that showed any sort of recognition when I mentioned Gordie Howe.\" He told her with a smirk. \"All the other kids gave me blank stares and confused looks like I was from some other planet or something.\" \"You are.\" She teased as she returned to his side. \"You're old .\" \"Gee, thanks.\" He drawled slightly, then looking at her wickedly he added. \"But don't forget, you're almost as old as I am.\" \"Don't remind me.\" She moaned in exaggerated agony. But then looking at him shyly she admitted. \"But I'd rather be twenty-five and your girlfriend than seventeen and only your student.\" Sam leaned over and gave her a tender kiss. \"Me too.\" He assured her pulling away slightly. \"So, do you still play any sports?\" Josie quizzed as she picked up her muffin again. \"Besides pick up baseball games with my obsessed brother and his friends.\" Sam shook his head sadly and admitted. \"I use to, but not in the last couple years.\" \"What happen?\" She asked with concern. \"Did you get injured?\" \"No.\" He shook his head again. \"Lara didn't like me playing sports. She felt that I should be using that time to visit her and find a job in New York instead of wasting it on hockey or baseball. So, after too many fights to count, I gave up baseball and hockey hoping to make her happy. And it did, for a while then she was on me about other things.\" \"What kind of things?\" Josie asked, but when Sam hesitated she blushed and apologized. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be nosey. It's none of my business.\" \"Sure it is, Josie.\" He quickly assured her. \"Everything about me is your business. I have nothing to hide from you, it's just that some things are harder to talk about than others.\" \"I know what you mean.\" Josie sympathized thinking back to when she told him about her first High School experience. As if reading her mind, Sam nodded and said. \"You do.\" They smiled at each other for several moments before turned his attention back to his coffee and replied to her previous question. \"Lara didn't think that my job was good enough. She wanted me to give up teaching High School and apply at one of the local colleges or universities in New York. She thought that being a Professor was a much higher social standing than just being a Teacher. I didn't agree with her. I love being a high school teacher. I love being around teenagers, helping to guide them in their future careers. I don't want to give it up.\" The last few words were said with decided firmness. Reaching over and putting a hand on Sam's knee Josie gave it a reassuring squeeze. \"And you shouldn't. Sam, you're a wonderful teacher. Everybody loves your class. You make literature come to life. Even Gibby, Kristen and Kirstin say how much they love your class, and they don't know anything about Shakespeare except for what you've told them.\" She chuckled slightly at a memory. \"In fact, Kristen thinks that Hamlet is a ham and lettuce sandwich.\" \"A ham and lettuce sandwich?\" Sam repeated in amusement. \"I see. I guess those blond roots are real. Unlike some peoples.\" He glanced at the top of her head knowingly. \"Sam!\" She exclaimed, slapping his arm in mock annoyance. When their laughter subsided Josie reverted back to their original topic. \"I think you should join a baseball team this summer.\" \"Really?\" He looked at her in surprise. \"Sure, why not.\" She assured him. \"After all, you have two whole months off, what better way to spend them then playing ball.\" \"But I want to spend time with you too.\" He told her seriously. \"Don't worry, we'll spend lots of time together.\" She assured him. \"I'll be there cheering you on at all your games.\" \"Really?\" He gave her a broad smile. \"You'd come watch me play?\" \"Of course.\" She nodded. \"After all, I won't have much else to do after Rigfort fires me for botching up this story.\" Sam slid an arm around her shoulders and pulled her to him. \"You're not going to get fired. You're going to find a really great story. One that will blow their socks off and make them wonder why on earth they ever doubted you. I promised I'd help you, don't forget and I will. We're in this together and we'll get through this together.\" Josie turned her head to look at him tenderly. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" He told her before leaning down and kissing her gently. When he pulled away Josie snuggled her head against his shoulder and told him honestly. \"I really think you should join a team, though. If I do by some chance write a good enough story not to be fired than I'll be busy at the office during the week, so you'll have lots of time to yourself. Working out with a team may just be the thing to keep you out of trouble.\" A teasing tone edged her voice as she added. \"Keep you away from the girls too.\" \"What are you talking about?\" He replied, his tone also light and teasing. \"Don't you know that girls just flock to the ball fields to meet the handsome and talented players. I'll probably have to fight them off with a stick.\" \"I wouldn't doubt it.\" Josie agreed, feel her stomach clench up slightly at the thought. Noting the change in her tone Sam tightened his arm around her shoulders and promised. \"I only have eyes for you, sweetheart. You're the only girl that I want.\" He kissed the side of her head before adding. \"You have given me back so much of my life that I had let Lara take away, you've made me whole again in a way that nobody else could. And I will love you always.\" \"I love you too.\" She turned and kissed him again, her heart nearly exploding with the love she felt for this man. They finished their breakfast while sharing some of their hopes, dreams and thoughts about a variety of different topics. Finally, after draining the last of his coffee, Sam sighed and glanced around the large living room. \"Well, I guess we should get at it. Jon and Joanna will be here in a couple of hours to help move stuff to the new place.\" At the mention of Sam's new apartment Josie remembered what Anita had said the night before about his new place being remarkably close to Josie's. Remembering her promise to Anita Josie took a deep breath and asked the question that she and her friend had been debating about the night before. \"Sam, can I ask you a question?\" Seeing the nervous look on her face he immediately gave her his full attention. \"Of course you can, sweetheart. I've told you that you can ask me anything you want.\" \"It's about the apartment that you're moving to.\" She explained. \"Last night when I was telling Anita about it she made the observation that it was not too far from my place. Now I told her that it was just a coincidence, but she seemed to think that it was much more than that.\" A deep blush appeared on her cheeks as she added. \"She made me promise to ask you if I had anything to do with you decision to take that apartment, but I told her she was crazy. You signed the lease in April, so there's no way I could be the reason – could there?\" Sam chuckled slightly at her agitated look and asked. \"Did you two wager anything on the outcome of this question?\" \"No.\" Josie replied, curious at the question. \"Why?\" \"Because you, my dearest loveliest Josie would have lost the wager.\" He gave her a broad smile. \"Really?\" She gave him a surprised look. \"You really picked that apartment because of me?\" \"I had narrowed it down to two different apartments.\" He explained seriously. \"But that night when I was marking papers and marking the grades down in my book, I noticed that your address was just a few blocks away from the one, so that's the one I decided to go with.\" Josie flushed slightly as she remarked. \"I guess I'll have to tell Anita that she was right. I'll be in for a big 'I told you so'. Oh, well, I think I can handle it. In fact I'm kind of glad that I have to hear it.\" Sam gave her a tender smile. \"Me too.\" \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" Josie asked, changing the subject a few moments later. Smiling knowingly he asked. \"Want to pack up all my books?\" He gestured towards the two large bookcases in the corner of the living room that were full of books. \"Sure!\" Josie's eyes sparkled eagerly as she took in the collection of books adorning his shelves. \"It'll give me a chance to scope out your selection and your tastes.\" \"Go to it.\" He encouraged, knowing that that was a task that she would thoroughly enjoy. As Josie pulled a couple of volumes from the case he added. \"When you're done there, there's more books in the bedroom.\" He pointed towards the room in question. Curious, Josie moved towards his bedroom, her eyes widening in awe at the sight of the large bookcase beside his bed. Even the headboard held a few volumes of their own. \"This is incredible!\" She exclaimed as she moved closer to the shelves so that she could read the titles they held. Sam chuckled at her enthusiasm and turned to grab a box. He had just started wrapping some of his trophies when there was a knock at the door. Setting the trophy in the box he rose and answered the door. \"Jon? Joanna?\" He looked at his best friend and his wife in surprise. \"What are you doing here? I wasn't expecting you until after ten.\" \"We thought we'd come over earlier and help you do some packing.\" Jon replied as he and Joanna entered the apartment. \"We figured you'd probably need all the help you could get.\" Glancing around the apartment he chuckled. \"Looks like I was right.\" \"I was just getting started.\" Sam told him defensively. \"It's still early.\" \"And it'll take you all day by yourself.\" Jon commented as he shrugged out of his jacket and laid it over the back of the couch. \"I thought you were going to start packing yesterday.\" \"I was.\" Sam admitted. \"But I ended up having other plans.\" \"I see.\" Jon nodded as he grabbed an empty box and a stack of newspapers. \"Procrastinating Sam strikes again.\" \"I wasn't procrastinating!\" Sam objected seriously. \"I had something very important come up.\" \"Uh, huh.\" Jonathan acknowledged in a teasing manner causing Sam to grab and pillow and toss it at him playfully. \"Okay, boys.\" Joanna interrupted with a good-natured laugh. \"We're here to work, not play. Sam, what should I do? Want me to pack up your books?\" \"Actually, somebody's already doing that.\" Sam told her a broad smile lighting his face. \"Someone else is here?\" Jonathan asked in surprise. \"Who?\" Before Sam could answer a crash came from the other room which was punctuated by a yelp of surprise. Concern creased Sam's brow as he rushed to his bedroom door. \"Honey, are you all right?\" As he disappeared into the other room Joanna turned to her husband and whispered tersely. \"I thought you said that Lara was out of the picture.\" \"I thought Sam told me she was.\" Jonathan told her honestly. \"I'm sure he said that they had broken up last week.\" Before either could comment again, Sam emerged from the bedroom with a blond-haired woman in his arms. \"Sam, I'm fine!\" The young woman was protesting adamantly as he headed towards the couch and gently set her down. \"It was just a little bump.\" \"It wasn't just a little bump.\" He told her seriously. \"You got quite a nasty bump there.\" He gently touched the growing lump on the top of her head and suggested. \"Maybe we should have a doctor look at that.\" Josie shook her head and protested even harder. \"All he's going to tell me is that I have a bump on the head. Sam, I'm fine, really. It's just a little bump. All I need is an ice pack and a couple Advil and I'll be fine.\" \"Are you sure?\" He continued to fret. \"I'm positive.\" She assured him. \"Trust me, I have a hard head. It comes from Rob bouncing so many foul balls off me when we were kids.\" Sam gave her a slight smile before going for the ice pack and the pills. When he left the room Josie moaned slightly and reached up to gingerly touch the tender spot on her head, flinching slightly when her finger made contact. Lifting her other hand she glared angrily at her attacker, which she'd retrieved off the floor just before Sam had arrived. Shaking the object slightly she scolded. \"I'll never forgive you for this.\" She chuckled slightly to herself and gave her head a gentle shake. It was then that she realized that she wasn't alone. \"Oh, hello.\" She acknowledged when her eyes fell upon Jonathan and Joanna, who were standing behind the couch watching her curiously. Josie blushed slightly under their scrutiny and lifted the large, hardcover book she held in her hand. \"The Count and I had a little accident.\" Jonathan grinned slightly and commented. \"I certainly wouldn't want to tangle with the Count of Monte Cristo . Especially not with a cover that hard looking.\" Josie smiled and ruefully rubbed her head again. \"It doesn't just look hard. That'll teach me to reach for a book that's over my head.\" The three of them laughed lightly at her comment as Sam returned with ice, pills and water.\" \"Here you go, sweetheart.\" Sam said as he handed her the pills and the water. Sitting down beside her he watched as she swallowed the pills and then drained the glass of water. Setting the empty glass down on the coffee table she reached for the ice pack, but Sam moved it out of reach. \"Just a sec.\" He admonished as he settled himself back into the corner of the couch, swinging one of his legs up. He then reached for Josie, motioning for her to slide back towards him. She hesitated nervously for a moment until Sam lightly teased. \"I promise not to bite.\" Giving him a shy smile she finally obliged and carefully slid herself towards him until her back was leaning against his chest. Once she was settled, Sam wrapped one arm around her to pull her closer while he lifted the other to gently apply the ice pack to the bump on the side of her head. \"How's that?\" \"Fine.\" Josie blushed and cast her eyes down shyly until Sam brushed a gentle kiss on the side of her head. Lifting her eyes to meet his she gave him a gentle smile. \"Okay, Sam Coulson, you have some big time explaining to do.\" Jonathan's voice interrupted the love-struck pair, causing Josie to jump and Sam to chuckle. Turning their attention from each other and to the other couple Josie's cheeks flushed bright red in embarrassment while Sam's smile nearly split his. \"Josie, may I present two of my oldest and dearest friends, Jonathan and Joanna Harper. Jonathan's the impolite one.\" Sam added the last in a stage whisper. \"Nice to meet you.\" Josie acknowledged shyly. \"Jon, Jo may I present the very lovely and talented Josie Geller.\" With a proud smile he added. \"Who also happens to be my girlfriend.\" \"Girlfriend?\" Jonathan and Joanna repeated in unison. \"Did you say girlfriend?\" Jonathan added, his eyebrows raising in complete surprise. Sam nodded his head in confirmation. \"Does this mean that Lara's history?\" Joanna pressed eagerly. \"Lara and I broke up last week.\" Sam told her matter-of-factly. \"Finally!\" Joanna sighed gratefully. \"I'm so glad that you finally came to your senses about her and got rid of that little no good hussy once and for all. She was definitely not good enough for you.\" Josie raised her eyebrows in surprise. \"I didn't think she seemed all that bad.\" \"How well do you know her?\" Joanna questioned suspiciously. \"I don't, not really.\" Josie admitted honestly. \"I only met her for about two minutes at Delloser about a month ago. I had just run into Sam and she joined us.\" \"And let me guess.\" Joanna interrupted. \"She was dressed in a suit probably with a mini skirt looking like she'd just stepped out of a beauty parlor and she hung onto Sam's arm as if she was afraid that you were going to snatch him up right then and there. Oh, and let me not forget to mention that she was probably complaining about something or someone.\" \"Actually,\" Josie cast a hesitant look at Sam before confirming. \"You're right about everything.\" \"Of course I am.\" The other woman commented confidently. \"I've watched her act like that for the last five years. She treated Sam and all his friend's like dirt.\" \"I take it that you and Lara are not very good friends.\" Josie observed seriously. \"That's the understatement of the century.\" Jonathan replied with a knowing laugh. \"There's definitely no love lost between Jo and Lara. But then again, there isn't much love lost between Lara and a lot of people, including Sam.\" He looked at his best friend seriously. \"You're right.\" Sam admitted honestly as he lifted the arm he had around her waist so he could stroke her hair tenderly. \"I never knew what love was until I met Josie.\" When she turned her head to smile at him lovingly he added. \"I can honestly say that I was never in love until she came into my life.\" Josie blushed slightly and looked down in embarrassed pleasure. \"So when and how did you two meet?\" Joanna asked curiously as she sat on the couch at Sam and Josie's feet, while Jonathan took the armchair near them. \"We met in March.\" Sam told them. \"Josie came into my Senior Lit class as a transfer student.\" \"A transfer student?\" Both Jonathan and Joanna looked at Sam in alarm. \"Josie's one of your students?\" Joanna couldn't believe her ears. What was Sam thinking? He could get into so much trouble if the school found out that he was dating one of his students. And what about when Josie's parents found out? Would they think that Sam was trying to take advantage of his position as her teacher? This whole situation spelt nothing but trouble. \"On paper, Josie is one of my students.\" Sam admitted truthfully. \"But in reality she isn't.\" \"Excuse me?\" Joanna gave him a completely perplexed look. \"Want to run that one by me again?\" \"It's a long story.\" Sam told her seriously. \"But it's up to Josie as to whether or not you can hear it.\" Tightening his arm around her waist again he asked. \"Is it okay if I fill them in on everything?\" Josie hesitated for a moment, then replied cautiously. I guess it's okay. They are two of your closest friends and besides they wouldn't know Gus, so they couldn't tell on me for telling you the truth.\" \"Gus who?\" Jonathan asked curiously. \"Gus Strauss.\" Josie told him. \"Gus Strauss!\" Jonathan exclaimed in obvious surprise. \"Augustus Strauss?\" \"You know him?\" Josie asked nervously. \"Never heard of him.\" Jonathan admitted honestly, his eyes twinkling mischievously as he gave her a teasing smile. Josie couldn't help but laugh at the expression in Jonathan's blue eyes. Turning her head towards Sam she smiled and told him happily. \"I think I'm really going to like you're friends!\"[Chapter 4] \"Finis!\" Josie exclaimed as she finished sealing and labeling the final box. \"Finally!\" Joanna heaved a dramatic sigh of relief and collapsed into the recliner wearily. \"I had no idea how much stuff one lone bachelor could have. He had what? About five boxes of books alone?\" \"Six.\" Josie corrected from where she was still sitting on the floor. \"Plus three for his hockey and baseball trophies.\" \"Well, if you weren't aware of it before, than I'm sure you're convinced of it now.\" Joanna commented with a laugh. \"Sam is both an avid bookworm and a fanatic sports nut.\" \"Well that suits me just fine.\" Josie remarked honestly. \"Because I'm a bookworm and a sports nut too.\" \"I'm glad.\" Joanna admitted seriously, giving the other woman a warm smile. Ever since Sam had told her and Jon the story behind how he and Josie had met, Joanna had found herself liking the younger woman more and more. What had impressed her the most about their story, was the fact that Josie was willing to give up her dream of being a reporter because she loved Sam much more. She was obviously a young woman who had her priorities straight. That was definitely one thing that she had on Lara, who put her career above everything and everyone else. \"You know, speaking of sports.\" Josie commented thoughtfully. \"One thing I was kind of hoping to see was Sam's Gordie Howe helmet.\" \"His Gordie Howe helmet?\" Joanna repeated in surprise. \"Yeah, the autographed one his dad bought him during his first year of peewee hockey.\" Josie explained. \"Doesn't he still have it? I got the impression that it meant a lot to him.\" \"It did mean a lot to him.\" Joanna acknowledged before adding bitterly. \"Which is way Princess Lara threw it out.\" \"What?\" Josie exclaimed, her eyes widening in surprise. \"She threw it out? Why?\" \"Because she was angry that he was spending so much time playing hockey instead of visiting with her.\" Joanna explained, her tone still crisp. \"Sam told me that she didn't like him playing baseball and hockey.\" Josie told her. \"But that certainly didn't give her any right to throw out Sam's stuff.\" \"Lara does whatever Lara wants to do.\" Joanna remarked tersely. \"She doesn't care in the least who she hurts. In fact I think she relishes hurting people.\" \"No wonder you didn't like her.\" Josie acknowledged. \"That was a big part of it.\" The other woman agreed. \"There was never much love lost between me and Lara, even in the beginning. Jonathan and I had been dating since we were seventeen, yet Lara still viewed me as a possible rival for Sam's attention since he and I were good friends. I love Sam, but he's never been more than like a brother to me.\" \"So I don't have to view you as a possible rival then.\" Josie teased, giving the other woman a mischievous smile. \"Not in the least.\" Joanna replied with a reassuring smile. \"Good, because I'd like to be able to view you as a friend.\" The younger woman admitted honestly. \"I'd like that too.\" Joanna assured her warmly. The two women smiled at each other as Jonathan and Sam entered the apartment. \"How's it coming?\" Sam asked the two women as he collapsed on the couch and reached for Josie's hand. \"We just finished packing the last box.\" Joanna informed him. \"All there's left to go is the furniture and about four boxes.\" \"Well, Matt and Scott are suppose to be here about five to help us load the big furniture.\" Sam told Jonathan. Checking his watch Jonathan remarked. \"They should be here anytime then. It's almost five now.\" \"Well I suppose we could move some of the lighter pieces down to the truck.\" Sam suggested. \"That way when Matt and Scott get here we just have a few pieces left to take out.\" \"Sounds like a plan.\" Jonathan acknowledged as he pulled himself back to his feet. \"The sooner we get this done the sooner we can get something to eat. I'm starved.\" As the two men moved off to organize the furniture Josie moved from the floor to the couch. \"I didn't realize that packing up an apartment was such hard work.\" \"Do you have your own place, or do you still live at home?\" Joanna asked curiously. \"I have my own place.\" Josie replied. \"I moved out of home about five years ago when I started working at the Chicago Sun-Times. I figured I was making my own money, so I might as well be out on my own.\" \"That's quite a mature attitude for a twenty year old.\" Joanna commented, deeply impressed by her words. No wonder Sam thought he was a mature seventeen year old. She probably was when she was seventeen. \"Do you have any brothers or sisters?\" \"I have one brother.\" Josie replied. \"His name is Rob. He's twenty three and he still lives at home.\" \"Boys never seem to mature as fast as girls do.\" Joanna commented. \"Rob's okay.\" Josie defended. \"In fact a lot of times I don't know what I'd do without him. He's a pretty terrific brother as far as younger brothers go. In fact he's helped me out a lot on this assignment. There's no way I could have gotten in with the 'in crowd' without his help. He's always been popular, where as I've always been a geek.\" \"I wouldn't call you a geek.\" Her new friend quickly objected. \"I think you're a very nice, well educated young woman who is absolutely perfect for Sam. I can't tell you the last time I've seen him so happy. You obviously have a good effect on him.\" Josie blushed slightly, pleased yet embarrassed by the compliment. \"Thanks.\" Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of a phone ringing. \"That's not mine!\" Sam called from the other room. \"All my phones are packed in boxes!\" Josie jumped up and grabbed her purse off the kitchen counter. Just as she suspected the ringing was coming from inside. \"Hello?\" Josie answered after fishing her cellphone out of her bag. \"Hey, Jos.\" Rob's voice greeted her on the other end. \"Hi Rob, what's up?\" There had been something about his greeting that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. \"I'm at Nana's.\" He told her seriously. \"I just ran into Aldys and she was very upset.\" \"How upset?\" Josie queried. \"Crying upset.\" Rob replied. \"Why is she so upset?\" Josie asked with deep concern. \"It seems that I wasn't the only one that saw you and Sam kissing outside of Prom the other night.\" Her brother reported grimly. \"Aldys saw us?\" Josie's eyes widened in alarm. \"Apparently.\" Rob confirmed. \"She came out looking for you after she saw you leave with Mr. C and then heard through the grapevine that you were going to be talking about college. Wanting to ask him something about her own application she followed you out. I guess she got out there just in time to find you two kissing on the bench.\" \"But didn't she see you come out and wonder why you weren't surprised or upset by what was happening?\" His sister asked, trying to put the whole situation together. \"She left before I came out.\" He replied, then after a brief pause added. \"She's really upset about it, Jos. She even asked me if I thought she should report Mr. C. to the school authorities.\" Josie closed her eyes against that piece of information. Reaching up she pinched the bridge of her nose as she tried desperately to think of a solution to the situation. \"Where is she now?\" \"She's still here.\" Rob told her. \"I promised her that I'd help her get to the bottom of this.\" He paused again before carefully suggesting. \"I think you need to tell her the truth, Josie. She's really mad at Sam right now. She feels hurt, angry and betrayed by her favorite teaching and worried out of her mind about you.\" \"I'll talk to her.\" Josie assured him. \"Think you can convince her to meet me at my place? I'll tell her everything now.\" \"I'll have her there in twenty minutes.\" He promised. \"Thanks, Rob.\" Josie acknowledged. \"You may have just prevented Sam from loosing his job. I owe you one.\" \"You owe me a whole lot more than one.\" He teased lightly. \"After this assignment of yours is over I expect a big payback for all my hard work.\" \"How about all you can eat pizza and tickets to any baseball game of you choice.\" She offered with a knowing grin. \"Deal!\" He accepted eagerly. \"See you in twenty.\" \"Bye, Rob.\" As Josie hung up the phone Sam and Jonathan came through the bedroom door with Sam's mattress between them. \"Who's phone was that?\" Sam asked curiously as they propped the mattress against the wall. \"It was mine.\" Josie told him a little distractedly. \"Who was it?\" He pressed, noting her preoccupation. \"It was Rob.\" She told him, finally making eye contact with him. \"He just ran into Aldys at Nana's and she was very upset.\" \"What about?\" Sam asked with obvious concern. Looking into Sam's worried face she said. \"She saw us kissing outside of Prom.\" Sam's face paled slightly as Josie continued. \"She's thinking of reporting it to the school authorities.\" Seeing how white his face had gone she quickly put a comforting hand on his arm as she assured him. \"I'm going to talk to her. I'm going to tell her everything before things getting any more out of hand.\" \"Are you sure?\" He asked, his concern deepening. \"What about your job?\" \"My job is of least importance here.\" She told him seriously. \"If Aldys goes to the school authorities with this, then your reputation and moral character will be called into question. Chances are they'll want to investigate and even though I'm not really seventeen, the whole thing could get ugly. You know how people love a scandal and even if the accused is innocent they'll still try to tarnish your reputation just to make themselves look good.\" Looking at Sam she shook her head determinedly. \"I will not let you go through that. The only thing to do is to stop this thing before it gets started. Like I told you at Prom, you're much more important to me than my job is. I can always get working somewhere else, doing something else if I have to but I will not let you be forced out a teaching because of me.\" Sam, mildly comforted, pulled her into his arms and hugged her tightly. \"You are amazing, Josie Geller.\" Hugging her tighter he added. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She told him as she hugged him tightly back. \"And don't worry about anything. I'll get this whole mess straightened out right away.\" I won't let you get in trouble because of my stupid mistakes.\" She promised him firmly. \"I won't!\" About twenty minutes later there was a gentle knock on Josie's apartment door. Opening the door, Josie found a visibly upset Aldys standing on her doorstep. \"Thank goodness you're okay.\" Aldys surprised her by pulling her into a tight embrace. \"I've been so worried about you since Prom. I've tried calling you about a hundred times since then, but all I ever got was your machine. I left you about a dozen messages but you never called me back. I thought maybe Mr. Coulson had kidnapped you or something.\" \"I'm fine.\" Josie quickly assured her friend as they released each other. \"Why don't you have a seat.\" She offered as she reached over to close her apartment door. \"You and I have a lot to talk about.\" \"I should say we do.\" Aldys agreed as she waited for Josie than followed her to the couch. \"What was going on at Prom between you and Mr. Coulson? How could he kiss you like that? Josie, what are you going to do?\" \"Calm down, Aldys.\" Josie gently admonished her friend as she reached out to put a comforting hand on her arm. \"It's not what it looks like.\" \"Not what it looks like?\" Aldys exclaimed in disbelief as she looked at her friend incredulously. \"Josie, I came outside and fond you and Mr. Coulson kissing . You and Mr. Coulson, our teacher . I just don't understand how he could do such a thing. I always thought he was a very straight-laced, by the book teacher who would never use his position to take advantage of a student. Josie, I trusted him and I don't trust many people.\" \"Aldys!\" Josie cried, trying to get her distraught friend's attention. \"Before you have Mr. Coulson tarred and feathered I have something that I need to tell you.\" \"What?\" Her friend looked at her anxiously. \"What is it?\" Josie hesitated for a moment while she collected her thoughts then she looked her friend right in the eye and admitted. \"I'm not a high school student. I'm really an undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times.\" \"What?\" The younger woman exclaimed, her eyebrows raising in surprise. \"You're a reporter?\" Nodding in confirmation Josie continued to explain. \"I graduated from High School eight years ago, then went to Northwestern for three years studying English Literature and Journalism. For the last five years I've been working as a copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times, but my greatest dream is to be a reporter. Well, in March my dream finally came true when our publisher, Mr. Rigfort decided he wanted to have an undercover story done on high school kids today and since I was the only member of the staff that looked about the right age I was given the assignment. And that's what brought me to South Glen South.\" \"So Mr. Coulson knew that you weren't his student, but an undercover reporter when he kissed you on Friday?\" Aldys commented, the anxiety that she'd been feeling for days finally giving way to understanding. \"I had just told him the truth about myself.\" Josie informed her. \"He sure didn't waste anytime acting on that information.\" Her friend observed, her eyes narrowing slightly. \"Are you sure there wasn't anything going on between you two before that.\" \"There was something going on.\" Josie admitted honestly. \"There was a lot of admiration and appreciation and respect. And I'll admit that there was a certain amount of attraction too.\" Pausing for a moment she contemplated her next words. \"Because you've been such a good friend to me since we met, and since we've caused you so much heartache and worry the last few days I'll confide something to you. I've been in love with Sam almost since the first day I met him.\" \"You have?\" Aldys exclaimed in surprise then pressed curiously. \"And how did he feel about you?\" \"Sam also felt a certain attraction for me, but contrary to what you first thought he was beating himself up for it.\" Josie told her. \"He felt like a real heal for falling for one of his students. He's still not completely comfortable about the thought but consoles himself with the fact that since I'm really twenty-five than I probably acted like a very mature seventeen year old.\" \"You did.\" Aldys admitted. \"That's one of the reasons I liked you so much. You weren't flighty and shallow like most of the other girls. Though I must admit I was starting to doubt your maturity when you started hanging around with the 'lemmings'.\" Josie chuckled in amusement at the term. \"Trust me, I would have much sooner hung around with you and the Denominators. But I had to try to 'infiltrate' the in-crowd for my story.\" \"I have to admit that I was a little hurt when you started hanging around with them.\" Aldys confided. \"When we met, I thought that I had finally found a best friend that I could hang around with. One that seemed to have the same interests as me and who was viewed by the popular kids the same way that I was. But when you got accepted by them I felt like I really was a loser.\" \"You're not a loser!\" Josie quickly assured her. \"You're smart and fun and you have a lot more going for you than Gibby, Kirstin or Kristen.\" \"Really?\" The younger girl looked at her friend hopefully. \"Really.\" Josie confirmed. \"And I hope that even though we're not the same age we can still be really good friends.\" Aldys hesitated for a moment before asking a little shyly. \"Would you mind if I still considered you my best friend?\" \"I'd be honored.\" Josie assured her. \"And I'd be happy to consider you one of mine. That is if you don't mind sharing the title with someone else.\" \"If she doesn't, I won't.\" Aldys assured her. \"Maybe someday the three of us could be best friends.\" \"Quite likely.\" Josie agreed with a knowing smile. \"Anita is a very big hearted, loving person.\" \"When do I get to meet her?\" Her friend asked eagerly. \"Actually you already have.\" Josie told her with a mischievous grin. \"I have? When?\" \"You remember 'Pam Kitterman'?\" The older girl asked, her eyes dancing with fun. \"You mean the Sex-Ed speaker we had?\" Aldys asked in a puzzled tone. \"That's the one.\" Josie nodded. \"'Pam' was actually my friend Anita Brandt who happened to be in the wrong place at the right time.\" Aldys laughed at the humor behind that story. \"She did a good job. She must be well acquainted with the subject.\" \"And how.\" Josie exclaimed knowingly. \"Just don't get her started. But I have to tell you, the fact that Pam is actually Anita is a secret that only four people know about and we want to keep it that way.\" \"Only four people?\" Aldys repeated, raising an eyebrow in surprise. \"You and me and I'm assuming Mr. Coulson are three, but who's the fourth?\" \"Rob.\" Josie told her. \"Rob?\" Again surprise showed on the younger girl's face but then after a moment her expression turned thoughtful. \"What's the deal with you and Rob anyway?\" \"What do you mean?\" Her friend asked curiously. \"Well, he arrived shortly after you do and instantly you too are as thick as thieves and then next thing I know the two of you are in with the popular kids.\" Aldys commented, her eyes narrowing with mock-suspicion. \"If I didn't know better I'd swear I smell a rat.\" \"I know Rob can smell bad, but I don't know if I'd call him a rat.\" Josie teased lightly. Rising to her feet she moved to pick up a photo of herself and Rob that was taken at his graduation. Handing it to Aldys she said. \"Rob is my younger brother. He became my self-appointed popularity manager after hearing me moan about not being able to get into the in-crowd. He was always popular in school, were as I wasn't.\" When Aldys handed her back the photo she looked at it warmly and said. \"Rob's been pretty great through all of this.\" \"How old is Rob?\" Aldys asked as Josie returned the picture to it's spot. \"Twenty-three going on fifteen.\" Josie laughed as she sat down in the armchair. \"Actually, he's not that bad.\" Hesitating slightly her friend finally asked. \"I'll be eighteen in six weeks. Do you think he'd be interested in going out with an eighteen year old?\" Josie gave her friend a surprised look. \"Aldys Wells! Don't tell me you have a crush on Rob!\" The blush on her cheeks gave her away. A delighted smile spread across Josie's face. \"That's great!\" A relieved smile tugged at Aldys mouth. \"You really think so?\" \"Of course I think so!\" Josie assured her. \"I think you'd be good for Rob, as long as you like baseball, pizza and baseball, in that order.\" \"I love pizza and I'm a pretty big Cub fan.\" She told her friend. \"Well than you and my brother should get along just fine.\" Josie laughed. \"Speaking of Rob, where is the big nut?\" \"Waiting down in the car.\" Aldys said. \"He said he'd drive me home after we talked.\" \"That was nice of him.\" Josie commented as she got up and walked to the window. Looking out she laughed and reported. \"He's down there talking to his car.\" Aldys jumped up and joined her at the window. \"He was doing that on the way over too. I've never had a three way conversation that included a car before.\" Josie laughed. \"He actually talked to Bambi while you were in the car? That is even weirder than him talking to it when he's alone. I always knew my brother was strange, but now I'm thinking he's insane.\" \"He's not that bad.\" Aldys defended causing Josie to look at her in amusement. \"What?\" \"Girl, you've got it bad!\" Josie teased as she gave the other girl a warm smile. \"I'm starved!\" Jonathan exclaimed as he flopped down on the couch, which was now sitting in Sam's new apartment. \"You guys ready to go get something to eat?\" \"I'm ready!\" Matt Reilly exclaimed as he flopped down beside his friend. \"I'm more than ready!\" Scott Romano echoed sitting in the recliner. \"How about you, Sam?\" \"Uh, huh.\" A distracted Sam grunted from his spot before his living room window. From there he had an unobstructed view of the front door of his apartment building. \"Sam? Earth to Sam!\" Matt called out, trying to get his friend's attention. When Sam looked at him blankly he asked with concern. \"Are you okay? You seem so distracted today.\" \"I'm fine.\" Sam replied, not very convincingly as he turned his attention back to the window. \"Sam, everything will be fine.\" Joanna told her friend comfortingly as she approached him and put a hand on his arm. \"She'll get it all straightened out.\" \"I hope so.\" He said with deep feeling as he continued to look out the window. Than after a moment he turned his gaze to her and added firmly. \"Because giving her up isn't an option, Joanna and I now that that's what it'll come down do if the school finds out about us. I won't loose her, Joanna. I won't !\" \"I'm sure it won't come to that kind of decision.\" Joanna assured him sincerely. \"Josie said she was going to handle everything and I trust her to do that. She's not going to let anything happen to you or your job, Sam. I think she made that perfectly obvious.\" \"I know.\" He nodded. \"I guess I just have to have faith in her.\" \"I know I do.\" She told him honestly. Sam gave her a warm smile, but before he could say anything a knock at the door caused him to jump slightly. \"That's probably her.\" Joanna commented softly. Sam nodded. It was all he could do as he was trying desperately to keep from flying to the door. He managed to keep himself rooted to his spot by the window while Matt opened the door. \"Well hello there, good-looking.\" Matt grinned broadly at the blond-haired woman he found standing out in the hallway. \"How can I help you?\" \"Is this Sam Coulson's new apartment?\" Josie asked, suddenly worried that she'd gotten the wrong address. \"Yes it is.\" Matt confirmed with a nod. \"Are you his new pizza delivery girl?\" He gestured to the pizza boxes that she held in her hands. Josie chuckled slightly. \"I guess you could call me that. Though I do have a little help.\" She glanced at Aldys and Rob who were also carrying bags of food. \"We brought supper.\" \"Well then come in.\" Matt opened the door wider and welcomed them in. \"I can never turn away a beautiful woman, especially one carrying an arm load of pizzas.\" After the trio entered the apartment Matt closed the door and then relieved Josie of her burdens. \"Here, let me take those. I'll just go and put them in the kitchen and then when I get back maybe you and I can get better acquainted.\" He winked at her before disappearing into the other room an amused Aldys and Rob following him with their own bundles. \"Who was that?\" Josie asked Sam when he appeared at her side. \"That's Matt Reilly. He's a bit of a flirt, but he's harmless.\" Sam told her, a thoughtful expression on his face. \"What's wrong?\" She asked when she noted the expression. \"Can I assume from the fact that you brought Aldys over that she's okay with what you told her?\" Sam asked, a hint of worry in his tone. \"She was perfectly okay with everything once I explained to her what was really going on.\" Josie assured him. \"In fact she's very happy for us and still wants to be friends.\" Sam heaved a great sigh of relief and pulled Josie tightly to him. Burying his face in her hair he said. \"That's good, because I knew that if push came to shove that I could never let you go no matter what the consequences.\" Pulling back to look into her face he smiled. \"I love you, Josie Geller. I love you very much.\" \"I love you too.\" She gave him a broad smile. Sam smiled back and leaned down to give her a gentle kiss on the lips. \"Hey!\" Matt's loud exclamation interrupted the kissing pair. When Sam looked at him curiously he said. \"Get your own girl! I saw her first!\" \"Sorry Matt, but I saw her way before you did!\" Sam told his friend seriously. \"Oh yeah?\" Matt challenged. \"How way?\" \"Way way!\" The other man replied. \"I met her back in March.\" \"Okay, I'll give you that you met her first.\" His friend conceded. \"But I still put first dibs on her when she walked through the door.\" \"Sorry, pal.\" Sam grinned slyly at his friend. \"But I had a prior claim on her that superceded your claim.\" \"What do you mean?\" Matt asked curiously. \"What I mean is, Matt I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Josie Geller.\" Sam told his friend proudly. \"Girlfriend?\" Matt repeated in surprise. \"What happened to Lara?\" \"We broke up last week.\" His friend informed him. \"She and I are completely finished.\" \"Yes!\" Matt exclaimed happily as he pumped a fist in the air. \"There is a god!\" \"Matt!\" Joanna cried in a shocked tone. \"Watch your mouth!\" \"Yes mother!\" Matt stuck his tongue out at Joanna before turning his attention back to Sam. \"Well, since you finally ditched that witch of a Lara than I guess I can let you have Josie.\" He gave a dramatic sigh. \"I hope you realize what a sacrifice this is. A beautiful woman like this doesn't come along just everyday.\" Josie blushed a hot red, which managed to deepen even more when Sam echoed. \"Don't I know it.\" \"Enough of this nonsense.\" Joanna interrupted, seeing how embarrassed Josie was getting. \"You guys were all complaining earlier how hungry you were. Why don't we eat before everything gets cold.\" \"I'm with that suggestion!\" Jonathan acknowledged as he jump off the couch and headed for the kitchen. \"Last one there gets to eat the crumbs!\" \"And he's not kidding.\" Coach Romano joked as he followed Jonathan into the other room. \"Come on, everyone.\" Joanna urged the Matt, Rob and Aldys into the kitchen. \"We'd better get in there before Jon and Scott eat it all.\" \"They'd better not eat all my anchovies!\" Rob called as he disappeared into the other room. \"Anchovies!\" Matt's face screwed up into a pained grimace. \"Don't tell me you actually ruined a good pizza by putting anchovies!\" \"But of course!\" Rob replied. \"What better way can you think of to ensure that you get a pizza all to yourself.\" As the rest of them disappeared into the kitchen Josie moved to follow them, but Sam stopped her by grabbing her by the hand. Josie looked at him curiously for several moments. \"What is it, Sam?\" She finally asked when he didn't say anything. Raising a hand to her cheek he gently stroked it before finally saying. \"I just wanted to thank you. I know how hard it must have been for you to tell Aldys the truth. I can't tell you how much that meant to me, Josie. After spending five years with a person who sacrificed everything for her career I can't tell you how nice it is to be with someone who would sacrifice her career for someone else. Now don't get me wrong, it's not that I expect you to sacrifice your career for me. I want your dream of being a reporter to come true. But it means a lot to me to know that if push came to shove that you would give up your career for me. Because I know that if push came to shove I'd do the same for you.\" Josie gave him a warm smile before surrendering completely to his loving kiss, the pair soon becoming completely oblivious to the excited din of their friends in the kitchen. Josie smiled as her doorbell rang bright and early Monday morning. When she'd gotten home last night there had been a message on her machine from Anita dying to find out how things had gone at Sam's. After filling her in on all the details of the day, including the answer to the question she'd raised the night before, Anita had filled her in on her day with Gus. \"I don't want to watch another Christopher Lloyd movie as long as I live!\" She moaned to Josie after she finished her tale. \"I could barely tolerate that guy before today, now I absolutely can't stand him!\" \"He's not that bad.\" Josie had commented. \"Certainly not one of my favorite actors, but I certainly don't hate him.\" \"That's because you haven't been forced to sit through six hours of him.\" Anita pointed out. \"You'd soon change your tune. Maybe I'll suggest to Sam that he have a Back to the Future marathon too.\" \"Don't you dare, Anita Brandt!\" Josie exclaimed in alarm. \"Or I'll tell Gus you love to watch Dumb and Dumber .\" Both women shuddered at the thought of that movie. After they'd finished talking they'd made plans to get together for breakfast. Anita promised to pick her up at seven so they could grab a quick breakfast together before heading off for work. And it appeared for once that Anita was right on time for her appointment. \"It's open!\" Josie called, poking her head out of her bedroom. When she hard the front door open she ducked back inside the room to finish getting ready. \"I'll be out in a minute, I wasn't expecting you yet. You're early.\" Without pausing for a reply she continued to say. \"I am so nervous about seeing Sam at school today, Anita. It is going to be so hard to pretend that he's just my teacher and not the man I love more than anything in the world. I don't know how I'm going to get through the day without accidentally letting something slip. Wouldn't everybody look if I walked into English class and planted a big kiss on Sam.\" She chuckled in amusement at the thought as she gave her reflection one final inspection. \"So, how do I look?\" She asked as she stepped out into the living room. Her eyes widened in surprise as she heard Sam's voice reply with obvious amusement. \"Beautiful.\" \"What are you doing here?\" She asked in confusion, her eyes quickly scanning the room for her best friend. \"Well that sure is a warm greeting.\" He countered in a mock-hurt tone. \"What happened to planting a big kiss on me?\" Josie blushed as he repeated her earlier statement. \"I'm sorry, I just wasn't expecting you. I thought it was Anita that came in. I wasn't expecting to see you until sixth period.\" \"Do you honestly think that I could have lasted that long without getting a kiss from my favorite girl?\" Josie blushed again as Sam stepped up to her and put his hands on her shoulders. \"So, are you going to kiss me and put me out of my misery?\" Josie smiled in amusement. \"Well, I do hate to see anyone suffer.\" Sam flashed her a warm smile as he leaned down and captured her lips with his. Josie responded by putting her arms around his neck and pulling him closer. They were still locked in each other's embrace when Josie's apartment door opened a few minutes later. \"Knock! Knock!\" Anita Brandt's cheerful voice preceded her into the apartment. \"Josie, I'm here! Are you ready for...\" She stopped in her tracks when she saw Josie and Sam still wrapped in each others arms. \"...breakfast?\" She finished softly, silently kicking herself for interrupting the pair. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.\" She started backing her way out of the room. \"I'll just catch up with you later, Josie.\" \"No, wait.\" Sam's voice stopped her in her tracks. Releasing Josie he continued. \"Please, don't leave on my account. I didn't realize that you two had plans, so I brought breakfast with me.\" \"You did?\" Josie looked at him in surprise. He nodded. \"I brought some bagels and cream cheese and some fresh croissants.\" He informed her, but then looking at Anita he added. \"But if you two already had plans to go somewhere else I can just go...\" \"Don't be silly.\" Anita quickly assured him. \"Jos and I can do breakfast another time. I'll just go...\" \"Why don't you both stay.\" Josie interrupted the pair laughingly. \"I have orange juice in the fridge. We can have a nice breakfast right here. Sound okay to everyone.\" \"Sounds fine to me.\" Anita readily agreed. \"Sam?\" Josie prompted, looking at him uncertainly. \"I'm certainly not about to say no to the chance of sharing breakfast with two such beautiful ladies such as yourselves.\" Placing his hands on her shoulders he leaned down and kissed the tip of Josie's nose, adding. \"Anything to be able to spend some time with my precious Josie.\" Josie blushed as Sam turned his attention to Anita and added. \"Besides, this will give me the opportunity to get to know the illustrious 'Pam Kitterman' better.\" Anita chuckled and corrected. \"Actually it's Anita, Anita Brandt.\" \"Well, I'm pleased to meet you Anita.\" Sam gave her a warm smile. \"How about I get breakfast ready?\" When Josie gave him a bright smile of approval he gave her another squeeze before releasing her and moving towards the kitchen. An instant later Anita grabbed her arm and whispered seriously. \"If you don't put a permanent claim on that wonderful man than I will.\" Josie laughed and gave her friend an amused look. \"Sorry, Anita. He's already spoken for. And for your information I do intend to put a permanent claim on him just as soon as he asks me.\" \"You are so lucky.\" Her friend told her enviously as they watched him poke through a few cupboards obviously looking for something. \"I wish Gus was half as romantic as Sam is...\" \"Honey, where do keep your plates?\" The searcher finally inquired, having no success on his own finding the objects in question. \"Or as adorable.\" Anita finished as they moved to join Sam in the kitchen area. Josie gave her friend another amused look before moving to Sam's side and showed him where her plates were. \"Voila.\" She exclaimed, opening the cupboard door. \"Merci.\" He grinned as he dropped a kiss on her cheek before he pulled out one big plate and three little ones. Turning around he set them on the counter that separated the kitchen from the living room and opened the paper bag he'd set there earlier. As he set the bagels and croissants on the larger plate, Josie poured three glasses of orange juice. \"Breakfast is served.\" He announced as he set the last bagel on the plate. \"Let's eat then.\" Josie said as she set the glasses with the juice on the counter. She felt a sudden chill of delight run through her body when Sam dropped a kiss on her neck before claiming one of the barstools. Josie and Anita sat on the other two. As they each grabbed a bagel or croissant Anita decided to find out a little more about her best friend's boyfriend. \"So Sam, how long have you been teaching at South Glen South?\" \"Three years.\" Sam replied with a knowing smile. Some how he had the feeling that he was going to be put through yet another 'Are You Eligible to Date Josie' test. He didn't mind. He knew it was only because her friends and family cared about her so much. And actually Josie had been put through a similar test with Jon and Joanna yesterday when they'd found out that she was now Sam's girlfriend. He guessed it was just something to expect when they first start dating. \"And Josie told me that you went to Yale before that.\" Anita remarked, clearly impressed. Sam nodded. \"I graduated in '95. Majored in English Literature and minored in Creative Writing.\" Giving her a wicked grin he teased. \"I can show you my school transcripts if you want.\" \"I'll let you know.\" Anita chuckled, knowing he was joking. \"Let's see how well you do on the rest of this test.\" \"I knew it was a test.\" Sam exclaimed good-naturedly. \"I knew this was another 'Are You Eligible to Date Josie' test!\" \"Oh, you've already been through one of these?\" The tester asked in surprise. \"Who gave it?\" \"Mr. Rob Geller and Mr. Tom Geller.\" Sam replied. \"Well, in that case I guess you've probably been thoroughly screened than.\" Anita commented with exaggerated disappointment. \"I guess I don't have to work you over after all.\" \"That's a relief.\" Sam gave an exaggerated sigh. \"I've seen you in action, frankly I was getting scared.\" \"Not fair!\" Anita laughed as she slapped his arm playfully. \"You're the one getting picked on here, not me.\" \"Hey!\" Josie exclaimed in a mock-angry tone. \"Don't hit my boyfriend!\" \"Yeah!\" Sam retorted back to Anita in fun. \"That's my job.\" Josie added, giving Sam's arm a light slap. \"Hey!\" He pretended to give her a hurt look. \"I didn't realize I was getting into an abusive relationship.\" \"I'm not abusive!\" Josie denied. \"I'm just feisty. There is a difference.\" \"I certainly hope so.\" He commented, looking her up and down seriously before pulling her in a warm embrace. \"Because I don't mind being in a relationship with a feisty person, but I won't be in one with an abusive one. I've done that already and I don't want to ever do that again.\" \"Well I can guarantee, Mr. Coulson, that Josie is anything but abusive.\" Anita assured him sincerely. \"She's in fact the most considerate, kind and loving person I know and you are the luckiest guy in the world to have her love and admiration.\" \"I know.\" Sam agreed, kissing the side of Josie's head lovingly. \"I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.\" \"And I feel like the luckiest girl.\" Josie told him as he looked at him warmly. \"I have a wonderful boyfriend.\" Looking at Anita she added. \"And the greatest best friend.\" Then with a sigh she said dismally. \"Now if only I could find a superb story.\" Josie took a deep breath and climbed the front steps of South Glen South. This was definitely going to be a very difficult day. Not only did she have to pretend that Sam wasn't her boyfriend, but as Sam pointed out at breakfast this morning, she had to pretend that Guy was. Or that at least he was someone that she was interested in. Her only hope was that Guy didn't try to kiss her. She wasn't about to kiss anyone just to keep up her cover. The only person she was ever going to kiss was Sam. But she didn't want to hurt Guy's feeling either, especially since he did seem to be genuinely interested in her. She remembered his words as they danced together at the Prom. You rock my world. And the look in his eyes as he said it was proof that he meant it. No, she didn't want to hurt him. As she passed through the metal detectors she noticed Rob, Guy and the rest of the 'in crowd' waiting for her just inside. They seemed quite engrossed in their conversation, each one of them talking animatedly about something. From what Josie could tell Rob was the 'audience' to everybody else's excited chatter. Just then Gibby spotted her and lifted her hand to get her friend's attention. \"Josie!\" Josie chuckled and returned the wave. When she reached the group she hugged each of the girls and gave the boys shy smiles. \"Hi.\" Rob threw an arm across her shoulders and said. \"I've just been given the whole low down on the party we missed after Prom. Sounds like it was a really wing-ding.\" \"I'm sorry we had to miss it.\" Josie said as sincerely as possible. \"I'm sure it would have been fun.\" \"So, Josie how was your weekend?\" Kristen asked curiously. \"We tried getting you on Saturday, but we just got your answering machine. Where were you?\" \"Saturday I was at Rob's.\" Josie replied, which technically was the truth. \"His parents invited me over for dinner.\" Once again, the truth. Just that his parents were also her parents. \"Oh, that sounds like fun.\" Gibby grinned slightly, giving Josie a sly look. \"Like old times I'm sure.\" \"Old times?\" Josie frowned slightly. \"Yeah, like when you two use to go out.\" Kirsten clarified. Josie looked at Rob and tried not to laugh. The thought of him and her as a couple struck her as so ludicrous. \"Yeah, just like 'old times'.\" Just then the warning bell sounded and everyone started heading for their classes. \"I still can't understand why you two broke up.\" Gibby commented, glancing at Rob and Josie as they walked down the hall, Rob's arm still draped across Josie's shoulders. \"You make such a cute couple.\" \"Yeah, but obviously he didn't realize how amazing she is.\" Guy remarked as he casually pushed Rob's arm off her shoulders and replaced it with his own. \"That's why she's my girl now.\" Josie blushed and shot Rob a pleading look. As usual he came to her rescue. Imitating Guy's actions he casually pushed his arm off of Josie and replaced it with his own saying. \"That may be, but I'm her best friend not to mention the fact that I've known her longer than all of you put together.\" Feeling more confident now that Rob had had the last word Josie gently pushed her brother's arm off of her and said as lightly as possibly. \"Now, now boys. There's no need to fight over me. I'm quite capable of being both your friends.\" She quickened her pace so that she could join Gibby, Kirsten and Kristen who were now walking a few steps ahead of them. Guy watched her go and couldn't help but chuckle. \"Isn't she incredible? I think I'm falling for her, man. She rocks my world.\" Rob felt a prick of conscience as he noted the look on the other man's face. For the first time since he'd come to South Glen South he felt bad about all the lies and stories he'd told about himself and Josie. He never expected anybody to get hurt, and he certainly hadn't expected anybody to actually fall for his sister. But here there were two men who had fallen for her. One she returned his affection, but how would Guy feel when he found out he was being played the fool. He would probably be very hurt. \"Um, Guy there's something you should probably know.\" \"What's that, man?\" Guy looked at him expectantly, stopping when Rob did. \"Ah, you see.\" Rob shuffled uncomfortably and glanced down the rapidly emptying hallway. Taking a deep breath he said. \"There's no easy way to tell you this, but, ah...\" \"Just spit it out, man.\" Guy told him, a trifle impatiently. \"Josie's in love with someone else.\" Rob finally said. He felt bad as he watched Guy's shoulders slouch slightly. \"Who?\" Rob shook his head. \"I can't say. She's sworn me to secrecy.\" When Guy continued to look at him he added desperately. \"She made me pinky swear! I can't break a pinky swear!\" \"Why didn't she say anything?\" The other man asked sadly. \"Because she doesn't know you cared for her that much.\" Rob replied. \"Also, so didn't know how he felt about her.\" \"And she does now?\" Guy asked dully. Rob nodded. \"They got together this weekend.\" Reaching over he squeezed the other man's shoulder sympathetically. \"I'm sorry man. I know what its like to loose someone you care about.\" \"Did you feel the same way when you and Josie broke up?\" Guy asked curiously. Rob thought about his answer carefully before replying. \"Let's just say that I'm very grateful to have Josie as my best friend. I don't know what I would do without her.\" Guy sighed. \"I don't know what I'm going to do either. She's just so amazing.\" \"You can still be her friend.\" Rob told him. \"You still have that.\" The other man looked thoughtful for a moment and then gave his head a nod. \"You're right, I can still be her friend. Thanks man.\" He reached over and shook Rob's hand gratefully. \"My pleasure.\" Rob assured him, a broad grin nearly splitting his face. Feeling both proud and relieved Rob followed Guy down the hall just as the final bell rang. At lunch time Josie excused herself from Gibby, Kirsten and Kristen feigning last minute research on a school report and headed for the Library. In actual fact she was hoping for a few minutes to work on her reporting assignment. She'd really been hoping to have an idea ready to present to Gus that afternoon at the weekly staff meeting, but so far she was drawing nothing but a blank. How could she top a so-called scandal between a teacher and his supposed student? What could possibly be as riveting or as noteworthy? Surely nothing else about her boring life that would qualify. A deep sigh escaped her lips as she entered the Library. She was thankful to find that the room was basically empty except for one or two other people. Without even looking at her companions she headed for the back of the Library to where all the non-fiction and reference materials were kept. Dropping her shoulder bag on a table she moved to the closest row of shelves and began scanning the titles. She wasn't looking for any book in particular, just whatever struck her and might give her some ideas for her story. \"'My Semester in High School'.\" She murmured Rigfort's original theme to herself as she ran a hand over the various volumes on the shelf. \"'My Life As a Geek'.\" She added as she continued to scan the titles under her hand. As her mind traveled over other self-deprecating titles she pulled a book from the shelf and flipped it open. She was so deep in thought that she didn't even notice the hand that reached over her shoulder to drop a piece of paper on her open book. It wasn't until she was about to turn the page that she noticed the piece of blue paper. Shifting the book from one hand to the other she picked up the note curiously. On the scrap of paper, scribbled in Sam's familiar handwriting were the following words: The best stories come from within influenced by life, time and growth. A similar comment Sam had made to her echoed in Josie's head: To write well, you have to write what you know. As Josie seriously considered those words she felt a pair of arms encircle her waist from behind. Hugging her tightly to him Sam leaned down and whispered softly in her ear the same thing he'd written on the piece of paper she still held. \"The best stories come from within influenced by life, time and growth.\" Kissing the side of her head tender he then added. \"Listen to your heart, sweetheart and believe in yourself. You'll write a fantastic story. I have complete faith in you.\" Kissing her again he said. \"I love you.\" Then with after another loving squeeze he was gone, disappearing just as suddenly as he'd appeared. Josie wondered if he'd really been there or if she'd just imagined him. Looking down again she found another piece of paper lying on her open book. This one was folded and looked larger than the previous one. Carrying her book the a table she carefully sat down and unfolded the note, careful to keep the paper out of view of her camera. \"My dearest Josie.\" The note read. \"I don't know how many more days I can do this. If I thought that pretending not to be in love with you was hard when I was just your teacher I should have realized how much harder it would be now as your boyfriend. I hope we can end this charade soon because I am absolutely dying to tell everyone that you belong to me. That you are mine and no one else can have you. I overheard Rob talking to Guy this morning. He was trying to gently tell him not to get him hopes up about you and him because you were in love with someone else. Don't worry, Rob handled the whole thing very well and Guy had no idea who you're in love with. But for me, I can't begin to explain how I felt when I heard Rob say that and know that he was talking about me. That I was the guy lucky enough to be the object of your affection. I love you so much, Josie. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone before. And more than anything I want to have you in my life forever. I want to marry you, to have children with you, to live happily ever after with you. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a proposal - yet. This is merely a declaration of my heartfelt intentions. I love you Josie Geller, and I always will. Yours always, Sam.\" Josie wiped the tears from her eyes as the bell rang signaling the end of lunch. Quickly folding Sam's letter she slipped it into her bag before slinging it over her shoulder and heading for her next class. \"Good afternoon everyone!\" Sam greeted his Senior Lit class warmly as he entered the classroom and closed the door behind himself. \"Afternoon.\" Most of his students returned pleasantly. After setting his briefcase down on his desk he turned to face the class, a slight smile on his lips. He scanned the room silently for a moment before letting a broad smile spread across his face. \"Welcome to your last week of High School English.\" A cheer erupted from his students echoed by vigorous applause and some excited whistles. Sam put on his most offended look. \"Nice to know you're going to miss me.\" \"We'll miss you, Mr. Coulson.\" Kristen told him eagerly. Looking at her three girlfriends she prompted. \"Won't we, girls?\" Gibby and Kirsten echoed her sentiment with sincere nods and words of agreement. The fact was the three of them were going to miss him very much. They had all had a crush on him since the first day of class. In fact amongst themselves they referred to him as Mr. Cool son. They thought he was the handsomest teacher at South Glen South and they each wished desperately that he was younger - or better yet that they were a little older. Turning to Josie who hadn't said anything Kristen pushed. \"You'll miss him too, won't you Josie?\" Josie's cheeks flushed at the other girl's innocent question. She noticed that Aldys was desperately trying not to choke on the laughter she was attempting to hold back. Trying her best to keep her voice steady and as normal sounding as possible Josie finally managed to reply. \"Yes, of course I will.\" Sam turned his smile on her and said neutrally. \"Thank you, Josie. That means a lot to me.\" Looking at the others he added. \"I'm going to miss you all too.\" He paused for a moment, a thoughtful look on his face before continuing. \"I have an idea. How about we do something special so that we'll never forget each other.\" \"Like what?\" Jason asked suspiciously. Sam paused for another moment before replying. \"I want each of you to write an essay about your Senior years at South Glen South. I want you to tell me just how much of an influence this year has been on your lives and your view of both the past and the future.\" Josie shot Sam an amused look. She knew exactly where his inspiration had come from for this little assignment. \"Your papers will be due the day after tomorrow and then we'll spend the next three days discussing them as a group.\" A collective groan went up from the class. \"Oh, come on you guys.\" He gave them all an encouraging look. \"Just think, this is your last High School English assignment.\" When he received more moans he chuckled and offered. \"Tell you what. Why don't we get things rolling by sharing some of our favorite South Glen South Senior year experiences? Who wants to start?\" When no hands went up he prompted. \"Come on, somebody must have something to share. I didn't think it was that boring of a year!\" Aldys put up her hand and Sam gave her an encouraging smile. \"Well I think I'll always remember the look on Brett's face when you nailed him with those whipped cream pies on Senior night.\" She shot the football star a teasing look. Sam and some of the other students laughed in agreement. \"That was pretty good, wasn't it.\" He commented as he too shot the young man a mischievous look. \"I'm just glad that Brett's a good sport.\" \"Just until graduation.\" Brett pretended to threaten. \"After that you'd better watch your back Mr. Coulson.\" Sam chuckled good-naturedly. \"I'll remember that.\" Then looking back to the class he asked. \"Anybody else? Anyone?\" \"Why don't you share a memory from when you were in High School?\" Tommy prompted, a mischievous smile on his face. \"Did they even have High School back then?\" Jason added teasingly. \"For your information we had a great high school!\" Sam defended in mock-annoyance. \"So tell us about it.\" Gibby encouraged. Sam grinned for a moment, exchanged a brief look with Josie and then nodded his head. \"All right.\" Settling himself on the edge of his desk he thought for a moment before starting to chuckle. \"How about I tell you a story about my Senior Lit teacher.\" There were nods and murmurs of approval. \"Well, when I was in High School, our school had a yearly tradition that on the last day of classes before exams started the teachers would put on a show for the students.\" \"What kind of show?\" Kristen asked curiously. \"Air bands.\" Sam explained. \"They'd get up and lip sync to some song and usually dance or pretend to play an instrument at the same time. Well, my Lit teacher was a real nut. He got up on stage dressed like an Eskimo: winter coat, scarf, hat, mitts, the works. Then while lip syncing to the song I'm Too Sexy he slowly stripped on stage all the way down to a pair of shorts and T-shirt. And each layer that he took off he tossed into the audience. Well everybody was just roaring with laughter.\" His present audience was also greatly amused by the story. \"Oh, and later...oh, this was great! You see usually for about the last month of school water fights were big in my school. Almost everyone had either a water gun or water balloons or both and there were water fights everywhere . Well, during the Teacher's Aid Bands one of the Vice Principals came out on stage and said that after that day there wasn't to be any more water guns or water fights in school. It was exam time and we were all suppose to be serious. Well, later on he did a song and dance for us and came out dressed in a long trench coat, his back to the audience. After a couple moments he whipped around and started soaking the audience with his Super Soaker. Well the kids in the audience retaliated with their water guns and balloons. The stage was just swimming in water, but it was one of the funniest water fights I'd ever been involved in!\" \"That's rufus!\" Guy exclaimed as he and his buddies laughed heartily at the story. \"I wish we had something like that here.\" \"Yeah, it'd be fun to nail the principal and the vice principal with water balloons.\" Jason agreed eagerly. \"Okay, so I've told my story.\" Sam commented. \"Now it's somebody else's turn.\" Looking around the room his eyes finally settled on Josie. He gave her a warm smile and prompted. \"Josie, why don't you tell us how being at South Glen South for the last three months has effected you.\" When Josie's eyes widened in alarm he encouraged. \"How was it different from your last High School?\" Swallowing hard Josie stood up and turned to face the class. She had no idea what she was going to say. If she didn't love Sam Coulson so much she would have been tempted to beat him to death at that very moment. \"Why don't you come and sit up here, Josie.\" Sam encouraged, scooting over a little to make room beside him on the desk. He patted the vacant space invitingly. Josie hesitated for a moment than moved to join him. With a shy smile she settled herself on the desk beside him before looking at the class. \"My experience here at South Glen South started out very much like it had at my last High school.\" Josie began a little hesitantly. \"Most people ignored me, or tormented me. Few of my classmates ever took the time to get to know me. I was basically an outcast, a geek. Things didn't change too much when I first came to South Glen. I was considered a geek here too.\" \"There are no 'geeks' in my class, Josie.\" Sam quickly corrected her. \"What you are is a very studious and highly talented young lady.\" Josie blushed slightly at the comment and felt her heart swell with love for this wonderful man who was now the love of her life. \"Anyway, things are different now. Others have finally accepted me, and it has given me a whole new perspective about things. I know longer wonder 'what if', but I can look forward to what's coming next without any regrets. I think my experience at South Glen South has changed my life a lot. It has changed my outlook on my life a lot too.\" Looking at Sam she grinned slightly and added. \"Now if I can only nail this assignment my happiness will be complete.\" Only Sam, Aldys and Josie knew she wasn't referring to Sam's English assignment.[Chapter 5] \"I noticed how Mr. Coulson didn't say that he was going to miss you after the school year was over.\" Aldys teased Josie after class was over. The two of them were alone in the Girls bathroom getting ready to leave the school for the day. Due to their location, Josie had taken the opportunity to remove her camera and recorder, glad to be rid of the annoying device. \"Well that's because I'm not going to give him the opportunity to miss me.\" Josie replied with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. \"Well, some how I don't think that's going to be a problem.\" Aldys commented as she pushed open one of the stall doors. \"Something tells me he's not going to be letting you out of his sight now that he's finally got you.\" \"And I'm not going to be letting him out of mine.\" Her friend added as the stall door closed behind the other girl. Just then the bathroom door opened and Kristin, Gibby and Kirsten came filing in. \"There you are!\" Gibby exclaimed when she caught sight of Josie standing by the row of sinks. \"We've been looking all over for you.\" \"What's up?\" Josie asked curiously looking from one girl to the other. The three teenagers looked at each other before focusing their attention back to Josie. \"We just wanted to apologize to you for being so mean when you first came to South Glen.\" Kristen told her sincerely. \"We were such jerks for treating you like we did.\" Gibby added sincerely. \"Can you ever forgive us?\" Kirsten finished, giving Josie a pleading look. \"If you don't, we'll just die.\" Kristen gave her a small pout. Josie couldn't believe her ears. The 'popular girls' were actually asking her forgiveness for the way they'd treated her. Never in all her years had Josie ever imagined that such a thing could take place. She felt her self-esteem soar at the idea that these girls would actually care enough about her feelings to apologize for their treatment of her. Maybe the popular kids weren't so bad after all. \"Of course I forgive you.\" She quickly assured them and returned the friendly hugs they offered her. As she hugged Gibby the girl told her sincerely. \"If there's anything we can ever do to make it up to you, please tell us.\" \"As a matter of fact there is something that you could do.\" Josie told them honestly. \"What?\" Gibby asked curiously. \"Name it.\" \"Let Aldys come with us to the ball game tonight.\" Josie replied, her expression serious. A frown appeared on the three girls' faces. \"Why do you want Alpo to come to the game with us?\" Kristen complained in a whiny tone. \"Yeah, she's not one of us.\" Gibby added with her hands on her hips. \"Aldys is a very nice girl.\" Josie told them very firmly. \"And I happen to like her very much.\" She looked at each girl before adding. \"Please, all I'm asking is that you spend one evening with her. Just give her a chance. I think you'll be surprised to find out that you like her more than you expect. After all, you weren't that crazy about me when we first met, but now we're friends aren't we?\" \"Of course we are.\" Kirsten quickly assured her. The three girls looked at each other for a moment before finally answering Josie's request. \"Okay, she can come with us tonight if she wants.\" Gibby told Josie seriously. \"But just for tonight. We'll see how things go before we start inviting her to anything else.\" \"That's all I ask.\" Josie assured them sincerely. \"I'm sure you'll discover what a great person she is.\" \"I hope you're right.\" Kristen replied. \"After all, this is Robbie Rob's big game and I want to be in a good mood to cheer him on.\" \"We'll make a great cheering section for Rob.\" Josie promised. She and Coach Romano were the only ones that knew that Rob was going to 'injure' himself during practice that afternoon and that this 'injury' was going to prevent him from starring in the big game that night. \"Are you going to be coming to dinner with us before the game?\" Gibby asked curiously. \"We're all going to Nana's to grab a bite.\" Josie shook her head. \"No, actually I already have plans for supper. But I'll meet you at the entrance gate at seven o'clock. That gives us half-an-hour before game time.\" \"Sounds great.\" Kirsten acknowledged. Then looking at her two friends she suggested. \"We'd better go if we're going to get ready for dinner in time for the guys to pick us up.\" \"Your right.\" Gibby exclaimed in sudden alarm as she looked at her watch. \"We only have about an hour and a half before we're suppose to meet.\" Looking at Josie she added. \"We'll see you later, Josie.\" \"Bye, Josie.\" The other two girls called over their shoulders as they followed Gibby out of the room. Josie laughed and shook her head as she watched the trio file out. \"Is the coast clear?\" Aldys asked, poking her head out of the stall she had been in. \"Yeah, they're gone.\" Josie assured her. Aldys emerged from the stall, a look of surprise on her face. \"I can't believe you actually convinced them to let me come with you tonight. I never would have expected them to say 'yes'.\" \"Don't be so surprised.\" Josie told her. \"Besides, all it takes is one person to think you're cool and you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.\" \"Really?\" The younger girl raised her eyebrows in surprise. Josie grinned and shrugged. \"That's what Rob told me when I first started this assignment. And seeing how he's so popular, I guess he would know.\" \"You know what Rob told me when he dropped me off last night?\" Aldys looked at Josie, her eyes sparkling. When Josie shook her head she smiled and said. \"He told me that I had very beautiful eyes.\" Josie smiled at her friend and remarked. \"You do have very beautiful eyes.\" Aldys blushed with pleasure. \"I'm glad Rob thinks so.\" With a slight sigh she added. \"Aren't guys great?\" Her friend nodded. \"Yes they are.\" Then glancing at her watch she started to panic. \"I'm going to be late!\" \"Late for what?\" The other girl asked in confusion. \"Late for the staff meeting at the Sun-Times.\" Josie replied, gathering up her things. \"We have a staff meeting ever Monday at four and I've been late the last two weeks. Rigfort and Gus will both have my hide if I'm late again.\" \"I can drive you.\" Aldys volunteered. \"I can have you there in ten minutes.\" \"Are you sure you can make it in ten?\" Josie asked looked at her with uncertainty. \"Positive.\" The other girl assured her. Josie's eyes started to twinkle slightly. \"Then can I get you to do me a favor before we leave?\" \"Anything.\" Her friend assured her. Josie walked purposefully into Sam's classroom and was relieved to find him still sitting at his desk. She'd been afraid that he'd gone home already. At the sound of her footsteps he looked up and fixed her with a brilliant smile. \"Josie? To what do I owe the honor of your presence?\" Glancing over her shoulder to where Aldys was standing guard at the door she received a nod signaling that the coast was clear. Looking back to Sam she grinned mischievously and asked. \"How would you like a kiss before I go?\" Sam's face broke into a broad smile as he rose to his feet and reached out to enfold her in his arms. \"I'm not likely to turn down an invitation like that, am I?\" Leaning down he kissed her gently on the lips, hugging her tighter to him. When he pulled away he leaned his forehead against hers and sighed. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She returned her eyes still closed as she savored the feeling of being in Sam's arms. \"Are we still on for dinner tonight?\" He asked, still holding her tight. Josie nodded her head. \"I have my staff meeting until about five and then I'll be ready to go.\" \"Should I pick you up at the Sun-Times or meet you somewhere else?\" He inquired, kissing her forehead as she replied. \"It would probably be best if we met somewhere else.\" She told him. \"It would be just my luck that Gus would leave work early and see us leave together. There's a coffee shop about two blocks West of the Sun-Times building. I'll meet you there about five-fifteen.\" \"It's a date.\" He confirmed. Then leaning down again he planted another kiss on her lips, this one a little longer. Josie pulled him closer and deepened the kiss, tangling her fingers in his blond hair. \"Josie!\" Aldys suddenly hissed, trying to get her friend's attention. When neither Sam nor Josie acknowledged her she tried again a little louder. \"Josie!\" The couple jumped and looked at her in surprise. \"Ms. Knox is coming.\" The other girl informed them in a terse whisper. The couple nodded, hugged again quickly and parted. \"I'll see you at five-fifteen.\" Sam whispered to Josie as he released her. Josie nodded and then quickly gathered up her bag as Ms. Knox entered the room. Plastering as normal a smile as he could on his face Sam looked at his co-worker and greeted. \"Hi Marilyn.\" \"Afternoon Sam, girls.\" Ms. Knox nodded to Josie and Aldys and smiled. \"I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\" \"Oh no.\" The three of them replied a little too quickly. \"I was, ah, just getting some, ah, ideas for our last assignment.\" Josie stumbled nervously, a red flush spreading across her cheeks. Looking at Sam she stammered quickly. \"Thanks for your help, S…Mr. Coulson. I really appreciate your impute.\" \"My pleasure, Josie.\" Sam assured her with an amused smile. \"I'll see you later.\" \"Later.\" She repeated and quickly fled from the room with Aldys in tow. Both girls let out a nervous laugh as they ran down the hallway. Marilyn frowned slightly as she watched the girls leave. \"Something I can help you with Marilyn?\" Sam asked as he gathered his stuff up and returned it to his briefcase. \"I wanted to talk to you about graduation actually.\" She told him as she turned away from the door. \"Any suggestions for Valedictorian?\" \"Aldys Wells would be my first choice.\" Sam told her honestly. \"She's one of my best students.\" Marilyn watched him for a moment before venturing. \"I would have thought you'd chose Josie Geller. Word is she's your favorite student.\" Sam looked at her seriously and said. \"I don't have 'favorite' students, Marilyn. I don't believe in 'teacher's pets'.\" She gave him another measuring look before favoring him with a smile. \"I'm glad to hear that.\" Then after hesitating for a moment she finally said what was on her mind. \"I don't know if I'm doing right by saying this, but you should probably be aware that I think Josie has a crush on you.\" Sam gave her his best surprised look and asked. \"Are you sure?\" She nodded her head. \"I've seen the way she looks at you when you pass her in the hall. She's definitely smitten with you. I wouldn't worry about it. It's completely normal for a teenage girl to develop a crush on her teacher.\" She giggled slightly. \"When I was in High School I had a terrible crush on my Spanish teacher. He was eight years older than me and a real dreamboat. I use to fantasize about running away to Spain with him.\" She blushed slightly when she realized what she'd been saying. \"Anyway, I just wanted to let you know so you can be prepared if you have to be.\" Sam suppressed the chuckle that he felt building and managed to reply in an even tone. \"I appreciate your concern, Marilyn. I'm sure things will be fine.\" He shook his head as she left, finally letting out the amusement that he'd been holding back. \"Josie honey, I don't know how much longer we can keep our relationship a secret. You'd better get that story of yours done and quickly before anyone else gets suspicious.\" \"Josie, you made it!\" Anita sighed with relief as her best friend slid into the seat next to her. Glancing at the clock she noticed it was five to the hour. \"You sure cut it close. Gus was ready to have your head if you late again today.\" \"I know.\" Josie acknowledged with a roll of her eyes. \"I'm just lucky that Aldys knows a shortcut or else I would have been late.\" Anita gave her a mischievous grin. \"You mean that gorgeous hunk of a teacher of yours didn't drop you off?\" Josie flushed slightly and looked around to make sure nobody heard her friend's comment. Fortunately everyone else was engaged in their own conversations, completely oblivious to what Anita had said. Looking at her best friend she hissed softly. \"Will you keep your voice down! Somebody might overhear!\" \"Oh, posh!\" The dark haired woman dismissed with a wave of her hand. Leaning closer to Josie she asked eagerly. \"So what happened? How did you day go? Did you two behave yourselves?\" She raised her eyebrows up and down suggestively, a wicked grin on her face. \"Yes!\" Josie gave her arm a swat. \"Of course we did!\" Then with sparkling eyes she added confidentially. \"The day when great! Better than great actually!\" Glancing at the clock she pulled Sam's letter out of her bag and handed it to Anita. \"What's this?\" Her friend asked curiously as she unfolded it. \"A note Sam gave me.\" Josie told her with a broad smile. With a glint in her eye Anita quickly read the letter, her smile broadening with each word. She'd just barely finished when Gus and Rigfort filed in. Quickly folding the letter she handed it back to Josie who quickly shoved it into her bag as Rigfort rapped the large conference table with a long wooden stick and called. \"Meeting now in progress!\" He surveyed the room silently for a moment, quietly sizing up each one in his audience, until his eyes fell upon Josie. With a mildly sarcastic clip he greeted. \"Glad to see you're on time this week, Miss Geller. How's the story coming?\" Josie cringed slightly at his tone, but then took a deep breath and with much more confidence than she felt replied. \"Very well, sir. I'll have it ready by next week's deadline.\" \"Good!\" Rigfort gave her a genuinely delighted smile. \"I look forward to reading it, Miss Geller. I think you have the potential to be a great undercover reporter.\" His expression became stern as he added. \"Don't disappoint me.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Josie whispered hoarsely, jumping as he whacked the table again, signaling a change of subject. \"This year's Sun-Time Baseball team. Practice starts Friday. Anyone interested in playing please sign-up by Wednesday. Veterans get first choice of positions.\" Glancing at Josie he smiled encouragingly. \"I hope you plan on being our catcher again this year, Miss Geller. That was one hell of a save during last years championship game.\" Josie beamed at the compliment. \"Thank you sir.\" Addressing the group again, Rigfort continued. \"I have decided that since we had such a hard time last year finding enough employees to make up the team, friends and family members are now welcome to participate.\" Josie's heart skipped with excitement at the idea that Rigfort's announcement caused to pop into her head. She started picturing what it would be like to play baseball with Sam. The idea had her smiling broadly. \"Okay, out with it!\" Anita told her friend as they filed out of the conference room forty-five minutes later.\" \"Out with what?\" Josie asked her friend innocently as they walked to Anita's desk. \"Out with why you've been grinning like a Cheshire cat since Rigfort mentioned the baseball sign ups.\" Anita urged her curiously. Glancing around to make sure they weren't overheard Josie gently shoved her friend into her little cubicle and sank down into a chair. Anita grabbed another one and sat down across from her, a deeply curious look on her face. Leaning closer to her friend Josie finally confided excitedly. \"I'm going to see if Sam wants to sign up to play ball with me on the Sun-Times team.\" Anita gaped at her in surprise. \"Josie, you can't!\" \"Why not?\" The younger woman frowned in confusion. \"You heard Rigfort, friends and family members are welcome to participate this year. I'd say that Sam qualifies as a friend, wouldn't you?\" \"Yeah, I would, but Josie sign ups are Wednesday.\" Anita looked at her friend seriously. \"Nobody here except me and you know about you and Sam being 'friends'.\" She watched as understand removed the sparkle of excitement from her friend's eyes. She hated to be the one to deflate her friend's enthusiasm, but she couldn't let her throw everything away for a baseball team. Josie sighed and slumped back in her chair, her animation dying instantly as reality hit her fully on. \"If I sign Sam and I up than everyone is going to find out about us before I get my story finished. And if they find out about Sam and I before I get my story finished then they'll be no use signing us up for the Sun-Times baseball team because I will no longer be employed by the Chicago Sun-Times. It'll basically be a moot point.\" Frustrated she pounded her fist on the arm of her chair. \"When did life get so complicated?\" Anita smiled at her knowingly. \"The minute you fell in love with Sam Coulson.\" At the sound of her boyfriend's name Josie couldn't help the smile that spread across her face. With a dreamy sigh she commented. \"Yeah, but he's worth it.\" Anita couldn't help but chuckle at her friend's expression. \"Girl, you've got it bad !\" Josie looked at her best friend and blushed slightly. \"I know.\" Then remembering something she reached into her shoulder bag and fished out her notebook. Flipping it open she ripped out a page and handed it to Anita. \"I want to place a Want ad.\" Anita gave her a wicked look. \"Not in the Personals I hope.\" \"No!\" Josie exclaimed a bit too loudly. She blushed when Rhonda, who'd been passing by, looked at them curiously. After she continued on Josie lowered her voice and said. \"It's a different kind of Want ad.\" Intrigued Anita read the Ad that Josie had scribbled on the paper she held. When she finished her intrigue had been replaced by puzzlement. \"I didn't know you collected Gordie Howe memorabilia.\" \"I don't.\" Josie assured her. \"It's not for me, it's for Sam.\" At Anita's expectant look she explained. \"When Sam was in peewee hockey his father bought him a helmet autographed by Gordie Howe. He said it made him feel invincible. He even got a trophy for 'Most Improved Player' that year.\" Her friend smiled. \"Sounds like it meant a lot to him.\" \"It did.\" Josie confirmed. \"So why are you getting him another one?\" \"Because Lara...\" \"The witch he just broke up with?\" Anita interrupted to ask. Josie nodded in confirmation and continued. \"Lara got mad at him one day because he liked playing hockey when she felt he should spend more time visiting her and looking for work in New York and so she tossed his helmet in the garbage to get even with him.\" \"She sounds like she's a real winner that one.\" Anita commented caustically. \"She's very beautiful.\" Josie replied seriously. \"But I'm afraid with her beauty is only skin deep.\" \"Where as yours goes right to the core.\" Anita told her honestly. \"No wonder you turned Sam's head so fast. After that Lara witch he probably considers you an angel.\" The younger woman blushed hotly and denied. \"I doubt he sees me as that.\" \"I wouldn't doubt it.\" Her friend told her confidently. \"Have I been wrong much where you and Sam Coulson are concerned?\" Josie smiled back and shook her head. \"No, I guess you haven't. You seem to have an uncanny knack in that direction.\" \"It's a gift.\" Anita teased lightly. The two women chuckled with easy amusement. Their humor was short-lived however when Gus' voice came booming across the bullpen. \"Geller! My office now!\" Josie looked at Anita and rolled her eyes. \"Sounds like Gus is on a rampage again.\" Glancing at the clock she noticed it was three minutes to five. \"Listen, can you do me a favor?\" \"Name it.\" Her friend replied without hesitation. \"I'm suppose to meet Sam at Sadie's Coffee Shoppe at five-fifteen.\" Josie told her. \"Could you possibly go down and keep him company until I get there. I don't want him to get worried thinking I stood him up or anything.\" Anita flashed her a mischievous smile. \"I'd love to babysit that gorgeous hunk of yours for you. But I have to warn you, if you're not there by six I'm running off with him.\" Josie laughed and retorted hotly. \"I'd like to see you try, Missy. Sam Coulson's mine. So you keep your grubby hands off him!\" Anita couldn't help but laugh as he watched her friend strut hautily across the room to Gus' office. One thing was sure, if nothing else this undercover assignment had given Josie a confidence that she'd never shown before. \"You go girl.\" Anita whispered with pride and delight. \"You show them all what you're really made off!\" Unfortunately Josie's air of confidence fizzled to nothing as she sat across the desk from her gruff looking boss. It had been a full two minutes since he'd told her to shut the door and take a seat. Now he just sat looking at her, not saying a word. Josie shifted uncomfortably in her seat wishing he would say something - anything - to break the silence. Just when she felt that she couldn't take it anymore he finally spoke, asking the question that Josie had been dreading the most. \"So, what did Coulson say when you told him the truth?\" All Josie could do was gap at him. Her surprise couldn't have been greater if he'd suddenly sprouted a second head. \"What...How...I don't...What?\" \"Don't play dumb with me, Geller.\" He barked gruffly. \"I know you told that teacher of yours the truth.\" Josie swallowed hard, desperately trying to fight back the tears that wanted to spill. \"Did George tell you?\" She finally managed to ask in a choked voice. \"No.\" Gus exclaimed harshly. \"Contrary to what you may think, Geller I didn't get to be editor of a major city newspaper by sitting on my ass. I happened to have been one of the best investigative reporters the Sun-Times had ever seen. And for your information, it didn't take much investigating to realize what had happened. In fact one phone call confirmed it.\" \"One phone call?\" Josie croaked nervously. Her boss nodded, pausing for a moment to watch her squirm. \"I called a friend of mine at the Chicago PD and had him trace the license plate number of a certain black Jetta that was parked in your parents driveway on Saturday evening.\" Josie closed her eyes against her tears, not needing to hear the results of that phone call. Instead she asked. \"What made you decide to check that number? It could have just been a friend of Rob's visiting.\" \"I knew that Coulson drove a black Volkswagen Jetta.\" Gus told her matter-of-factly. \"I also knew that it couldn't have been just a 'friend of Rob's' because of all the scrambling that was going on in the kitchen when Anita and I entered and by the way your eyes kept darting to whoever it was that was hiding behind the door, especially when I mentioned how I knew you had feelings for Coulson.\" As Josie buried her face in her hands Gus concluded. \"I'd say that the evidence that you told Coulson the truth is pretty air tight. No judge in the world would be able to deny it.\" Josie's shoulders started to shake as she started to cry openly. \"I didn't mean any harm.\" She sobbed vehemently. \"I just couldn't stand lying to him anymore.\" \"But you could stand lying to me?\" Gus commented gruffly as he shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Contrary to public opinion he hated seeing someone cry and he hated even worse being the reason for someone crying, but he was completely ignorant as to what to do about it. Clearing his throat slightly he slid a box of tissues across his desk towards her. Josie took a tissue and wiped her eyes then blew her nose. After several moments Gus finally spoke again, but this time both his tone and his expression were softer. \"Look, Josie.\" She looked at him in surprise when he addressed her by her first name. \"I need to know how far this had gone. When did you tell Coulson the truth?\" Josie wiped her eyes again and took a deep breath. \"I told him at Prom. I cut the feed deliberately and told him.\" \"And how did he react?\" Gus pressed, watching her intently. Lifting her eyes to meet his she told him very icily. \"Contrary to what you might think he was very relieved to find out that I wasn't his seventeen year old student. Yes, he was attracted to me, very much so in fact. But he was very uncomfortable about the fact. He's not the sick, depraved man that you want to make him out to be. He's sweet and honorable and kind. He is the most wonderful man that I have ever met and I love him with all my heart.\" She chuckled slightly from nerves and added. \"That doesn't even properly reflect how much I feel for him. I have never cared for anyone as much as I do for him and what amazes me the most is that he is just as crazy about me as I am about him. For the first time in my life, the guy that I like likes me back. No false pretense, no hidden agenda, he honestly and truthfully loves me.\" Squaring her shoulders she suddenly gave him a very defiant look and told him firmly. \"I love Sam more than I have ever loved anyone and if you make me chose between my job and him I'll be out of here so fast your head will spin.\" Gus blinked at her in complete surprise. Never had he ever heard her speak to him or anyone else in such a way before. There was a certain air of confidence about her that he'd never seen before. He was actually quite proud of her for it. \"Well hopefully it won't come to that.\" He commented with surprising gentleness. \"What kind of story have you got?\" Josie fished a notebook out of her bag and opened it to the story she'd started sketching out during Sam's class earlier that afternoon. Setting it on Gus' desk she'd slid it towards him. Without a word he picked it up and started reading her rough draft. After about five minutes he set the notebook down on his desk and leaned back in his chair looking at Josie thoughtfully for several moments. \"I'll let you do this story on one condition.\" \"What is it?\" Josie asked cautiously. \"I want to meet this wonderful teacher of yours.\" He told her seriously. \"I'm assuming that he's somewhere nearby.\" Josie hesitated for a moment than nodded. \"I was suppose to meet him at Sadie's at five-fifteen.\" Glancing at the clock Gus noted. \"It's almost five-forty-five. Think he'll still be there.\" Josie nodded and admitted honestly. \"I sent Anita to tell him I'd be late.\" \"Anita's in on this?\" Gus barked, his anger suddenly returning. \"How long has she known?\" \"She figured it out on Saturday.\" Josie confessed. \"She confronted me with it when she called me after she got home from the movies.\" \"Has she met Coulson before?\" He pressed curiously. Josie nodded. \"She met him that day she came to South Glen South and ended up doing the Sex-Ed seminar. But of course Sam had no idea who she was then. He thought she was Pam Kitterman.\" Gus sighed and growled slightly. \"I still haven't fired her for that yet. What'll that make? Number ten?\" \"Nine.\" Josie corrected. \"Unless you fired her once while I was undercover.\" \"No.\" Gus shook his head. \"This would be the only time. Guess that means Collins in Accounting lost the pool.\" \"What pool?\" Josie asked in a puzzled tone. Gus gave her a measuring look. \"The pool that everyone in this office has going on about when I'll fire Anita for the tenth time.\" \"Oh, that pool.\" Josie acknowledged with a nod of her head. She was surprised that Gus was so casual about the fact. She hadn't even been aware that he knew about the pool. What he said next surprised her even more. \"I gotta try to drag it out until August.\" He told her seriously. Then with an uncustomary twinkle in his eye he added. \"I've bet on the ninth of August.\" Josie couldn't help but gape at him in surprise once again. \"So, was that the only time that Anita met Coulson?\" Josie hesitated again and shook her head. \"Anita, Sam and I had breakfast together this morning. It wasn't planned, it just happened.\" Gus frowned then sighed. \"Well, let's get down there before Anita convinces Coulson to run off with her or something.\" Josie scowled at his remark. \"That would never happen and you know it.\" \"I do?\" Gus gave her a skeptical look. \"Come on, Gus you don't actually believe that do you?\" She gave him a surprised look. When he didn't respond she told him confidently. \"Sam would never do that to me and Anita would never do that to you.\" Gus shook his head slightly and remarked sarcastically. \"You're even more naive abut relationships than I thought, Geller.\" Josie bristled slightly but managed to keep her tone even as she replied. \"That may be, but I do know that trust is very important in a relationship. Any relationship ! Anita is my best friend and has been for several years now and I trust her implicitly. She would never do anything to hurt me. And neither would Sam. He was ready to risk his career for me because he fell in love with me, and I feel the same way about him.\" Gus sighed deeply, his expression showing that he still wasn't convinced. \"I hope your trust isn't misplaced.\" \"It isn't.\" Josie told him with firm convictions. \"You'll see.\" With a grin she added. \"Trust me.\" \"You should have seen the grin on Josie's face when Rigfort announced that friends and families could play on the company's baseball team this year.\" Anita told Sam as they lingered over a cup of coffee while waiting for Josie to show up. \"She said she couldn't help but imagine how great it would be if the two of you could play ball together.\" Sam gaped at her in surprise. \"Wait a minute! Josie plays baseball?\" At Anita's nod he exclaimed in delight. \"I didn't know that! I thought she just liked watching, I had no idea that she could actually play! What position does she play?\" \"Mostly catcher.\" Anita told him. \"That's what she's played for the last four years anyway. She's very good too. She's saved the game more than once because of her stubborn determination to cover home plate. She's got a good arm too, though her batting needs a bit of work.\" She gave Sam a mischievous wink as she commented. \"I'm sure you'd be happy to help her work on that. Give her a few pointers.\" Sam just chuckled and shook his head slightly. \"Just when I think she can't get anymore perfect I learn something new bout her that makes her even more incredible. She's almost too good to be true!\" Anita studied his face carefully for a moment before commenting softly. \"You really love her, don't you?\" Sam looked at Anita and nodded his head. \"I love her more than I've ever loved anyone in my life.\" He paused as he leaned forward to lean his arms on the table, a far-away look on his face. After several thoughtful moments he looked at Anita and admitted softly. \"She completes me. She makes me feel alive. She makes me feel feelings that I've never felt before. My whole world revolves around her, being with her. Seeing her smile, hearing her laugh. We have so many things in common, more and more all the time it seems. I mean for example, I never ever thought I'd have a girlfriend who not only liked to watch baseball, but who could and does play.\" He chuckled slightly. \"I suppose I have Rob to thank for that.\" Anita robbed her eyes. \"No doubt. That guy eats, breaths and sleeps baseball and nothing else. I agree with Josie, he's totally and completely obsessed with the game.\" \"So I've learned.\" Sam commented with another chuckle. Than after slipping into a thoughtful silence he finally continued. \"I can't get over how different two people can be. Josie is nothing like Lara.\" \"You're ex-girlfriend Lara?\" Anita clarified, trying to subtly let him know she'd heard about her. \"That's right.\" Sam nodded. \"Josie is so different from her in every way imaginable.\" \"Josie said that Lara was a goddess with a perfect figure, perfect hair and perfect looks.\" Anita commented, curious about Sam's opinion of his ex's appearance. \"She actually thinks that?\" Sam looked at her in disbelief. \"Lara's looks are far from perfect. They're far from natural too.\" \"What do you mean?\" Anita frowned slightly in confusion. \"What I mean is that Lara has had so many nips and tucks and make-overs that I'm not sure what's real and what's not anymore.\" He commented in obvious distaste. \"Lara's looks don't even hold a candle to Josie's. Josie's naturally beautiful. She doesn't need any 'help', if you know what I mean.\" Anita chuckled and nodded. \"Yeah, I think I do.\" Then after looking at him thoughtfully for a moment she admitted. \"I can't tell you how happy what you said makes me. Josie is the sweetest, tenderest hearted, most romantic person I have ever met and I can't begin to tell you how many times I wished that she would meet someone special like you. She loves you so much, Sam and she's not the type of person to give her heard to just anyone. You have a real treasure there. I have tried for four years to get her to go out with some decent guys that I know, but she wouldn't go. She always dug in her heels saying that when she met 'Mr. Right' she'd know it and that she wasn't going to go and kiss a bunch of 'losers' to get to him.\" Smiling warmly at him she added. \"She was right in doing things the way she did. I didn't understand her thinking at first, but now I do and I wish I'd shared her outlook on love and relationships. You know she's loved you since the first day she met you.\" \"Yeah?\" Sam grinned expectantly. Anita chuckled and nodded. \"I remember the first night after she'd gone to South Glen South I called her to ask about her first day as a High School student. All she had was horror stories to relate - and threats for the outfit I'd chosen for her. Sam laughed and exclaimed. \"You were the one responsible for that - interesting - outfit.\" \"Guilty.\" Anita blushed slightly with embarrassment. \"I think Josie was ready to kill me for it. She threatened to strangle me with the feather boa.\" \"It was definitely unique.\" He agreed with amusement. \"I guess it was.\" His companion admitted. \"Anyway, her negative comments continued until she started talking about your class. I couldn't see her face, but I could hear the excitement in her voice. You may not realize this Sam Coulson, but you've changed that girl's life forever.\" \"Well, the feeling is entirely mutual.\" Sam assured her. \"Josie has changed my life so much these last few months, especially these last few days that thinking about it makes my head spin.\" \"Uh, oh.\" Anita suddenly exclaimed, alarm and dismay appearing on every feature of her face as she focused on something just over Sam's left shoulder. \"Speaking about heads spinning.\" \"What's wrong?\" Sam turned around in his seat in time to see Josie walk by the large front window of the coffee shop, a curly-headed man at her side. \"Who's that?\" He asked as he watched the pair entered the shop. \"That's Gus Straus, our illustrious leader.\" Anita told him. Then with a sigh he added. \"Looks like Jeff in Sports may win the pool after all.\" \"The pool?\" Sam gave her a puzzled look. \"The pool speculating when Gus would fire me for the tenth time.\" She replied, her eyes still on Gus and Josie as they scanned the coffee shop in search of her and Sam. Sam gave her a look of surprise. \"I didn't know you knew about that.\" Anita chuckled slightly. \"I know about it the same way you obviously know about it.\" \"Josie.\" The pair said simultaneously. Sam gave her another curious look. \"I thought Josie said that Gus had only fired you eight times. When did the ninth happen?\" \"It hasn't happened yet.\" She confessed. \"But I have a feeling it's pending.\" \"What did you do this time?\" He asked expectantly. Fluffing up her hair she said. \"I posed as Pam Kitterman - Sex Ed teacher extrordinare. So, if that firing comes through and he fires me for deceiving him about knowing about you and Josie, it would bring us up to ten.\" \"Unless he combines the last two offenses.\" Sam told her with a deadpan expression. \"You know, two offenses for the price of one firing.\" \"It's possible.\" Anita commented as if seriously considering his words. Both of them broke into amused laughter as Josie and Gus approached the table. \"You two sound like you're having fun.\" Josie commented to the laughing pair. \"We are.\" Sam acknowledged as he rose to greet Josie. Casting an uncertain glance at Gus he bent down and planted a quick kiss on Josie's lips. \"Anita's good company, though she's not you.\" He kissed her forehead and put his arm around her waist. \"Yes, he's been sitting her pining away for you for the last forty-five minutes.\" Anita teased the young man mischievously. \"He's been crying in his coffee.\" \"Ah, my poor lonely honey.\" Josie commented in a mock-sympathetic voice. \"Want me to kiss it and make it better?\" Sam laughed and willingly accepted her tender kiss, tightening his arm around her and bringing her closer. When they pulled apart Josie nodded towards Gus who was standing there watching the two of them intently. \"Sam, I'd like you to meet my boss, Gus Strauss. Gus, this is Sam Coulson, my boyfriend.\" Josie looked at Sam lovingly as she said the last two words. Sam gave her a tender smile and gently squeezed her waist before turning his attention to Gus. Extending his hand he greeted the other man pleasantly. \"It's nice to meet you, Mr. Strauss. Josie has told me a lot about you.\" \"So I understand.\" Gus grumped as he looked at Josie pointedly. \"A lot more than she was suppose to I hear.\" Noting the nervous look on her best friend's face Anita decided to intervene. \"Why don't you all sit and we'll discuss this over coffee.\" Gus hesitated for a moment than nodded. \"All right.\" He claimed the chair next to Anita, surprising her by drawing it a little closer to her. Sam held Josie's chair out for her before claiming the one beside her. There was several moments of uncomfortable silence while both men sized each other up. Finally Gus broke the silence by commenting. \"Geller tells me that you like playing baseball.\" Sam smiled slightly and nodded. \"Yeah, I like playing baseball. I'm not as fanatic about it as some people I know...\" He shot Josie an amused look. She rolled her eyes heavenward in response. \"...but I do enjoy a good game.\" \"What position do you play?\" Gus asked curiously. \"Mostly Centerfield.\" Sam told him. \"Though I have played Shortstop on occasion.\" \"Good.\" The other man acknowledged. \"We need a good Centerfield player.\" Sam frowned slightly. \"Excuse me?\" Josie looked at him excitedly and explained. \"Gus has accepted us playing on this year's softball team - both of us!\" When Sam didn't say anything she quickly said. \"That is if you're interested in playing on the Sun-Times team. I mean you don't have to if you don't want to, I just thought...\" Sam silenced her by putting a finger to her lips. When she stopped talking he removed his finger and gave her his brightest smile. \"I couldn't think of anything I'd like more than to play baseball with my beautiful and talented girlfriend.\" Josie blushed rosy red as he leaned forward and dropped a kiss on her lips. Pulling back he whispered. \"You're so amazing, Josie Geller. You take my breath away.\" Anita sighed as she watched the pair, knowing full well that both she and Gus had been forgotten. Looping her arm through Gus' she said. \"Isn't love wonderful?\" Gus glanced down at their linked arms and then back to Anita's smiling face. Boldly he reached up and squeezed the hand that was wrapped around her forearm. \"It certainly has it's potential.\" He admitted, giving her a warm smile.[Chapter 6] Sam and Josie ended up spending their supper together with Anita and Gus talking about baseball, Josie's assignment and a variety of other things. At first Josie had been on edge, worrying about what Gus was thinking and perhaps plotting in his head. But after a while she started to relax when she realized that Gus was, surprisingly enough, just trying to associate with her and Sam on a purely social level. It was a side of her boss that Josie had never seen before and she was positive that it was because of her best friend's influence that he was even attempting it. Josie still wasn't sure, however, of what Sam thought of the whole thing, of being once again submitted to questions and scrutiny by someone he barely knew. She secretly wondered if he'd get tired of strangers poking their nose in his life and decide she wasn't worth the aggravation. \"I'm really sorry about that.\" She told Sam as they walked hand-in-hand towards his car. \"I didn't mean for them to join us like that. It just kind of happened.\" \"Don't worry about it, Josie.\" Sam quickly assured her, giving her hand a tight squeeze. \"It was actually kind of fun. I really like Anita and I think Gus has potential.\" Josie couldn't help but smile at that. Stopping mid-stride he turned to look at her, a serious look on his face. \"I'm just glad that he didn't get upset when he found out about you telling me the truth about everything.\" \"He was surprisingly good about it.\" She commented seriously as they reached his car. \"I fully expected to be fired when he found out that I'd told you the truth.\" \"How did he take it?\" Sam asked as he opened the door for her and looked at her curiously. \"And what made you decide to tell him?\" \"I didn't decide to tell him.\" She replied pointedly. \"He figured out that I'd told you himself.\" \"What?\" Sam exclaimed in alarm. \"I hope I didn't do anything to tip him off! I tried to be so careful while you had that camera…\" \"Sam, it's okay!\" Josie quickly assured him. \"It wasn't you…at least it wasn't only you. Gus got suspicious after seeing your car parked at Mom and Dad's the other night. He knew that you drove a black Jetta and he copied down the license plate number and had a friend of his at the CPD run it for him today. The only reason he did that was because of the way I acted when I was talking to him in the kitchen. He said that was what convinced him that something was up. If it's anybody's fault, its mine.\" Sam closed the car door and stepped closer to her, placing his hands on her arms. \"It's not anybody's fault. Besides, its for the best anyway. It's not like we wanted to keep our relationship from people. At least now your boss knows the truth. Maybe now we can start telling other people about us. Maybe starting with my boss.\" Josie's eyes widened slightly in alarm. \"What do you think he'll say?\" \"I'm sure Jack will be okay with everything.\" Sam assured her, then added pointedly. \"As long as we get to him first and explain the whole thing before anyone else finds out.\" \"And before my article comes out.\" Josie added with understanding. \"Exactly.\" Sam nodded. Glancing at her watch she asked. \"Think he'd still be in his office?\" \"Probably not.\" Sam shook his head. \"But he's always there by eight o'clock. We can see him before classes start tomorrow.\" \"It's a date.\" Josie gave him a broad smile. Then her smile faltered as she asked. \"Think he'll be upset?\" \"I don't think so.\" He ventured to reply. \"I've known Jack for a few years now and as long as there was nothing involving a real student, then I can't see him having a problem with it. But that's why I want to tell him myself - ourselves. That way we can explain things so he understands exactly how everything played out.\" \"Sounds good.\" She nodded and then smiled as Sam once again opened the car door for her and waited patiently until she was seated inside before closing it. Then jogging around the car he climbed behind the wheel. \"So, where to now?\" He asked as he put the keys in the ignition and turned the car on. Glancing at the clock in his dash he said. \"We've got about an hour until game time, what do you want to do until then?\" \"Actually,\" Josie flushed slightly. \"Aldys is suppose to pick me up at my place at six-forty-five. Then we're going over to the stadium early to meet Gibby, Kirsten and Kristen.\" She made a face as she said the three 'cool girls' names. Sam laughed. \"I take it you're not that excited about meeting the others.\" \"Not overly.\" She admitted. Then after a thoughtful pause she added. \"When I was in High School, I desperately wanted to be part of the 'in' crowd. I would have given almost anything to be the most popular girl in school, but now…well, I've finally realized that being popular isn't all that it's cracked up to be.\" \"Seems like this assignment has been a blessing in more ways than one.\" Sam remarked seriously. \"What do you mean?\" She looked at him curiously. \"Well, for one thing it's helped you eliminate the regrets that you've had since High School.\" He commented matter-of-factly. \"You'll no longer have to wonder 'what if'.\" \"That's true.\" Josie acknowledged with a nod. \"I no longer feel like an outcast, like someone whose on the outside looking in.\" \"And because of that you feel more confident about yourself.\" Sam remarked, more as a statement then a question. Josie looked at him in surprise. \"Yeah, I guess I do. I actually feel pretty good about myself now. Like maybe I'm not such a loser after all.\" \"You're not a loser, Josie.\" Her companion quickly assured her, his hand gently caressing her face. \"You are beautiful, talented, intelligent and I love you more than I've ever loved anyone in my entire life. And as far as I'm concerned, the greatest blessing that ever came out of this assignment of yours was us.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" Josie blinked slightly as tears filled her eyes. \"I love you.\" Sam responded to her words by capturing her mouth in a tender kiss, deepening it when he felt her reach up at tangle her fingers in his hair. He felt his scalp tingle under her touch as he lost himself in the kiss, in the feeling of having her lips pressed against his, her hands running through his hair. Sam was so caught up in the explosion of feelings he was having that it took several moments for him to realize that her hands were no longer in his hair, but were now pushing against his chest. \"Sam!\" She mumbled as she pulled her lips away from his. \"Um.\" He murmured protesting the separation as he captured her lips again. \"Sam!\" Josie once again pulled back from his lips and called his name, her hands pressing harder against his chest. The near panic in her tone finally got Sam's attention. Pulling back slightly it took him a moment to focus enough to realize why Josie sounded so nervous. He'd been so caught up in their kiss that he hadn't realized that he'd pressed her rather awkwardly against the passenger door. She'd obviously been trying to get his attention for some time in an effort to break off the passionate kiss, but when he'd failed to heed her wishes she'd gotten scared. Flushing slightly at his uncontrolled behavior he sat back up in his seat, giving her a chance to compose herself. After a few minutes he glanced over at her and noticed tears in the corners of her eyes. \"Oh, Josie.\" He felt his heart constrict with guilt as he realized he was the cause of her current distress. \"I am so sorry.\" She closed her eyes, desperately trying to hide her tears, but that only succeeded in causing them to streak down her face. Turning in his head Sam reached over to wipe the tears off her cheek. When she didn't pull away he lifted her chin to make her look at him. When she didn't he pleaded gently. \"Josie, look at me.\" When she still refused to make eye contact he whispered. \"Please.\" After a few moments she looked at him, her eyes wet with tears. Her teary look nearly broke Sam's heart. \"I am so sorry for upsetting you. I never meant for that to happen. I guess I just got a little carried away.\" He smiled slightly as he added. \"You're just such a good kisser.\" Josie chuckled slightly, more from nerves than anything else. Sam took that as a good sign and forged ahead. \"I never meant to make you feel uncomfortable. And I promise that I will never let it happen again.\" Josie gave him a measuring look before asking the question that had been plaguing her since she'd first pushed him away. \"You don't hate me?\" \"Hate you?\" Sam looked at her in astonishment. \"Oh sweetheart, I could never hate you. And I want you to tell me anytime I do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Understand?\" When she nodded he reached up and gently stroked her cheek. \"This is not some short-lived fling for me. I don't want to push you into anything that you don't want to do. I'm here for the long haul and we'll take things as slow or as fast as you want to. Okay?\" Josie's eyes teared up again, but this time for a completely different reason. Covering Sam's hand with hers she gave it a warm squeeze and said. \"I love you, Sam Coulson and I want this relationship to last too. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I do. But like you said the other night, this is my first - and I hope only - real relationship and I want to enjoy it, every step of it. This is all so new to me, so for now I want to enjoy just being your girlfriend.\" \"And I want to enjoy being your boyfriend.\" Sam assured her. \"A lot of this is new for me too.\" When Josie looked at him in surprise he explained, taking her hand in his. \"Josie, you've awaken feelings in me that I've never felt before.\" \"Like what?\" She asked curiously. \"Well, like jealously for one thing.\" He replied, eliciting another surprised look from her. \"For the last several weeks I've been almost crazy with jealousy because of the attention you were getting from Rob and Guy. You know the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do in my life was to announce the King and Queen dance at the Prom. I felt like I was handing you over to Guy on a silver platter when all I really wanted to do was pull you to me and hold you tightly. I wanted to dance with you, touch you and hold you so much that I was almost aching with want.\" \"Really?\" She looked at him with surprise on her face. \"Really.\" He assured her. \"Josie, you've touched me in so many ways.\" \"What about Rob?\" She asked him curiously. \"Rob never touched me the way you did.\" Sam told her with a very straight face. Josie laughed and slapped his arm lightly. \"That's not what I meant. I meant why would you have been jealous of my relationship with him? He's my brother.\" \"Because until Friday night I had no idea that he was your brother.\" Sam pointed out. \"All I knew was that the two of you seemed to be very close friends, but I was having a hard time figuring out just how close of friends you were. Sometimes I'd be sure that you two were an item, but then you'd do something that didn't seem to indicate a romantic involvement.\" \"Like what?\" Josie questioned curiously. \"Like the time Rob gave you a noogy in the school cafeteria.\" Sam commented. \"That's not usually something a guy does to his girlfriend - not unless they've been going out for quite a long time and they've gone passed the 'best behavior' stage.\" Josie laughed at that remark and said mischievously. \"Than Rob doesn't stand a chance because that is his 'best behavior' stage.\" After they both chuckled Josie expression turned serious again as she admitted. \"I was jealous too.\" \"What?\" He looked at her in surprise. \"Of what?\" \"Of Lara.\" She replied softly. \"I was jealous because she had you, because I knew I could only dream of having someone as wonderful as you in my life even though I wanted it so much. I wanted you so much. I'd already fallen in love with you by the time I'd met Lara at Delloser and my heart nearly broke when she introduced herself to me as your girlfriend. Then when she said you were moving to New York, well lets just say my prognosis wasn't very good.\" \"I noticed the look on your face when she said that.\" Sam commented. \"You looked at me like you'd just lost your best friend.\" \"I thought I had.\" She whispered softly. \"Oh, Josie.\" Sam sighed slightly and gently caressed her cheek. \"I'm not going anywhere. You're my best friend too and the love of my life. I'm not going anywhere.\" Josie was too choked with emotion to speak. Instead she let her smile and her eyes convey the emotions she was feeling. \"Josie! Up here!\" Gibby waved frantically from the top row of the stadium stands, desperately trying to get the blond girl's attention. Josie and Aldys waved back in acknowledgement as they climbed the flight of stairs and joined Gibby and her friends. \"Where have you been?\" She demanded anxiously. \"I thought we were suppose to meet at the gate at seven o'clock. The games going to start in ten minutes.\" Looking pointedly at Aldys she added crisply. \"I hope nothing held you up.\" \"Actually, its my fault that we're late, Gibby.\" Josie told the dark haired girl as she and Aldys sat on the end of the top row. \"I asked her to pick me up at six-forty-five, but I didn't end up getting home until about seven then I had to change. I had a few errands to do downtown and they took me longer than I expected.\" \"Well, I guess the main thing is that you're here now.\" Gibby commented, still giving Aldys a cool look. \"So what have we missed?\" Josie asked, looking out to the field where the team was warming up. Squinting slightly as if she was trying to find someone she finally asked. \"I don't see Rob. Is he out there?\" \"Didn't you hear?\" Kirstin asked eagerly. \"Hear what?\" Josie asked, playing along with them. \"That poor Robbie Rob hurt his knee during practice this afternoon.\" Kristen pouted, a real sorrowful look on her face. \"Oh, that's awful!\" Aldys exclaimed, also putting in a very good performance. Josie had told her on the way over that Rob was going to feign an injury to get out of playing in the championship game. \"I hope he's not too disappointed about it.\" \"He's taking it surprisingly well.\" Guy commented from his seat in front of Josie and Gibby. \"Especially since all he talked about last week was the big game. Well, that and Prom.\" \"But I bet the game came first.\" Josie commented knowingly. Guy nodded and laughed. \"Doesn't everything that involves baseball.\" Josie laughed again. \"I see you've come to know Rob very well. So where's the big baseball freak now?\" Guy pointed towards the home team's dugout and replied. \"He told me earlier that Coach Romano is going to let him be Assistant coach for the night. He seemed excited about that.\" \"He would be.\" Josie remarked with an exaggerated roll of her eyes. \"I think that guy was born with a baseball in one hand and a mitt in the other.\" Her companions all chuckled with knowing amusement. \"Hey, there's Mr. Coo lson!\" Kristen exclaimed excitedly, pointing towards the bottom of the stands to where Sam and a blond-haired woman were carefully scanning the crowd. \"Who's that with him?\" Tommy asked curiously. \"His girlfriend maybe.\" Guy suggested as they all peered curiously at the pair at the bottom of the stairs. \"She looks too old to be his girlfriend.\" Jason commented seriously. \"I mean, I know Mr. C.'s old, but I don't think he's that old.\" His comment caused Josie to bite her lip to keep from replying. \"She's not his girlfriend.\" Kirstin assured them matter-of-factly. \"How do you know?\" Tommy asked looking at her in surprise. \"Because I heard that he and his girlfriend just broke up.\" She told him, her eyes sparkling with delight when she realized she had some juicy gossip they didn't know. \"Apparently he decided that he didn't want to move to New York after all and sent her packing.\" \"How do you know this?\" Josie blurted out before she could stop herself. \"Cynthia Payne told me.\" Kirstin told her in a tone that clearly indicated that she should have known that. \"And Sally Henderson told her and she got it from Sarah Ford who's cousin's step-sister's boyfriend's niece lives in Mr. Coulson's apartment building.\" She frowned slightly as she added. \"Though I understand that he now longer lives in that apartment anymore.\" \"Guess you're going to have to find a new gossip line to get your Mr. Cool son bulletins from.\" Guy remarked a trifle sarcastically. \"I guess so.\" Kirstin acknowledged a little sadly. It had taken her the better part of her freshman year to find that connection to her favorite teacher's private life. \"I'd say she's his mother.\" Jason remarked, drawing everyone's attention back to Sam and his companion. \"She looks like she could be his mother.\" \"Then he's got one foxy looking mother.\" Tommy exclaimed with a laugh. Behind the boys' backs Josie blushed a deep shade of red for the woman under discussion was not Sam's mother, but her own. But what she was doing there and with Sam was a mystery. Sam had left Josie at her apartment to meet Aldys and then had continued on, supposedly to go home and do some unpacking. He'd said that he probably wouldn't be at the game since he had so much to do to get ready for exams the next week and his apartment was still in complete disarray since he hadn't had any time to unpack yet. They'd made arrangements to meet the next morning for breakfast before going to the school to talk to Jack Harding, the principle. So what was he doing here now and with her mother? \"Let's invite them to join us.\" Gibby suggested to the others as she started waving her hands over her head trying to attract the pairs' attention. \"Mr. Coulson! Mrs. Coulson!\" Sam looked up when he heard his name being called and spotted Josie sitting beside the waving Gibby. Raising a hand to acknowledge that he'd seen them, he said something to his companion before they climbed the stairs to meet them. Josie looked at the other girl and corrected. \"That's not Sa…I mean Mr. Coulson's mother.\" \"How do you know?\" Gibby asked curiously \"Because she's…she's, ah, Rob's mother.\" Josie stuttered slightly as her mother and Sam finally joined them. \"Hi Josie, girls.\" Janet Geller smiled at Josie and her companions warmly. She knew she probably shouldn't be there, but she couldn't help herself. She'd been dying of curiosity to see how her daughter was managing being in the High school environment for the second time around. When she'd heard about the championship game and had learned that Josie was gong with the 'popular' kids, Janet decided she'd take the opportunity to observe her daughter in action, especially since she had the excuse of coming to watch her son play on the team. Josie looked at her mother and gave her a welcoming smile. \"Hi, Mrs.…\" Her eyes widened as she realized that she couldn't call her mother by her last name without giving everything away. Fortunately her mother was quick on her feet. As if reading her daughter's mind she said. \"Josie dear, how many times do I have to tell you to call me Janet. You and Rob have known each other since you were babies. I think we've gone past the 'Mrs.' Thing.\" Josie flushed slightly as she said. \"Sorry. It just seems so impolite to call you 'Janet' .\" Especially since you're my mother. Josie finished silently. \"Nonsense.\" Janet Geller dismissed with a wave of her hand. Then looking at the others she asked eagerly. \"Now are you going to introduce me to your friends or do I have to do it myself.\" Giving her mother a knowing look she proceeded to make the introductions. \"Janet, this is Gibby, Kirstin, Kristen, Guy, Tommy and Jason. And I guess you've already met Mr. Coulson.\" \"Yes, he was kind enough to offer to help me find you after I spoke to Rob.\" Glancing at Sam she added sincerely. \"I thought that was very nice of him.\" \"Oh, Mr. Cool son is always nice.\" Kristen gushed slightly as she gave her teacher an appreciative smile. Sam flushed slightly with embarrassment at the teenage girl's comment. Looking at Janet he said. \"Well, I guess I'll leave you to your visiting. It was very nice to meet you.\" \"You don't have to go.\" Janet quickly assured him. Then putting a gentle hand on his arm she invited. \"Why don't you stay and watch the game with us. We'd love to have your company, wouldn't we girls?\" The glanced at the five girls before her, her eyes resting ever so slightly longer on Josie than the others. \"Well, I…\" He hesitated slightly, glancing at Josie to see what she thought about the idea. She gave him a smile and an almost imperceptible nod. \"Please, Mr. Coulson.\" Gibby pleaded unashamedly. \"Please stay and watch the game with us. It'll be so rufus!\" Sam couldn't help but chuckle at her plea. \"Well, since you asked so nicely, how can I say no.\" \"Yes.\" The three 'popular' girls cheered victoriously. \"Here, you can sit right here.\" Gibby invited, scooting over slightly and patting the empty space between herself and Josie. Sam eyed the small space momentarily than suggested innocently. \"Why don't you slide over a little more so that Janet can sit down as well.\" Gibby frowned slightly but did as he asked. Ever the gentleman Sam turned to Josie's mother and said. \"Ladies first.\" Janet gave him a knowing smile. \"Why thank you, Sam.\" As the pair claimed their seats Janet glanced down at the ballfield and commented with awe. \"Wow, we're higher up than I thought. The players look like little ants down there.\" She was so intent on watching the players that she failed to notice that the man beside her tense up in fear. Her daughter, however, noticed it instantly. Wracking her brain to think of a way to help him relax, Josie finally came up with an idea. Casually crossing her arms she leaned against Sam, using her left arm to conceal the fact that her right hand was wrapped around his right bicep. When he turned to look at her she flashed him a reassuring smile and gave his arm a gentle squeeze. Sam smiled back and mirrored her posture, using his right arm and her left to hide the fact that he was now holding her hand tightly in his own. Squeezing her hand tightly in his he gave her a tender smile. Sam still found it amazing that one simple touch from Josie was all it took to calm his fears. He was so lost in the feel of Josie's touch that it took him several moments to realize that Gibby was talking to him. Turning his attention from Josie to Gibby he leaned forward to see passed Janet and said apologetically. \"I'm sorry, Gibby, I wasn't listening. What was that again?\" \"I was just wondering what your plans were for the summer.\" Gibby replied, an expectant look on her face as well as those of her companions. \"Well, I haven't really thought about it.\" He admitted honestly. \"I'm planning to go to Wisconsin next month to visit my folks.\" He didn't change where his focus was centered, but he did give Josie's hand a squeeze as if to silently assure her that she was part of that plan. \"And just today I signed up to play baseball with a locally sponsored team.\" \"Which team is that?\" Jason asked curiously. \"Maybe we'll come watch you play sometime.\" \"Definitely.\" Gibby, Kristen and Kirstin exclaimed simultaneously. \"I'll be playing on the Chicago Sun-Times team.\" Sam told them proudly. \"The Chicago Sun-Times team?\" Janet Geller exclaimed in surprise. \"But I thought only employees were allowed to play on that team.\" She glanced at Josie over Sam's head. \"Apparently this year they've decided to let friends and family participate too.\" Sam explained, trying to ignore the silent conversation that seemed to be transpiring over his head between the two Geller women. Josie knew exactly what her mother's expression was asking. Did this mean that Gus knew the truth about her and Sam? And since friends and family members were now allowed to play on the team, had she signed Rob up for the team too? Josie nodded yes to both unspoken questions. \"Who do you know at the Chicago Sun-Times?\" Gibby asked curiously. \"My girlfriend's a reporter there.\" Sam told them proudly, fighting the urge to look at Josie as he said it. Kirstin gave him a confused look. \"I thought your girlfriend was a lawyer in New York. I also thought I heard that you two had broken up a couple weeks ago.\" Sam gave the teenage girl a mildly amused look. \"I didn't realize my personal life was open to such public knowledge.\" Kirsten shrugged slightly and said. \"The personal life of any handsome, eligible guy is always open to public knowledge.\" Josie looked at Aldys, trying to hid the deeply amused look that was on her face as Sam flushed brightly at the younger woman's words. \"So did you and your girlfriend break up or not?\" Kristen pressed curiously. Collecting himself Sam managed to answer her question. \"Yes, Lara, my old girlfriend, and I broke up two weeks ago. She is a lawyer in New York.\" \"So you've got a new girlfriend now.\" Gibby commented, obviously deeply interested in his response. \"That's right.\" Sam nodded. \"So when did you and this new girlfriend of yours get together?\" Kirstin prodded. Sam grinned indulgently and replied. \"Josie and I started dating this weekend.\" \"Josie?\" The three girls exclaimed in surprise. \"Your girlfriend's name is Josie?\" Gibby repeated. Sam silently chided himself for his slip but nodded his head. \"Yes, her name is Josie.\" Leaning around Sam to look at her friend Gibby teased. \"I bet you wish you were that Josie, eh?\" Josie blushed slightly but managed to keep her tone even as she replied. \"She certainly is a lucky woman.\" \"Very lucky.\" Kristen sighed deeply. \"I hope she realizes it too because we're all so envious of her.\" Josie squeezed Sam's hand tightly to assure him that she did realize just how lucky she was. Fighting the urge to turn and look at Josie, Sam told Kristen sincerely. \"I'm the lucky one.\" Giving Josie's hand another squeeze he added. \"I'm the one who's lucky enough to have the love of the most amazing woman I have ever met.\" Because his head was turned away from her Sam didn't notice the tears well up in Josie's eyes or the tender smile that was on her lips. But someone else did. A suspicious frown appeared on Guy Perkins face as he watched the variety of emotions that played across Josie's face as Sam spoke to Kirstin, Gibby and Kristen about his new girlfriend. At first he thought that it was because she had a crush on him just like the other three girls did. But then when Sam had said that he and his new girlfriend had gotten together over the weekend he'd remembered what Rob had told him earlier about Josie and the guy that she liked. And the fact that Mr. Coulson's new girlfriend's name was 'Josie' made him even more suspicious. Could she be the one that he was talking about? He'd noticed how cozy they seemed to be sitting there together, their arms pressed closely together. He's also noticed on more than one occasion how Mr. Coulson would look at Josie when he thought no one was looking. And the way he'd stared almost longingly at her when she and Guy had been dancing during the King and Queen dance at Prom seem to clearly indicate the depth of his attraction to her. But was Josie really a reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times instead of a seventeen-year-old High School student? And if so, what was she doing at South Glen South masquerading as a High School student? Guy was at a total loss for answers to any of his questions. He examined the pair more closely, noticing that both were unaware of his scrutiny since they were engrossed in their own conversations - Josie with Aldys and Mr. Coulson with Janet and the others. As he examined their faces and their demeanor nothing seemed amiss. They both seemed open and friendly, there wasn't any outward appearance of any deceit or misconceptions. Guy began to wonder if he was just allowing his imaginations and his feelings for Josie get the better of him when Sam suddenly lifted his right hand to scratch the back of his head. It was obviously an unconscious movement, because he just continued with his conversation as if nothing had happened, but something had. He'd just given away the fact that neatly and comfortably tucked in his left hand was Josie's right. Josie smiled as she took a sip of her herbal tea. It had been a wonderful evening. The Rams had won seven to five, Aldys had been grudgingly accepted by the 'in' crowd and even invited to go shopping with the girls on Friday after school and most importantly Sam had been there. And thanks to her mother they'd even gotten a few minutes alone together. It had been just before the fifth inning when her mother had suddenly decided that she wanted a hot dog and a drink. She'd then offered to treat the whole gang to a drink and Frankfurt, which she proceeded to commission Sam and Josie to go and get. The two had eagerly obliged, both secretly thanking Janet Geller for her generosity and her sneakiness. As the couple had made their way from the stands to the refreshment cart Josie had asked Sam what he was doing there. \"I thought you had exams to prepare for and boxes to unpack.\" She'd commented as they'd walked along, side by side. \"I do.\" He'd replied with a nod of confirmation. \"And I had every intention of doing some unpacking tonight.\" \"So what happened?\" She'd pressed curiously. \"I got home to my apartment, walked in the door and felt…lonely.\" He'd given her such a tender look that Josie felt her knees start to go weak. \"I missed you.\" He'd whispered softly. \"I missed you too.\" She'd assured him warmly, secretly wishing that nobody else were around so she could show him how much she missed him when he wasn't around. Instead she'd added. \"But you have to get your exams written. You're suppose to be giving them next week.\" \"I'm not worried about the exams.\" He'd told her honestly. \"It's the unpacking that I'm concerned about.\" \"Why's that?\" Josie'd asked curiously. \"Because there's so much of it?\" \"No, that doesn't even bother me.\" He'd commented, still not directly answering her question. \"Samuel Coulson, will you please spit it out!\" She'd finally exclaimed in growing impatience. \"What is it about unpacking that has you worried?\" \"Well, for starters,\" He'd began thoughtfully. \"I'm not sure where to put the fuzzy poke-a-dot elephant or the crazy leopard with the lime green spots.\" Josie'd started to laughed in amusement as she caught his meaning, remembering the fun she and Joanne Harper had had while they were packing up Sam's stuff. Near the end as they were getting tired of their task, they'd started labeling some of Sam's boxes with fancier labels than others. \"Don't forget the purple and orange stripped platypus and the man-eating lion.\" \"I think I should make you and Jo come and unpack those since you decided to label them with such helpful descriptions.\" Sam had commented as they approached the cart. \"But that takes all the fun out of it.\" Josie had pouted in a playful tone. \"Besides, if we helped you you'd never be able to find the fuzzy poke-a-dot leopard or the crazy elephant with lime green spots.\" \"Actually, it was a fuzzy poke-a-dot elephant and a crazy leopard with lime green spots.\" Sam had corrected after he'd placed his order with the cart vendor. \"Oh, excuse me.\" She'd rolled her eyes heavenward. \"My mistake.\" \"Hey, you were the one that labeled the boxes, not me.\" He'd exclaimed, holding up his hands in a defensive posture. The pair laughed and gathered up their order. On the way back to the stands with their stash they'd made arrangements to meet at Perks after the game. As Josie fingered the mug that bore the coffee shop's green and yellow logo she couldn't help but smile at the thought of how quickly this was becoming 'their' spot. They'd only been dating for about seventy-two hours and this was their third time here. The sudden ring of her cellphone quickly brought Josie out of her musings. \"Hello?\" She greeted her caller pleasantly. \"Hi.\" An unfamiliar voice greeted warmly on the other end. \"Is this Josie?\" \"Yes it is.\" Josie affirmed, trying hard to place the voice and failing. \"Who's this?\" \"I'm Abby Waite.\" The other woman replied pleasantly. \"I'm Sam's big sister.\" \"Oh, yes of course.\" Josie acknowledged in a friendly tone. \"Sam's told me a lot about you. How's everything in California?\" \"Hot.\" Abby replied with a slight chuckle. \"But then when is it not hot in California?\" \"Hey, don't knock it.\" Josie commented lightly. \"At least you don't have to shovel snow.\" \"True enough.\" Abby agreed with a smile. \"I did enough of that when I lived in Wisconsin.\" Then changing the subject she said. \"Look, I'm sorry to bother you on your private cell, but Sam gave me this number in case of an emergency.\" \"Is everything all right?\" Josie asked, her tone filling with concern. \"Yeah, everything's fine here.\" The other woman quickly assured her. \"It's my brother I'm worried about.\" \"What do you mean?\" Josie frowned slightly in confusion. \"Well, he called me up Friday night - actually it was about one-thirty Saturday morning - all happy and excited about the two of you getting together, but then after that he falls off the face of the earth.\" Abby told her, her concern evident in her tone. \"I tried calling him all day Saturday and then again Sunday evening, but there was no answer. And now when I call his place I get a recording saying that the number has been disconnected, but no forwarding number is listed. Do you happen to know where that brother of mine has disappeared to?\" Josie smiled brightly as Sam walked through the door of the coffee shop at that very moment. \"As a matter of fact I do.\" She assured the other woman. \"He's meeting me for coffee and he just walked in the door.\" Her smile broadened as Sam reached the table, leaned down and gave her a kiss and whispered 'Hi Beautiful' before claiming the seat across from her. Giggling slightly she said to Abby. \"Here he is.\" Holding the phone out to Sam she said. \"It's for you.\" When he gave her a surprised look she added. \"It's your sister.\" Sam smiled slightly and took the offered phone. Putting it to his ear he greeted warmly. \"Hey, Ab what's up?\" \"Don't I get a 'Hi, Beautiful' too?\" Abby teased, pretending to be insulted at his greeting. \"Sorry.\" Sam replied with a chuckle. \"I only say 'Hi, Beautiful' to one woman and that's not you.\" \"Gee, thanks Squirt.\" She retorted with mock-sarcasm. \"So where have you been hiding these last few days? I've been trying to call you all weekend but you haven't been around. Then tonight I called and got a recorded message saying that your number was no longer in service.\" \"I moved to my new apartment this weekend.\" Sam reminded her with amusement. \"Remember the one that you encouraged me to take because it would give me a fresh start without memories of Lara, etc, etc.\" \"Oh, yeah, that apartment.\" Abby recalled with a laugh. \"I completely forgot about that.\" \"Getting forgetful in your old age, are you Ab?\" Her brother teased mercilessly. \"Hey, I'm not that much older than you, bub.\" She retorted with pretend annoyance. \"So what's the place like? It's closer to the school right?\" Sam hesitated for a moment before saying gently. \"Listen, Abby, no offense or anything but…\" \"But your on a date with Josie and would greatly appreciate it if you nosey big sister would just shut up and hang up.\" Abby finished good-naturedly. Sam smiled and objected. \"I wouldn't put it quite that way, but that's the basic idea, yes.\" \"It's okay, I understand.\" She assured him as she let out an exaggerated sigh. \"I know when I'm not wanted. I guess I'll just have to go and drown my hurt feelings in a good cup of tea.\" The pair both chuckled in amusement. \"But before I let you go back to your date, when do you think you might be getting a phone? I mean I wouldn't want to keep interrupting your dates with Josie.\" \"They said something about coming sometime between noon tomorrow and five o'clock next week.\" He told her teasingly. Abby laughed in amusement. \"At least they gave you a definite appointment. Just don't forget to give me your new number or else I will harass you during your dates.\" \"Is that a threat?\" He challenged. \"No,\" She replied innocently. \"More like a promise. I'll be in touch.\" Sam laughed lightly and promised. \"So will I.\" \"Say 'bye' to Josie for me.\" She commented. \"I will.\" He acknowledged, giving Josie a warm smile. \"And Sam,\" Abby added in a serious tone. \"Yeah?\" \"She seems really terrific.\" His sister told him sincerely. Reaching over to squeeze Josie's hand he echoed with heart-felt feeling. \"She is.\" \"Love ya, Squirt.\" Abby said. \"Take care.\" \"I will.\" He promised. \"Love you too.\" Hitting the end button he handed the phone back to Josie. \"Abby said to say 'bye'.\" Josie smiled with pleasure. \"I think I'm going to really like your sister.\" Sam smiled and squeezed her hand again. \"Well she really likes you too.\" \"So what's happening between noon tomorrow and five o'clock next week?\" She asked curiously as he signaled to a passing waitress that he'd like a coffee. \"That's when the Phone Company is suppose to come and hook up my phone.\" He told her. \"Nice of them to give you such a definite time frame.\" She commented with mild sarcasm. \"Makes it a lot easier to plan your week.\" \"Actually they said it would be tomorrow sometime between noon and five.\" Sam admitted as the waitress he'd signaled brought him a cup of coffee. \"Thank you.\" He acknowledged. \"Can I get you anything else?\" The young woman asked pleasantly. \"No thanks, Sarah.\" Sam acknowledged, reading the girl's nametag. \"I'm fine.\" \"I wouldn't mind another pot of hot water, Sarah.\" Josie requested. \"Sure, Josie.\" The girl nodded. \"I'll be right back.\" When the girl left Sam looked at her in surprise. \"You know her?\" Josie shook her head. \"Just met her tonight when I came in. She commented that she'd seen us here on Friday. She goes to Northwestern.\" \"That's where you went to college, right?\" He remarked as he poured some cream in his coffee. \"That's right.\" She nodded. \"Sarah even has some of my old professors. Isn't that right, Sarah?\" She asked the girl as she set the full tea pot in front of her. \"That's right.\" She nodded. \"And one of them you can keep. Oh, I can't stand Professor Marshall. What a pompous baffoon that guy is! He is so full of himself.\" \"True, but he does know his subject well.\" Josie commented honestly. \"That's true.\" Sarah grudgingly agreed. Then noticing the new customers coming in dismissed herself and went to wait on them. Sam chuckled. \"She seems like a nice enough girl.\" Josie nodded. \"Yeah, she seems all right.\" Then turning her attention back to their previous conversation she asked. \"So what are you going to do about the Phone Company? You have classes all day tomorrow, don't you?\" Sam nodded as he took a sip of his coffee. \"I also have a staff meeting at four which will be at least an hour.\" Setting his coffee down he sighed and continued. \"I guess I have no choice but to go home for my lunch break and hope that they show between noon and twelve-thirty. And if they don't then I'll go back after my last class finishes at two and stay until I have to go back for the staff meeting at four.\" \"That's an awful lot of running around.\" Josie commented in dismay. \"I mean I know your new apartment is a lot closer to the school than your old one, but that's still an awful lot of wasted time.\" \"I know.\" Sam agreed with nod. \"But I don't really have much choice. \"They don't do installations on the weekend at it'll be at least two or three weeks before I'm off during the week. I can't go that long without a phone.\" He noticed Josie glance at her cell. \"And I can't have everyone I know harassing you whenever they want to get a hold of me.\" Josie gave the situation several moments thought before suggesting. \"Why don't I wait for the Phone Company for you?\" \"What do you mean?\" He frowned slightly as he set his coffee cup back down after taking a sip. \"You have work too.\" \"I know, but right now my schedule is a bit more flexible than yours.\" She commented. \"I could just as easily do my work at your place as anywhere.\" She replied. \"I mean, technically I'm not a High School student, so if I play hooky from its not exactly going to count against me and now that Gus knows the truth I don't have to keep up the charade for his benefit. I have a laptop and all my notes I could quite easily do my work at your apartment. That way you don't have to run back and forth half a dozen times in hope of catching the Phone Company.\" With a twinkle in her eye she added teasingly. \"Maybe I can even find a spot to put the fuzzy poke-a-dot elephant and the crazy leopard with the lime green spots.\" Sam chuckled in amusement and added. \" Don't forget the purple and orange stripped platypus and the man-eating lion.\" \"I won't.\" Josie laughed lightly. \"So it's a deal?\" \"Deal.\" He acknowledged, looking at her tenderly for several moments. \"What?\" She pressed when he didn't say anything for several moments. Reaching over to tuck a piece of hair behind her ear he gave her a warm smile and said. \"You are amazing, Josie Geller.\" Josie blushed with pleasure, her heart pounding fiercely against her chest. It was just after seven when Josie pulled up in front of Sam's apartment building the next morning. Getting out of the car she grabbed her briefcase, duffel bag and the case that contained her laptop. Then leaning back into the front seat she grabbed the cardboard tray that held two cups of steaming Starbucks coffee and a bag of fresh Danishes. Using her foot she kicked closed the driver's door of the Buick and headed for the apartment building. She arrived at the front door at the same time as a young woman sporting jogging clothes and sneakers. \"Here, let me get that for you.\" The dark-haired girl offered, her tone slightly breathless from her exercise. \"You seem to have your hands full.\" \"Thanks.\" Josie acknowledged with a slight chuckle as she moved through the door. \"I was wondering how I was going to get that opened.\" \"You live here?\" The girl asked after they'd made it into the lobby. \"No.\" Josie replied as she shifted her burdens slightly. \"My boyfriend just moved in on Sunday.\" \"You don't mean that really cute guy that just moved into 1215, do you?\" Her companion asked with obvious dismay. \"That's him.\" Josie nodded as they waited for the elevator. \"Have you met him already?\" \"Not yet.\" The girl replied honestly then admitted. \"I just watched him as he moved in the other day. You've got yourself quite a good-looking guy there. I was hoping he was unattached.\" \"Sorry to disappoint you.\" Josie said with a grin as she once again shifted her packages. \"But he's spoken for.\" \"You want a hand with that stuff?\" The other woman offered willingly. Josie hesitated for a moment than agreed. \"That would be great.\" She surrendered the tray of coffee and Danishes to her new acquaintance then shifted her other bags, distributing their weight more evenly. \"By the way, I'm Nikki Finlay.\" The girl introduced with a smile. \"I live in apartment 1212.\" \"So I guess that would make you and Sam neighbors.\" Josie commented as the elevator chimed and the doors opened. \"I guess it would.\" Nikki replied as they stepped into the elevator car and she selected the twelfth floor. \"So what's your name?\" Josie flushed slightly at her lack of manners. \"Josie. Josie Geller.\" \"Well, its nice to meet you Josie Geller.\" Then looking at all the stuff that Josie was carrying she asked curiously. \"So, are you moving in too?\" Josie flushed again and shook her head. \"No, I'm just apartment sitting for the day. Sam has to go to work and the Phone Company is suppose to be here to hook up his phone sometime between noon and five.\" Nikki rolled her eyes and commented sarcastically. \"Don't you just love their definite appointment schedule?\" Josie laughed. \"Yeah, it makes life sooo much simpler.\" The two women chuckled as the elevator doors opened on the twelfth floor and they got off. They walked in silence down the hall to Sam's apartment where Josie knocked lightly on the door. \"Just a minute!\" They heard Sam call from inside before the door opened a few moments later to reveal Sam dressed in the same blue shirt and black pants that he was wearing the day Josie met him. His green eyes lit up and a broad grin spread across his face as he greeted his precious visitor. \"Morning Beautiful.\" Not even noticing Nikki who was standing beside Josie he leaned forward to place a tender kiss on Josie's smiling lips. It wasn't until he pulled away that he realized that they weren't alone. Flushing slightly he looked at Josie's companion and said pleasantly. \"I don't believe we've met. I'm Sam Coulson.\" \"Nikki Finlay.\" Nikki returned brightly. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Sam.\" \"You a friend of Josie's?\" He asked curiously. He didn't recall hearing the name before. \"No, just a Good Samaritan doing my good deep for the day.\" She replied with a slight chuckle as she held out the cardboard tray she was holding to Sam. As Sam accepted the tray Josie explained. \"Nikki was kind enough to open the door for me and help me carry some of this stuff up here. Speaking of which, this stuff is getting kind of heavy. Are you planning on keeping us out here all day, Coulson?\" \"I'm sorry, honey.\" Sam quickly apologized and moved out of the doorway to let them in. Josie moved inside immediately but Nikki hesitated, remaining uncertainly in the doorway. As Josie dumped her bags on the couch Sam looked curiously at her. \"Would you like to come in?\" The girl continued to hesitate. \"I don't want to intrude.\" \"You're not intruding.\" Sam quickly assured her. \"We were just going to have breakfast, which I believe you helped carry up. The least you can do now is help us eat it.\" Nikki chuckled slightly. \"Well how can I refuse an offer like that?\" She stepped into the apartment and glanced around. With an amused smile she remarked. \"I see you've really delved into your unpacking.\" \"He's hoping that some little elves will mysteriously appear and put all this away for him.\" Josie commented, giving Sam a teasing look. Sam chuckled and tossed an arm across her shoulders and retorted. \"No, I'm just hoping you'll get tired of hearing me complain and do it for me.\" Shoving him gently away Josie laughed lightly. \"In your dreams, Coulson!\" When Sam reached out to grab her again Josie giggled and danced out of reach. Slapping his hands away she ordered. Go get some plates so we can eat. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm hungry.\" \"Yes, ma'am.\" Sam saluted teasingly before heading for the kitchen, mumbling jokingly to himself, but loud enough for them to hear. \"Women can be so bossy.\" \"Men can be such babies.\" Josie looked at Nikki and rolled her eyes dramatically. The two women chuckled as Sam stuck his tongue out at them before disappearing into the kitchen. \"I know exactly what you mean.\" The other girl in amusement as frantic rummaging started coming from the other room. The two women glanced towards the kitchen and chuckled again. \"I have four brothers: two older and two younger.\" \"Poor you.\" Josie commiserated with mock sympathy. \"I only have one brother and he's enough of a handful.\" Gesturing to the couch she urged her new friend. \"Have a seat.\" \"How old is he?\" Nikki asked curiously as she sat on the end of the couch beside where Josie had settled in Sam's favorite recliner. \"Rob's twenty-three going on fifteen.\" Josie laughed. \"But he's actually pretty terrific as far as brothers go.\" \"Yeah, mine are pretty great too.\" Nikki agreed. \"We're all very close. We like to pick on each other a lot, of course. But were always there to support each other too.\" \"How old are your brothers?\" Josie asked curiously. \"Mike's the oldest, he's thirty-two; Chet comes next, he's twenty-seven.\" \"Same age as Sam.\" Josie remarked with a smile. \"Really?\" Nikki exclaimed. \"That's neat. So how old are you?\" \"Twenty-five.\" The other girl told her. \"How about yourself?\" \"I'm twenty-five too.\" Nikki told her excitedly. \"Where did you go to High School?\" \"Lake View.\" Josie replied. \"On Ashland Avenue. Where did you go?\" \"Lincoln Park.\" Her new friend replied. \"It's over on Orchard.\" \"I think that's where Sam went.\" Josie commented in surprise. Turning her head towards the kitchen where Sam was still searching for plates Josie called. \"Sam, you went to Lincoln Park High School, didn't you?\" \"That's right.\" He called back, not even stopping in his efforts. \"So you would have gone to school with my brother than.\" Nikki told him eagerly. \"Who's your brother?\" Sam asked as he appeared in the doorway. Looking at Josie he sighed in resignation. \"I can't find the plates. Would you be terribly offended if we just ate with our fingers?\" Josie chuckled and rose to her feet. \"Here, let me look.\" As she disappeared into the kitchen Sam looked back to Nikki and asked. \"Sorry about that. Who's your brother?\" \"Chet Finlay.\" Nikki replied. \"He played Short stop on Lincoln Park's baseball team for three years.\" \"Sam's face broke into a wide smile. \"I remember Chet. About six-two, black hair, twisted sense of humor.\" \"That's him.\" She acknowledged with a knowing smile. \"We played ball together for three years.\" He told her excitedly. \"In fact I think he roomed with my best friend, Jonathan and I for a couple of Away games.\" He looked thoughtful for a minute as he tried to remember something. \"He liked to play the guitar, didn't he? I seem to remember him working on some song he was trying to write.\" \" Blue Eyes and Soft Lips .\" Nikki replied proudly. \"He's trying to get it recorded.\" \"Really? That's great!\" Sam exclaimed delightedly as Josie appeared out of the kitchen with four plates in her hand. \"If I remember correctly he was very talented.\" \"Ready to eat?\" Josie asked Sam as she put the Danishes on one of the plates she held. \"Where did you find those?\" Sam asked, looking at Josie with evident amazement. \"I'm sure I looked through every box in that kitchen.\" Josie just gave him a mysterious look as she turned to Nikki and asked. \"Would you like some coffee?\" \"Actually, I'll just have a glass of water, if I may.\" She requested. \"You may if the Great Josie Geller Houdini can find the glasses.\" Sam commented, giving his blond girlfriend a challenging look. \"No problem.\" Josie replied, a bright smile on her face. \"I'll be back in a jiffy with the water.\" As she disappeared into the kitchen Sam looked at Nikki and shook his head. \"She'll never find them.\" The moment the words were out of his mouth Josie was back, a glass of water in hand. \"How did you do that so fast?\" \"Easy.\" Josie told him evasively as she handed Nikki the glass. \"It's called Women's Intuition. I just sensed what was in the boxes.\" \"Then you can 'sense' them out of the boxes and into their proper places so us poor men can find what we're looking for without having to dig for an hour.\" He told her with mild teasing. Josie merely chuckled and urged. \"Come on, we'd better get cracking if were going to talk to your boss before school starts.\" Sam glanced at his watch and exclaimed in surprise. \"It's already twenty-to-eight. We'd better get a move on.\" Despite his words the three of them still enjoyed a relaxed and leisurely breakfast getting to know one another better. About ten after eight Sam announced that he had to go. Josie rose with him and explained to Nikki that she had a meeting to go too, but that she'd be back later on if the other woman wanted to return. \"I may just take you up on that.\" She'd commented eagerly as the three of them walked to the door. \"It was really nice meeting you both.\" She told them sincerley. \"Hopefully we'll get a chance to get together again soon.\" \"We'd like that.\" Josie assured her as they walked down the hall. Stopping in front of her apartment Nikki remarked. \"Well this is my stop. If you ever want to stop by feel free.\" \"Thanks.\" Josie smiled at her warmly. When the girl disappeared into her apartment Sam and Josie continued to the elevator. They were both silent for several minutes as they waited for the car to arrive. \"You nervous about talking to Jack?\" \"You mean about us?\" Sam questioned, looking at her in surprise. When she nodded he denied. \"No, of course not. Jack's a good guy, he'll understand.\" He hesitated for a moment before adding. \"At least I think he'll understand.\" When he noticed that Josie didn't look convinced he admitted. \"Okay, I'm nervous about talking to Jack about us. I mean this is my career were talking about. Not that I'm saying my career is more important than us.\" He paused as he tried to find the words to explain himself. \"I guess I'm just saying that it would be nice to have both. You know what I'm saying?\" \"I know exactly what you're saying.\" Josie assured him honestly. Sam gave hre a warm smile and nodded. \"I know you do.\" Then lifting his arms he encouraged. \"Come here.\" As Josie stepped into his arms he pulled her close. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She returned, her head lying against his chest. After a few moments she looked at him and said comfortingly. \"Don't worry, Sam. No matter what happens we're in this together.\" Sam smiled and reached up to push a loose curl behind her ear. \"Josie, you have no idea how much hearing you say that means to me. I love you so much and the only thing I really, really care about is us being together. If I have to, I can find a job somewhere else. It's replaceable, you're not.\" \"I feel the same way about you.\" She told him sincerely, proving her words by leaning up and giving him a tender kiss. Sam looked at Josie nervously before lifting his hand and knocking lightly on the door of the principle's office. When a cheery voice called for him to come in Sam gave Josie another anxious look before opening the door and poking his head inside. \"Morning Jack.\" He greeted in as normal a voice as he could manage. \"You got a minute?\" \"For you, anytime.\" Jack Harding replied as he motioned for Sam to come in, raising an inquisitive eyebrow when Josie followed him inside. \"Miss Geller? If it isn't our beautiful Prom Queen. To what do I owe the honor of your visit?\" Glancing at Sam nervously for a moment she turned back to Jack and said. \"Sam and I have something we need to talk to you about.\" Jack raised his eyebrow again at the familiar way in which Josie addressed Sam but he didn't comment on it. Instead he gestured to the two seats across from his desk and encouraged. \"Please, have a seat.\" When they were seated he asked curiously. \"What can I do for you?\" Sam looked at Josie for a moment before commenting anxiously. \"I don't quite know where to start.\" Taking a deep breath Josie began her tale. \"About three months ago I came to South Glen South as a transfer student.\" Jack nodded his head in confirmation. \"Yes, I remember reading your file. Very impressive. And I must admit that it was very nice to see you crowned Prom Queen. It was nice to see someone win who truly deserved to be Prom Queen.\" Josie blushed with pleasure and murmured. \"Thank you.\" \"So, what can I do for you?\" He asked eagerly as he folded his hands on his desktop. \"Are you wanting a letter of reference for college?\" \"No.\" Josie shook her head and took a deep breath. \"That's not it.\" \"So what is it?\" Jack prompted curiously. Josie sighed and looked at Sam ironically. \"I've done this so often in the last four days you'd think I'd have it down pat by now.\" Sam reached over and gave hr hand a comforting squeeze, an action that wasn't lost on Jack. Gripping Sam's hand as if it were her lifeline Josie looked squarely at Jack and managed to explain their situation. \"My name is Josie Geller and I'm an undercover reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times. I came to South Glen South in March as a transfer student to do research about High School kids today for my article.\" Jack gave her a scrutinizing look for several moments before looking at Sam. \"Did you know about this?\" Sam shook his head. \"Not until Friday night at the Prom. Josie told me the whole story then.\" Narrowing his eyes slightly Jack gave the pair a pointed look. \"It certainly didn't take you long to act on the news.\" Sam took a deep breath, gave Josie's hand a tight squeeze and looked at his boss seriously. \"I won't lie to you Jack, I was attracted to Josie before I knew that she wasn't my student. And I spent the last three months secretly beating myself up over it. I knew it wasn't right and I felt like such a heel that I could have allowed such a thing to happen. I'm still not proud of it, but I console myself with the fact that since Josie's not seventeen that she obviously seemed like a very mature seventeen year old. And I swear to you that I never ever did anything that would be considered inappropriate for a teacher/student relationship. All I tried to do was be her friend.\" \"He's telling the truth, Mr. Harding.\" Josie quickly assured him. \"While I hoped that he felt the same way about me that I felt about him, I wasn't sure until after I'd told him the truth about myself.\" \"What made you tell him the truth if you weren't sure if he was attracted to you or not?\" Jack asked, his _expression hard to read. \"Because if nothing else I loved him and I wanted him to know the truth about me.\" Josie replied seriously. \"I hated all the lying and the deception to start with, but I hated lying to and deceiving him even more.\" \"So Sam did absolutely nothing that would be considered inappropriate behavior for a teacher and his student?\" Jack pressed, watching both of them carefully. \"Not at all.\" Josie quickly assured him. \"He was nothing more than any teacher should be: a kind and caring friend who tried to encourage his student to be the best that she could be.\" \"Well then,\" Jack looked at the two of them for several minutes before finally leaning back in his chair and saying seriously. \"I'd say your explanation of the situation is close enough to the other version I was told that there shouldn't be any problems. In fact, since nobody was hurt and no real teacher/student lines of propriety were crossed I think we can just keep this whole matter our little secret.\" Sam and Josie looked at each other in confusion. \"What other version?\" Sam asked suspiciously. \"Who's been telling tales out of school?\" \"Aldys Wells, Scott Romano and Rob…\" Jack paused for a moment before commenting. \"What was Rob's last name? I don't think I got it.\" \"Geller.\" Josie told him matter-of-factly. \"His name is Rob Geller.\" Jack's eyebrows quirked slightly. \"Relative of yours?\" \"My younger brother.\" She told him simply. \"Though I may be an only child once I get a hold of him.\" \"He a reporter too?\" The other man asked curiously. Josie shook her head. \"No, he's just an amiable goof who was willing to help his sister get her first undercover story.\" \"I see.\" Jack commented with a smile. \"I understand that 'amiable goof' is now our Assistant Coach. Think he'll do okay?\" Josie groaned and rolled her eyes heavenward. \"That goof eats, breaths and sleeps baseball. He'll probably drive everyone nuts with his obsessiveness.\" \"As long as he helps us win.\" Jack commented with a smile. Then glancing at the pair before him he said teasingly. \"Now get out of here you two, I have work to do.\" Josie and Sam rose to their feet and gave the other man a grateful smile. Reaching over to shake the other man's hand Sam said eagerly. \"Thanks a lot, Jack. We really appreciate your understanding and support in all this.\" \"Hey, true love is very hard to find.\" The other man commented with a slight twinkle in his eye. \"Who am I to stand in its way? Besides Aldys, Rob and Scott make a very formidable team. I didn't stand a chance against them.\" \"I'll have to remember to thank them.\" Sam chuckled. \"Fifty dollars a piece in unmarked bills might do it.\" Jack teased as the pair headed out the door. \"I'll consider it.\" Sam laughed as he reached behind him to close the door. When the pair was alone in the empty outer office they looked at each other in amazed surprise. Suddenly Josie let out an excited squeal and threw herself in Sam's arms. Sam responded by lifting her up and spining her around. When both were in danger of falling over with dizziness he stopped and put her down. Looking at her tenderly Sam said, his tone full of emotion. \"You are amazing, Josie Geller. You are truly amazing.\" Josie laughed and rested her hand on his chest. \"You're pretty amazing yourself, Mr. Coulson.\" \"I love you.\" He whispered softly, his eyes fixed firmly on hers. \"I love you too.\" Josie returned before surrendering herself to his kiss. Neither of them noticed Guy Perkins come around the corner and stop dead in the Main Office door, his eyes wide with shock as he watched the kissing pair.[Chapter 7] Josie stretched her arms above her head and let out a slight moan as the cricks in her limbs protested her move. Glancing at the clock on her laptop she was surprised to see that it was already two o'clock. She'd been working on her story for almost three hours straight. After leaving Sam at school Josie had come back to his apartment to change out of her business suit and into a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. She'd intended to get right to work on her story, but after glancing around the large living room and noting all the boxes pilled about the room she'd decided to sort through them and organize them according to rooms. It had taken her about an hour to get that done, but at least now Sam could find things a little easier whenever he went looking. It was then that she'd gotten the idea to take advantage of the fact that she'd be home all day to make Sam a home cooked supper. Glancing at her watch she'd realized that she had about two hours to get the stuff she needed before the Phone Company might possibly arrive. An hour later she was back, her hands full of the ingredients needed to make Lasagna, Caesar salad and garlic bread. After rummaging around for a few minutes she finally found a frying pan and a large pot. After getting her sauce on simmering Josie had turned her attention to her story. Which is where it had remained fixed until just then. Deciding that she needed to take a break Josie rose to her feet and headed for the kitchen. After checking on her sauce she glanced at the boxes scattered on the counter. Looking from the boxes to the cupboards thoughtfully for several moments she finally reached into one of the boxes and pulled out some plates, each individually wrapped in newspaper. Patiently and carefully she unwrapped each plate, stacking them on the counter as she went. After she finished she shoved the newspaper back into the box and tossed it on the floor, kicking it out of her way. After opening the cupboard doors, Josie finally decided on the best place to put them. She continued to do the same with each box, slowly and carefully putting everything away. As she emptied the last box Josie was pleasantly surprised to find that it had only taken her forty-five minutes to finish the task. Encouraged by her progress she continued to the living room, eyeing the boxes that rested there. Her work there proved to be considerably slower as she was uncertain as to where Sam would want some of the things. She wasn't even sure where he wanted the bookcase to rest as it was just shoved against a wall behind his desk and a couple other cabinets. Deciding it best to just organize the boxes out of the way, she stacked them against the wall beside the furniture and continued on to the next room. Standing in the doorway of the bedroom she shook her head at the sight before her. The bed frame, headboard and footboard sat in one corner of the room in separate pieces, while the boxspring and mattress lay on the floor, sheets and blankets in a tangled heap on top. Pushing herself off the doorframe Josie commented with a chuckle. \"That man is so helpless sometimes. Oh, but he is adorable.\" Pulling the mattress and boxspring out of the way Josie set about putting the bed frame, headboard and footboard together in the same general area where the mattress and boxspring had been. Then with a little bit of effort and struggle she managed to get the boxspring and mattress set up in the frame. Grinning proudly she inspected her work. \"Not bad if I do say so myself.\" Next she set about putting the sheets and blankets back on the bed, smoothing the wrinkles out of the bed spread when she finished. Her attention then shifted to the empty bookcase that sat against the far wall. Noting that it was about the only place the bookshelf could go she decided to unpack the books she'd earlier removed from it. Opening the box that contained the volumes she set to work. \"I remember you.\" She told the Count of Monte Cristo as she pulled the book out of the box and gave it a shake. \"Don't you even think about attacking me again.\" Just as she was putting the book on the shelf there was a knock at the apartment door. \"Looks like the Phone Company's finally here.\" Setting the box aside she rose to her feet and padded out to the living room to answer the door. Opening it she was shocked to find Guy Perkins standing in the hallway, his eyes dark with anger and hurt. \"Guy?\" Josie looked at him in surprise. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I came to find out the truth.\" He told her crisply. \"That truth?\" Josie repeated nervously. \"The truth about what?\" \"The truth about you.\" He replied curtly. \"I know your not who you've been trying to make us believe you are. You're not a seventeen-year-old student are you?\" His eyes narrowed slightly as he waited for her to deny his accusation. Instead she shook her head sadly and admitted honestly. \"No. No, I'm not.\" Surprised by her truthful reply Guy felt a lot of his initial anger seep away. \"Why?\" He finally asked, hurt written all over his face. Josie sighed slightly. \"It's a long story.\" \"I've got time.\" He told her, not willing to let her off that easy. Josie nodded, knowing he deserved to know the truth. After all, it was because he had been willing to give her a chance that she'd been able to taste High School popularity. \"Why don't you come in and we'll discuss this over a Coke.\" Guy hesitated for a moment than nodded his head in agreement, stepping into the apartment. As Josie closed the door behind him he glanced around the room curiously. Noting the sparse décor and the full boxes he asked. \"You moving out or moving in?\" \"Neither.\" She commented lightly. \"This isn't my apartment. I'm just doing a friend a favor and waiting for the Phone Company to come install the phones.\" Then suddenly a thought occurred to her. \"How did you know where to find me anyway?\" Guy had the good manners enough to flush slightly as he admitted. \"I followed you here from school this morning.\" Hurt appeared in his eyes again as he told her. \"I saw you and Mr. Coulson kissing outside Mr. Harding's office this morning. And I was pretty sure I saw you two holding hands during the ball game last night.\" Josie's blush confirmed his suspicions. \"When you left I decided to follow you.\" \"Why didn't you come see me then?\" She asked curiously. \"Because unlike some people I still have school to attend.\" He told her crisply. \"And I'm not about to jeopardize graduation for some two bit, lying reporter.\" Josie flinched slightly at his tone. As she scrambled to think of something to say he commented coolly. \"So, you said something about a Coke and an explanation.\" \"Why don't you have a seat?\" Josie offered, gesturing to the couch. \"I'll get us both something to drink.\" Guy merely nodded before moving towards the couch. As Josie disappeared into the kitchen Guy sat, his eyes travelling carefully about the room. It didn't take much deducing to realize that this was Mr. Coulson's new place. He felt his heart constrict slightly at the thought. He knew he had no right to feel that way, after all Josie had lied and deceived him for her own purpose. But despite that, he still really liked and cared about her. When Rob had told him yesterday that Josie had her eye on someone else and that they'd gotten together over the weekend he had secretly hoped that the relationship wouldn't work out. He figured that if they broke up, than maybe he could win her over. But he knew now that the chances of that happening were virtually nil. Josie was not seventeen, she was no doubt at least five or six years older than himself and on top of that she was now involved with Sam Coulson, a guy more her own age. And Guy knew from just seeing that one kiss that the two of them were crazy about each other. \"Here you go.\" Josie's gentle voice interrupted his turmoiled thoughts. Looking up he accepted the glass she held out to him but didn't say anything. He watched silently as she moved to the recliner a few feet away and sank down into it, tucking her feet under her. Guy got the feeling that she was trying to put some distance between the two of them, both physically and emotionally. It was several minutes before either of them spoke. Finally Josie's hesitant voice broke the uncomfortable silence. \"I never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted to hurt anyone. This whole thing started off so simple and innocent and then it just ended up spiraling completely out of my control.\" Guy noted the distressed tone in her voice and softened his own slighlty as he prompted. \"Why don't you tell me everything from the beginning?\" Josie gave him a wry smile. \"Maybe I should just print a copy of it and hand it around. I've repeated this story about five or six times in the last four days.\" \"Who else have you told?\" Guy asked, a deep frown appearing on his face. Josie hesitated than replied honestly. \"Sam for starters, then my best friend, Anita. She knew parts of the story, but not everything. Then Sam's best friend and his wife, then Aldys, then my boss and then Sam's boss this morning.\" \"Wait a minute? You told Mr. Coulson and all those other people before you told me?\" He exclaimed a trifle angrily. Then with hurt in his eyes he asked. \"Why? I'm the one that made you popular! I'm the one that gave you the chance to prove yourself by suggesting the Prom theme! If it hadn't been for me, you'd still be the same loser you were when you first arrived at South Glen South!\" Seeing how much his words had hurt her he took a calming breath before saying with deep feeling. \"I thought you and I had something special. I told you that you rocked my world.\" \"I know you did.\" Josie acknowledged softly, her voice barely above a choked whisper. \"But I'm afraid things weren't really that simple.\" \"What do you mean?\" He asked with clear confusion in his tone. \"Is it because of our age difference?\" Josie shook her head and said seriously. \"Let me start at the beginning.\" Taking a deep breath she outlined her history. \"I graduated from Lake View High School about eight year ago. I then went to Northwestern for three years. When I graduated I started working as a copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times. I've been there for the last five years. My biggest dream, however, was to be a reporter. I love to write. It's always been a passion of mine.\" She flushed slightly as she added. \"I've even been told I'm pretty good at it.\" \"So what happened?\" Guy asked curiously, not willing to pay her any more compliments yet. \"After all didn't Mr. Coulson day that you are a reporter for the Sun-Times?\" Josie nodded her head in confirmation. \"That's right. The Monday before I enrolled at South Glen South, my publisher decided that he wanted to do an undercover feature about High School kids today. Since I was the only one that looked young enough to be a High School student I was chosen to do it. I was thrilled. It was my big chance to prove to everyone that I could do it, that I could be a reporter. Problem was, I've never been popular. I went through High School being tormented by the 'popular' kids, which has left a few scars that I'm still trying to work through.\" \"What did they do to you?\" Guy asked, the sadness in her voice causing sympathy to get the better of him. He knew from experience how cruel teenage kids could be towards those that they considered 'losers'. He wasn't a saint by any means himself, but he hoped he wasn't as bad as most of the crowd. In fact he'd had to squash a particularly mean trick that his friends were plotting against Aldys Wells at Prom. They'd been less than happy with him, especially when he'd confiscated the dog food can they'd been planing to dump on Aldys' head, but he couldn't let them humiliate her like that. As much as he agreed that Aldys was a geek and completely uncool, he couldn't play such a mean spirited trick on her. He even cringed when he realized how mean he'd just been to Josie when he'd called her a 'loser'. He had to be careful not to let his hurt get the better of him or else he may end up saying something that he'd later regret. \"Let's just say that your counterpart humiliated me worse that I have ever been humiliated in my life.\" Josie told him plainly. When Guy opened his mouth to inquire she cut him off. \"I'm not going to go into any more details beyond that. It's just too painful of an experience to share.\" \"Fair enough.\" Guy acknowledged after a moment, tactfully backing off that line of questioning. \"So, what's the status of your story?\" \"I almost have it finished.\" She replied, gesturing to the open notebook and the laptop on the coffee table. \"I'm basically comparing the two experiences, highlighting the similarities as well as the differences and how this second experience has helped me to put my first experience into perspective.\" \"Can I read the article?\" Guy asked curiously. Josie shook her head. \"It's not finished yet and I have to get it approved by my editor before I know for sure if it'll be published.\" There was a brief silence before Guy asked softly. \"So, how serious are things with you and Mr. Coulson?\" Josie looked at him for a moment before answering. She knew that Guy had feelings for her and she felt really bad hurting him. In some ways she found the whole situation with her and Guy very ironic. Here she was, Josie Grossie, biggest nerd at Lake View High School telling the most popular boy in school that she wasn't interested in being anything more than just friends. At least I know how to turn him down without throwing eggs at him and humiliating him. She thought to herself. \"Sam and I love each other very much.\" She told him truthfully. \"And someday, if everything keeps going as it has been we hope to get married.\" Guy looked at her in surprise. \"Mr. C. proposed to you already?\" \"Not officially.\" Josie assured him. \"But it is something that we have talked about and I would have to say that it is definitely in our future.\" \"I see.\" Guy felt his heart fall slightly at her words. Josie watched the various expressions pass over his face before finally saying, her voice warm and gentle. \"Guy, I want you to know that I think you're a really terrific guy. And I hope that now we've gotten past the 'loser'/'popular' barrier we've actually become friends.\" Guy looked at her sadly for a moment before admitting. \"I thought we were becoming more than just friends.\" Josie flushed slightly and gave him a slight smile. \"Where were you eight years ago?\" \"Eight years ago I was in the fourth grade.\" He commented, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. Josie laughed. \"Oh, yeah. Guess that wouldn't have worked.\" Then with a more serious _expression she told him sincerely. \"If I was really seventeen and everything had happened as it had happened between us than I can almost guarantee that I would have been crazy about you.\" \"You think so?\" He looked at her hopefully. Josie smiled and nodded. \"I really do.\" He gave her a sly look and asked, his eyes twinkling slightly. \"So what if I was to tell you that I'm really twenty-seven and that I'm an undercover reporter for the Chicago Tribune?\" Josie gaped at him momentarily, trying to decide if he was serious or just pulling her leg. In some ways it would make sense. After all, she'd always wondered how someone from the Trib had managed to do an article on Gibby, Kirstin and Kristen right under her nose. She looked at him for several moments before deciding to call his bluff. \"Then maybe Sam'll get a real surprise when he gets home.\" \"Really?\" Guy looked at her in surprise. \"You'd really dump Mr. C. for me if I was twenty-seven?\" \"Are you twenty-seven?\" She asked, keeping her tone neutral. Guy hesitated for a minute before admitting. \"No, I'm not.\" Josie gave him a mysterious smile and said. \"Then I guess we'll never know, will we?\" Guy gave her a pained look until he realized that she was just trying to tease him. Shaking his head slightly he said. \"You are definitely crazy, Josie Geller.\" \"Thank you.\" She acknowledged with a bright smile. Then after a moment's pause she asked, a trifle nervously. \"So are we okay?\" Guy waited for a moment before giving her a reassuring smile. \"Yeah, we're okay. I'll admit I was hurt and angry when I realized what was going on, but as much as I'd like to I can't seem to stay mad at you.\" \"I'm really sorry for hurting you, Guy.\" She apologized again. \"I never meant to. I never meant to hurt anyone. Like I said, this whole situation just kind of spun totally out of my control and I ended up stuck between how I wanted to handle things and how my editor wanted me to handle things.\" She looked at him sadly. \"I just wish things could have turned out differently.\" \"Me too.\" He admitted with obvious feeling. \"But I hope we can still be friends.\" \"I'd like that.\" Josie assured him. \"And one more thing.\" Guy commented, a mischievous smile appearing on his face. \"What's that?\" She asked him curiously. \"If things don't work out with you and Mr. Coulson.\" He began, his eyes dancing slightly. \"Promise you'll give me a call?\" \"Hello honey, I'm home!\" Sam called out as he entered his apartment a little after five-thirty that evening. Josie appeared out of the kitchen, a dishtowel flung casually over her shoulder and a white apron tied around her waist. \"Hi Sweetheart.\" She greeted warmly as she leaned up to give him a kiss. \"How was your day?\" \"Very, very long.\" He told her with a sigh. \"Much longer than usual.\" \"Why's that?\" She asked with a concerned frown. \"Because I missed you.\" He told her truthfully, producing a bouquet of roses from behind his back. \"Oh, Sam!\" Tears welled up in her eyes as she accepted the fragrant spikes and buried her nose in them. \"They're beautiful.\" Looking up at him she whispered tenderly. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" Sam returned, leaning down to kiss her again. When they pulled back Josie commented. \"I'd better put these in some water.\" As she moved to the kitchen Sam dropped his briefcase on the couch and sniffed the air appreciatively. \"Something smells wonderful.\" \"Lasagna and garlic bread.\" She called from the kitchen. \"I hope you're hungry.\" \"I'm starving.\" He commented as his stomach started to growl in expectation. \"How was your day?\" He asked her as she appeared out of the other room with the vase of flowers in her hand. \"Great.\" She replied as she arranged the vase on the already set dinning room table between two unlit candles. As she picked up a book of matches to light the candles she continued. \"I got a lot done on my story and I did a bit of straightening up and unpacking for you. Nikki came by a little while ago and helped me move some of the furniture around. I don't know if everything is where you want it, but we can always change it if you want.\" When she got the candles burning she turned back towards him and prompted. \"Dinner's ready. Why don't you go wash up while I get it on the table?\" Sam nodded as she disappeared into the kitchen. Too enchanted to move he stood rooted to the spot until she returned with a salad bowl in her hands. Glancing at him in amusement she remarked lightly. \"Are you planning on standing there all night or are you going to come and eat?\" Sam shook himself from his dazed state and headed towards the bathroom. \"I'll be right there.\" As Sam washed his hands he couldn't help but smile to himself. It had felt so unbelievably good to come home to Josie's warm smile and the smell of a home cooked meal. Never in all the years that he and Lara had been together had she even offered to cook him a meal, let alone gone ahead and surprised him with one. It was just one more thing about Josie to love. \"The place is looking great.\" He told her as they settled down to eat supper. \"I noticed you got the bed put together.\" Josie gave him an amused smile as she put some Caesar salad on her plate. \"Well I figured you'd find it more comfortable then sleeping on just the boxspring and mattress.\" \"I appreciate that.\" He acknowledged. \"Goodness knows how long it would have stayed like that if it had of been up to me.\" Josie chuckled and remarked. \"I would have done more unpacking, but I wasn't quite sure where you wanted some things put.\" She told him as she poured herself a glass of wine. \"As it is you might want to reorganize your kitchen. I just put things where I thought you might like them.\" \"I'm sure it'll be just fine the way it is.\" He assured her with a smile. \"Anything would be better than trying to find things in boxes. Did the Phone Company come by?\" Josie nodded. \"About four o'clock. They put a line in the bedroom and the living room. They asked if I wanted one put in the bathroom, but I didn't think that was overly necessary.\" Sam laughed slightly. \"Yeah, I'm not that big on talking on the phone while I'm showering or brushing my teeth.\" Josie couldn't help laughing at the mental image that invoked. Then taking a sip of her wine she said seriously. \"Guy came by after school.\" Sam looked at her in surprise. \"He did? Guy stopped by here?\" When Josie nodded her head he asked. \"How did he know where to come?\" \"He followed me here from school.\" She told him. \"He followed you?\" Sam repeated, his eyes narrowing slightly. \"What's he doing? Stalking you?\" \"He's not stalking me.\" Josie denied, a bit surprised at his clipped tone. \"He saw us kissing outside Jack Harding's office and wanted to find out what was going on.\" Sam groaned and rolled his eyes in disgust. \"This is getting ridiculous! Why is it I can't kiss you without someone spying on us? I'm starting to feel like I'm living under a magnifying glass and I'm getting sick of it! First it's Aldys spying on us at Prom, then it's Gus giving you the third degree and now Guy. I'm getting sick and tired of having to explain myself to everyone. Can't people just keep their noses out of my business? Can't they just leave me alone? Whatever happened to my nice, simple life when everyone left me alone?\" Josie looked at Sam and felt her heart fall to her stomach. She'd been worried that the continuous attentions and comments of others would finally wear Sam's normally easy going nature thing, maybe even causing him to wonder if she was worth all the hassle and bother. Unwillingly tears formed in her eyes as guilt and worry rose into her heart. She knew that things had been going too good to last. She knew that there was no way Sam would continue to put up with the nonsense they'd been dealing with for long. And why should he? He was a handsome, wonderful, intelligent man, he didn't need to be saddle with a burden like her. She was so inferior to him in so many ways and she knew it. She also knew that Sam would never push her away or allow her to see that he was feeling trapped by their relationship. He was too much of a gentleman. No, it was up to her to save him the stress and misery of putting up with her and everything bad that would come of their relationship. Silently she pushed her chair back and rose to her feet, violently fighting the tears that were trying to fall. She paused for a minute to collect herself before turning and picking up her jacket, duffel bag, briefcase and laptop. \"What are you doing?\" Sam suddenly asked in alarm, getting to his feet and moving towards her. \"Where are you going?\" Taking a deep breath Josie looked at him, sadness etched into every feature of her face. Taking a deep breath she said. \"I never meant to cause you so much trouble, Sam.\" She chuckled sarcastically and wiped at her eyes as she continued ironically. \"Which may be hard to believe since that seems to be all I've done since we met. You are a sweet and wonderful man and you deserve someone far better than me. Someone who'll make you happy and won't cause you the amount of stress and heartache that I've obviously caused you these last few months.\" \"Josie, what are you talking about?\" He demanded, fear written all over his face. \"I don't want anyone else, I want you. You are the only one that can make me happy.\" Josie shook her head.\" No I don't. I'm nothing but a pain. Ever since we've met I've done nothing but cause you grief and heartache. Face it, Sam, you'd be far better off without me.\" Sam, panic filling him, stepped towards her and grabbed her arms. Looking into her tear-filled eyes he exclaimed seriously. \"The only way you could cause me pain and grief is if you walk out that door right now. I'm sorry if I got frustrated with Guy and everyone else sticking his nose into our business, but its only because I want our private life to be just that - private. I want to be able to kiss you and not have to worry about who might see us. I want us to be able to enjoy being in love without everyone feeling that they have a right to question us on everything we do.\" \"Sam, I'm not…I don't deserve you.\" She stammered, tears rolling down her cheeks. \"All I do is cause you pain.\" \"Josie, you haven't caused me any pain.\" He told her seriously. \"In fact the only thing that you've caused me in unbelievable happiness.\" Reaching up to caress her cheek he added, his eyes looking deeply into hers. \"Josie, don't you understand yet how much you mean to me? You're my whole world. I would be completely lost without you.\" He paused for a moment as he searched her eyes for any form of acknowledgement to what he was saying. He saw flickers of hope amidst the insecurities and the doubts. Stroking her cheek tenderly he continued softly. \"I know you were hurt very deeply by what happened with that guy in High School and that its made you scared and insecure and that's understandable. What he did to you was horrible and completely inexcusable, but Josie I'm not him. I'm not going to do anything to hurt you, at least not intentionally. But honey, I'm not perfect. Sometimes I'm going to say something accidentally that offends your or hurts you but that doesn't mean that I don't love you or treasure you. It just means that I'm not perfect. A relationship, any relationship is full of ups and downs. Things aren't always going to be easy, but I love you and I'm willing to ride out the tough times just to be able to be with you.\" Josie searched his face carefully for a moment before asking uncertainly. \"Are you sure?\" Sam gave her a warm smile and told her firmly. \"I have never been so sure of anything in my life.\" Then pulling her to him he added. \"You mean everything to me, Josie. Without you I would be lost.\" He continued to hold her tightly as she sobbed stormily against his chest. \"What is it, honey? What's got you so upset? This isn't just about me being upset about Guy sticking his nose into our personal life, is it?\" There was a long pause before Josie finally spoke. \"Why are you so wonderful to me?\" She asked between heart-wrenching sobs. \"Nobody outside of my family has ever treated me like this before. I've never felt so loved or appreciated by anyone in my life.\" Sam frowned in confusion as he asked. \"And that's why you're upset? Forgive me if I'm a little dense, but I don't understand why that's such a terrible thing.\" \"That's just it.\" She commented against his chest. \"It's not a terrible thing. It's a wonderful thing.\" Pulling back slightly so she could look at him she admitted. \"And that's what makes me so scared. I'm scared that you'll decide you don't love me anymore and leave. I'm scared that you'll one day decide that I am Josie Grossie and walk away leaving me alone and broken-hearted. And I'm especially scared because I know that if that happens I won't be strong enough to get through it. I was crushed when he threw eggs at me and humiliated me like that, but I didn't love him. It was just a silly schoolgirl crush. But with you it's different. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you, and that scares me too because that gives you even more power to hurt me than he or anyone else ever had.\" Sam looked into her worried eyes and told her sincerely. \"I'm scared too.\" At her surprised look he continued. \"I'm scared that I will do something completely stupid like I did tonight and mess up what we have together. I'm scared because I've only had one other relationship before this and it ended up not working. And what scares me the most is that you'll find someone else and then where will I be?\" Seeing the true anxiety in his green eyes Josie set her bags down on the floor and threw her arms around his neck. Hugging him tightly she said softly. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm yours forever, if you want me.\" Pulling her as close to him as he could he said, his tone full of emotion. \"Forever isn't long enough.\" They stood like that for several minutes, relishing the sense of love and security that they both felt wrapped in each other's arms. Then, as if by mutual consent they pulled slightly apart. Reaching up to brush a stray curl off her forehead Sam asked gently. \"How would you like to sit down and enjoy a delicious candlelight supper? I understand the chef here ins very talent, not to mention incredibly beautiful.\" Josie giggled slightly and nodded her head. \"I'd love to.\" Giving her a warm smile Sam lead her back to the table. \"Honey, I was just thinking about something.\" Sam commented to Josie a little while later. The two of them were busy unpacking a few of the boxes that littered his living room floor. \"What's that?\" Josie asked without looking up from the book she was skimming. Once again Sam had put her in charge of his library, giving her free reign to organize it as she wished. This time Josie was taking full advantage of the assignment, stopping occasionally to peruse the books she hadn't read before. There weren't many since the two of them appeared to have much of the same taste in books, but there was the odd volume that she'd never read before. \"I know you're no longer a 'student' at South Glen South.\" He remarked seriously. \"But what would you think about coming in one day this week and reading your story to the class? I figured it would be a good way to tell them all the truth about yourself before the article comes out in print next week. That is if Guy hasn't spilled the beans already.\" \"Guy promised not to say anything.\" Josie assured him. \"He said that he'd let me tell them when I thought they should know.\" Sam looked at her in surprise. \"I thought for sure he'd have the news spread all over campus by now. This must be the hottest gossip of the year!\" Josie frowned at him slightly. \"Guy's not like that. He's not a gossiper.\" \"I hope not.\" Sam remarked, clearly unconvinced. \"So what do you think about reading your story to everyone?\" Josie considered his suggestion for a minute before nodding. \"It think it sounds like a good idea. It'll be a good way to tell everyone the truth.\" \"When do you think you'll be ready to give it?\" He pressed eagerly. \"I have it about half finished now.\" She reported. \"I'm hoping to have it completed tomorrow. I'll then have to pass it by Gus. Why don't we make it Friday.\" \"It's a date.\" Sam grinned excitedly. \"And so the most important thing that I learned my Senior year at South Glen South is that I should never under any circumstances ever wear Crimson Red lipstick with a Salmon colored shirt.\" \"Um, thank you very much Kristen for that well, uh, though out essay.\" Sam acknowledged with a forced smile. Trying not to appear too obvious he glanced at the clock on the wall and sighed quietly to himself. He still had five essays and thirty-five minutes of class left and he was sure he was going to go nuts before it came he was sure of it. Josie was suppose to have been there by now. As Kristen read her report all Sam could think about was where Josie was. It wasn't like her to be late and not let him know. As he listened to Kristen with one ear a list of possible scenarios kept going through his head - none of them very pleasant thoughts. \"Um, who's next?\" He asked somewhat distractedly. He was glad that he'd assigned the order at the beginning of class so now he didn't have to worry about that but could instead concentrate on worrying about Josie. \"I'm next.\" Guy Perkins told him as he rose to his feet. Sam gave him a nod of acknowledgement but before he could begin there was a gentle knock at the classroom door. \"Just hang on a minute.\" Sam interrupted the teenager and did his very best not to fly to the door. Pulling it open he found no one. Frowning slightly he poked his head out in the hall where he found Josie standing out of sight of the classroom. Looking back to the class he said. \"I'll be right back. Please try not to destroy the place in the next five minutes.\" Closing the door behind him he stepped towards Josie and without a word wrapped his arms around her. \"I was getting worried.\" He whispered into her hair. \"I was thinking all kinds of bad things had happened to you.\" \"I'm not that late.\" She commented, greatly surprised at his obvious anxiety over her tardiness. \"I know.\" He acknowledged with mild embarrassment. \"It's just not like you to be late without letting me know. I guess I was just letting my imagination run away with me.\" Giving him a serious look she told him, her tone completely empty of emotion. \"I had a meeting with Gus and Rigfort today.\" \"About?\" He prompted, searching her face for any clues as to the reason for the meeting. \"Two things: my story and the future of my job as a reporter.\" She told him, her expression still neutral. He waited for her to continue but when she didn't he pressed eagerly, curiosity eating at him. \"What did they have to say?\" \"Well, apparently they've decided that it would be best if I wasn't given any more undercover pieces to do. They don't seem to think I have what it takes to be an undercover reporter.\" She told him matter-of-factly, still no hint of expression on her face. \"Oh, honey I'm so sorry.\" He told her sincerely, giving her a consoling hug. \"I know how much you wanted this.\" \"That's not all they said.\" She commented against his chest. When Sam pulled back and looked at her expectantly she added. \"Even though they don't think I have what it takes to be a reporter, they do agree that I have the talent to be a writer.\" \"So?\" Sam pressed as he saw the excited sparkle that appeared in her eye. \"So, you are looking at the Chicago Sun-Times newest columnist!\" She told him proudly. \"And look at this.\" Reaching into her briefcase she pulled out the latest issue of the Sun-Times. Flipping it open to the middle section she handed it to Sam and pointed to the article in question. \" Life and Times of Chicago. A Monthly Column by Josie Geller. 'Finding Myself in High School'.\" Looking at Josie excitedly he exclaimed. \"Honey, this is wonderful!\" Enveloping her in another hug he said sincerely. \"I am so proud of you! I knew you could do it!\" \"I never could have done it without you.\" She told him sincerely. After a couple moments he pulled back and urged. \"Come on, lets go in and tell your 'classmates' the good news. I bet they'll be surprised.\" \"I'm sure they'll be more than surprised.\" Josie commented with a wry smile. Sam gave her hand a tender squeeze before releasing it and opening the door to his classroom. Josie followed him into the room and made her way to her usual seat beside Aldys. \"Hey.\" Aldys greeted warmly as the other girl sat down. \"We've missed you.\" Josie gave her a warm smile. \"I've missed you too.\" Suddenly she was surrounded by more of her friends and 'classmates', all of whom were welcoming her back with excited words and big smiles. Sam watched delightedly as Josie's face started to glow under the attentions of her friends. He knew how much it meant to her to be accepted by others, especially by her high school peers and he was so happy to see them flocking around her as they were. After a few minutes he raised his hands and said seriously. \"Okay everyone settle down.\" When the din didn't diminish much he added. \"I'm still your teacher for a few more days so when I say settle down I expect you to listen.\" There were muttered protests but everyone finally did as he asked. Looking at Guy he prompted. \"Mr. Perkins, I believe you were about to tell us how your Senior year at South Glen South affected you.\" Guy rose to his feet, clearing his throat slightly as he stood. \"I would have to say that the most important thing that I learned during my Senior year here at South Glen South is that you can't always go by first impressions. People aren't always what they first seem to be.\" He noticed Josie squirm slightly in her seat out of the corner of his eye, but he didn't look directly at her. Instead he focused his attention on his loyal followers as if trying to get his message across to them. \"A lot of times we let prejudice or preconceived ideas influence our treatment of a person before we really get to know them.\" It was then that he turned his attention to Josie, who he noticed was now blushing hotly from his words. \"When Josie first came here most of us immediately branded her a loser just because she was nervous and a bit shy and awkward. But we were wrong. Josie is anything but a loser. She is one of the smartest, craziest - coolest girls that I have ever met. And she's the one that taught me the importance of looking beyond those preconceived ideas and first impressions and get to know the real person. Because sometimes you may be surprised by what you may find.\" Giving Josie a genuinely warm smile he told her sincerely. \"You have literally rocked my world, Josie and I thank you whole-heartedly for that.\" As Guy sat down the whole room broke into thunderous applause. Josie, moved beyond words, rose to her feet and walked over to Guy. He rose to his feet at her approach and willingly accepted the warm hug that she gave him. \"Thank you.\" She whispered in his ear, her tone choked with emotion. \"You have no idea how much that meant to me.\" Guy smiled and whispered back. \"I just wanted to show you that not all of us 'popular' guys are total jerks.\" Josie chuckled at that and pulled back to look into her eyes. Then leaning over she gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek. \"You're anything but.\" She assured him before turning and reclaiming her seat. Once settled her eyes immediately sought Sam's, who was smiling warmly at her. He knew just how much Guy's honest expressions had meant to her and to him too. He would always be grateful to the younger man for helping to boost her self-esteem in a way that he wasn't able to. Focusing back on the rest of the class he announced. \"We have a few more people to hear from before class is over and then at the end Josie has something she'd like to say to the class.\" Twenty minutes and four essays later Sam finally turned to Josie and prompted warmly. \"Josie, why don't you tell us how your time at South Glen South has affected your outlook on life.\" Josie gave Sam a mildly amused look, noting how he'd changed the way he'd worded the question. Reaching into her briefcase Josie pulled out the clipping she'd made of her article. Then she rose and went to stand at the front of the class, beside where Sam was sitting on the edge of his desk. Glancing at him nervously for a moment she felt her confidence bolster with his reassuring smile. Turning back to the class she cleared her throat and read her article out loud: \"Finding Myself in High School\" by Josie Geller Sun-Times Staff Writer Someone once told me that to write well, you have to write what you know. This is what I know: I am twenty-five years old and until last week I had never really kissed a guy. A geek to the core most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher. High School was more of the same. Then at seventeen it seems as if my luck was about to change. The cutest guy asked me to the Senior Prom, but it turned out to be a cruel joke and I have never fully recovered. Yes, it is embarrassing to share this with the world, but it would be hard to explain what I learned and how I learned it without sharing this humiliating history. I received an assignment, my first as a reporter to go back to High School and find out about kids today. What I ended up finding was myself and that High School hasn't changed. There's still that one teacher who marches to her own drummer; those girls are still there. The ones that even as you grow up, will remain the most beautiful girls that you've ever seen close up. The smart kids. Who everyone else knew as 'the brains', but I just knew them as my soul mates, my teachers, my friends. And there's still that one guy with his mysterious confidence, who seems so perfect in every way. The guy you get up and go to school for in the morning. South Glen would not have been the same without him, High School would not be the same without him, I would not have been the same without him. I lived a lifetime of regret after my first High School experience, but now after my second all my regrets have disappeared. In fact I have found that everything that I hated about High School before are now things that don't matter any more. And for that I have three very important people to thank: a fellow student who befriended me without question on my first day and unknowingly kept me from running away from my own fears. The coolest guy in the class who gave me the chance to see the other side of the popularity fence and made all my hopes and dreams of being accepted possible. And finally, I want to especially thank a certain teacher who directed me in my path of self-discovery. Who encouraged me more than anyone has ever encouraged me in my life and who made me believe in myself just like he believed in me. To this man in particular, you know who you are, I just want to say: I love you. Yes I, Josie Geller, have finally managed to battle the demons that haunted me since High School and have been able to put them in their proper place - behind me. And I am finally ready to move on with confidence and my head held high with my wonderful new friends and most importantly my beloved teacher at my side. \" The conclusion of Josie's story was met with stunned silence and blank expressions, much to Sam and Josie's expectation. The pair exchanged knowing smiles before looking back at the class, where they caught the amused eye of both Guy and Aldys. Finally after several moments Gibby's hand went up. \"Yes, Gibby.\" Sam acknowledged, his eyes dancing with expectation. \"I thought this assignment was suppose to be based on our own personal experience.\" Gibby commented seriously. \"About how our Senior year here at South Glen South has affected our lives.\" \"That's right.\" Sam nodded in confirmation. \"Then why did Josie get to read a newspaper clipping about somebody else's High School experience?\" The young girl complained in a whinny tone. \"I didn't read someone else's work.\" Josie denied, stepping towards the other girl and handing her the clipping she was reading from. \"See, it's say 'by Josie Geller. Sun-Times Staff Writer.\" Gibby looked up from the clipping and gave the blond girl a completely perplexed look. \"I don't understand. What are you trying to say?\" \"Oh, for pete's sake!\" Guy exclaimed, visibly disgusted at her obvious denseness. \"What she's trying to say is that she's no a seventeen-year-old student but a twenty-five year old reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times.\" \"Shut up!\" Kirstin exclaimed in complete disbelief as Josie returned to where Sam was standing at the front of the class. \"There's no way!\" \"I'm happy to say that he's right.\" Sam confirmed Guy's words with a bright smile on his face. Then looking at Josie proudly for a moment he added. \"I am also proud to announce that Josie is now the Chicago Sun-Times newest and most talented monthly columnist!\" \"Josie, that's wonderful!\" The three popular girls exclaimed in stereo. Aldys, unable to contain her happiness for her friend leapt out of her seat and threw her arms around the other girl. \"Josie that is terrific!\" Pulling back she gave her a broad smile. \"I knew you could do it!\" Suddenly something occurred to Kirsten. \"Did you say the Chicago Sun-Times?\" \"That's right.\" Josie nodded in confirmation. Kirsten's eyes widened slightly as she glanced from Josie to Sam and back again. \"You're that Josie?\" Josie smiled up at Sam as he came up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders, giving them a loving squeeze. Looking back to the class she nodded to Kirsten and replied joyfully. \"I'm that Josie.\" Murmurs of surprise went around the room at Josie's announcement. \"You are so lucky!\" Kristen told her sincerely, feeling somewhat envious of the other girl. Looking back to Sam Josie echoed the other girl's sentiment. \"I most certainly am.\"[Chapter 8] Josie stood before her mirror and smoothed the skirt of the new blue sundress that Aldys, Gibby Kirstin and Kristen helped her pick out that afternoon. After class she and the four teens had gone shopping as they had planned at the ballgame on Monday night. When she'd told them that tonight she and Sam were going out on their first official date to celebrate her article and her new job at the paper they were more than happy to help her shop for the occasion. Now that she didn't have to pretend to be one of their peers, Josie actually found she didn't mind Gibby, Kirstin and Kristen as much as she had before. With the pressure of having to impress them and find a story gone she found herself more able to relax and even enjoy their adolescent behavior. The fact that she was so excited and happy about the way her life was going also helped contribute to her happy mood. In some ways she still found it hard to believe that she - Josie Grossie - was actually the girlfriend of a very handsome and wonderful man and the newest and youngest columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. At that very moment she felt like she was on top of the world. There was no way that her life could get any better. \"It could only get worse.\" She whispered anxiously to her reflection. But then she immediately pushed such thoughts from her mind. \"I've got to stop being such a pessimist or else Sam is going to break up with me for being so negative.\" She smiled wryly at herself. \"There I go again!\" A knock at her door signaled Sam's arrival. \"It's open.\" Josie called from the bedroom as she gave herself another quick once over before heading for the living room and her waiting boyfriend. \"Hi.\" He greeted as she appeared out of her room. After dropping a kiss on her lips he said. \"You look wonderful. These are for you.\" He presented her with a beautiful bouquet of pink lilies and baby's breath. \"Oh, Sam!\" She accepted the flowers and smiled. \"They're wonderful. But you don't have to keep bring me flowers every time, you know. It must be costing you a fortune.\" \"Don't you be worrying about that.\" Sam told her seriously. \"Besides, its our first real date and I want everything to be just perfect.\" Josie gave him a tender and said. \"As long as I'm with you, it will be.\" Sam smiled at her and leaned down to kiss her again. Josie looped her free arm around his neck, deepening the kiss. Neither one seemed anxious for it to end, so its unknown as to how long it would have lasted had the phone not started ringing. Josie groaned in obvious annoyance as Sam broke off the kiss. \"I'm going to kill that little brother of mine.\" She gripped angrily. \"What do you mean?\" Sam gave her a surprised look. \"Oh, that baseball nut has been calling me all day long about practice tomorrow.\" Josie told him as she moved towards the kitchen and her phone, which was still ringing. \"He's been driving me crazy! I'm ready to throttle him!\" She reached to answer it but then stopped. \"You know what, you answer it. If I talk to him one more time I'll probably have him kicked off the team before we even get things going.\" \"And we certainly wouldn't want that.\" Sam commented as he reached for the phone. \"Rob may be obsessive, but he is a pretty darn good ball player.\" Putting the receiver to his ear he greeted pleasantly. \"Hello?\" \"Sam?\" A surprised sounding female voice replied. \"Hi, Anita.\" Sam responded warmly. \"How's it going?\" \"Fine.\" Anita acknowledged, then hesitantly asked. \"I'm not interrupting anything am I?\" \"No.\" Sam assured her. \"Josie thought it was Rob calling her about practice again. I guess he's been bugging her all day about it.\" Anita chuckled slightly. \"He'd better mind his P's and Q's tomorrow. Gus won't put up with Rob's obsessiveness as well as we do.\" Sam glanced at Josie who was busy putting her lilies in a vase. \"I don't know how much longer some of us will be able to tolerate him either.\" Anita chuckled again. \"Josie's getting that annoyed, is she? Well, here are some words of warning, Sam. When Josie finally loses it with him get far, far out of the way. Josie can be very formidable when she's mad.\" \"I'll remember that.\" Sam acknowledged, his eyes still fixed on the subject of their discussion. \"So how did her story go over in class today?\" She asked expectantly. She'd been dying of curiosity about the subject ever since Josie'd left the office that afternoon. \"They didn't eat her alive, did they?\" \"No, actually quite the contrary.\" He assured her. \"Actually, it took some of them a while to actually catch on to what Josie meant by her article. Gibby accused her of stealing someone else's work. It wasn't until Guy piped up and told her that Josie was the newspaper reporter and that she was twenty-five than Gibby and her friends actually got it.\" Anita sighed dramatically. \"Well, nobody ever said that all teenage girls were swift.\" \"No, they most certainly did not.\" Sam agreed with a chuckle. \"That's probably why I was so attracted to Josie. She was so much smarter than the average teenage girl.\" \"Are you saying you just love me for my brains?\" Josie asked as she set the vase of flowers on the counter in front of Sam. \"Not just for you brains.\" He assured her and gave her a mischievous wink. On the other end of the phone line Anita chuckled. \"I should probably let you go as I'm sure you're both eager to start your first official date.\" \"You're right.\" Sam agreed. Then with a wicked wink at Josie he added in a hurried tone. \"Been nice talking to you, Anita. Bye!\" Anita laughed again, having already caught on to Sam's sense of humor. \"No so fast Coulson!\" She countered. \"I need to talk to your girlfriend first before you hang up.\" \"Just a second, I'll see if she wants to talk to you.\" Sam replied and looking at Josie he asked, without even moving the receiver from its place. \"Honey, you don't want to talk to Anita, do you?\" Then in a stage whisper he pretended to plead. \"Say 'no'. Just say 'no'.\" Josie laughed at his mock pleading expression and grabbed the receiver from his hand. \"Give me that, you fool.\" Putting the receiver to her ear she greeted her friend warmly. \"Hi Anita, what's new?\" \"Well, your boyfriend is a little bit weird.\" Anita laughed with evident amusement. \"Yeah, I know.\" She agreed. Then shooting Sam a sly look she added. \"But that's not new.\" The two women laughed as Sam smiled good-naturedly, figuring that he was the butt of their joke. \"Look Jos, I won't keep you. I realize that you two are on your way out.\" She paused for a moment and then added wickedly. \"At least I assume you're on your way out.\" \"Anita!\" Josie exclaimed, blushing hotly under Sam's curious gaze. Turning her back on him she tried to compose herself by asking. \"What is it you wanted to tell me?\" \"Two things.\" Anita replied, her face nearly splitting with the amused smile it wore. \"First, you got a reply to your ad about the helmet.\" \"Really?\" Josie exclaimed eagerly. \"I never expected to hear anything so quickly. Do you know who it was?\" \"Yeah, Merkin gave me the message to pass on to you.\" Her friend told her. \"Do you want the guy's name and number now?\" Josie hesitated for a moment, glancing briefly over her shoulder at Sam. \"May be I'll wait and get it from you later.\" \"Don't want Sam to know about it just yet, eh?\" Anita commented with understanding. \"Exactly.\" Josie confirmed with a smile. \"So what was the other thing you had to tell me?\" \"Oh, just that I overheard Gus and Rigfort talking this afternoon. Apparently they have received a lot more response to your article than they expected.\" Anita told her eagerly. \"I guess they got hundreds of phone calls and emails from people eager to hear more from you.\" \"Really?\" Josie exclaimed in amazement. \"Are you sure they were talking about me?\" \"Positive!\" Her best friend assured her. \"And that's not all! They've decided that instead of having you do a monthly column, they're going to try a weekly one! And you never know, maybe if there's enough demand you'll get to do a daily one!\" When so response came from her young friend Anita prompted. \"Josie? Are you still there?\" After a pause Josie finally acknowledged her friend. \"I'm here.\" She confirmed. \"I'm just speechless! I can't believe this is happening to me! Anita, I'm a writer! I'm finally a writer!\" Shaking with excitement she launched herself into Sam's arms and cried happily on his shoulder. \"Oh Sam, this place is beautiful!\" Josie exclaimed as she scanned the restaurant delightedly. \"How did you ever find it? It's got to be the most out of the way hole-in-the-wall place I've ever seen.\" \"That may be.\" Sam acknowledged with a smile. \"But it serves the best Italian food in Chicago. And its always jammed packed, even during the week. It's almost impossible to get a reservation here.\" Stepping up to the Maitre 'D he said. \"Reservation for Coulson.\" \"Table for two?\" The girl inquired checking her schedule. \"That's right.\" Sam nodded. She gave him a mischievous smile and said. \"Please excuse me for a minute while I check on your table.\" As the girl moved off Josie looked at Sam and commented. \"So, you didn't answer my question.\" \"What question was that?\" He asked curiously. \"How did you ever find this place?\" She repeated, looking around them again. \"The owners are immigrants from Italy.\" Sam explained. \"Maria speaks and reads English fairly fluently, but Luigi spoke very little at all and couldn't read any. A couple of winters ago Maria convinced Luigi to take some English lessons to help him improve his language skills. The restaurant was growing quickly and Maria needed more help from him to handle the growth. So they advertised for a tutor. I saw the ad and since I had most of my evenings free with Lara in New York and having already given up hockey I decided to take the job.\" He chuckled slightly. \"Actually, it wasn't really a job, it was more like visiting with friends two nights a week. Maria and Luigi basically adopted me as one of their sons, stuffing me full of pasta and stories from the old country while I helped Luigi learn his verbs and nouns.\" Josie smiled at his story, but before she could comment a roundish Italian matron came bustling out of the kitchen and into the foyer, a broad smile on her face. \"Sam!\" She exclaimed, opening her arms wide and pulling him into a warm embrace. \"Hi Maria.\" Sam greeted, returning her exuberant hug easily. \"It's good to see you.\" \"Its good to be seen.\" She replied, giving him a brilliant smile. Then chiding him slightly she added. \"It's been far too long since you've been here. Luigi and I have missed you very much.\" \"I've missed you both too.\" Sam assured her. \"I'm sorry about not coming in sooner, but my life has been a bit crazy lately.\" Maria frowned, concern written all over her face. \"Good crazy or bad crazy? That Lara is not making your life miserable again, is she? I tell you that woman is…\" She broke into a barrage of Italian words that caused Sam's eyebrows to rise sharply. Then putting a hand on either side of his face she continued in English. \"You need someone special, Sam. Someone sweet and nice and who will love you for you. You need to dump that awful woman, five years or no five years. She's not good for you, Sam.\" Sam chuckled slightly and reached for Josie's hand, pulling her closer so he could introduce her to his friend. \"Actually, Maria there's someone that I would like for you to meet. May I present my beautiful and incredibly sweet and nice girlfriend, Josie Geller. Josie, this is Maria Attardo.\" A broad smile spread across Maria's face. Pointing to Josie she repeated. \"Girlfriend? She's your girlfriend?\" \"Yes she is.\" Sam confirmed. \"You mean Lara's…\" She made a sound in the back of her throat as she mimicked a knife slicing across her throat. Sam chuckled and nodded. \"Lara and I broke up a few weeks ago.\" \"Meraviglioso!\" Maria exclaimed her hands extended in the air before she pulled Sam in for another hug. Pulling back she added. \"That woman was a strega ! She was not good for you! She only cared about herself. You need someone who cares about you.\" Sam slipped his arm around Josie's waist and said sincerely. \"Well, I've found her.\" Maria gave Josie a warm smile and took one of her hands in both of hers. She gave the young woman a scrutinizing look before pronouncing. \"E bello.\" Josie flushed slightly. \"And not just on the outside, non?\" \"She most certainly is.\" Sam agreed, tightening his arm that was still around her waist and kissing the side of her head lovingly. Josie flushed even more. \"Come.\" Maria finally exclaimed after watching them for another few moments. \"Let's get you a table. Follow me.\" She led them through the crowded restaurant to a quiet little corner booth for two. \"This is so beautiful.\" Josie exclaimed her eyes widening as she took in the flickering candles and the romantic ambiance that surrounded them. \"Oh Sam, this is such a perfect spot for out first date.\" Maria's ears perked up at Josie's words. \"Your first date?\" With an eager expression on her face she said. \"You two sit, please and leave everything to me. Tonight, you dine on us!\" \"No, Maria.\" Sam tried to stop the excited Italian woman. \"We can't impose on your generosity.\" \"No imposition!\" She told him honestly. \"Tonight you are our guests. Tonight is a night for amore!\" With that she was gone. Sam couldn't help but shake his head and chuckle. He knew Maria would go all out if she found out it was his and Josie's first date. Looking up he found Josie chuckling too. \"She's really something, isn't she?\" \"I love her.\" Josie exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with amusement. \"She's fun and enthusiastic.\" \"Sweetheart, you haven't seen anything yet!\" Sam told her with a laugh. \"The moment you told her that it was our first date you gave her the green light to go absolutely all out, and believe me she will! Italians are some of the most romantic people alive.\" \"It's a good job that I didn't tell her that this was my first official date period.\" Josie remarked with a smile. \"No, it's a good thing you didn't.\" Sam agreed. \"There's no telling how elaborate Maria would have gone if she knew that.\" His expression turned more serious as he reached across the table and took her hands in his. \"Though I do want you to have a memorable first date.\" Kissing the back of her right hand he added. \"I want it to be one of the most memorable evenings of your life.\" Josie's eyes welled up with tears. \"Every moment with you is memorable.\" Sam gave her a tender smile. \"I feel the same way.\" Before the couple could say anything more Maria returned with a bottle of wine in hand and an older Italian man in tow. \"Sam!\" The man exclaimed eagerly as he approached them. Sam rose and gave the other man a hearty handshake and good-naturedly accepted the friendly kisses he placed on both his cheeks. \"Why you not come and see us sooner? You not like us?\" Sam gave the other man a knowing smile and flung his arm around the shorter man's shoulders. \"Nice try at the guilt trip, Luigi. Make me feel bad.\" \"Hey, you no come see me.\" Luigi commented. \"You make me feel bad!\" Then with a mischievous look at Josie he added. \"But, I see you have good reason for being too busy to visit.\" Gesturing to the young woman she exclaimed. \" E molto bella !\" Josie flushed once again at the praise. \" Astuto too, non ?\" Sam looked proudly at Josie. \"Yes, she's very smart.\" \"Luigi, let's let them enjoy their date.\" Maria admonished her husband as she poured two glasses of wine and set the bottle on the table. \"This wine is from Luigi's personal stock. His brother sent it all the way from Italy.\" \"We can't take your family wine.\" Sam objected seriously. \" Assurdita !\" The Italian couple exclaimed simultaneously. \"You're like family!\" Maria told him, patting him affectionately on the cheek. \"You enjoy.\" Luigi urged them with twinkling eyes and a broad smile. \"Wine is important for romanzesco !\" With that the older couple left them to enjoy their wine and each other's company. \"You were right.\" Josie commented with a smile. \"About what?\" Sam asked curiously. \"Italians really are the most romantic people alive!\" \"How is it?\" Sam asked as Josie slipped a bite of her dessert into her mouth. \"Heavenly.\" She moaned as the Semi-sweet, Bittersweet and White chocolate from her Triple Chocolate cheesecake melted in her mouth. Closing her eyes she sighed. \"Nothing should be allowed to taste this good.\" Sam laughed at the sheer ecstasy on her face. \"Should I leave you two alone?\" He teased lightly. Josie blushed slightly and opened her eyes. \"Sorry, I guess I got a little carried away. What were you saying before?\" Sam watched as she took another bite of her cheesecake before replying. \"I was just saying that you're going to love Wisconsin. It's very beautiful this time of year. My parents have a nice little hobby farm in the country.\" Noting her smirk he asked curiously. \"What's with the grin?\" \"I just find it hard picturing you as a farm boy.\" She remarked with a chuckle. \"You know with the overalls and straw hat feeding the chickens and milking the cows. You must have been so adorable.\" \"I was an adorable little boy.\" Sam told her cheekily. \"But I'm sorry to disappoint you. I was never a farm boy.\" \"You weren't?\" She was surprised at that. \"How can you grow up on a farm and not be a farm boy?\" \"Because I didn't grow up on a farm.\" Sam told her. \"I'm a hometown boy. Born and raised here in Chicago.\" \"Really?\" Josie had been sure he was from Wisconsin. \"I wonder where I got the idea that you were from the country?\" She mused aloud to herself. \"Does that mean you don't love me anymore because I'm not from the country?\" Sam teased lightly. Josie gave a mock dramatic sigh and said. \"Well, it definitely might put a damper on our relationship.\" Then after taking a bit of her cheesecake she asked. \"So, how did your folks end up there?\" \"When I was a senior in High School Dad got a job offer in Wisconsin.\" He explained after taking a bite of his own dessert. \"He and Mom decided that it would be a good move for them since there were getting tired of the rat race here in Chicago. So, Mom, Dad, Russ and Abby all moved to Wisconsin.\" Josie snapped her fingers and exclaimed. \"That's where I got the idea that you were from Wisconsin. When I was talking to Abby on my cell phone the other night she'd made a comment about shoveling snow in Wisconsin.\" Sam nodded his head in confirmation. \"Abby lived in Wisconsin for about two years before she and Bill got married and moved to California.\" \"But you didn't go? To Wisconsin I mean. You didn't move with the rest of your family?\" When he shook his head she pressed. \"Why not?\" \"I was almost finished my Senior year of High School and I didn't really want to have to start all over again for four or five months.\" He explained. \"Besides, I was planning to go to college in the fall anyway, so I would have left home then. It just didn't make much sense to move and than move again.\" \"So what did you do?\" Josie asked curiously. \"Where did you stay?\" \"I stayed with Jonathan and his family until about August.\" Sam told her. \"Than Jonathan, Joanna and I moved to Connecticut and got ready to attend Yale.\" \"All three of you went to Yale?\" Josie looked at him in awe. At his nod of confirmation she exclaimed. \"That's amazing! I always wished I could have gone to Yale but I never bothered to apply because I never figured I'd get in. I didn't think that I was smart enough.\" \"Josie, you are definitely smart enough.\" Sam quickly assured her. \"You are one of the smartest people I know.\" Josie gave him a mischievous grin. \"You have to say that because you're my teacher.\" Sam's expression grew serious as he said. \"No, I'm saying it because I believe it's true. You are one of the smartest people I know and I love you very, very much.\" \"I love you too, Sam.\" She assured him with a tender smile. With an excited sparkle in her eyes she added. \"This last week has been the best one of my entire life. You have made me feel so loved, so cherished. Like I'm really someone special.\" Sam leaned forward and reached across the table to touch her face. \"You are special, Josie. You are the most special woman in my life and I love you more than anything else. And you know what, I wish you had of gone to Yale.\" \"Why's that?\" She asked curiously. \"Because then maybe I would have met you instead of Lara and it would be you that I could have had a five year history with by now.\" He told her truthfully. \"And I can guarantee that our history would have been so much different.\" Josie gave him a mischievous smile and asked. \"What do you think that we'd be doing right now if we'd met at Yale five years ago?\" \"Well, I would think that we would probably both be doing the jobs that we're doing right now.\" He told her with a thoughtful expression on his face. \"After all, I love to teach and you love to write.\" He looked thoughtful again for several moments before continuing. \"I think that we would most definitely be living here in Chicago, since we both grew up here and love it here.\" \"So far good.\" Josie told him with a nod. \"What else?\" After doing some mental calculations in his head Sam replied. \"Well, if we'd have met your first year at Yale, which would have been the 1991-92 school year and say we'd started officially dating that winter.\" Josie raised her eyebrows slightly. \"That fast?\" \"Well, when I see a good thing I don't waste much time staking my claim.\" He teased gently. \"Okay, so we started dating that winter.\" She repeated. \"Then what?\" \"I would say that by the end of the school year we would have been engaged.\" He told her seriously. Josie laughed. \"You definitely don't believe in wasting time.\" \"Well, you obviously feel the same way because you accepted my proposal.\" He commented mischievously. \"Point taken.\" She laughed again. \"So when would we have gotten married?\" Sam looked thoughtful again for several moments. \"That summer. Maybe August, just before school started. That would give us time for a honeymoon, but also time to get back in time to start the new school year.\" \"Now that's what I call a whirlwind courtship!\" Josie exclaimed. \"I guess you don't believe in long engagements then either.\" \"Not when I desperately want to marry the girl I'm engaged to.\" He told her honestly, reaching across the table to take her hand. Josie flushed and gave him a bright smile. \"I want to marry you too.\" She told him sincerely. \"But I don't want things to happen too fast. I want both of us to be sure.\" \"I have never been more sure of anything in me life.\" Sam told her truthfully. \"But I understand what you're saying. Just as long as you promise not to change you mind in the mean time.\" Josie gave him a warm smile. \"I promise. Nothing could make me change my mind. I love you.\" Sam reached up and cupped her face with his hand again. Josie closed her eyes and pressed her cheek into the palm of his hand. \"I can't wait to introduce you to my family. They are going to just adore you.\" Josie looked at him a little skeptically. \"You think so?\" \"I know so.\" He assured her. \"Do you think you'll be able to get the time off?\" \"I should be able to.\" Josie nodded. \"I've been at the Sun-Times for five years and I've only taken two weeks off.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" Sam raised his eyes curiously. \"What did you do?\" \"Rob and I went to Toronto, Ontario, Canada to watch a Blue Jays baseball game at the Skydome.\" \"The Skydome?\" Sam repeated in surprise. \"Why did you guys go there?\" \"I don't know.\" Josie shrugged slightly. \"Rob got the notion into his head that he wanted to go and he begged me to go with him. It was fun actually. Toronto's a nice city. Cleaner than Chicago for sure.\" \"Did you do anything else besides go to a ball game?\" He asked inquisitively. \"We did some sightseeing and some shopping. We went up to CN Tower and visited this really interesting castle that use to belong to the guy that originally owned the power company in Toronto. It was built in the early 1900's, and cost about two million dollars then.\" \"That sounds interesting.\" Sam gave her a deeply intrigued look. \"What's the place called?\" \"Castle Loma.\" She told him. \"It was designed to have a swimming pool with golden statues surrounding it, a bowling alley, exercise room, a library that holds about 10,000 books and the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen.\" Sam's eyes twinkled knowingly. \"I bet you loved the library best.\" Josie smiled and nodded. \"Rob got mad at me because I was trying to read the titles of all the books I could see.\" \"What else did you do?\" He asked eagerly, wishing to hear every detail of her trip. \"We went to Paramount Canada's Wonderland which is about an hour north of the city and rode the roller-coasters. They've got some pretty interesting roller coasters up there.\" She told him excitedly. \"They've got one that you stand up on while your riding it. I think it's called the 'Skyrider' or something like that. They have one called 'The Fly' that's like a little cart that takes you around some really sharp corners and a couple fast dips. They take your picture when you go down the biggest dip. Rob and I both bought a copy as a souvenir. Rob's mouth is wide open from the shock of the drop. All you see in place of Rob's head is this big gapping hole.\" Sam smiled as she continued, her excitement building as she continued to describe the rides they'd been on. \"Another coaster was called 'Top Gun'. This one your strapped into a chair-like seat that leaves your feet dangling the whole time - even when you're flipped upside down in a loop. But I would have to say my favorite was the \"Bat\". On the \"Bat\" you do the ride forward through all the loops and corkscrews, then you do it backwards. The corkscrew really throws you for a loop when you do it backwards.\" Seeing the sparkle in her eyes and hearing the excitement in her voice Sam remarked. \"I take it you like roller coasters.\" Josie nodded enthusiastically. \"I love rides period! Another cool ride that we went on was called 'Drop Zone'. It's 230 feet high and they pull you up in a bench of seats that's four seats wide with complete back and side supports for each seat plus a harness you pull down over your shoulders and clip into place in front of you. Then when you reach the top they wait about ten seconds and then drop you. You're actually free falling for about oh, say three -quarters of the distance and then they slow you down and eventually stop softly on the ground. It was a real rush!\" She chuckled slightly. \"The first time that we went on it I noticed how beautiful the view was. You could see such a long distance away. Anyway, I was pointing something out to Rob, momentarily forgetting where we were when suddenly the ride dropped. My heart was in my throat before I realized what was going on! It was great though! We went back on it a couple more times that day.\" She noticed Sam shudder slightly and reached over to squeeze his hand reassuringly. \"Don't worry, honey. I won't make you ride anything like that. I completely understand why you don't like rides.\" \"I'm not fond of them.\" Sam agreed honestly but then his eyes started to twinkle slightly as he added. \"But I will say that the Ferris wheel is starting to hold a definite appeal.\" A sly smile appeared on his face as he said. \"Especially if I can hold my favorite girl in my arms while I'm riding it.\" Josie returned his mischievous smile with one of her own. \"Well, that jut may be something that cam be arranged, Mr. Coulson.\" Sam's eyes began to dance even more. \"What do you say we take a stroll down there right now? The pier's only a couple blocks away.\" The mischief in his voice deepened as he eyed her empty dessert plate, which was now completely devoid of any traces of her sumptuous dessert. \"That is unless you'd like another serving of that Triple Chocolate Cheesecake you love so much.\" \"No, its okay.\" She assured him with a slight blush. \"I don't want to make a pig of myself.\" Sam merely smiled as he rose to his feet, reaching a hand out to help her to hers. \"Shall we?\" \"Lets.\" Josie acknowledged with a broad smile as she let Sam lead her across the full restaurant. Spying Maria peering through the kitchen door, Sam waved at her. Seeing him the Italian woman came bustling out, a warm smile on her face. \" I mili tesori , you're not leaving?\" She asked, her expression turning sorrowful. \"I'm afraid we are.\" Sam informed her, trying not to laugh at her expression. \"But don't worry, we will be back.\" \" Promessa ?\" She prompted eagerly. \"Promessa.\" He assured her before leaning down and giving her a kiss on each cheek. As he did so he tried to slip some money into her apron pocket, but Maria was wise to him. \" Non ! You save your money!\" She took the bills out of her pocket and pressed them into his hand. \"Tonight is on us. You spend your money on other things.\" She looked at Josie and reached over to touch her face gently. \"On prettier things.\" \"But Maria…!\" Sam started to object but she waved him off. \" Non! Silenzio! \" Then with a mischievous wink she added. \"You let us cater the wedding and we will be even.\" Josie blushed at the remark, but not as hotly as she did a moment later when Sam whole-heartedly agreed. \"It's a deal!\" \"I always loved the Navy Pier at night.\" Josie commented as she and Sam strolled along the boardwalk that leads to the midway. \"The lights are so beautiful.\" Slipping an arm around her waist Sam whispered in her ear. \" I love the way the lights make your eyes sparkle. They look like they're dancing.\" Josie blushed in the darkness and slipped her arm around his waist. \"Who would have thought that night we rode the Ferris Wheel that we'd be back a few weeks later as a real couple.\" Kissing the side of her head Sam confessed honestly. \"That night on the Ferris Wheel I wished we were a real couple.\" \"Really?\" Josie looked at him in surprise. \"Why do you think I joined you so quickly, d espite my fear of heights? \" He confided seriously. \"When I saw you sitting there all alone and heard the carnie call out for a partner for you I just reacted without thinking because I wanted nothing more than to be with you.\" Josie couldn't believe her ears. \"I thought you just did it out of pity, because I looked so pathetic sitting there all by myself.\" Sam shook his head and admitted. \"If wasn't pity. If anything it was jealousy.\" \"Jealousy?\" Josie repeated in disbelief. \"I told you that you made me feel jealous.\" He reminded her. \"What could you possibly of been jealous of then?\" She asked curiously. \"Guy was treating me like a loser and Rob was barely on the scene. I don't think you'd even met him yet.\" \"That's true.\" He acknowledged. \"But I wasn't jealous of them, or at least not just them.\" When she looked at him expectantly he explained. \"I was jealous that some other guy would come and sit beside you and fall in love with you and take you away from me.\" \"Like that would ever happen.\" She scoffed and rolled her eyes. \"Hey, I wanted to do it.\" He told her honestly. \"I wanted to run away with you right then and there. And if I'd have been more honest and forthcoming with my feelings maybe I would have suggested it.\" \"Where would we have gone?\" She asked mischievously as she gave him an expectant look. \"Oh, I don't know.\" He commented thoughtfully. \"Maybe some remote island in the Tropics where nobody would have known that you were my underage student and that I was your teacher.\" \"That's pretty sneaky and devious of you, Mr. Coulson.\" Josie teased, giving him an amused smile. \"Maybe, but truth be told I'm glad we didn't run off together. I am so much happier with the way things are now.\" He told her truthfully. \"I much rather having you a part of my life here in Chicago than have to sneak around and be deceptive in some other part of the world, Tropical paradise or not.\" \"Me too.\" She agreed with a laugh. \"After all, I tend to burn very easily if I spend too much time in the hot sun.\" The pair chuckled in amusement as they reached the midway. They wandered around for several moments, just enjoying the busyness and excitement of their surroundings, not to mention just being together. After a few minutes a couple familiar face appeared to Sam across the way. \"Hey, isn't that Rob and Aldys up ahead?\" He asked with a small smile. \"Where?\" Josie asked, scanning the crowd for her younger brother and their friend. \"Over there by the ball toss.\" Sam pointed towards the booth he meant. Josie finally spotted the pair and couldn't help but smile as she watched her brother throw a baseball at a bunch of bowling pins. \"I'll bet he's practicing for tomorrow.\" Sam chuckled slightly. \"He's practicing for practice tomorrow?\" \"Hey, I keep telling you he's obsessed!\" She remarked as they headed for the pair. When they got within earshot Josie greeted them warmly. \"Hey you two, what's up?\" Both Aldys and Rob turned and smiled at the approaching pair. \"Rob's teaching me how to throw a ball properly.\" Aldys told her with a smile. \"And how much has he spent on this little training session?\" Josie asked knowingly. \"None of your business, Josephine.\" Rob commented as he went back to his game. \"Twenty-five dollars.\" Aldys mouthed to her friend. Josie laughed and nodded. She'd figured as much. \"So what are you two doing here?\" Rob asked curiously as he handed Aldys the large stuffed teddy bear that he'd won. \"We're on our first official date.\" Sam replied proudly as he hugged Josie to him. \"Congratulations.\" Aldys exclaimed with a delighted smile. \"So where did you go?\" \"Sam took me to this quaint little Italian restaurant a few blocks from here.\" Josie replied eagerly. \"Then we decided to come here and ride the Ferris wheel.\" \"Oh, the Ferris wheel. The Ultimate Date Ride.\" Rob remarked with a mischievous wink at the pair. \"How romantic.\" Josie and Sam chuckled as Josie gave her younger brother's arm a swat. \"So what have you two been up to?\" \"Well, first we went to the Batting Cage.\" Aldys began to relate. \"Then we did the Speed Throw, then Rob just spent twenty-five dollars winning me this beautiful big teddy bear at the Ball Toss.\" She gave Rob a warm smile and hugged the bear tighter to her. Rob tossed an arm casually around Aldys' shoulders and remarked. \"And this little lady here has got a good arm on her. You should sign her up for the Sun-Times team.\" Josie gave Aldys an apologetic look when she noted the excited expression on the girl's face. \"I'd love to, but I'm afraid you have to be twenty-one to sign up. I'm sorry.\" Aldys just shrugged it off good-naturedly. \"That's okay. I'll just appoint myself your cheering section.\" \"Great.\" The other girl told her eagerly. \"You can help Anita cheer us on. She never joins the team, but she's always there to watch the games.\" \"I'd like that.\" Aldys assured her with a smile. \"Just make sure you come up with a really good victory cheer.\" Rob told her, tightening the arm he had around her shoulders. \"We're going to need it a lot I'm figuring.\" \"And why's that?\" Sam asked expectantly, knowing the answer but wanting to bait the young man. Rob fell for the bait. \"Cause we're gonna cream all those losers that come our way!\" \"I still think I should call Gus and have him booted off the team.\" Josie said to Sam in a stage whisper. She then grinned innocently at Rob when he fitted her with a glare. \"So what were you guys up to now?\" Sam asked, wisely changing the subject. \"I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm thirsty.\" Aldys remarked. \"Me too.\" Rob agreed. \"Those tacos we had have left me dying of thirst.\" \"Well, we wouldn't want you to die.\" Josie teased him lightly. \"Why don't we head for the food building?\" She looked at Sam for his opinion. \"Sound fine to me.\" He agreed readily. \"I could go for something to drink too.\" \"Then I guess we're all in agreement.\" Aldys remarked and the two couples headed off in the direction of the food building. \"So, Aldys how's you application to Northwestern coming?\" Sam asked curiously. \"Good.\" She replied eagerly. \"I actually sent it off a couple days ago. Thanks again for the letter of reference.\" \"You're welcome.\" Sam and Josie said simultaneously causing them to look at each other in astonishment. \"You gave her a letter of reference too?\" Sam asked in surprise. Josie nodded. \"She asked me for one.\" With a proud smile she commented. \"I am a Northwestern graduate, after all.\" \"So you are.\" Sam grinned, tightening his arm around her. \"And no doubt one of their finest.\" \"Flatter.\" Josie teased, giving him a slight smile. Sam smiled back and leaned down to give her a kiss on the lips. Pulling back slightly he whispered. \"Not to mention my favorite graduate.\" \"Oh, will you two knock it off!\" Rob exclaimed in mock annoyance. When the couple looked at him in amusement he added. \"I really don't need to witness my sister's love life.\" Josie blushed slightly at his remark, but then for the second time that night her blush deepened at Sam's reply. \"Oh, you're just jealous, Rob.\" \"Jealous?\" Rob repeated in surprise. \"Of what?\" \"You're jealous because you wish that you could find someone as wonderful as Josie to be your girlfriend.\" Sam's eyebrows rose slightly when he noticed the embarrassed flush on Aldys' cheeks, but before he could comment Rob suddenly exclaimed in surprise. \"Hey Jos, isn't that what's her name?\" \"Who?\" Josie asked, looking in the direction Rob was pointing. \"You're going to have to be more specific.\" \"You know who I mean.\" He started snapping his fingers as he tried to remember the name of the girl he was referring to. \"That girl you were tight with in High School. The chubby one with the curly hair and the glasses. You know whom I mean. You two were as thick as thieves back then. Sandy? Cherie? Shirley?\" \"You mean Sheila Davis?\" Josie asked in surprise, her eyes scanning the crowd again. \"Sheila! That's her name!\" He acknowledged as the name finally fell into place. \"Where?\" Josie demanded as she continued to scan the crowd. \"Over there by the 'Zipper'.\" Rob pointed to the ride about five feet away. \"She's wearing the blue tank top and beige shorts.\" \"The one with the ponytail?\" Sam asked as he too scanned the crowd. \"That's the one.\" Rob acknowledged. \"I'll tell you one thing, she's certainly not that chubby High School geek anymore. In fact she's quite hot looking.\" \"Rob.\" Josie scolded softly, sending a pointed look at Aldys who was now looking sadly down at her feet. Catching her sister's hint he tightened his arm around Aldys' shoulders again and said. \"But she's not as hot as my girl here.\" Aldys flushed again and gave Rob a warm smile. Sam laughed at the couple then turned her attention to Josie, who was still watching the young woman across the way. \"So, are you going to go over and say 'hello'?\" \"I don't know.\" Josie replied, her tone evidently nervous. \"I'm not positive that it's her, and besides I haven't seen her in eight years. What if she doesn't remember me? Or worse, what if she doesn't want to remember me. I mean look at her she looks fabulous. I'm sure she doesn't want to be seen with me. I look heavy and ugly compared to her.\" \"You look nothing of the kind.\" Sam quickly assured her. \"As far as I'm concerned, you have her beat hands down.\" When Josie still didn't look convinced he tried another tactic. \"Come on, honey, you said yourself that you wished you hadn't lost contact with her. Maybe this is your chance to have that wish fulfilled. Go on. Just go up and say 'hi'. You'll be glad that you did.\" \"Listen to this man, Jos.\" Rob urged. \"He knows you well enough already to know you'll kick yourself all over the place if you don't go up to her and talk to her.\" When she hesitated again Rob started chanting. \"Josie! Josie! Josie!\" Soon he had Sam and Aldys doing it too. \"Okay! Okay!\" Josie finally exclaimed, her face red with embarrassment. \"I'll do it if you guys will promise to shut up!\" \"It's a deal.\" Rob assured her. Then with a not too gentle shove he urged. \"Go!\" Josie turned her head and stuck her tongue out at Rob. When she turned back she was surprised to find her quarry standing a few feet away looking at her nervously. \"Oh, hello.\" Josie greeted, her own tone trembling. \"Excuse me, but are you Josie Geller?\" The young woman asked curiously. \"Yes.\" Josie acknowledged hesitantly. Then in an uncertain tone she added. \"Sheila Davis?\" The young woman nodded her head eagerly and confirmed. \"It's me, though it's Sheila Clarke now.\" She held up her left hand for Josie to see her wedding ring. The two women started silently at each other for several seconds before they both let out a piercing scream and threw themselves into each other's arms. \"I don't believe it!\" Josie finally cried a few minutes later when she stepped back and took a good look at her friend. \"I've always wondered what became of you after High School.\" \"Well, as you know I went to NYU that fall and I decided that I wanted to be a nurse.\" Sheila told her eagerly. \"What about you? What are you doing?\" With an excited sparkle in her eyes Josie asked proudly. \"Do you read the Sun-Times?\" Sheila gave her an inquisitive look as she shook her head. \"No, Derek usually reads the Chronicle. Why?\" Josie's smile widened as she announced. \"You are looking at the newest columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. My very first article came out today!\" \"Oh, Josie that's wonderful!\" Sheila exclaimed and hugged her friend again. \"I'm so proud of you! I always knew you'd make it as a writer!\" \"You did?\" Her friend gave her a look of complete surprise. \"Of course I did.\" Sheila told her seriously. \"Your writings in High School were always the best I'd ever heard. I knew you had the talent to be a writer of some sort. Looks like I was right.\" \"Yes you were.\" Josie nodded then hugging her old friend again she whispered softly. \"Thank you.\" Knowing that Josie tended to be somewhat insecure about some things Sheila returned her hug and said. \"You're welcome.\" When they separated Sheila exclaimed eagerly. \"Come on, I want you to meet Derek.\" At the mention of the male name Josie remembered her own companions. \"Just a moment.\" She turned and beckoned for the others to join them. \"I have someone that I want you to meet too.\" As the others reached them she gestured to her brother and said. \"I'm sure you remember Rob.\" \"I sure do.\" Sheila acknowledged. \"Mr. Popularity himself. Just as good-looking as when we were in High School.\" Rob gave her a broad smile and returned the compliment. \"You're looking pretty good yourself, Sheila.\" \"That's what loosing fifty pounds and falling in love will do for you.\" She commented with a laugh as she spun and posed like a runway model. Sam saw Josie tense slightly at her friend's movements and put his hands reassuringly on her shoulders. Josie smiled up at him and then continued the introductions. Gesturing to Aldys she said. \"This is a good friend of mine, Aldys Wells.\" \"Aldys?\" Sheila repeated with a small smile. \"I like that. It's pretty.\" \"Thanks.\" Aldys smiled back. \"My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.\" Sheila chuckled then turned her attention to Sam who was still standing with his hands on Josie's shoulders. \"And who's this handsome young man of yours?\" Josie couldn't help the proud smile that lit up her face as she glanced up at Sam. Looking back to her friend she introduced the pair. \"Sheila, I'd like you to meet my boyfriend, Sam Coulson. Sam, this is my best friend from High School, Sheila Davis - actually I guess its Sheila Clarke now.\" \"You're married?\" Rob exclaimed in surprise. \"That's right.\" Sheila confirmed with a laugh as she showed him her rings. \"How long?\" He prompted curiously. \"Seven years ago August 17th.\" Then grabbing Josie's hand she urged. \"Come on, I want you to meet him.\" Josie laughed as she ran to keep up with her excited friend. Sam, Rob and Aldys all followed at a more leisurely pace, giving the two friends a few moments alone. \"Derek!\" Sheila called out to a handsome young man who was anxiously scanning the nearby crowd. Turning at the sound of his name, Derek flashed Sheila a relieved smile. \"Where did you go? I was worried somebody had taken off with you.\" Sheila chuckled at his concern and asked. \"Where's Sarah?\" \"Chad and Cindy took her and Melinda to the Carousel.\" Derek replied. Then slipping an arm around her waist he commented softly. \"I thought maybe we'd steal ourselves away to the Ferris wheel for a romantic ride while they're gone.\" \"Sounds wonderful.\" His wife sighed as she leaned back against him. \"When are we supposed to meet them?\" \"In thirty minutes at the van.\" He told her as he kissed the side of her head lovingly. \"So we don't have much time.\" \"Let's go then.\" Looking at Josie she asked. \"You guys want to come to the Ferris wheel with us?\" Josie gave Sam a mischievous smile as she replied. \"We'd love to.\" Then looking at Rob and Aldys she asked. \"You guys coming too?\" Aldys shook her head sadly and said. \"I have to get home. Dad told me to be home by eleven.\" Glancing at her watch she said. \"It's already after ten and it's a good half hour drive home.\" \"You going to come and watch us practice tomorrow?\" Josie asked curiously. \"I wouldn't miss it.\" She assured her friend. Then giving Josie a mischievous wink she added. \"I'll even work on that victory cheer. Maybe Anita can give me some ideas.\" Josie laughed knowingly. \"You be careful of some of Anita's ideas. She might get you in trouble.\" \"I'll remember that.\" The younger girl acknowledged as she gave Josie a hug. \"See you tomorrow.\" Sam and Josie waved as the young pair moved on. \"They make a cute couple.\" Sheila remarked as she watched them go. \"Have they been dating long?\" \"No.\" Josie replied with a smile. \"I'm not ever sure if they're really on a date or not. It kind of looked like it, but I never expected that Rob would actually date someone like Aldys.\" \"Why not?\" Sheila asked in surprise. \"What's wrong with Aldys? She seems like a very nice girl.\" \"She is.\" Josie quickly agreed. \"And that's just it. You know how Rob was very popular in school where as I wasn't.\" When Sheila nodded she continued. \"Well, Aldys is like me. She's the leader of a math group called the Denominators. She's a very nice and outgoing person and she's shunned by the popular crowd.\" \"Being accepted by the popular crowd isn't all it's cracked up to be.\" Sheila commented matter-of-factly. \"Most of them are real jerks.\" \"Yeah, some of them are.\" Josie agreed, but then remembering what Guy had said earlier that day she added. \"But some of them aren't so bad.\" \"Could be.\" Her friend commented with a shrug. \"But all I know is that we had some real big losers in our High School and it wasn't the ones that the 'popular' kids labeled losers.\" \"I agree.\" Josie nodded. Then changing the subject she looked at Derek and asked curiously. \"So how did you two meet?\" \"I'm sorry.\" Sheila suddenly apologized with a slight flush. \"Where are my manners? Josie, Sam I'd like you to meet my husband Dr. Derek Clarke. Derek this is my best friend from High School, Josie Geller and her boyfriend, Sam Coulson.\" \"It's nice to meet you both.\" Derek acknowledged, shaking both their hands warmly. Looking at Josie he remarked. \"I remember Sheila talking about you a lot when we first met. Its nice to finally meet you.\" \"Its nice to meet you too.\" Josie returned. Then repeating her earlier question she asked. \"So how did you two meet?\" Slipping an arm through Josie's Sheila encouraged. \"Come with us to the Ferris wheel and I'll fill you in on everything.\" \"It's a deal.\" Josie accepted with a warm smile. As the two couples winded their way through the crowd Sheila filled her friend in on the last eight years of her life while the two men chatted easily among themselves. She and Derek had met her first week at NYU. He was pre-med and had been studying there for three years already. They started dating a few weeks later and were married the following summer. \"I tried calling you to invite you to the wedding.\" Sheila told her friend. \"I wanted you to be my maid of honor.\" \"Really?\" Josie questioned in surprise. Sheila nodded. \"I really wanted you to be there, but I couldn't get a hold of you. I must have left called about a dozen times a day, but you never seemed to be there.\" Josie was surprised at her persistence. \"I thought you'd be glad to get away from me when we graduated from High School.\" Lowering her voice so Derek wouldn't hear she added. \"Especially after what happened Prom night.\" It was Sheila's turn to be surprised. \"Why would I want to have nothing to do with you because of that?\" \"Because Billy Prince humiliated me more than I've ever been humiliated in my life.\" Josie replied, tears forming in her eyes at the memory of it. Brushing them away she added. \"I thought you'd be too embarrassed to be seen with me after Billy bragged to everyone about what he'd done to me.\" Sheila looked at her in shock. \"Josie, I wanted nothing more than to scratch his eyes out! I swear to you that if Rob hadn't have beat him up I would have seriously considered doing something drastic myself.\" When Josie was silent for several minutes Sheila pressed gently. \"Does Sam know about what happened with Billy?\" Josie nodded her head gently. \"He knows most of it. He knows about Billy pelting me with the eggs and that Rob beat him up for it, but he doesn't know about Billy bragging about his triumph to everyone in school…\" \"At least until Rob go a hold of him.\" Her friend remarked with a broad smile. \"He didn't do too much bragging - or talking even - after that.\" \"Well, I guess it's hard to talk when you jaw's wired shut.\" Josie commented with a slight smirk. Then in a more serious tone she added. \"I also didn't tell Sam about the torturing I had to put up with until graduation.\" \"Why didn't you tell him about that?\" Sheila asked with concern. When Josie didn't respond right away she pressed gently. \"Josie?\" \"It's still a very painful issue for me.\" Josie told her softly. \"In fact until a few weeks ago it was basically a wound that's been festering for the last eight years. Thanks to the events of the last few months I'm finally able to start healing the wound. But it's going to be a slow process. I hadn't talked about what happened with anyone except Rob until I met Sam. He's the one that started the healing process.\" \"He seems like a great guy.\" Sheila commented as they reached the Ferris wheel. \"You're going to have to tell me how you two met. Maybe we can get together for lunch sometime this week.\" \"I'd like that.\" Josie told her honestly, giving her friend a warm smile. \"I've really missed you, and funny enough lately I've been contemplating trying to find you.\" \"What made you decide to do that after eight years?\" Sheila's tone was more curious than condemning. \"Well, last weekend Sam introduced me to his best friend who he's know since they were in grade one.\" Josie explained. \"They've been best friends since they were six and their relationship has stood many different tests. It got me thinking about how much I wished you and I were still friends.\" Sheila reached over and pulled her into a warm embrace. \"We'll always be friends, Josie.\" She assured her. \"Now that we've found each other, let's make sure we never let ourselves drift apart again.\" \"I'd like that.\" Josie told her honestly, hugging her old friend tightly to her. \"I'm sorry to interrupt this little reunion.\" Derek's voice suddenly commented as he came up behind the two young women. \"But as much as I like Sam, he's not really my partner of choice for this ride.\" Looking at Sam he grinned teasingly. \"No offense, Sam.\" \"No offense taken, Derek.\" Sam quickly assured him. \"In fact, the feeling is quite mutual.\" \"Good.\" The other man nodded. Then turning to Josie he offered her his arm and teased. \"Shall we?\" \"Hey!\" Sam exclaimed in mock indignation before Josie could reply. \"That's my girl! Get your own.\" \"Oh, man!\" Derek exclaimed, shaking his head in mock disbelief. Looking at Josie he teased. \"You'd better watch this fellow, Josie. He's awfully possessive.\" Josie looked at Sam and smiled in amusement. \"Yeah, but that's one of the things I love about him.\" \"Girl have you got it bad!\" Sheila teased as she accepted the hand Derek held out to her and followed him towards the ride. The four of them chuckled as they surrendered their tickets to the carnie and climbed on the ride. \"Whoa!\" Sam exclaimed when the ride started to move. Josie giggled slightly and asked. \"Want me to hang on to you so you don't go plunging head first into the crowd?\" \"How about I hang onto you?\" Sam remarked as he slipped his arms around her and pulled her close. Burying his face in her hair he sighed contentedly. \"Now this is the way to ride the Ferris wheel.\" Josie smiled and closed her eyes as she relished the feeling of Sam's arms around her mixed with the sensations from the ride. At that moment, nothing could feel any better.[Chapter 9] It was well after one o'clock in the morning when Sam got home from his first date with Josie. It had been a wonderful evening. Far better than any date he'd ever been on with Lara. They'd both enjoyed everything that had happened, there was no whining or complaining about anything and the evening didn't end with a fight. No, Sam had to admit that this is what he'd always expected dating would be like - fun, relaxing and peaceful. Not World War I, World War II and the Cold War all wrapped into one evening. As he dropped his keys on the coffee table Sam noted that the light was blinking on his answering machine. Hitting the message button he sank down into his favorite recliner and leaned back. \"You have four new messages.\" The machine told him before playing them one by one. \"Hey Sam, it's Jon!\" Sam smiled at the sound of his best friend's voice. \"I see you finally got your machine hooked up. I've been trying to reach you since Wednesday when I got your message with your new number. Joanna and I were hoping that you and Josie would be available to come for supper Saturday night. Nothing fancy, just a barbecue and maybe a movie or something. Let us know if you can make it, okay? I'm assuming since we haven't heard from you in the past few days that you and Josie are enjoying a lot of each other's company. Just don't forget about your old pals there buddy. Especially now that you have a girlfriend that we'd like to get to know better. Call me.\" Sam made a mental note to call Jonathan first thing in the morning after checking with Josie to see if she was available to go there for supper. The next message was from his mother. \"Hi sweetheart.\" She greeted warmly. \"Just calling to see how the new apartment's going. Getting settled in okay? I just had an interesting conversation with your sister. She told me that you've made some major changes in your life and she wasn't talking about your move. From Abby's description she sounds wonderful Sam. I'm dying to meet her. Are you planning on bringing her to Wisconsin when you come next month? Make sure you call us and fill us in. I'm eager to hear more about this wonderful new girl of yours. Love you.\" The next one was from Rob. His greeting caused Sam to laugh out loud. \"Hey Samster! Just calling to see if you'd be interested in coming down to the ball park and tossing the ball around for a bit. Thought it might be nice to get in a bit of practice before tomorrow. I tried asking Josie, but she wasn't having any of it. Woman, sheesh! They don't realize the importance of keeping your baseball skills sharp. Let me know if you're available and interested in coming. You can bring my sister too if you want to, though I have a feeling that she's getting a bit annoyed with me. You know the number. Later.\" Sam chuckled as a click signaled the end of the message. \"That guy has definitely got to find some new hobbies!\" The next message caused the hairs on the back of Sam's neck to stand on edge. \"Sam, it's Josie.\" He could hear the near hysteria in her voice. \"There's been an accident. Please call me as soon as you get this message. It's about ten after one.\" Grabbing up the phone Sam quickly punched in her number. Josie answered on the first ring. \"Hello?\" Her tone gave away that she was crying. \"What's happened?\" He demanded, his heart jumping into his throat as a thousand scenarios passed through his head. \"Anita's been in an accident.\" Josie told him tearfully. \"A car ran a red light and hit here while she and Gus were crossing at an intersection. She's been rushed to the hospital. Gus just called and begged me to get down there as soon as I can. He sounds pretty upset.\" \"I'll be there in ten minutes.\" He told her without waiting for her to ask him to come. \"I'll meet you out front.\" Sam heard her say before they hung up. As he grabbed his keys and rushed out the door he said a silent prayer that Anita would be all right. Josie raced down the hallway of Chicago Mercy hospital with Sam hot on her heels. Rounding a corner she found Gus sitting dejectedly in a chair, his face buried in his hands. \"Gus!\" Josie cried and headed for her distraught boss and friend. Gus looked up, visibly relieved to see her. Rising to his feet he completely surprised Josie by wrapping his arms around her and pulling her close. \"Thank goodness you're here.\" He whispered emotionally into her hair. Josie didn't say anything for several minutes, she just hugged the upset man that clung to her, rubbing her hands up and down his back in an attempt to comfort him. After a while Gus finally pulled back, embarrassment written on his face. Stepping back a couple of small steps he cleared hi throat and gruffly said. \"Thanks for coming, Geller.\" Nodding at Sam he added. \"You too, Sam.\" \"It's no problem, Gus.\" Sam assured him sincerely. \"Gus, what happened?\" Josie asked anxiously. Gus closed his eyes as he tried to fight back the tears that wanted to fall. Without a word Josie took his arm and lead him back to the chair that he'd just vacated. She and Sam took the ones on either side of him. \"We were on our way home from the movies.\" He began to explain. \"We'd just been to see this chick flick, Notting Hill and Anita was feeling all happy and excited because she really enjoyed the story. Anyway, we were crossing at a crosswalk to go to this little coffee shop across the way that she'd been telling me about. She was walking backwards ahead of me chattering away, laughing like an excited school girl.\" His smile faded and his eyes darkened as he continued. \"I never even saw the car coming. One lane of traffic stopped for the flashing crossing lights, but the second one didn't. A car raced through the crosswalk, its bumper catching Anita in the side and tossing her back towards me. It all happened so fast, but I was able to react fast enough to catch her and cushion her fall. She was pretty banged up. The driver of the front car in the other lane called 9-1-1 and said that he'd talk to the police so I could go to the hospital with Anita.\" Josie was shocked when tears started running down the face of her normally gruff boss. The look in his eyes was enough to break her heart. \"I was never so scared in my life.\" He admitted honestly. \"She looked so pale and fragile lying there on that stretcher. I found myself holding my breath hoping to hear hers.\" The fear rose in his expression. \"What if she doesn't make it? What if she dies without knowing how much she means to me?\" Looking the younger woman in the eye he confessed seriously. \"I love her, Josie. I love her more than I have ever loved anyone. Actually, I've never felt anything close to this for anyone else. There's something about her being a part of my life that makes it complete. I can't explain it…\" He looked at her hopefully. \"Do you know what I mean?\" Josie looked past Gus to smile at Sam. \"I know exactly what you mean.\" Gus glanced from one to the other and nodded his head before dropping his face tiredly in his hands. \"Excuse me.\" A strange voice suddenly said, interrupting the trio. They looked up into the sympathetic looking face of a blond haired man. His expression was mirrored on the face of his dark-haired companion. \"We're sorry to bother you, but we're looking for a Mr. Augustus Strauss.\" The owner of the name looked up at the blond man wearily. \"I'm Gus Strauss.\" \"Mr. Strauss, my name is Detective Ray Kowalski, Chicago Police Department.\" The blond man introduced himself, then gesturing to his companion he added. \"And this is my partner, Constable Benton Fraser of the RCMP.\" Gus frowned slightly. \"A Mountie?\" \"That's right.\" Constable Fraser acknowledged with a smile. \"I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father and for reasons that don't need exploring at this juncture I have remained here attached as liaison with the Canadian Consulate.\" Gus' frown deepened as he glanced at Detective Kowalski. \"This guy for real?\" \"Very much so.\" The Detective confirmed with a slightly amused look at his partner. Then turning his attention back to Gus he asked. \"What can you tell us about what happened tonight?\" Gus swallowed emotionally as he once again mentally replayed the events of the past few hours. \"Anita and I had just left the Movie Theater and were crossing the street at the crosswalk when a car failed to yield the flashing lights and sped through the intersection. He hit Anita and kept on going.\" \"Did you get a look at the driver or the car?\" The CPD officer pressed eagerly. \"Did you happened to get the license plate number?\" The older man shook his head. \"It all happened so fast. I was more concerned about Anita then the car.\" \"That's certainly understandable, sir.\" Constable Fraser commented sympathetically. \"But is there anything about the car that you can remember that may help us track down Miss Brandt's assailant?\" Gus started to shake his head than stopped. \"There was some kind of design on the passenger door of the car.\" 'What kind of design?\" Ray asked curiously. \"I didn't really notice.\" Gus admitted honestly. \"I just remember it shining as it passed the street lights.\" He sighed in frustration. \"I wish I could help you more.\" \"If you remember anything else please call me at this number.\" The Detective handed Gus his business card. Gus accepted the card and nodded. \"Do you have any leads on who may have hit Anita?\" Sam asked anxiously, looking from one officer to the other. \"Nothing solid yet.\" The blond detective told him honestly. \"Theo Winchester, the guy that called 9-1-1, gave us a better description of the car. He also mentioned the design on the door and he managed to get part of the license number, but its too soon to have anything solid. We'll keep you posted.\" \"I'd appreciate that.\" Gus gave him an appreciative look. \"Detective, Constable.\" The two officers turned at the sound of their titles to find Lieutenant Harding Welsh coming down the hall. \"Lieutenant?\" Ray Kowalski questioned in surprise at the sight of his boss approaching. \"Any news yet, Detective?\" The older man asked curiously. \"Nothing yet, sir.\" The Detective informed him. \"Francesca get anything on that license plate number?\" \"Not yet.\" Harding replied. \"She said she'd call when she found something.\" Turning from the two officers he surprised them as well as Sam and Josie when he put a comforting hand on Gus' shoulder and asked gently. \"How you holding up, Gus?\" \"I've been better, Harding.\" Gus told the other man with a sigh. \"Well, don't worry about anything except Anita.\" His friend said, giving the other man's shoulder a squeeze. \"I've got two of my best men on this.\" He glanced at Ray and Fraser proudly. Gus followed his gaze. \"We'll nail the scumbag who's responsible.\" \"I appreciate that, Harding. And I can't tell you how much I appreciate you coming down here.\" The normally gruff editor told his friend sincerely. \"My pleasure.\" The gruff police Lieutenant assured him, giving his shoulder another squeeze. \"Wait a minute!\" Ray Kowalski suddenly exclaimed in confusion. \"How do you two know each other?\" \"We played baseball together in High School.\" Harding told his Detective proudly. \"Gus was the star player our Senior Year.\" \"And Harding was my best friend.\" Gus added. \"You never told us that!\" Josie exclaimed in amazement. \"Rob would be all over you if he knew.\" \"That's exactly why I didn't say anything.\" Gus told her pointedly. \"I didn't want that over eager brother of yours to drive me crazy!\" \"Guy a baseball nut?\" Harding asked knowingly. The trio rolled their eyes simultaneously. \"Nut is an understatement.\" Josie exclaimed with evident exasperation. \"When it comes to baseball, my brother is certifiably insane!\" \"Each of us have our little habits or hobbies that make others think that about another.\" Harding commented, looking at his two officers knowingly. \"Hey, I resent that!\" Ray exclaimed, pretending to be insulted by the jab. Looking at his partner he asked. \"Don't you resent that, Frase?\" Fraser rubbed his earlobe thoughtfully for a moment. \"Well, you know Ray, the Leftenant does have a point. A lot of times we judge other people by their habits or hobbies.\" \"Yeah, like everyone thinking you're a freak because you go around in that bright red jacket and taste everything you find off the ground.\" The blond detective commented. \"Come on, Ray.\" His partner denied, a trifle defensively. \"I don't tasted everything I find on the ground.\" The after a brief pause he added. \"Besides, you're not without your notable habits.\" \"Save it.\" Ray suddenly snapped. \"I'm not in the mood to hear yet another lecture on my eating habits, okay!\" \"Understood!\" The Mountie nodded slightly. There was a slight pause before the detective asked, all traces of annoyance and anger gone from his voice. \"You wanna get something to eat?\" \"It's three o'clock in the morning, Ray.\" Fraser commented, glancing at his watch. \"So, what?\" Ray shrugged his shoulders slightly. \"I'm hungry and I always sleep better on a full stomach.\" \"Actually Ray, scientists have shown…\" \"Fraser!\" The blond man's irritated voice stopped the Mountie short. \"I told you I don't want to hear another lecture on my eating habits. Do you want something to eat - yes or no?\" \"Well, now that you mention it, I could go for a hot drink.\" Fraser accepted. \"Great, let's grab something before I drop you off at the Consulate.\" Ray commented cheerily. \"I know this all night dinner near there.\" Looking at the other he said to Gus. \"We'll keep you informed of any leads.\" Then glancing at Welsh he added. \"See you in the morning, Lieutenant.\" \"It's already morning, Detective.\" The Lieutenant informed him gruffly. \"I don't want to see your skinny butt before noon. That's an order.\" Looking at Fraser he added. \"Make sure he follows it, Constable.\" \"Understood.\" The Canadian acknowledged with a nod. \"Goodnight, Leftenant, Mr. Strauss.\" Then turning to his partner he prompted. \"Ray?\" Ray nodded and echoed his friend's goodnights. As the pair walked down the hall Gus couldn't help but chuckle slightly. \"So that's the infamous duo you keep telling me about, Harding.\" Shaking his head slightly he added. \"No wonder you keep complaining about them. They certainly are the most annoying pair.\" \"They are.\" Harding Welsh agreed with a smile. \"But they are also two of the finest police officers I have ever had the privilege of working with.\" \"They don't seem to like each other very much.\" Sam observed seriously. \"I wonder how they get any work done with all the fighting that they do.\" \"Don't let appearances deceive you, son.\" Harding told the young man, traces of amusement on his face. \"Those two are best friends and as thick as any two fleshly brothers could be. You say anything against either one and you'd better be ready to answer to the other.\" Sam shook his head slightly. \"You'd never know it by looking at them.\" \"Trust me.\" Welsh assured him with a smile. \"After listening to them for two years you get to recognize when they're just talking and when they're really at each other's throats.\" \"So how did those two get teamed up together?\" Josie asked curious to learn more about the unlikely pair. Before the police Lieutenant could answer a woman in green surgical scrubs appeared in the waiting area. \"Are you here for Anita Brandt?\" She asked the quartet eagerly. \"That's right, doctor.\" Gus acknowledged as he rose to his feet. \"I'm her boss, Gus Strauss.\" Noting the way Josie's eyebrows raised slightly at him he cleared his throat nervously and added. \"I'm also her boyfriend.\" If the doctor noticed his hesitation she didn't comment on it. \"I'm Dr. Margaret Smith.\" She introduced. \"Ms. Brandt is in recovery.\" \"How is she?\" Josie asked anxiously, gripping Sam's hand tightly for reassurance. \"She's sustained severe trauma to her left side.\" The doctor told her. \"She has three broken ribs and her left leg was fractured in two places. Fortunately she received no trauma to the head and no major organs were damaged. There was some internal bleeding, but we were able to stop it.\" \"So she'll recover?\" Sam pressed noting that both Josie and Gus looked too choked to speak. Dr. Smith nodded. \"Yes, she'll make a full recovery. Though it will probably be a very slow one. She'll have to keep still to give her ribs time to mend and she'll probably have to have some physical therapy once her leg has healed, but she's strong and healthy…\" \"And stubborn.\" Gus added seriously causing Josie to smile knowingly. \"She is that.\" Anita's best friend confirmed to Sam and Harding. \"Can I see her?\" Gus asked anxiously. \"She's in recovery right now.\" The doctor told him. \"But once we move her you can see her.\" \"Thank you, Doctor.\" Gus shook her hand and gave her a relieved smile. \"You're welcome.\" She smiled back, but then remarked. \"Things aren't over yet though. Anita still has a long way to go and she's going to need a lot of help and support from her family and friends.\" \"You can count on us, Doctor.\" Josie assured her firmly. \"I'm sure she'll be glad to hear that.\" The surgeon commented with a smile. Then looking at Gus she said. \"I'll let you know when you can see her.\" \"Thank you.\" He acknowledged. As the Medical doctor left the waiting area Gus turned to Josie and surprised her greatly by pulling her to him for a happy embrace. \"She's going to be okay, Josie!\" He exclaimed eagerly as Josie giggled slightly, nerves and tension making her giddy. \"She's going to be okay!\" After a moment he pulled back and looked at Josie a very determined expression in his eyes. \"What is it, Gus?\" Josie asked anxiously. \"I've decided that when Anita wakes up I'm going to tell her how I feel.\" Gus announced firmly. \"I'm going to tell her that I love her!\" It was late the next afternoon before Anita woke with any sort of alertness. She'd regained consciousness periodically throughout the day, but each time had been brief and she'd been confused. She hadn't even realized that Gus had sat protectively by her side the entire time, her left hand kept securely clasped in both of his. \"Anita?\" The sound of her name caused Anita to turn her head towards the sound of the gentle voice. Seeing Gus sitting beside her, peering at her through the bed rail Anita smiled. \"Hi.\" She breathed softly. Then with a teasing grin added. \"You look terrible.\" Unable to help himself Gus chuckled slightly. \"You should talk.\" Then surprising both of them he suddenly rose to his feet and leaned over the bed rail to kiss her tenderly on the lips. Anita smiled against his mouth and carefully lifted a hand to tangle her fingers in his curly hair, pulling him closer. Several moments later Gus pulled away just enough to look into her face. Reaching down to run a tender hand along her cheek he finally said the words that Anita had been longing to hear. \"I love you, Anita Brandt.\" Tears appeared in Anita's eyes as she ran her fingers through his hair again before responding. \"I love you too, Gus.\" Gus smiled broadly and leaned down to kiss her again. The sound of someone clearing their throat finally caused the two to separate. Glancing towards the door the couple found a very obviously amused Sam and Josie standing in the doorway. \"You kids better take it easy.\" Sam teased lightly. \"It's not good for the patient to get too excited.\" Josie groaned and rolled her eyes as he raised his eyebrows a couple of times at Anita, who started to laugh. \"Oh, stop that.\" She moaned as she held her side in pain. \"It hurts when I laugh.\" Sam grinned wickedly at her as he moved to her bedside on the opposite side to where Gus was standing. \"Then don't laugh.\" His eyes twinkled as he leaned down and placed a friendly kiss on her cheek. Anita slapped playfully at his arm. \"Brat!\" She exclaimed as he feigned a hurt look. When Josie leaned down to gently hug her friend Anita whispered loudly. \"You're boyfriend is a pain.\" \"I know.\" Josie agreed with a sly look at Sam. \"But you have to love him anyway.\" Anita looked thoughtful for a brief moment before saying to Sam. \"It's just a good thing that you're so cute.\" \"And generous too.\" He told her as he handed her a box of chocolates. \"Pot of Gold.\" She sighed happily. \"My favorite. You're a prince.\" \"Wow, elevated from Brat to Prince with one box of chocolates!\" Sam exclaimed jokingly. \"I wonder what she'd call me if I bought her a whole chocolate factory.\" \"God.\" She breathed in mock ecstasy. After the laughter died Gus looked at the younger couple and asked curiously. \"So how did practice go? Is everyone up to our first game?\" \"Hey, give us a break!\" Josie exclaimed with mock annoyance. This was only our first practice and our first game isn't until the middle of next month.\" Gus looked from Josie to Sam and pressed. \"How did they do, coach?\" \"Pretty well.\" Sam assured him honestly. \"There's a few bugs to work out and it'll take a few practices for everyone to get use to working together as a team, but on the whole I think we've got a pretty good team.\" \"Though Sam almost had a mutiny on his hands when Rob learned that you appointed Sam Assistant Coach.\" Josie commented with a laugh. \"I think I almost lost my boyfriend.\" \"Rob doesn't scare me.\" Sam told her confidently. \"I could take him.\" \"I don't know.\" Josie commented with a teasing smile. \"Rob can fight pretty dirty sometimes.\" \"So can I.\" He assured her. When she gave him a measuring look he exclaimed. \"Hey, I'm no push over!\" With a sly grin she turned her back on him and coyly remarked. \"We'll see.\" \"So how did you handle him?\" Gus asked Sam curiously. Josie grinned back up at Sam and replied. \"He made Rob his Assistant Coach.\" Anita giggled slightly. \"That's really showing him who's boss.\" \"Well, hey.\" Sam shrugged good-naturedly and wrapped his arms around Josie's waist, pulling her back against him. \"I am dating his sister, I have to be nice. After all he'll probably be my brother-in-law someday.\" Josie looked at Anita and blushed slightly as Sam hugged her tighter. Anita just smiled delightedly at her friend. Changing the subject Josie asked her injured friend. \"So, how are you feeling?\" \"Like I've been hit by a car.\" She replied a mildly mischievous smile on her lips. \"Other than that I'm fine.\" Giving Gus' hand a tender squeeze she added. \"More than fine, actually.\" Josie and Sam exchanged amused looks as a red tinge stained Gus' cheeks. \"Well, we're glad to hear it.\" Josie told her friend sincerely. \"You had us so worried.\" \"Sorry.\" Anita gave her an apologetic look. \"By the time I realized that car wasn't going to stop it was too late to do anything about it.\" \"Don't be sorry, it's not your fault. We're just relieved that it wasn't more serious.\" The younger woman told her, carefully leaning down to hug her again. \"You're my best friend and I love you very much.\" \"I love you too.\" Anita replied, hugging her back. When Josie pulled away and stood back up she was surprised when Sam took her place, hugging Anita. \"I love you too, Anita.\" He told her. Anita, surprised, gave him a gentle hug and laughed nervously. When Sam pulled back just enough to see her face he winked mischievously and said. \"I was feeling left out.\" The four of them, even Gus who had been eyeing him cautiously, chuckled lightly at his comment. When he straightened back up he gave Josie a cheeky grin before glancing at his watch and urging. \"Honey, we should really get going. Jon and Joanna are expecting us at six.\" \"Okay.\" Josie nodded then reached out to squeeze her best friend's arm. \"I'll be back to see you tomorrow.\" \"I'll be here.\" Anita told her with a warm smile. \"Have fun tonight.\" \"We will.\" Josie acknowledged as she moved around the bed to where Gus was standing. Squeezing his shoulder gently she added. \"See you later, Gus.\" \"See you, Geller. Coulson.\" Gus nodded to both of them as they headed to the door. Anita watched the younger couple leave the room, a soft smile on her lips. \"In some ways I envy Josie. It's so nice to be young and in love.\" \"Yeah, I suppose it is.\" Gus agreed emotionlessly as he looked out the door that the other couple had just exited. \"Yeah, but you know, in other ways I wouldn't trade my life for anything in the world.\" \"Why's that?\" Gus asked, looking at her curiously. \"Because as sweet and nice as Sam Coulson is…\" She looked at Gus tenderly as she finished. \"…he's not you.\" Lifting a hand to touch his upper arm she added. \"I love you, Gus Strauss. I love you with all my heart.\" The smile Gus flashed her just before his lips met hers could have lit up the entire city of Chicago. Sam couldn't help but smile to himself when he glanced at the clock on the dash of his car. It was only ten minutes to six. Another two or three minutes would easily get them to Jonathan and Joanna's place. They would actually be on time, if not a few minutes early. It was such a wonderful feeling. When he and Lara were dating it have been virtually impossible to get her anywhere on time. The very concept seemed foreign to her. It was like she had this unspoken rule that she had to be at least twenty minutes late for everything. And the harder you tried to get her somewhere on time, the deeper she'd dig in her heels and the later you'd end up being. It drove Sam and his friends' nuts but they were powerless to stop it. Once they had tried tricking her by telling her an earlier time just to get her there on time, but when she'd found out what they'd done she'd given Sam such a tongue lashing in front of everyone that they never tried deceiving her like that again. Sam was greatly relieved to see that Josie wasn't like that. In fact she seemed to be very much like him in that she preferred to be early for things. \"Here we are.\" Sam announced as they pulled into the driveway of a three-story brick townhouse. Nervously Josie checked her reflection in the visor mirror. \"How do I look?\" She asked Sam anxiously as she smoothed her hair and checked her makeup. \"Honey, you look fine.\" He assured her sincerely. \"I hope so.\" She said as she closed the visor mirror and looked at him worriedly. \"I want you friends to like me.\" \"My friends already love you.\" He told her honestly. \"Really?\" She gave him a hopefully look. \"Would I ever lie to you?\" He asked her, flashing her a bright smile. A guilty look appeared on Josie's face. Reaching over to take her hand Sam kissed the back of it before addressing her thoughts. \"You did what you had to for your job. You only deceived me because you had no other choice. I've already forgiven you for that. There's no need to worry about it. We start fresh from the moment you told me the truth, okay?\" Josie nodded, too choked to speak. She still couldn't believe that this wonderful man had so easily forgiven her her lies. It seemed to be too good to be true. \"Now come on, Jonathan and Joanna think you are one of the greatest people that they have ever met and they completely agree with me in thinking that you and I are perfect for each other.\" Josie gave him a shy smile. \"You think we're perfect for each other?\" \"Completely.\" He said, leaning closer to her and looking deep into her eyes. \"Josie Geller, you are the best thing that's ever happened to me and I love you with all my heart.\" Josie felt her heart melt at his words. \"I love you too.\" She closed the gap between them and planted a tender kiss on his lips. Pulling back slightly she whispered. \"You're the best thing that ever happened to me, Sam Coulson.\" She punctuated her feelings by placing another kiss on her lips. After a few moments Sam pulled reluctantly away. \"We'd better get inside before I loose control of my senses again. Your kisses are much too tempting, Miss Geller.\" Josie blushed as she followed his lead and got out of the car. \"Sam! Josie! Glad you could make it!\" Jonathan greeted the couple warmly when he opened the front door. \"Come in. Come in. I was just getting ready to fire up the old barbecue. Hope hamburgers sound okay to everyone.\" \"That sounds fine, Jonathan.,\" Josie acknowledged when Sam looked at her for confirmation. \"I'm easy going.\" \"She is too.\" Sam confirmed happily. Jonathan gave them both a warm smile. \"I'm happy to hear it.\" Then gesturing to the doorway at the end of the hall he said. \"Jo's in the kitchen making up a pasta salad and a few other odds and ends. Why don't you join her Josie while Sam helps me fire up the grill.\" Sam looked at Josie hesitantly for a moment. \"That okay, honey?\" Josie pretended to look thoughtful for a moment. \"You got a fire extinguisher handy?\" She asked Jonathan without a trace of teasing. Surprised Jon nodded. \"Yeah, there's one in the kitchen and one in the back closet by the patio doors.\" \"In easy reach from the back yard?\" She queried. \"Yeah.\" Her host nodded, still not understanding the reason for her questions. Josie nodded, satisfied. \"Then I guess it's safe to leave you and Sam alone with the barbecue.\" She flashed Jonathan a teasing smile. Unaccustomed to being teased by his best friend's girlfriend it took Jon another moment to realize that it was all a joke. Finally realization dawned on him and he started laughing. Looking at Sam he commented delightedly. \"I'm gong to have to watch this one I think.\" Josie smiled, relieved that her small joke was well received. Looking at Sam she encouraged. \"I'll be fine. You two go out and enjoy yourself. Just try not to sacrifice dinner. I like my burgers well done, but not charcoaled.\" \"Are you sure?\" Sam pressed, wanting to make sure she was comfortable with his friends. \"Yeah, I'm sure.\" She nodded. \"I definitely don't like my burgers charcoaled!\" Grinning mischievously at him she waved her hand at him and said. \"Go on, have fun. It'll give me some time to get some more dirt on you from Joanna. She said she had plenty she would share with me.\" \"Dirt? What kind of dirt?\" He asked, pretending to be nervous. \"All the big, juicy stories that I've been saving since Grade school.\" Joanna said, appearing out of the kitchen, a dishtowel in hand. \"You know those nice embarrassing stories that a guy just loves for his girlfriend to hear.\" \"I don't remember you telling any such stories to Lara.\" Sam commented, an amused look on his face. \"That's because that kind of conversation is called 'girl talk' and Lara and I didn't do 'girl talk'.\" Joanna replied in a curt tone. \"Lara and I barely did regular talk.\" Giving Josie a warm smile she slipped an arm through Josie's and said. \"This one on the other hand looks like she would enjoy a little bit of 'girl talk'.\" Josie returned Joanna's warm smile. \"I love 'girl talk'.\" Then jerking her head towards Sam she added. \"Especially if it involves finding out some more dirt on this guy.\" \"Well then, lets get to it.\" Joanna shot Sam a mischievous grin as she said. \"We'll see you guys later.\" \" Please don't embarrass me too much, Jo.\" Sam pleaded at Joanna's retreating back. \"I hope to keep Josie around for quite a long time and I don't want you saying anything that'll make her not want that.\" As Joanna shot Sam a saucy grin Josie turned her head and mouthed to Sam: \"That'll never happen.\" Before Sam could respond they disappeared into the kitchen. \"Come on, Romeo.\" Jonathan teased as he tugged on his best friend's sleeve to get his attention. \"Let's get those burgers going.\" Sam nodded his head and followed his friend outside. Meanwhile Joanna and Josie were getting better acquainted in the kitchen. \"So, how as your first week as Sam's girlfriend?\" Joanna asked curiously as she chopped up some peppers for her pasta salad. Josie's eyes began to sparkle as she exclaimed honestly. \"It has been the most incredible week of my life. I never would have imagined it to be so, but I love Sam more now than I did this time last week. He is the most incredible man I have ever known.\" She blushed slightly at her honest admittance. Joanna smiled softly. \"You and Sam are certainly perfect for each other, Josie. I can safely say that I have never seen him happier. I want to thank you for that. Jonathan and I both feel a debt of gratitude towards you for everything you've done for Sam. We were both so scared that he'd end up marrying Lara just because he felt obligated to do so after their long history instead of ditching her for someone more suitable for him. Who knows what would have happened if you hadn't come along when you did.\" Josie hesitated for a moment before asking candidly. \"Did Sam ever mention marrying, Lara?\" Joanna shook her head. \"Never. Anytime the subject was brought up it was always Lara pushing for it. Not once did Sam ever say that he wanted to marry her. But usually whatever Lara wanted, Lara got. That's why we were so scared. We figured that if Lara pushed Sam hard enough he'd marry her just to get her to lay off. Not that that's a good reason to get married, but Sam's such an easy going guy that he doesn't like saying 'no' to anyone.\" Josie felt familiar fears well up in her mind. \"Do you think that's why he forgave me so easily? Because he couldn't not?\" Looking at Joanna fearfully she asked. \"Do you think Sam's only dating me because he feels sorry for me? Or because he thinks I expected it after I told him the truth?\" Joanna looked at the young woman before her. This morning when Sam had called Jonathan to accept the invitation he'd told them a little bit more about Josie then he'd been able to the weekend before. He hadn't gone into any specific details, but he had said that Josie's confidence in herself and in men had been shattered by something that had happened to her in High School. He'd said that she was apt to expect the worse instead of accepting that something good could ever happen to her. Joanna had scoffed slightly figuring that Sam was exaggerating things and that Josie's comments were merely from being in a new relationship. But now seeing first hand the amount of uncertainty and fear that was right now lurking in Josie's beautiful blue eyes she began to realize just how much emotional damage whatever had happened to her in High School had caused. Putting down her knife and her pepper Joanna wiped her hands on the dishtowel before moving around the counter to stand before Josie. Putting her hands on Josie's upper arms she looked Josie directly in the eye and said. \"Sam forgave you because he understood your situation and the awkward position that your boss had put you in. He's dating you because he is very clearly head over heels in love with you. I have known Sam for a lot of years and in all the years that he dated Lara I never saw him show a fraction of the affection or the love that he showers on you to her. They were barely holding hands by the end of it. It was as if he couldn't stand even touching her. But with you its like if he doesn't touch you or kiss you every five minutes he'll go crazy.\" \"Jo, Jon needs the barbecue sauce.\" Sam's voice called out as he entered the back door and came walking down the hallway. \"Speak of the devil.\" Joanna grinned mischievously at Josie before moving to the fridge to get the required condiment. \"How's it going?\" Sam asked the woman as he entered the kitchen. \"Great.\" Josie quickly assured him, Joanna's words still playing over and over again in her mind. She felt Joanna's eyes on her as Sam put his hands gently on her shoulders and gave them a tender squeeze. Bending down he whispered loud enough for Joanna to hear. \"If she starts telling you about the time Jonathan and I went in the High School beauty pageant, please do me a favor and change the subject.\" Kissing her cheek he straightened up in time to face his long time friend. \"Oh, yes. The beauty pageant.\" Joanna commented with a wicked grin. \"I'd almost forgotten about that.\" \"Let's keep it that way.\" Sam commented as he took the barbecue sauce bottle Joanna held out to him. Leaning back down to Josie he said teasingly. \"Just remember that fifty percent of what Jo says is a lie, and the other half is untrue.\" Josie chuckled slightly in amusement. \"I'll remember that.\" \"Good.\" Sam nodded before kissing her gently on the lips. \"Well, I guess I'd better go make sure that Jon hasn't charcoaled Josie's burger yet.\" He winked at he slyly before leaving the room. When Joanna heard the door to the backyard shut behind Sam she looked at Josie a trifle smugly and said. \"What did I tell you?\" Josie smiled slightly. \"I guess you're right.\" \"Of course I am.\" Jo teased as she fluffed her hair slightly. \"I'm always right. Except when I'm wrong.\" She shot her new friend a teasing look as she resumed her chopping. Josie leaned her elbow on the counter top before her and said seriously. \"I know this sounds very selfish, but I'm glad that Lara wasn't as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. Not that I'm glad about all the grief that she gave Sam, but I am glad that he broke up with her. I fell in love with Sam my first class with him three months ago and it nearly broke my heart when I met Lara that night at Delloser. I was absolutely sure then that there was absolutely no chance for me to be anything more than Sam's friend, if I was that lucky. It made me sad because I knew that I would always love him.\" \"Is that why you looked so upset when Sam saw you at Senior's Nite the next night?\" Joanna asked curiously. \"That was certainly the big reason.\" Josie told her honestly. \"Then when Sam sat with me on the Ferris Wheel I started thinking well maybe he did like me. But then he brought up Lara and my heart sunk again. I mean, I know that wasn't fair of me to think such things, especially since Sam thought I was only seventeen. But sometimes the heat doesn't always act logically.\" \"What would you have done if you'd known then that Sam was just as crazy about you as you were about him?\" The older woman asked curiously. \"I would have told him everything - story or no story.\" Josie told her without hesitation. \"That's what my mom kept telling me to do. She was convinced that he like me just from what I'd told her about him, but I refused to believe her. I didn't want to get my hopes up. After all, Sam was the first person to encourage me in my writing and show any kind of faith in my abilities so it would be far too much to believe that he'd also fall in love with me.\" \"But he did.\" Joanna remarked seriously. \"Yes he did.\" Josie nodded with a smile. \"And I pinch myself about a hundred times a day to make sure its still real.\" \"You'd better stop doing that.\" Her companion teased lightly. \"You'll turn yourself all black and blue.\" The pair chuckled then Joanna said. \"So I understand Sam's taking you to Wisconsin next month to meet his family.\" Josie nodded again, a nervous look appearing on her face. \"I guess so. He invited me to go the other day, but we didn't really discuss it until last night. Sounds like we're going the first weekend in July.\" \"You don't sound too happy about it.\" Jo observed carefully. \"Don't you want to meet Sam's family?\" \"It's not that.\" Josie quickly assured the other woman. \"I mean, I do want to meet them. If they're anything like Sam I'm sure I'll really like them. It's just…\" \"It's just what?\" Joanna pressed when the younger woman trailed off. Josie hesitated for a moment before explaining. \"What if they don't like me? What if they think I'm all wrong for Sam and they try to convince him into dumping me? I don't know what I'd do if that happened.\" Joanna gave her a warm, reassuring smile. \"Don't worry, Josie. Sam's family is going to love you. In fact they are going to be absolutely thrilled that Sam has found someone as wonderful and as sweet as you to spend the rest of his life with. Cause face it, honey, that guy is never letting you go.\" \"I hope not.\" Josie admitted seriously. \"Because I never want to be without him. In fact ever since I first met him I couldn't picture my life without him.\" \"Well, I must admit I'm glad to hear it.\" Joanna acknowledged as she finished mixing her salad. After popping it in the fridge she asked. \"What do you say we join those wonderful guys of ours outside?\" \"Sounds good.\" Josie acknowledged with a broad smile. \"Especially since the most important lesson I learned from my father and my brother is that you don't leave men alone for too long with a barbecue. Not unless you want a sacrificial offering for supper.\" \"Amen.\" Joanna agreed as she led the way out. \"So how are things going with you and Josie?\" Jonathan asked his best friend as they lounged in some lawn chairs by the barbecue. Sam's whole face lit up at the thought of his beautiful girlfriend. \"I feel like I've been in a dream this past week, Jon. I mean I never ever thought I'd ever be in a relationship with someone who actually likes the same things that I do, that would let me just be myself without constantly trying to change or improve me.\" \"Well that 's the way a true, loving relationship is suppose to be, Sam.\" Jonathan told him seriously. \"It's about give and take and compromises, not trying to mold the other person to fit your ideals.\" \"I want to marry her, Jon.\" Sam smiled when his best friend's eyebrows raised slightly in surprise. Usually whenever Lara had brought up the subject of marriage Sam would either change the subject, get very quiet or else leave the room if Lara wouldn't let up. This was the first time that Jonathan could ever remember Sam bringing the subject up on his own. It was definitely an interesting turn of events. \"It's that serious, is it?\" Jon remarked, watching his friend carefully. \"Its very serious.\" Sam acknowledged with a nod. \"Josie makes me feel complete, happy. Nobody has ever made me feel that way before. I'm going to ask her to marry me.\" \"Don't you think you're taking things a little bit fast here, Sam?\" His friend commented with obvious concern. \"I mean you and Josie have only been seeing each other for a week. And it was only a week before that that you broke up with Lara the Hun. Don't you think you should take these things a little slower? I mean you have the rest of your lives ahead of you.\" \"I know that.\" Sam acknowledged with a serious look on his face. \"But you never know what the future holds.\" \"What do you mean?\" The other man asked in confusion. \"I told you about how Josie's best friend, Anita landed in the hospital, right?\" \"The one that got hit by the car?\" Jonathan replied. At Sam's confirming nod he asked. \"How is she?\" \"She'll be fine.\" Sam assured him. \"But she gave us all a very bad scare. And last night when Josie and I were sitting in the waiting room with Anita's boyfriend, Gus - who also happens to be Anita and Josie's boss - all I could think was what would I do if anything ever happened to Josie?\" Looking at his best friend seriously he continued. \"To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do. We may have only started dating a week ago, but Josie has been an important part of my life since I first met her in March. She's so much a part of me now Jon that I don't want to ever be without her. I love her more than I ever loved Lara, even in the beginning and I want to marry her. I plan on asking her before the summer's over.\" \"Does Josie know how you feel?\" Jon pressed curiously. \"Does she know you're planning on proposing to her?\" \"I think she has a pretty good idea.\" Josie's boyfriend commented with a light chuckle. \"Especially since I told her that I'd be asking her to marry me the night I asked her if she'd be my girlfriend.\" \"Boy, you don't waste anytime, do you?\" His friend teased. \"What did she say?\" \"She seemed pleased by the thought.\" Sam said. \"I did tell her that I would wait for a while since this is her first relationship and I want her to enjoy it without the pressures of planning a wedding. But I don't know how much longer I can wait. I want everyone to know that she's mine and only mine.\" Jonathan laughed in amusement at his friend's eager expression. \"She still is yours, Sam. She's your girlfriend.\" \"I know.\" Sam acknowledged with a smile. \"But I want it to be more definite than that. More lasting. Like I told Josie the other day, I'm not interested in a short time, I want a lifetime.\" Looking at his friend he asked. \"Think next week's too soon to ask her?\" \"Maybe a little.\" Jon laughed with amusement. \"I'd wait a few more weeks if you can.\" \"I'll try.\" Sam said with a dramatic sigh. \"But it won't be easy.\" \"What won't be easy?\" Josie's voice asked as she came up behind him and put her hands on his shoulders. Joanna collapsed into the empty lawn chair beside Jonathan. \"Fighting the urge to run off with you and elope.\" He teased as he tilted his head back so he could look up at her. \"Oh.\" Josie blushed slightly at his response. \"Here, have a seat.\" Sam encouraged as he patted his knee invitingly. Josie hesitated, glancing shyly at Jon and Jo who were watching them with open interest. \"It's okay, I won't bit.\" He promised her. Josie giggled slightly. \"Okay.\" Slowly she came around him and stood uncertainly in front of him. \"Come here.\" He took her hand and tugged on it gently, urging her to sit down. Nervously Josie obliged, gently settling herself on his lap. Sam wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close. \"See, nothing to it.\" Josie smiled at him, her cheeks rosy with embarrassment. \"So what movie are we watching tonight?\" Sam asked, trying to help alleviate Josie's discomfort. \"I got Ever After .\" Joanna told him. \"It's a really good sappy chick flick.\" \"Good.\" Sam acknowledged with a smile. \"I'm in the mood for a good romance.\" \" Ever After .\" Josie repeated. \"Is that the Cinderella-type story with Drew Barrymore and Angelica Houston?\" \"That's it.\" Joanna confirmed. \"Have you seen it?\" Josie nodded. \"Anita and I went and saw it at the theater when it first came out. That is a wonderful movie. I really like Drew Barrymore. I think she's a really good actress.\" \"She's the one that played the little girl in ET , right?\" Jonathan asked curiously. \"Yeah, that's her.\" Josie nodded. \"My dad use to tell me that I looked just like her when I was little. I use to say that explains why Rob was the way he was. He'd spent too much time playing with aliens when he was a child.\" \"Do you mind watching Ever After again?\" Sam asked. \"Of course not.\" She assured him. \"In fact Anita and I loved it so much we went and saw it three times when it was in the theaters. I didn't realize that it was out on video already or I probably would have gotten a copy.\" \"It came out in March I think.\" Joanna told her. \"Somewhere around there anyway.\" \"Well that would explain it.\" Josie commented. \"I haven't had a chance to rent any videos since I started my undercover assignment in March. This will be a nice treat.\" \"What kind of movies do you like?\" Joanna asked Josie inquiringly. \"I like a good love story.\" Josie told them then admitted honestly. \"They use to make me sad though.\" \"Why?\" Joanna asked curiously, noting the mixture of emotions that played across her friend's face. Looking at Sam Josie replied. \"Because I never thought I'd ever find my own guy to live happily ever after with. I've watched all these movies about true love and love conquering all, but I was sure I'd never find it myself. I'm so glad that I was wrong.\" \"So am I.\" Sam said sincerely as he leaned up to kiss her tenderly. \"You know your story would make a good movie.\" Joanna commented with a teasing grin. \"Come on.\" Sam exclaimed to his friend, knowing that she was teasing. \"No, Jo's right.\" Jonathan eagerly piped up. \"It's got everything a good love story should have: two love starved people looking for that special someone but when they meet all kinds of trials seem to be preventing them from getting together.\" \"Hey, we could call it Never Been Kissed .\" Sam gave Josie a mischievous look. Her only response was to slap him playfully on the chest. \"Maybe we could even convince Drew Barrymore to play Josie.\" Jonathan commented with a laugh. Then giving her a playful wink he added. \"Of course Brad Pitt would play me.\" \"You're not that good-looking.\" His wife retorted with mock seriousness. \"In fact I think you'd be better played by Michael Dorn.\" When Jonathan favored her with a frown she laughed and added. \"Especially when you look like that.\" \"Are you so delicately trying to tell me that I look like a Klingon?\" He asked her in a mock huffy voice. \"If the ridges fit...\" She replied giving him a wicked grin. \"A Klingon?\" Josie queried, a thoughtful look on her face. Sam, mistaking the reason for her expression, hastened to explain. \"Klingons are a fictious alien race from the Star Trek series.\" \"I know.\" Josie assured him with a small smile. \"But I don't think Jonathan would make a very good Klingon. I don't believe he's fierce or blood thirsty enough. No, I think he'd be more like a Telaxian. After all, Neelix was always very genial.\" Giving Jon a mischievous look she added. \"Maybe we could get Ethan Philips to play you in Never Been Kissed .\" \"Hardy har har.\" Jonathan laughed sarcastically. \"Oh, you're so funny, you are.\" \"I try.\" Josie returned, pretending to take his words as a compliment. Noting that Sam was looking at her funny she asked curiously. \"What's the matter?\" \"Nothing's the matter.\" He assured her with a warm smile. \"I'm just surprised, is all. I can't believe you like Star Trek .\" Josie shrugged slightly. \"I grew up on reruns of TOS . When I was in High School Sheila got me hooked on TNG and then when DS9 and Voyager came out I started watching them too. Though I have to admit, I don't care much for DS9 , but I like all the others. I've even seen all the Star Trek movies.\" Sam looked at Jon and grinned in delight. \"She even knows all the acronyms.\" \"Are you a Star Trek fan?\" Josie asked Sam, figuring he must be from his reaction to finding out that she liked it. Joanna rolled her eyes and said. \"These two are Star Trek fans the same way that I get the impression that your brother is a baseball fan.\" \"Oh no.\" Josie groaned in mock horror. \"They're not that bad, are they?\" \"Have you seen our Rec. room?\" Joanna asked gesturing towards the house. Immediately she realized that she hadn't. \"They have got more books and action figures and Star Trek memorabilia then most women have pairs of shoes.\" \"That is bad.\" Josie acknowledged with a laugh. Then looking at Sam she remarked. \"How come I didn't see any of your Star Trek stuff when we packed up your apartment?\" Giving him a teasing glance she asked. \"Did you pack it up yourself to make sure none of it got lost or broken?\" \"That's exactly what I did.\" He confirmed, a serious expression on his face. \"But I did that over a year ago.\" At Josie's curious expression he explained. \"After Lara got rid of my autographed Gordie Howe helmet I decided that I'd better do something about the rest of my prized possessions before she decided to get rid of them too. So, I packed up anything I treasured that could easily be carted away and brought it over here for safe storage until a time that I dared bring it out again.\" \"I think that time may have come, Sam.\" Jon commented seriously, glancing pointedly at Josie. Sam gave Josie a thoughtful look. \"Yeah, it may have.\" Bouncing her slightly with his knee he asked. \"What would you think about my bringing my Star Trek memorabilia and a few other of my sentimental keepsakes out of storage?\" Josie shrugged slightly. \"They're your keepsakes. You should be able to do whatever you want with them.\" \"But do you think that you'd be able to live in an apartment with a variety of Star Trek memorabilia scattered throughout it?\" He asked seriously, watching her reaction carefully. \"As long as it's tastefully scattered.\" She told him honestly. \"And not overdone so as to look gaudy.\" \"Well than, how about I let you do the scattering.\" He commented eagerly, giving her a warm smile. \"That way it will be tastefully done to your liking.\" \"How about we do it together.\" She suggested with a smile. \"That way it'll be tastefully done to both our liking.\" Sam's smile broadened at her suggestion. \"I'd like that.\" Leaning forward he gave her a tender kiss on the lips. Pulling away slightly he whispered softly, his eyes full of love. \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" She asked in surprise as he reached up to caress her face. \"For being you.\" He told her simply, his thumb stroking her cheek. \"I love you.\" \"I love you, too.\" She whispered back and leaned in for another kiss. Jonathan and Joanna watched the kissing couple for several moments before looking at each other and smiling with obvious delight, their hearts full of happiness for their friend and his new love.[Chapter 10] \"Well, you're looking pretty chipper this afternoon.\" Josie commented to Anita the following Sunday as she entered her friend's hospital room, a large box of chocolates in her hand. \"Meet some cute doctor that asked you to run away with him?\" \"No!\" Anita exclaimed in mock indignation. \"I'm not looking anymore. I'm already taken!\" Josie smiled slightly at her best friend's comment. She was still finding it hard to believe that her spunky, outgoing best friend and their gruff, usually caustic sounding boss were actually dating and in love. The two of them seemed so different. But it wasn't hard to see that there was some kind of deep connection there. And it seemed to be growing and strengthening by the day. \"The reason I'm so happy is that I get to go home tomorrow.\" \"That's wonderful!\" Josie acknowledged eagerly as she sat down on the edge of Anita's bed. \"I'm sure you'll be glad to get out of here.\" \"You'd better believe it!\" The patient replied earnestly. \"I swear too many more hospital meals and I was seriously considering becoming an anorexic.\" \"Not a good idea.\" Josie commented with a smile. \"I don't think Gus would like to see you shrink away to nothing. Besides, if you were anorexic you couldn't enjoy these chocolates.\" She waved the box she held under her friend's nose temptingly. \"Give me those!\" Anita grabbed the box from the other girl's hand and quickly tore off the cellophane. Opening the lid she inhaled deeply and sighed. \"This is heaven!\" Taking one of the delectable sweets out of the box she offered one to Josie. Josie accepted and bit into the treat. Closing her eyes she to sighed in delight and said. \"This is heaven!\" Anita chuckled and then asked curiously. \"So where's that guy of yours today? I thought you two were virtually joined at the hip now.\" \"We basically have been.\" Josie admitted with a blush. \"But today he's correcting exam papers.\" \"Oh, lucky him.\" Her friend grinned slightly. That sounds like such a fun chore! I'm so glad that I'm not a school teacher.\" \"Normally Sam loves it.\" Josie told her honestly. \"He says he gets a certain sense of satisfaction from seeing how much he's taught them over the semester.\" A mischievous smirk tugged at Anita's lips. \" Normally he enjoys it? He's not enjoying it this time?\" Josie flushed slightly as she replied. \"He said that right now he doesn't enjoy anything that keeps him from spending time with me.\" \"That boy's got it bad!\" Anita commented with a chuckle. Then with a decided nod she added. \"I'll bet you fifty bucks that he proposes to you before summer's over.\" \"I'm not going to take that bet.\" Josie told her seriously. \"Why not?\" Her friend gave her a curious look. The younger woman smiled widely and admitted. \"Because I seriously hope you're right.\" \"I can almost guarantee it.\" The older woman assured her confidently. Then remembering something she asked. \"Did you get ahold of that guy that responded to your ad?\" \"Yes I did.\" Josie nodded her head in confirmation. \"He does have an autographed Gordie Howe helmet, but not the one that I'm looking for.\" Anita frowned slightly and prompted. \"What one are you looking for?\" \"Sam's.\" Josie told her simply. Anita looked at her as if she'd lost her mind. \"How on earth do you expect to find Sam's helmet?\" \"Joanna told me that when get first got it he put his name on the inside lining of the helmet so that no one would steal it on him.\" Josie related. \"I know it's a long shot, but I'm hoping it'll still be out there somewhere.\" \"And if I'm not mistaken, doing something like that greatly diminishes the value of such an item.\" Anita commented eagerly. \"So its entirely possible that whoever bought it could still have it.\" Then frowning slightly she said. \"But I thought you said that his old girlfriend tossed it out.\" \"That's what she told Sam.\" Josie acknowledged with a nod as she reached for another chocolate from the box that now rested on Anita's lap. After taking a bite she added. \"But the more I find out about her, the more I'm convinced that she sold it and kept the money.\" \"She's a real winner that one, isn't she?\" Anita remarked sarcastically. \"I'm getting that impression.\" Josie nodded. \"Well, once they release me from this sterile prison I'll be more tan happy to help you search for it.\" Her friend volunteered. \"Especially since Gus has told me I'm not to set foot in the office for at least the rest of the month.\" \"I'd appreciate the help.\" Josie gave her best friend a bright smile. Reaching over she gave the other woman's hand a gentle squeeze. \"I can't tell you how glad I am that you're okay. I was so scared that I'd lost you when Gus called to tell us you'd been hurt.\" Anita gave her a warm smile and squeezed her hand reassuringly. \"I'm afraid you're not getting rid of me that easily.\" \"So, where are you staying after they release you?\" The younger woman asked curiously. \"Home.\" Anita replied, mildly surprised by the question. \"Where else would I go?\" \"Well, I was just wondering if you should stay by yourself.\" Josie commented with obvious concern. \"I mean, are you sure you'll be okay living on your own?\" \"I'll be fine.\" Anita assured her honestly, though very touched by her friend's concern. \"You know, you're more than welcome to stay with me for a few weeks.\" The younger woman told her eagerly. \"At least until your ribs heal and that cast comes off.\" Anita hesitated for a moment, seriously considering the offer. \"I don't want to be in the way.\" \"You won't be in the way.\" Her best friend assured her honestly. \"And you're more than welcome.\" Seeing her friend's uncertainty she pressed. \"Come on, it'll be fun!\" A slow smile spread across the other woman's face. \"All right, I accept!\" \"Wonderful!\" Josie exclaimed in honest delight, looking forward to having her friend nearby for a while. Before either woman could say anything more a nurse came in and interrupted their conversation. \"And how are we today?\" The white clad woman asked Anita pleasantly, totally oblivious to the wide eyed stare that Josie was giving her. \"Better.\" Anita told her eagerly. \"I hear you're getting out of here tomorrow.\" The nurse commented as she pulled out a thermometer and put it in Anita's mouth. Anita nodded and managed to say around the object in her mouth. \"Finally.\" \"I bet your husband will be glad to see you get out.\" The other woman commented a few moments later when she removed the thermometer. \"Those chairs are not the most comfortable to sleep in.\" She indicated the hard backed, wooden armed chair beside her. Anita flushed slightly which caused Josie to smile in amusement. \"He's not my husband.\" \"At least not yet.\" Josie teased, giving Anita a mischievous grin. It was then that the nurse finally focused on the blond woman seated on the edge of her patient's bed. \"Josie?\" She exclaimed in delighted surprise. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Visiting Anita.\" Josie replied simply. Anita looked from one to the other, a surprised look on her face. \"You two know each other?\" Josie nodded. \"Sheila and I were best friends in High School.\" \"Really?\" The dark haired woman exclaimed in amazement. \"We kind of lost contact after we graduated though.\" Sheila remarked. \"I went to NYU and Josie went to Northwestern.\" \"And she became a nurse and I became a copy editor.\" Josie added with a smile. \"Now you're a columnist.\" Anita reminded her proudly. \"A weekly columnist, or so I hear.\" Josie smiled and nodded. \"Gus and Rigfort had a meeting with me on Monday and officially confirmed what you told me Friday. I now have a weekly column in Friday's paper.\" \"That's wonderful!\" Sheila exclaimed in obvious delight. \"Now I'm going to have to make sure I buy every Friday issue of the Chicago Sun-Times.\" Josie gave her old friend a pleased smile then remarked. \"I didn't know you worked here at Mercy.\" \"Both Derek and I do.\" Sheila told her as she checked Anita's blood pressure. \"Though he's home with Sarah right now. He's doing 'Daddy duty' today.\" Then curiously she asked. \"Where's Sam?\" \"He's doing 'teacher duty'.\" Josie replied with a laugh. At Sheila's puzzled look she explained. \"He's an English teacher at South Glen South High School. He's home correcting exams right now.\" Sheila grinned slightly. \"It's kind of ironic that you're dating an English teacher. English was always your best subject.\" Looking at Anita she said. \"I swear she knew Shakespeare's As You Like It by heart by the end of our Senior year.\" \"Which came if very handy when I started attending Sam's class.\" Josie commented with a smile. Sheila frowned in puzzlement and asked. \"What do you mean?\" Before Josie could reply there was a soft tap on Anita's room door. The three women looked up to see two men standing in the doorway. Josie immediately recognized them as the police officers who had come to speak to Gus the night Anita was injured. \"May I help you?\" Anita asked, wondering who these two good-looking men were. \"Ms. Brandt?\" The blond haired man asked as he smiled at Anita. \"That would be me.\" She confirmed and waved them inside. They both did as bidden. \"I'm Detective Ray Kowalski of the Chicago Police Department and this is my partner Constable Benton Fraser of the RCMP.\" The blond introduced. \"We're the officers investigating your hit and run last weekend.\" Anita nodded her head. \"Yes, Gus mentioned that he'd spoken to you. What can I do for you?\" \"Nothing, ma'am.\" Detective Kowalski told her honestly. \"We just wanted to stop by and let you know that we've apprehended the driver responsible for the incident.\" \"Who was it, Detective?\" Josie asked curiously, glancing at Anita out of the corner of her eye. \"I'm afraid we can't release his name as he's a minor.\" The American officer replied, pulling out his notepad. \"But what I can tell you is that he and his buddies were out for a joyride in a stolen car when they ran through the crosswalk. The driver was only fifteen.\" \"Fifteen?\" Anita exclaimed in surprise. \"I thought the driving age around here was sixteen.\" \"Yes, it is ma'am.\" Constable Fraser confirmed. \"He was not a legal driver.\" \"Don't worry, he'll be dealt with accordingly.\" Kowalski promised her as he returned his notebook to his jacket pocket. \"We just wanted to let you know that the case has been solved.\" \"I appreciate that Detective.\" Anita acknowledged with a smile. The blond detective paused for a second before nodding and saying. \"Right then. Let's go, Frase.\" He turned on his heals and left the room. The dark haired Constable gave the three women an apologetic smile. \"Please excuse Ray.\" He asked earnestly. \"He's not very comfortable in hospitals.\" \"Fraser!\" The impatient voice of his partner drifted back inside. \"Before I die of waiting!\" The Canadian pasted a tolerant smile on his face and nodded at the three ladies. \"Excuse me. Have a good day.\" A few moments later he too had disappeared out the door. The two women listened until the partner's conversation died to silence. \"You know I hate these places, Fraser!\" The blond was saying in annoyance. \"Why do you have to prolong our stay by being polite? I don't care if they think I'm curt. I'm a police officer, they don't have to think I'm nice and loveable like you.\" \"I'm sure they don't, Ray.\" The other man assured his part. \"Good.\" The blond exclaimed. \"Now let's get out of here. I have a lead on...\" Anita looked from Josie to Sheila and back again. \"Gus told me they were an interesting pair, but that's definitely an understatement.\" \"What's a Canadian Mountie doing working with a Chicago cop anyway?\" Sheila asked curiously. \"Apparently Constable Fraser came from Canada to Chicago on the trail of the killers of his father and then ended up staying here.\" Josie told her. \"He's working at the Canadian Consulate here in Chicago right now and that gives him some connection with the Chicago Police Department.\" \"You know, there may be an interesting story in those two.\" Anita commented with a mischievous smile at Josie. \"Maybe you should interview them for your column.\" \"Hey, you never know.\" Josie smiled back. \"Maybe I will.\" Just then the telephone on Anita's night stand rang. Gingerly reaching for it Anita warmly greeted her caller. \"Good afternoon, Sweetheart.\" A soft chuckle on the other end caused her to frown slightly. \"Gus?\" \"Nope, Rob.\" The person on the other end corrected. \"Sorry to disappoint you.\" \"It's okay.\" Anita replied, heaving a dramatic sigh. \"I'll get over it. Just a sec.\" Handing the receiver to Josie she said with a smile. \"It's yours.\" Josie grinned and put the receiver to her ear. Winking at Anita and Sheila she greeted the man on the other end with a warm. \"Hello sweetheart.\" \"Ugh, not you too!\" Rob complained with exaggerated disgust. \"Let me guess, you thought it was Sam.\" \"Obviously.\" Josie rolled her eyes slightly and gave her friend, who was trying desperately to stifle her laughter, a mock annoyed look. \"I don't usually go around calling my brother 'sweetheart'. What's up?\" \"I need your help.\" He told her seriously. \"That's nothing new.\" She commented wickedly. \"You always need my help.\" \"Let's not forget who was helping who these past few months? Huh?\" Rob prodded with a bit of a cool tone in his voice. \"Whom.\" Josie corrected. \"Who was helping whom .\" \"Josie, this is serious.\" Her brother interrupted, his irritation starting to show. \"What do you need my help with?\" His older sister prompted patiently. \"I asked Aldys to got out with me tonight.\" Rob told her seriously. \"Like on a real date.\" \"Rob, that's wonderful!\" Josie exclaimed delightedly. \"She's a terrific girl.\" \"I know.\" He agreed eagerly. \"And I want to take her someplace really nice. Do you have any suggestions?\" \"How about Luigi's .\" Josie replied thoughtfully. \"Sam took me there last week for our first date. Everything was wonderful.\" \" Luigi's ?\" Rob repeated searching his memory for the place. \"Never heard of it. Where is it?\" \"It's a little hole-in-the-wall place down by the waterfront.\" Josie described. \"It's only a few blocks from Navy Pier. It's run by a wonderful Italian couple that Sam knows quite well. He use to tutor the husband in English a few years ago.\" \"And you say this place is good?\" Rob pressed cautiously. \"Wonderful!\" His sister assured him. \"Trust me. Aldys will love it.\" \" Luigi's .\" Rob repeated once again. \"Thanks, Jos. I'll give it a try.\" \"Sam'll be able to give you the exact address.\" Josie told him. \"He's at home if you want to call him.\" \"I know.\" Her brother admitted. \"That how I knew you were at the hospital. By the way, how's Anita doing?\" \"Much better.\" Josie assured him. \"They're releasing her tomorrow. She's going to come and stay with me for a few weeks.\" \"Make sure you warn her to stay away from those turtles.\" Rob remarked. \"Those two are nasty.\" \"Only to you.\" His sister commented. \"To me they're as sweet as kittens.\" \"Uh, huh.\" The young man acknowledged. \"Listen, before I go put Anita back on, will ya?\" \"Okay, I'll talk to you later.\" Handing the receiver back to Anita she said. \"Rob wants to talk to you again.\" Taking the receiver Anita greeted warmly. \"Hello, Rob.\" A loud kissing noise greeted her ear. \"Love you, sweetheart.\" He told her with a sly laugh. \"You nut!\" Anita exclaimed, laughing in amusement. \"You'd better behave or I'm going to tell Gus on you.\" \"Just as long as you don't tell Aldys.\" Rob told her, then quickly he added. \"Speaking of her, I gotta go. Talk to you later.\" Before Anita could respond he was gone. \"What was that all about?\" She asked as she stared at the receiver momentarily before replacing it in its cradle. \"It think he has a big date tonight.\" Josie remarked with a smile. \"Who has a big date tonight?\" A male voice inquired curiously. Josie looked up at the curly-haired man standing in the doorway of Anita's room, a bouquet of flowers in his hand. \"Rob.\" She told him as she approached Anita's bed. \"He has a date with Aldys.\" \"Aldys?\" Anita repeated in surprise. \"Really?\" At Josie's confirming nod she smiled and said. \"I think they'll be good for each other. Just like you and Sam are good for each other.\" \"And you and Gus.\" Josie added, giving the couple a warm smile. Anita smiled up at Gus and reached out to touch his arm. \"Yes we are good for each other.\" Gus gave her a tender look and leaned down to kiss her softly. As Gus pulled away he whispered gently. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She returned, caressing his cheek with her hand. \"Well, if you'll excuse me.\" Sheila suddenly said. \"It's time for my lunch break.\" \"Just a minute, Sheila.\" Josie exclaimed as she jumped off the edge of the bed. \"I'll come with you.\" Looking at Anita she asked. \"Do you need me to pick you up tomorrow?\" Anita looked at Gus for a moment then shook her head. \"Gus is going to take me out for a proper lunch tomorrow after they release me.\" \"Well, I guess I won't stand in the way of that.\" Josie teased, shooting the couple a teasing look. Reaching into her purse she pulled out her spare key. \"Here's the key. Just make yourself at home whenever you get there. The spare room is all yours.\" At Gus' curious look Anita told him. \"Josie's invited me to stay with her for a few weeks until I've healed a bit more.\" \"Good.\" Gus commented with a grateful look at his newest columnist. \"I was worried about you staying at home by yourself.\" \"So, I guess I'll see you after work.\" Josie commented to her best friend. Anita gave her a warm smile. \"Thanks for everything, Josie. I really appreciate it.\" \"What are friends for?\" Josie told her humbly. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Bye, Josie.\" Gus and Anita both called after her. As the door closed behind her Anita looked at Gus and said. \"Alone at last.\" \"Finally.\" He whispered before kissing her again. \"So, tell me about this boyfriend of yours.\" Sheila prodded eagerly as she and Josie sat together in the hospital cafeteria. \"What's there to tell?\" Josie asked evasively as she took a sip of her apple juice. \"His name is Sam Coulson and he's an English teacher at South Glen South.\" \"Oh, come on!\" Sheila protested seriously. \"You have to give me more than that! Where did you two meet? How did you meet? When did you start dating? Do you think the two of you will ever get married?\" Josie laughed at the barrage of questions tumbling out of her friend's mouth. \"Slow down there, girl. One question at a time.\" When Sheila opened her mouth again Josie held up her hand and said. \"I get the picture. You want to know everything !\" When her old friend nodded eagerly Josie began her tale. She began with her job as a Copy Editor at the Sun-Times, telling her how she longed to be a reporter so she could write her own stuff and not just edit the work of others. She continued on to describe her experience at South Glen South and how she'd been haunted by the same fears and insecurities she'd been plagued with her first time through school. \"Things changed quite a bit after Rob decided to enroll and give me a hand.\" Josie told Sheila truthfully. \"You remember what he was like in High School. Always 'Mr. Popular'.\" \"I remember.\" Her friend acknowledged with a smile. \"I even remember how he gained his popularity. I can't believe he lived after eating a whole bucket of that awful school-issue coleslaw!\" \"Hey don't knock that trick.\" Josie commented with a laugh. \"That's what made him popular at South Glen South too.\" \"You're kidding?\" Sheila laughed in amazement. \"I always thought your brother was a little on the crazy side.\" \"Oh, he is.\" Rob's sister quickly confirmed. \"But that's part of his charm.\" \"So, what was it like to be popular in High School?\" The other woman asked curiously. \"Was it everything you'd hoped?\" Josie gave her friend a wry smile and admitted honestly. \"Not really. It wasn't what I expected it to be like actually. I don't know if its just that my expectations were too great, or if I had just out grown the need to be popular. I don't know. All I know is that it was a bit of a let down.\" \"I found the same thing in college.\" Sheila confessed as she took a drink from her Diet Coke. \"When Derek and I started going out I was officially initiated into the 'popular' crowd. At first I was thrilled to be so accepted, but after a while I realized that it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. As the years past and our friends graduated we soon found that our little group was down to just Derek and I. But that suited us just fine actually. We were newlyweds and we just wanted to spend any spare moment we could alone.\" Looking at Josie she flashed her a bright smile and asked. \"Speaking of marriage, do you think you and Sam will get married?\" Josie blushed slightly as she admitted. \"We have talked about it. Anita figures he'll propose before the end of summer.\" \"Well, after seeing the two of you the other night at the carnival I think I can safely say that I agree.\" Sheila told her seriously. \"It's perfectly clear to anyone who sees you two together that he's absolutely head over heels for you!\" \"I love him too.\" Josie admitted honestly. \"I love him very much.\" \"Then if I were you I would tell him everything that happened in High School our Senior year.\" Her friend told her gravely. \"It would be good for you to get it out in the open. It'll help the rest of your scars to heal.\" Putting a gentle hand on Josie's arm she pleaded softly. \"Please don't let Billy Prince ruin your life.\" It was about six o'clock by the time Josie got back to Sam's apartment. Opening the door with the key he'd given her, her nose was hit by the smell of roasting chicken. It wasn't until then that she realized just how hungry she was. Stepping quietly into the living room Josie silently shut the door behind herself, knowing that any noise she made would be completely drowned out by the music that was playing on the stereo. Setting her purse and her keys on the coffee table she made her way to the kitchen, careful not to alert Sam to her presence. She couldn't help but smile as she watched him putter around the small room stirring pots and lifting lids to check on what he was cooking. \"Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket. Never let it fade away!\" Josie had to bite her lips and cover her mouth with her hands to keep from laughing as Sam continued to sing along with the stereo, totally oblivious to her watching him. Josie was enjoying the show immensely, though her lips were getting sore from having to bite them so hard to keep control on her amusement. She finally lost her battle when Sam picked up an unpeeled carrot that was sitting on the counter and started using it as a microphone, singing the chorus of the song in various tones and octaves in imitation of the original recording. When he heard Josie's hearty laughter Sam whipped around and looked at her in embarrassment, a slight blush staining his cheeks. But after a moment's hesitation he threw himself into his rendition causing Josie to start laughing even harder. As the last few notes of the song died away Sam bowed dramatically before her causing her to let out another boisterous laugh. \"You're a nut, you know that.\" Josie exclaimed as she threw her arms around his neck and looked into his twinkling eyes. \"I'm in love with a complete nutcase.\" \"As long as you love me, baby.\" He commented and gave her a welcoming kiss. Pulling away slightly he started singing along with the ballad that was currently playing. \"Baby I believe in you. And every little thing you do.\" \"Oh, my goodness.\" Josie exclaimed in disbelief. \"I haven't heard that song since Junior High school.\" Giving him a surprised look she asked. \"Don't tell me you were a New Kids on the Block fan too?\" \"You were a New Kids on the Block fan?\" Sam asked with a smile. \"I was in love with Joey-Joe MacIntyre!\" She told him with a laugh. \"Sheila loved Jordan Knight.\" \"Well, I didn't love them .\" He told her with a chuckle. \"But I did like some of their songs. Not that I ever told anybody. I think Jon's the only one that knew I was a closet New Kids fan.\" \"Well, I guess we all have some skeletons in our closet.\" Josie teased lightly as she started swaying slightly to the music. Easing his grip on her he lifted his left hand to take her right off his shoulder. \"Dance with me.\" He softly urged. Josie chuckled and looked at the carrot that he still held in his left hand. \"What about your microphone?\" Sam looked at it, took a big bite off the end and then tossed it over his shoulder and into the sink. She couldn't help but laugh as he pulled her closer to him, capturing her right hand in his left. \"Baby, I do believe in you.\" He told her sincerely. \"You can do anything you put your mind to.\" Josie gave him a warm smile. \"My, you certainly are in a good mood this evening.\" \"Why shouldn't I be?\" He remarked as he slowly danced them around the small kitchen. \"I'm happy, I'm healthy and I am holding the woman of my dreams in my arms. The woman that I am head over heels in love with and who is the most amazing person I have ever met. And what makes me especially joyful is that she's in love with me too.\" Leaning down to kiss her softly he whispered. \"I couldn't be happier.\" He captured her lips with his, pulling her tighter to him. Josie responded eagerly to his kisses, relishing the feeling of being in his arms. She loved nothing more than being held by him, being loved by him. She couldn't help but hope that this feeling would last forever. Sam pulled back slightly and whispered mischievously. \"I wonder if Rob and Aldys are having this much fun.\" \"I hope they don't have too much fun.\" Josie commented. \"Aldys isn't eighteen yet.\" \"Don't worry.\" He told her confidently. \"Rob promised to be a perfect gentleman.\" His eyes twinkled slightly as he added. \"And I'm sure Maria and Luigi will be keeping a special eye on them tonight.\" \"You called them?\" Josie exclaimed with a laugh. Then with a knowing smirk she stated. \"You called Maria and told her that it was their first date.\" When Sam nodded slightly she shook her head and chuckled. \"Well, I'm sure Rob and Aldys will get special attention then.\" \"Hey, they deserve it.\" He commented seriously. \"They make a cute couple.\" \"They do.\" She agreed eagerly. \"Hey, I'd love to have Aldys as a sister-in-law.\" \"So would I.\" Sam remarked, giving her a look of deep love. Josie smiled and leaned up to kiss him again, slipping her arms around his neck to pull him closer. Sam eagerly responded by pulling her closer to him, wrapping his fingers in her blond curls. The sound of the phone ringing interrupted their kiss. Sam groaned in annoyance against her lips. \"Whoever that is has a lousy sense of timing.\" Sam complained as he ended the kiss and released her to answer the phone. \"Hello?\" He greeted as he picked up the phone beside his recliner. \"Hi sweetheart!\" A female voice exclaimed warmly on the other end of the line. \"Hi Mom.\" Sam grinned happily as he settled into his favorite chair. Josie stayed in the kitchen and checked the boiling pots on the stove. \"How's everything going with you?\" His mother asked curiously. \"Good.\" Her oldest son assured her sincerely. \"Keeping busy. It was the first week of exams this week.\" \"Ah, so that's why you couldn't return your mother's phone call and let her know that you were still alive.\" Sarah Coulson teased her son lightly, laughing when he stumbled to explain. \"I was busy with exams and then Josie and I were at the hospital every night...\" \"The hospital?\" His mother exclaimed in alarm. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, we're fine.\" He quickly assured her. \"It was Josie's best friend, Anita. She was the victim of a hit and run last Friday night.\" \"Poor girl.\" Sarah said sympathetically. \"Is she all right?\" \"Yeah, she's doing fine.\" He replied, glancing at Josie who was now standing in the doorway of the kitchen. \"I didn't see her today, but Josie did.\" Addressing his girlfriend he asked. \"How's Anita doing today?\" \"She doing fine.\" Josie told him. \"They're releasing her tomorrow. She's going to be staying with me for the next couple weeks.\" \"Really?\" He gave her a surprised look then returned to his caller. \"Josie says that Anita's doing fine and the hospital's releasing her tomorrow.\" \"Was she injured very badly?\" Sarah asked curiously. \"She had three broken ribs and a badly fractured leg.\" Sam listed. \"She was lucky it wasn't a lot worse. I guess she's going to be staying with Josie for a few weeks until she gets back on her feet again.\" \"Josie, eh?\" His mother repeated with a broad smile. \"I take it that she's the new girlfriend that your sister called me all excited about a couple of weeks ago.\" \"Must be.\" Sam acknowledged with a chuckle. Giving Josie a sly wink he added. \"I only have one.\" \"What's she like?\" The older woman pressed eagerly, curious about this new woman in Sam's life. \"What does she do? Where's she from?\" Sam laughed and held out his hand towards the girl in question. Josie stepped towards him and accepted the hand he held out. Pulling her onto his knee he wrapped his arm around her as he started describing her to his mother. \"Let me see now.\" He ran his eyes slowly over her face. \"She has beautiful blue eyes, silky blond hair, satiny peaches and cream skin, rosy red lips and cute little ears.\" \"Sam!\" Josie laughed and flushed as he traced a finger over each feature as he listed it. When she tried to move he held her tightly in place. Removing the phone from where he'd tucked it between his ear and his shoulder he continued his description of the woman in his arms. \"She's also very sweet and modest and funny and smart. She is basically the most amazing woman I have ever met.\" \"Nice adjectives.\" His mother commented with a chuckle. \"It's not hard to tell what you do for a living.\" \"Josie's good with adjectives too.\" Sam remarked, giving his girlfriend a mischievous wink. \"And what does she do for a living?\" Sarah pressed inquisitively. \"She's the newest columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times.\" Sam told her proudly. \"And she is a fantastic writer.\" \"So when do I get to meet this goddess?\" His mother teased eagerly. Sam looked at Josie again and grinned. \"Well, I think I have her convinced to come to Wisconsin with me next month for the long weekend.\" \"That's wonderful!\" Sarah exclaimed delightedly. \"Abby, Bill and Emma are flying in too. We'll have a real family reunion.\" \"We're looking forward to it.\" Sam assured her earnestly. Then a trifle regretfully he said. \"I should go. Josie's here right now and I'm attempting to show off my culinary skills.\" \"Oh?\" Sarah's eyebrows raised slightly. \"What are you making.\" \"Roast chicken with all the trimming.\" He told her proudly. \"Well then I'll let you go.\" She told him eagerly. \"I wouldn't want to see all that food spoiled because I kept you on the phone.\" \"That's okay.\" Her son told her earnestly. \"Now I have an excuse if something doesn't turn out. I can just say that my mother distracted me.\" Sarah grinned knowingly. \"I bet I'm not the only thing distracting you tonight.\" Sam looked at Josie and smiled. \"Nope, but you have to admit that she's the best of all possible distractions.\" \"I'll have to wait until I meet her to let you know.\" His mother commented with a laugh. \"See you in a few weeks.\" \"See you then.\" He promised sincerely. \"Love you, honey.\" She told him warmly. \"And Sam.\" \"Yes, mom?\" He asked curiously. \"It's so nice to hear you laughing and happy again.\" She commented. \"If it's because of Josie then I'd say she's the one for you.\" Sam looked lovingly at Josie and once again tucked the phone into his shoulder so he could reach out and touch her face. Josie closed her eyes and pressed her cheek into his palm. \"She is, Mom. She's just perfect for me.\" \"I'm happy to hear that, honey.\" Sarah acknowledged with a warm feeling in her heart already for this Josie girl. \"Take care.\" \"We will.\" He assured her. \"Love you.\" \"Love you too.\" She repeated. \"Say 'hi' to that amazing girl of yours.\" \"I will.\" He promised. \"And you say 'hi' to Dad and Russ.\" \"Will do.\" She acknowledged. \"I'll talk to you soon.\" As Sam hung up the phone Josie asked curiously. \"So how are your folks?\" \"They're fine.\" He told her. \"Eager to meet you.\" \"Really?\" Her eyes widened nervously as she asked. \"Do you think they'll like me?\" \"They are going to love you.\" He confirmed truthfully as he looked deep into her eyes. \"They are going to love you if for no other reason because you make me very, very happy.\" Josie felt her heart melt slightly at the intense look of love in his eyes. \"I love you, Sam.\" She whispered gently. \"I love you too.\" He returned before leaning forward and capturing her lips with his. Josie wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer. The couple were soon lost in their kiss, their supper temporarily forgotten. Sam glanced over at the sleeping figure slumped in the passenger seat beside him and smiled softly to himself. He still found it hard to believe that he and Josie were really a couple. It seemed like it wasn't all that long ago that he was wishing that there was someway that he could tell Josie how he felt about her, yet in other ways it felt as if he and Josie had been together forever. They complimented each other so well that it was hard for him to imagine a time when she wasn't an important part of his life. It had been five weeks since Josie had first told him the truth about herself. Five glorious weeks of being her boyfriend. The experience had been everything that Sam had hoped for and so much more. The day after their first date they had spent the afternoon on the ballfield practicing with the Sun-Times team. He had been very impressed by Josie's skill as a catcher. She certainly was very determined and aggressive when it came to fulfilling her assigned position. Anita had been right though when she said that Josie needed help with her batting. But Sam had soon done what he could to rectify that taking time to give Josie some personal batting lessons. Though he's still not sure just how much tutoring was actually done. He had the suspicious feeling that Josie was holding back a bit on purpose, evening releasing the bat 'accidentally' and sending it flying into the air. Not that he really minded the charade. In fact he welcomed any excuse he could get to put his arms around her. Not that he needed any excuses. She was always quite willing to receive a hug or a kiss from him when he felt like giving her one. Which was pretty much all the time that he was with her. Smiling again he reached into the inside pocket of his jacket to make sure that the blue velvet box that he'd put in there earlier was still there. He'd picked it up that afternoon while he was killing time waiting for Josie to finish up at work. Now that school was out for the summer, his days were pretty much his own. Patting the box against his chest he silently hoped that Josie liked what he picked out. He didn't have much experience picking out jewlery. When he was dating Lara she would always tell Sam exactly what she wanted and insist that he buy it for her. Willing to do pretty much anything to keep the peace and make her happy, Sam usually went along with whatever request she made. Even when it meant scrimping and saving for six months or more to pay off whatever it was she'd chosen. Not only did such purchases put a strain on his pocketbook, they also created a level of resentment within him. But no matter how much he made up his mind not to let it happen again, it invariably did and usually a month or two after he'd paid off Lara's previous purchase he found himself paying for something else. Once he'd tried to stand up to her and suggested that she chose something else less expensive, but that only resulted in another one of her many lectures on how he should move to New York and get a professor position at a University there. That way he wouldn't have to worry about the cost of things. This lecture had occurred right in the middle of the jewelry store and Sam, mortified beyond words, had walked right out of the shop vowing to himself never to shop there again not to ever open his mouth about any of Lara's future purchases. Glancing over a Josie's sleeping form he smiled softly to himself. He knew for a certainty that Josie would never do that to him. He was confident that she would be content with whatever little thing that he got her, even if it didn't cost a small fortune. \"After all, it's the thought that counts.\" He commented softly to himself as he turned his attention back to the road. \"Not how much something costs.\" \"Did you say something?\" Josie's sleepy voice interrupted his thoughts. Sam looked at he again and smiled at her drowsy look. Reaching over he found her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. \"Nothing, just talking to myself.\" \"Better be careful.\" She warned teasingly. \"You do that too much and somebody might lock you up in a padded cell.\" Sam chuckled slightly and gave her hand another squeeze before releasing it. \"I'll try to remember that.\" Stretching her arms over her head Josie let out a wide yawn. \"Are we almost there yet?\" Sam grinned at her in amusement. \"Almost.\" He assured her. \"We've got about another half hour.\" \"What time is it?\" She asked, rubbing her eyes as she tried to get them to focus. \"A little after eleven.\" He told her, returning his eyes to the road. \"You need anything?\" \"No, I'm alright.\" She assured him, sinking her head deeper into the pillow she had resting against her side window and brought the blanket that covered her tighter around her shoulders. Her companion smiled as she drifted back to sleep. \"I love you, Josie Geller.\" A muffled murmur came from his semi-conscious girlfriend that he was sure was suppose to be an 'I love you too'. It was about quarter to twelve when Sam pulled his black Jetta to a stop in front of his parents ranch-style Wisconsin home. The outside light and almost every inside light were on as his family eagerly awaited their late night arrival. Turning off the ignition Sam reached over and gently shook his girlfriend's shoulder. \"Josie, we're here. It's time to wake up.\" When Josie didn't stir he shook her a little harder. \"Honey, come on, please wake up. We're here. My family's waiting to meet you.\" Josie, despite his efforts, showed no sign of moving. Sam couldn't help but smile slightly and shake his head. Rob had once told him that when Josie was in a sound sleep, nothing short of a nuclear explosion could wake her up until she was good and ready to wake up. Sam had figured that the younger man had been exaggerating, thinking that no one could sleep so deeply that they wouldn't wake up with a little prompting, but he was beginning to see what the other man had been talking about. \"Ever hear about the guy that slept through the sinking of the Titanic?\" Rob had asked him seriously. Sam had shaken his head and replied. \"No.\" \"I forget his name. Charles something, I think.\" Rob had said thoughtfully. \"But it doesn't matter. The point is, he was known for being a sound sleeper. He was a first class passenger and nobody that survived could remember seeing him on deck the night of the sinking. They figured afterwards that he must have slept right through it. And I can tell you that if Josie was on that ship, she would have gone down with it too.\" Sam had shuddered at the thought, suddenly realizing what danger she'd be in if a fire or some other emergency situation broke out in her apartment while she was sleeping. The realization made Sam even more impatient to marry her. That way he'd be able to carry her to safety if something did ever happen during the night. After trying one more time to rouse her Sam decided to unload the car and give Josie a chance to wake up on her own. Getting out of the car he bounded up the walkway that led to the front door of his parent's home. His knock was answered less than a minute later by a very pretty young woman with shoulder length blond hair and sparkling blue eyes. Upon seeing who was at the door she immediately threw her arms excitedly around Sam's neck and hugged him tightly. \"Sammy! You're here!\" She exclaimed eagerly. \"Oh, we've been waiting for you for hours!\" Tugging on his arms she pulled him inside encouraging. \"Come in out of the cool air. How was your trip?\" \"The trip was fine.\" Sam replied with an amused look on his face as his parents came into the foyer. \"We weren't able to get out of the city until almost six, then we stopped for a quick bit about eight.\" \"It's good to see you, sweetheart!\" Sarah Coulson exclaimed with obvious delight as she hugged her middle child to her. \"It's good to see you too, Mom.\" Sam returned her hug warmly. Pulling back slightly so she could see her son's face she added eagerly. \"You look wonderful, Sam!\" \"Thanks, Mom.\" Sam smiled at her before turning his attention to his father. As the two men hugged his father said affectionately. \"We've missed you, son.\" Then scolding slightly he added. \"It's been quite a while since you've been up for a visit.\" \"I know.\" Sam acknowledged a little sadly. \"I'm really sorry about that. Things have been kind of crazy for the last little while, but they seem to be leveling out now.\" Then looking around curiously he asked. \"Where's the others?\" Abby grinned slightly and replied. \"The three of them fell asleep watching Lady and the Tramp in the TV room. You should see them. Out like a light, the bunch of them.\" \"Speaking of being out like a light.\" Sam commented, remembering his slumbering girlfriend who was still out in the car. \"Josie's out in the car sound asleep.\" \"Well, why don't you wake her and bring her in.\" His mother encouraged eagerly. \"We've been dying to meet this new girlfriend of yours.\" \"I'm eager for you to meet her too.\" He assured them all. \"Problem is that she is a really sound sleeper and I can't seem to get her to wake up.\" \"Is she okay?\" Sarah asked her son with obvious concern. \"Oh, she's fine.\" Sam hastened to reply. \"Her brother told me that she's just a really sound sleeper. He said that when they were younger he use to go into her room and beat a wooden spoon on a pot a few inches away from her head and she wouldn't even flinch.\" \"I hope there's never a fire in her apartment at night.\" Tim Coulson remarked seriously to his son. \"She's probably sleep right through it.\" Sam grimaced slightly. \"I know. That thought has already crossed my mind and scares me to death.\" Then reaching for the door he said in a lighter tone. \"I'm going to go and get our bags. Hopefully Josie'll wake up by the time I'm finished.\" Unfortunately Sam's wish didn't come true, even though he'd been as noisy as he could about taking their bags out of the back of the Jetta. So, and about fifteen minutes later he entered his parents' house with a limp Josie in his arms. \"Why don't you take her upstairs to the guest room.\" Sarah told her son softly as she took a quick peek at his sleeping charge, immediately noting how pretty the young woman was. Secretly her heart hoped that her beauty wasn't like Lara's, only skin deep. \"Abby and Bill are in her old room and you can bunk with Russ in his room.\" \"Sounds fine.\" Sam acknowledged as he started up the stairs, careful not to bump Josie's head or feet on the walls. Soon he had her lying down on the bed that his mother had already turned down. After removing her shoes and her jacket Sam pulled the covers up and tucked them around her. Leaning down he dropped a soft kiss on her lips. \"Goodnight, my Sleeping Beauty.\" He watched her for another moment before shutting off the lamp beside her bed and leaving the room. \"'night, Sam.\" Josie mumbled in her sleep as she turned on her side and settled into an even deeper sleep. Josie stretched and yawned, carefully releasing all the kinks her body had acquired throughout the night. When she opened her eyes she immediately noticed that the sun was already beaming in her window, but it wasn't until a few moments later that her brain finally registered that she was in a strange room. Sitting up in her bed she curiously scanned the room for several moments, taking in every inch of her new quarters. The last thing she remembered about last night was falling asleep in Sam's car on the way to his parent's house in Wisconsin. She had no recollection of arriving there or of meeting any of Sam's family. She couldn't have slept through it all, could she? She knew that she had the reputation of being a sound sleeper. Rob often teased her that she'd have slept through the Titanic sinking if she'd been on board, but she couldn't have fell that fast asleep on the last leg of their trip, could she? The last thing she remembered was asking Sam how much longer to his parents' house and he'd said about a half hour. Surely she hadn't slipped into one of her coma sleeps in that short a time! Especially after she'd been fighting it all the way there. The last thing she'd wanted to do was fall asleep and miss meeting Sam's family. But from what she could tell, that was exactly what she had done. What they must think of her! They probably think she was high or drugged out on something. What a wonderful first impression that probably made. And poor Sam having to try to explain her unconscious presence. He must have been mortified. She racked her brain to try to remember if she'd even told Sam about her tendency to become comatose at night. She'd better make sure he knew that was why she hadn't woken up, not for any other reason. Glancing at her watch she was surprised to find that it was only six o'clock. From the quietness of the house she suppose that nobody else was up yet. Deciding that it would be a good opportunity to check out the house and the grounds Josie quickly got out of bed and dressed. After making her bed and verifying that everything else was in its proper place she picked up her shoes and padded quietly out her door and down the stairs to the outside porch. She couldn't help but smile at the beautiful sight that greeted her eyes. Trees, large wide opened spaces, a crystal clear pond and a variety of barns and sheds littered the property. She smiled when she spotted the coral at the far end of the yard. It contained three beautiful Quarter horses. Josie loved horseback riding. When she was in Northwestern one of her girlfriend's parents ran a stable, so she got to go riding whenever she wanted. It was something that she really enjoyed doing and even missed on occasion. She and her friend would go almost every weekend and sometimes during the week if they had a chance. \"Well, good morning, sleepy head.\" A voice said lightly bringing Josie's attention to the young man who was sitting on the porch swing at the far end of the verandah. He was dressed in jeans and a white T-shirt, his feet bare and his hair slightly tousled. With the coffee cup clutched in his left hand he looked the very picture of relaxation. \"I was wondering when you were going to rejoin the land of the living.\" \"I hardly slept that long that you would be worrying about that.\" Josie laughed as she came and sat down beside him. \"It's only six-thirty.\" \"Yeah, but you were sure flaked out when we got here.\" He teased with an amused smile. \"I was beginning to wonder if you'd been drugged or something.\" Seeing the mischievous twinkle in his eye she couldn't help but tease back. \"Not unless you slipped something in my supper when I wasn't looking.\" Sam kissed the side of her head and slipped an arm around her shoulders. \"I'm not in the habit of drugging my girlfriends. I don't really think its very good for the relationship. Besides, it takes all the fun out of doing things like this.\" Leaning forward he captured her lips in a passionate kiss. Josie responded by sliding her arms around his neck and pulling him closer. The two were so engrossed in each other that they didn't realize that they were being watched by two sets of spying eyes. \"So, what's this Josie like?\" Sarah Coulson asked her daughter curiously as she continued to watch the kissing couple carefully. \"I don't really know a lot about her.\" Abby admitted as she moved away from the window and poured herself a cup of coffee. \"I've only talked to her once briefly, one time when I was trying to get a hold of Sam after he'd moved. He'd given me Josie's cell number to contact him if I needed to. She seemed very nice and friendly and I've made it a point to read her column each week. She seems to be a very talented writer. I know that Sam praises her talent to the skies.\" Sarah gave her daughter a wry smile. \"Sam never said anything bad about Lara either. Not even when she had that big temper tantrum about him playing hockey and threw out his Gordie Howe helmet! You know how much trouble your father went to to get that helmet for your brother! And that .just tosses it like it was a piece of everyday junk!\" \"Well, I don't think that Josie's anything like that.\" Abby assured her angry mother seriously. \"In face she and Sam are both playing baseball this summer with the Chicago Sun-Times team.\" \"Really?\" Her mother gave the other woman a surprised look. \"Josie actually plays baseball?\" \"Apparently.\" Her daughter nodded. \"And Sam says that she's pretty good. Apparently Josie's brother is a real baseball nut and he and Josie use to toss the ball around all the time when they were kids.\" Sarah was visibly impressed by this piece of news. \"Maybe she's not another Lara.\" She commented thoughtfully to herself, her heart hoping beyond hope that that was the case. She was so sick of seeing her oldest son miserable and alone in a loveless relationship. She knew that Lara was no good for him from the very moment he'd brought her home to meet the family. She was too demanding, too controlling. But Sam was too easy going to stand up to her. Not that he didn't try, but Lara was forceful enough that she would 'put him in his place' without a moment's hesitation. She was obviously the one that called the shots in their relationship, and Sarah didn't think that was right. She was brought up believing that the man was the head of the family and that the woman should offer him the respect that headship demanded. Not that the man and the woman weren't equal partners. But just like anything else, if you have two captains or two leaders, nothing gets done right and you only have chaos. And from what she could tell, Sam and Lara's relationship was nothing but chaos with a capital 'C'. A high-pitched squeal from outside quickly caught her attention. Turning back to the window she couldn't help but laugh as she watched Sam running towards the pond with Josie flung unceremoniously over his left shoulder. Josie was hitting her fists against his back, pleading and screaming as he ran. Her protests, however, were hampered by her laughter. \"What does that boy think he's doing?\" As if replying to her question Sam suddenly tossed Josie into the pond before diving in after her. Josie came up spitting and sputtering as she wiped the pond water from her eyes. Sam came up behind her and suddenly she jumped. \"Oh, oh.\" Sarah found herself holding her breath as she waited for Josie's reaction to Sam's little stunt. All Josie did was turn around to face Sam, before throwing herself at him, successfully pushing him under the water. She then proceeded to laugh heartily as he came up sputtering and spitting and wiping the water from his eyes. Abby chuckled as she watched the pair as they started splashing and carrying on in the water. \"It's been a long time since I've seen Sam so happy and relaxed.\" \"They do seem to interact well together, don't they?\" Her mother commented as she watched them kiss each other again while still in the water. \"I would say she's definitely not another Lara.\" Abby commented as the couple pulled away from each other. They watched curiously as Sam suddenly turned his back on Josie. \"What.?\" She didn't get to finish her question before Josie suddenly jumped on Sam's back, throwing her arms around his neck. Reaching his arms back Sam hoisted her up so she was perched piggy-back style on his back. He then waded out of the pond and back towards the house. \"You know, Mom, I don't think we have to worry.\" Abby remarked seriously as she watched the laughing pair trudging back towards the house. \"I would bet you anything that Josie is absolutely nothing like Lara!\" \"You like horseback riding?\" Sam asked curiously as he carried Josie up towards the house. \"Is that what this is called?\" She commented with a mischievous smirk. \"I always thought it was 'piggy-back riding'.\" \"You think you're cleaver do you?\" He retorted as he jumped up and down a couple of times to jolt her. Josie squealed and laughed, clinging tighter to him. Sam's smile broadened at the sound of her laughter. It was a sound that he absolutely loved to hear and that he tried to encourage every chance he got. Lara wasn't a laugher. At least she didn't laugh at the same things that he did. And even when she did find something funny her laugh always sounded a bit forced. She never threw back her head and let out a boisterous, heartfelt laugh like Josie had just done. Sam hadn't realized before how much hearing someone else laugh could make you feel so good. When they reached the front porch Sam gently set her down on the wooden deck and then turned to face her. Tucking a wet strand of hair behind her ear he said softly. \"Have I told you lately how much I love you?\" Josie slid her arms around his neck and smiled warmly at him. \"Not in the last half hour.\" Sam slid his arms around her waist and pulled her closer as he whispered. \"I love you, Josie Geller.\" \"I love you too.\" She told him sincerely before submitting to his kiss. As the couple pulled apart they heard the screen door open. \"Are you two at it again?\" A male voice asked with mock disgust. When the couple looked at him he added wickedly. \"Every time I look outside this morning all I see is you two playing tonsil hockey!\" Josie's face flushed beet red with embarrassment as she hid her face against Sam's chest as he glared angrily at the other man. The younger man just continued to give Sam a cheeky look, totally unconcerned about the death look he was getting. \"I mean get a room or something, guys.\" \"I heard that Russell Thomas Coulson!\" A female voice called warningly from inside the house. A moment later the owner of the voice pushed open the screen door and stepped out onto the verandah. \"You'd better watch that mouth of yours, young man or I'll be washing it out with soap. Your father and I didn't raise you without manners!\" After giving Russell a light whack on the back of the head the woman turned her attention to Josie who was now watching the pair curiously, her head pressed comfortingly against Sam's chest as he held her securely in his arms. \"Please excuse my son, Josie.\" The older woman told her kindly. \"He tends to speak first and then think later.\" Josie giggled slightly when she caught the look Russ Coulson gave his mother behind her back. It was a look very similar to the one she'd seen her brother give their mother in similar situations. It was obviously a 'guy thing' to do. Turning her attention back to the older woman Josie gave her a warm smile and pushed herself slightly away from Sam. \"It's okay, Mrs. Coulson. I have one at home just like him.\" At the woman's slightly puzzled look she hastened to explain. \"My brother Rob's about the same age as Russ - and just as outspoken.\" She gave the young man a knowing look. \"Yeah, but I don't think even Rob is as outspoken as Russ is.\" Sam teased, giving his brother a few good-natured jabs in the ribs. Russ smirked slightly and jabbed him back. Josie giggled again as she watched a sudden light-hearted free-for-all break out between the two men. They reminded her a lot of herself and Rob. \"Will you two knock it off!\" A younger woman exclaimed in mock exasperation as she joined them on the porch. \"You two are like a couple of overgrown teenagers.\" Sam and Russ exchanged mischievous looks before wordlessly turning their assault on her. \"Stop! Okay, stop! Please stop!\" She pleaded as she laughed hard at their pokes and tickles. Sarah Coulson rolled her eyes in exaggerated amusement and commented to Josie. \"You get those three together and all hell breaks loose!\" Josie smiled and chuckled. \"They do seem to be very adapt at this.\" Sarah nodded and smiled. \"Oh, yeah. They've had lots of experience at this! They're always horsing around one way or another.\" \"That's nice.\" Josie remarked as she continued to watch the laughing trio. Sam was now pulling a laughing Abby into a big bear hug, effectively soaking her with his wet clothes. His sister squealed and squirmed, trying hard to get out of her brother's tight grasp. After a few moments Sam let her go. Abby continued to laugh as she ran a hand futilely over her wet clothes. \"I'll get you for this Samuel James Coulson!\" She exclaimed, but the twinkle in her eyes belied her crisp words. Sam, breathless and laughing, returned to Josie's side and wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her gently to him. \"Honey, I'd like you to meet my illustrious family. This is Abby and Russ and our wonderful mother, Sarah. Everyone, this is my lovely and extremely talented girlfriend, Josie Geller.\" Running a hand through her damp and messy hair Josie commented. \"I don't feel very lovely at the moment.\" Then realizing that she'd said the words out loud she blushed red with embarrassment. Sarah smiled slightly and assured her. \"You look just fine, dear. And I'm glad we finally get to meet the woman that we've heard so much about over the last few weeks. Sam has told us so much about you that we feel like we've known you forever.\" \"He's told me a lot about all of you too.\" She commented a little nervously. \"Thank you for allowing me to come up for a visit. I've been looking forward to meeting you for weeks now.\" \"We're happy to have you.\" Sarah assured her, liking the young woman more and more with every word out of her mouth. She did seem like a very sweet, kind-hearted girl and she could see why Sam was attracted to her. \"Now, why don't you and Sam go upstairs and get cleaned up while Abby and I get breakfast ready?\" \"Waffles with real maple syrup?\" Sam quizzed hopefully. \"And sausages?\" Sarah laughed knowingly. \"I think we can arrange that.\" \"I have first dibs on the shower!\" Sam announced as he pulled away from Josie and headed for the front door. It only took Josie a moment to recover from her surprise before she was on his heels calling at his retreating form. \"Whatever happened to 'ladies first', Coulson?\" \"Doesn't count when it comes to waffles and maple syrup.\" He told her cheekily as he began running up the stairs with her hot on his heels. \"Don't you get that dirty pond water all over my clean house, Samuel Coulson!\" His mother called after him. Sam paused on the stairs and grinned back at his mom who was peering at them through the screen door. \"Yes, mother!\" The older woman smirked slightly and admonished. \"And you let that young lady of yours use the shower first or you won't be getting any waffles.\" \"Yes, mom!\" Sam acknowledged letting out a martyr's sigh. \"The things I do for love.\" He grumbled with mock disgruntlement as he marched dejectedly up the rest of the stairs. \"For the love of me or the love of waffles?\" Josie asked him mischievously as she matched his speed. \"Both.\" He complained as he gained the landing. \"Rob always warned me never to get between a guy and his food. Especially if there's baseball involved.\" Josie commented teasingly to his back. \"Rob's a wise man.\" Sam remarked as he paused on the landing and turned back to look at her. \"Only when it comes to food and baseball.\" She replied with a laugh as she came to a stop on the last step before the landing. \"His two greatest loves.\" Sam chuckled as he reached out and touched her cheek affectionately. \"Three actually.\" She corrected and then explained when he gave her a quizzical look. \"It goes baseball, food and baseball. In that order. Though maybe that'll change now that he and Aldys are an item.\" \"It usually does.\" Sam told her, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. \"Especially when the girl you find is the one you fall head over heels for.\" When Josie gave him a tender smile he added softly. \"There's nothing in this world that means more to me than you.\" Josie gave him a warm look as he leaned down to punctuate his words with a kiss. When he pulled away she gave him a mischievous smile and asked. \"So does this mean that I get to use the shower first?\" Sam smirked at her and sighed. \"I don't really have a choice do I? If I don't let you, I don't get any waffles. And I don't love anything more than I love you, I still love my waffles!\" Josie laughed as he put his arm around her shoulder and prompted her to join him on the landing. Kissing the side of her head he asked curiously. \"How long do you usually take to shower?\" Josie's amused laugh echoed through the house as she slipped an arm around his waist and let him lead her down the hall towards their rooms. As the chuckling pair disappeared down the hallway Sarah Coulson turned away from the screen door and commented to her two other children, a broad smile on her delighted face. \"You know, I think I'm really going to like her!\"[Chapter 11] \"I think I could easily get use to this.\" Josie sighed contentedly as she snuggled against Sam. They were swinging gently on the front porch swing, lazily enjoying the peace and quiet of the country and each other's company. \"It is nice here.\" Sam agreed, tightening his arms around her and kissing the top of her head lovingly. \"I think I could quite easily stay here like this forever.\" He hugged her even tighter to him for a moment before easing his grip. Josie turned her head to look at him and smiled. \"Me too.\" She stretched up to give him a light kiss on his smiling lips. After Sam and Josie had gotten cleaned up from their little early morning swim, Josie and the Coulsons had sat down for a nice leisurely breakfast of waffles, sausages and real maple syrup. Josie still chuckled at the scene Russ and Sam made fighting over who got the last waffle. It had been a nice opportunity for Josie to get to know Sam's family and for them to get to know her. Even though she'd barely known them a few hours Josie already loved the Coulsons very much. They were a very warm, welcoming, fun-loving family and Josie felt comfortable with them almost immediately. She was really glad that she had thought to bring some little gifts for them, helping to show how much she appreciated their hospitality and friendship. She couldn't help but smile at the memory of Sam's surprised look when she brought one of her overnight bags downstairs and proceeded to bring out gifts for everyone. When she'd caught the look she'd given him a sly smile and asked. \"You didn't actually think I needed three overnight bags full of clothes for one weekend, did you?\" Sam had tried to cover up his assumption by digging himself in deeper, which caused everyone to laugh even harder than they had been before. The laughter grew as Abby looked at Josie and exclaimed seriously. \"You are definitely nothing like Lara!\" After breakfast Sam and Josie had gone for a long relaxing horseback ride through the woods behind his parents' house. They had been gone until about mid-afternoon when, after putting the horses away, they'd curled up together on the porch swing. They'd been there for about two hours, talking and laughing and just enjoying each other's company. \"So, do you think your family really likes me?\" Josie asked tentatively after several moments. \"I know my family adores you.\" He quickly assured her as he began nuzzling her neck. \"Almost as much as I do.\" \"I'm not so sure.\" She commented, her thoughts drifting over the conversations she'd had with them since she'd met them. \"They keep comparing me to Lara, saying things like how I'm nothing like her.\" Sam shifted slightly so he could see her face and commented seriously. \"Honey, you should know by now that that's a good thing.\" \"I guess.\" She acknowledged, her mind very obviously elsewhere. \"Josie, what is it?\" He pressed gently, his concerned eyes carefully searching her face for any clues about what she was thinking. When she didn't reply he prompted more. \"Honey, please tell me what's bothering you.\" Brushing a piece of hair off her forehead he ran his hand over her head tenderly. \"What's going through that beautiful head of yours?\" Josie gave him a weak smile and finally voiced her thoughts. \"I know that personality wise Lara and I are completely different, and that's okay. Actually its good, because from what I can see nobody you know really liked her at all. Not your family, not your friends, not even you really.\" \"So, what's the problem?\" He continued to prod, trying to understand where she was going with this. \"This is probably stupid. In fact you're probably going to think I'm being very vain.\" She rambled on uncomfortably. \"But I'm not. I know I'm not beautiful like Lara is, but I don't really want to be considered the total opposite of her. I mean, if I am that would mean that I am still Josie Grossie and that's something I don't want to be.\" Sam shifted them both so that they were facing each other. Taking her face in his hands he stroked her cheeks gently and said in a firm yet soft tone. \"You are not Josie Grossie! You never were Josie Grossie and I would love to skin whoever it was that started that horrible nickname.\" \"Actually, it was Rob.\" Josie admitted with a wry smile. \"But its not completely his fault. He didn't expect it to catch on like it did. He's apologized for it though.\" Ignoring Rob's part in the horrible nickname Sam concentrated on Josie and her persistent fears and concerns. \"As far as I'm concerned you are very beautiful both inside and out, and my family thinks the same thing. So whenever anyone says you're nothing like Lara they mean it in a good way.\" \"I love you.\" Josie whispered, giving him a loving smile. \"I love you, too.\" He returned as he leaned over and kissed her tenderly. When they pulled away Sam smiled at her and said. \"I have something for you.\" \"What?\" Josie asked curiously. Mysteriously Sam reached into the breast pocket of his shirt and pulled out a medium sized velvet box. Handing it to her he prompted. \"Open it.\" Taking the box Josie gently opened it, her mouth forming a perfect 'O' when she saw what was inside. \"Oh, Sam! It's beautiful!\" Her finger traced the delicate chain and then the diamonds in the heart-shaped pendant. \"Oh, Sam it's wonderful! But I can't accept this.\" \"Why not?\" He asked, alarm written all over his face. \"Don't you like it? I can get you something else.\" \"Oh, no, I love it!\" She quickly assured him, horrified that he thought she didn't like it. \"It's just too much. It must have cost you a fortune.\" Sam smiled softly at that, once again mentally comparing the difference between her and Lara. \"It wasn't that much.\" He assured her as he took the necklace out of the box and fastened it around her neck. \"And besides, I don't care if it was. I want you to have it.\" Josie looked down and lifted the pendant, feeling the rough edges with her finger. After a moment she looked up and gave him a tender smile. \"Thank you.\" Sam returned the smile. \"You're welcome.\" Josie admired her pendant again for a moment before suddenly exclaiming. \"Stay right here, I'll be right back!\" Sam watched curiously as she jumped off the swing and ran into the house, banging the door closed in her excitement. \"What's she up to now?\" A male voice asked from a few feet away. Sam glanced over to the owner of the voice and shrugged his shoulders. \"Beats me. All she said was that she'd be right back and then she disappeared into the house. She's just full of surprises today, I'm not sure what she's up to.\" Tim Coulson grinned as he leaned his arms on the deck railing and looked at his oldest son. \"She's a keeper, son.\" Sam smiled and nodded his head in agreement. \"She most certainly is.\" \"Your mother and I were talking earlier while you and Josie were out riding and both of us said that we have never seen you happier.\" His father told him seriously. \"And you're certainly a lot more relaxed around Josie than you ever were around Lara, even though you'd been dating for so much longer.\" \"It's hard to explain what having Josie in my life has done for me, Dad.\" Sam commented with a thoughtful look on his face. \"For the last couple of years I let Lara take away bits of me and of my life just because it was easier than trying to fight it. I gave up baseball and hockey and doing a lot of other things with my friends just to make her happy. I even considered uprooting my life and moving to New York just because she wanted me to. I lost a lot of who I was and what I loved because I let her take it from me.\" \"Including your autographed Gordie Howe helmet.\" His father commented, anger evident in his tone. Tim still felt very hurt by Lara's thoughtless and selfish act regards that helmet. It had taken him a lot of time and effort to find that helmet for his son and he knew just how much Sam treasured it. No matter where he was living be it at home, at Yale or even on his own in Chicago Sam had always displayed that helmet with great pride. The two of them had even built a special display case for it when Sam was about fifteen and Sam had kept both lovingly with him with every move. It had hurt both father and son when both the helmet and its display case had been unceremoniously discarded by Lara during one of her many temper tantrums. Before Sam could reply to his father's words Josie reappeared with a large overnight bag in her hands. Setting it down on the deck she unzipped it and pulled out a gift-wrapped package. Handing it to Sam she announced. \"This is for you.\" Sam looked at the present in his hand and then back to her overnight bag in surprise. \"How many of those bags of yours actually contained clothes?\" \"Only one.\" She told him with a smile. \"We're only here for two days. I certainly don't need three bags worth for that short period of time.\" Giving him a mischievous look she added. \"Not unless you continue to insist on dunking me in the pond every morning.\" Sam's eyes twinkled slyly as he said. \"We'll see.\" Josie chuckled and then prompted again. \"Open your present.\" \"What is it?\" Sam asked as he turned his attention to the package. \"Open it, silly and you'll find out.\" She told him playfully, as she sat beside him eager to see his reaction to his gift. Sam exchanged an amused look with his father before he started tearing the wrapping off the box. Tilting the box he looked at the picture on the side and remarked. \"Oh, look. A microwave. Just what I need.\" Leaning over he kissed her cheek lovingly and said. \"Thank you.\" \"That's not what it is.\" She told him with a laugh. \"I got the box from Nikki after she got her microwave a few weeks ago. Open it up.\" Sam eagerly obliged, opening the top flaps of the box. \"I wonder what it could be.\" He remarked as he set the box down on the deck and reached inside. When he pulled out a large wooden and glass box he gaped at it in disbelief. \"Surprise!\" Josie exclaimed excitedly, watching him carefully to gauge his reaction to his gift. When he failed to respond she suddenly became nervous. \"Don't you like it?\" \"Don't I like it?\" Sam repeated dumbly, still in complete awe as he examined his present more closely. \"That looks just like the case we make.\" Tim commented to his son in amazement as he too closely examined the display case that his son held. \"Look at the helmet.\" Josie instructed, focusing their attention on the content of the case and watching expectantly as Sam carefully lifted the helmet out. A slow smile spread across his face as he ran his hand gently over the signature scrawled across the side of the helmet. \"Look inside.\" When Sam flipped the helmet over to do as she asked he started slightly. \"I-I don't believe it!\" He finally stammered, his tongue finding it hard to form the words in his astonished condition. \"What?\" Tim asked eagerly, wondering what had caused his son so much surprise. When Sam turned the helmet so he could see what was inside his own jaw dropped when he recognized the childish signature. \"'Samuel James Coulson'.\" He read, his eyes filling with tears as realization donned on him. Sam looked back at Josie, disbelief and amazement written all over his face. \"How did you ever find this?\" Josie flushed slightly and replied. \"I put an ad in the Sun-Times the Monday after we started dating looking for an autographed Gordie Howe helmet. I got one response, but I was really hoping to find this one.\" She gestured to the helmet Sam was holding. \"So I told him I'd let him know and spent the next four weeks dragging Rob, Aldys, Anita, Sheila and Nikki to all the Pawn shops, sports places and second hand stores in Chicago looking for it. Gus even got his friend Harding Welsh to put an APB out on it.\" \"But I don't understand.\" Sam exclaimed in obvious confusion. \"I thought that Lara tossed this in the garbage.\" \"Apparently not.\" Josie told him seriously. \"According to the salesman at the store, a woman came in about a year ago and sold him the helmet and the case, as is, for several hundred dollars.\" \"I'm surprised that it was still there.\" Tim commented, his eyes still fixed on the helmet his son held. \"You'd think that a collector would have snatched it up a long time ago.\" \"The clerk said that a few people had taken a look at it, especially with the display case and everything.\" Josie admitted. \"But because Sam's signature was on the inside it wasn't as valuable as one that was still in mint condition.\" Looking at Sam affectionately she added. \"Except to the boy who put the signature in it.\" Wordlessly Sam carefully returned the helmet to the case and then gently set it on the deck at his feet. Turning in his seat he enveloped Josie in a tight embrace, burying his face in her hair. \"Thank you.\" He whispered gently, his tone full of emotion. \"You're welcome.\" She returned, hugging him tightly to her. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" He returned, not moving from her embrace. Tim watched the hugging pair affectionately for several moments, occasionally wiping at the tears that kept building in the corners of his eyes. Yes, this Josie of Sam's was most definitely a keeper. \"Oh good, you guys are back!\" Abby exclaimed excitedly as she came out of the house with her husband and daughter in tow. \"We've all decided to go into town to the carnival. You two interested in going?\" Sam looked at Josie questioningly, but before either of them could speak Sam's little four-year old niece ran up to them and threw herself eagerly into Sam's lap. \"Please came, Unca Sam! You have ta come so we can go on the Merry-Go-Round!\" Sam smiled at her as he wrapped his arms tightly around her, pinning the excited child to him. \"You want to go on the merry-go-round do you, little Miss Muffet?\" Emma nodded her head enthusiastically. \"Yup!\" She slapped him squarely on the chest and added. \"With you. Just you and me. No one else.\" \"No one else, huh?\" Sam have her an amused look before glancing at Josie and winking. Turning his attention back to Emma he asked. \"Is it okay if we let Josie come too?\" Emma looked at Josie thoughtfully for a moment before finally nodding her head. \"Aunt Josie can come with us too.\" \"Aunt Josie?\" Sam repeated with obvious amusement as Josie blushed a bright shade of red. \"Where did you get that from?\" \"From Momma.\" Emma told him, pointing towards Abby. \"Momma said that when you marry Josie than she would be my aunt.\" The little girl looked at Josie and pouted slightly. \"Don't you want to be my aunt?\" Josie giggled slightly and flushed a deeper shade of red. After glancing shyly at Sam, who was smiling warmly at her, she turned her attention back to the little girl. \"I would love to be your aunt, honey.\" She assured the little girl honestly. \"But I'm afraid it's a little more complicated than that.\" \"How more 'plicated?\" Emma asked curiously. Josie opened her mouth to correct the way she'd asked the question, but then closed it again. It probably wouldn't be considered good manners to correct the young girl in front of her parents. Especially when Josie was trying to make a good impression on said parents. \"Well, first of all, Sam and I have to decide if we want to marry each other and then Sam has to ask me.\" \"Why don't you ask him?\" Little Emma asked seriously. \"Because, little Miss Muffet.\" Sam interrupted the conversation, giving the little tyke's side a tickle. \"It's usually the guy that asks the girl to marry him.\" Looking at Josie he added seriously. \"And I am greatly looking forward to doing it too.\" Josie blushed even harder under his gaze and the gaze of his family. \"Well, shall we get going?\" Tim Coulson asked, trying to help remove the attention from his son's obviously embarrassed girlfriend. \"If we don't hurry up all the candied apples will be gone!\" \"Oh no!\" Emma exclaimed in great alarm. \"They can't run out of candied apples!\" Squirming slightly she quickly worked her way off her uncle's lap. Once on her feet she ran across the porch as fast as her little legs could carry her. \"Come on, everybody! Let's go before their all gone!\" All the adults laughed heartily at the young girl's excited exclamations as she ran down the walk and to the nearest car. \"You know something.\" Sam commented to Josie as they stood together watching Emma scurrying across the yard. \"What's that?\" Josie asked as he came up behind her and slid his arms around her waist, pulling her back against him. \"I'd like to see us with one or two like her someday.\" He whispered against her ear. Josie felt a shiver run up her spine at the feeling of his hot breath on her ear and neck. Leaning her head back against his shoulder smiled shyly up at him. \"How about one like her and one who would appreciate that helmet?\" The look on Sam's face spoke volumes as he leaned down and kissed her lips tenderly. \"Okay, you two, enough of that.\" Tim Coulson teased lightly. \"Yeah, we'd like to get to the carnival sometime before they close down for the night.\" Russ commented in a mock-complaining tone. Sam gave him a good-natured slap in the back of the head. \"You're just jealous because you don't have your own beautiful girlfriend to love and adore.\" \"Maybe not.\" Russ retorted back. \"But I'm still better looking.\" \"That's a matter of opinion.\" Sam returned playfully. \"And mine is the only one that matters.\" His younger brother replied as he strutted across the deck and down the front steps, all the while casting mischievous looks over his shoulder at them. Josie couldn't help but laugh. \"Something tells me that he and Rob are going to be completely insufferable when they get together.\" \"Russ and Rob together?\" Sam repeated then gave a dramatic sigh which sent all his companions into fits of laughter. \"Heaven help us all!\" \"Hey, honey! Look!\" Sam pointed across the fair grounds to a tall steel contraption that loomed high above everything else. Snaking his arm around her waist he pulled Josie to him and asked seductively. \"Shall we take a ride on the Ferris wheel?\" Josie giggled slightly at his tone and nodded her head in agreement. \"Wait a minute!\" Abby exclaimed looking at her brother in disbelief. \"You're actually going to ride the Ferris wheel? The same guy who refused to look out of his second story window when he was a kid and avoided the balcony of his apartment like the plague?\" \"Hey, I happen to like the Ferris wheel.\" Sam told her in a mock defensive tone. \"Since when?\" She asked in surprise. \"Since about two months ago when I first rode it with Josie.\" Sam replied, smiling tenderly at his girlfriend. \"Wait a minute?\" Abby frowned slightly. \"Two months ago? You and Josie weren't dating two months ago! Were you?\" \"No we weren't.\" Sam confirmed with a nod. \"I was just trying to be a gentleman.\" Josie wrapped her arms around Sam's waist and teased. \"He was trying to be my knight in shinning armor.\" With a mischievous grin she added. \"Actually it was more like my knight in a navy polo.\" \"So what happened?\" Sarah asked the pair curiously. \"It was back before Sam knew the truth about me.\" Josie began to relate. \"South Glen South was having it's Senior Nite down at the Navy Pier to raise money for the Prom. I went in an effort to relax, shake off some of the depression I was feeling over my assignment. I was getting kind of stressed out over it since I wasn't having any success infiltrating the 'popular crowd' and then on top of that a couple nights before I learned that Sam had this incredibly beautiful girlfriend who he was planing to move to New York to be with. That news alone was enough to depress me.\" \"Did you already have feelings for Sam by then?\" Abby asked curiously. \"By the time I found out that Sam was already involved with someone I was already head over heels in love with him.\" Josie honestly told them. \"And after he rescued my pride by joining me on the Ferris wheels I was forever hooked. Which only ended up making me feel worse since I figured we had no future beyond friendship.\" Abby looked at her brother and pressed with building curiosity. \"Whatever possessed you to get on that Ferris wheel in the first place?\" Sam looked at his girlfriend tenderly as he replied to his sister's question. \"I got on it because Josie looked absolutely mortified sitting alone in that Ferris wheel bucket with a carnie yelling 'lonely ride in bucket five' and the other kids on the ride laughing at her.\" Reaching up to gently touch Josie's face he added. \"I didn't even think, I just reacted. Josie was being teased and I had the overwhelming need to protect her. So I climbed into the bucket with her and it wasn't until the ride started moving that I realized what I'd done.\" Josie tightened her arms around Sam and chuckled. \"The look on his face when the ride started to move was absolutely priceless. It meant so much to me that he would actually put his own fears second to help me out. That's what made me love him even more.\" Sam gave her a wry smile. \"Even though I behaved like a blithering idiot?\" \"You didn't behave like a blithering idiot.\" She objected seriously. \"You were just nervous of the ride.\" He chuckled slightly and admitted. \"It wasn't just the ride that I was nervous of. Whenever I was alone with you I felt like a silly schoolboy who couldn't put two coherent words together. Why do you think I brought up Lara and moving to New York? It just came out before I even thought. I never had any real intention of moving there, especially not after I met you. Like I said, it just came out before I thought.\" \"You brought up Lara while you were riding the Ferris wheel with Josie?\" His brother asked, raising his eyebrows slightly. \"You were a blithering idiot, weren't you? Even I know not to bring up a girlfriend or an ex-girlfriend in front of a beautiful woman. Especially one you're trying to impress.\" Sam gave him brother a mock-annoyed look as he started walking away from the group, pulling Josie gently along with him. \"Come on, honey. I think I've had about enough abuse for one conversation.\" The others laughed and fell into step with the departing couple as they headed towards the ride they'd been discussing. \"So, on the level, Sam.\" Bill began, giving his brother-in-law a sly wink. \"We're you just trying to save Josie some humiliation or was there more to it than that?\" \"Like what?\" Sam asked innocently. \"Oh, like maybe you didn't want to give anyone else the opportunity to fill that empty seat beside Josie.\" The other man suggested, his eyes twinkling expectantly. Sam chucked and pulled Josie tighter to him as they walked. \"That's a definite possibility.\" He admitted. \"Because by this I was more than a little attracted to her.\" \"So why didn't you ask her out then instead of acting like an idiot?\" Russ asked curiously. \"She obviously would have said yes.\" \"Because I still thought that she was my seventeen year old student.\" Sam pointed out seriously. \"And because of that I was feeling like a perfect heal for being attracted to her.\" Looking at Josie he asked with an ironic smirk. \"Remember what I told you about when you were 'my age'.?\" Josie smiled and nodded, tightening her arm around his waist. \"What did he tell you?\" Russ pressed inquisitively. \"That when I was 'his age' all the guys would be lined up around the block for me.\" Josie replied, giving Sam a mischievous smirk. Then flushing slightly she added. \"Little did he know how wrong he was!\" \"Well, to be honest.\" Sam said with a smile as he reached over and tucked a piece of her hair behind her ear. \"I much prefer it this way. Less competition for me. Right now I only have one other guy who's waiting in the wings for you.\" When Josie gave him a puzzled look he chuckled and explained. \"The last day of school, the day you came in and read your story to the class.\" Josie nodded encouragingly for him to continue. \".after you and Aldys left Guy came over to me and warned me that if I ever do anything to hurt you, that he would be standing by to comfort you and to kick my sorry butt all over Chicago.\" \"He actually said that?\" Josie looked at him in deep surprise. \"That may not have been his exact words.\" Sam admitted, not wanting to repeat exactly what Guy had said. \"But that was definitely his meaning.\" \"Wow!\" Josie breathed under her breath. She hadn't realized just how strongly Guy had felt about her. She'd known that he liked her and that he really seemed to care about her, but she'd never expected him to actually come out and confront Sam like that. Somehow the knowledge of that helped boost her still fragile self-esteem. Josie suddenly realized that they had stopped walking and Sam was now searching her face worriedly. \"What?\" She asked, wondering at his expression. \" don' feelings for Guy, do you?\" He suddenly felt nervous of her answer. He hadn't expected her to look so delighted at the news of Guy's warning to him. Maybe she'd realized she was more attracted to the younger man then either of them had thought. Josie gave a tender smile and reached up to touch his face. \"Only as a friend. There's only one 'guy' that I love and his name is 'Sam'.\" Sam beamed at her and leaned down to brush a kiss on her lips. \"I love you too.\" \"Well, look where we are.\" Tim commented as he drew everyone's attention to the tall contraption a few feet away. \"Sam on a Ferris wheel.\" Abby remarked with a shake of her head. \"This I gotta see.\" \"It's not really that big of an accomplishment.\" Her brother commented with a dismissive shrug. \"Millions of people across the country do it every day.\" \"That may be.\" She acknowledged. \"But none of them are my brother who has an incredible fear of heights.\" Sam rolled his eyes and looked at Josie. \"Shall we show them that I can do this?\" Josie smiled and nodded her head. \"Let's do it.\" Sam nodded and took her hand. Looking at his family he teased. \"Don't try this at home folks without the benefit of a safety net.\" Then tugging gently on Josie's hand he led her to the Ferris wheel. \"This is definitely a side of Sam that I've never seen before.\" Bill commented to his wife and in-laws with a chuckle. \"It's been a long time since I've seen Sam this happy and this relaxed.\" Abby agreed as she watched the pair in question standing in line at the ride. \"He's always been very laid back and good-natured, but for the last few years he always seemed to have the weight of the world pressing down on his shoulders.\" \"He did.\" Her mother acknowledged with a serious tone. \"Her name was Lara. That woman was no good for Sam. I felt that from the first time I met her. She was selfish and cared only about herself.\" She watched as Sam and Josie were settled into a bucket and fastened in, a smile on her face. \"Josie is so different. She's sweet and caring and is obviously crazy about your brother.\" \"And it's not hard to see that Sam's crazy about her.\" Abby commented, continuing to watch the pair on the ride. \"Yeah, every time I see them they're hugging or kissing.\" Russ agreed. \"I think I've seen them kissing more in the last day then I saw Sam and Lara kiss or hug in the whole five years that they were dating.\" \"That's because Sam and Lara weren't really in love.\" His sister told him plainly. \"There may have been a certain amount of attraction at first, but I think that it soon wore off. At least on Sam's side.\" \"Well then why did they stay together for so long?\" Russ asked curiously. \"It think for Sam's part it was because Lara was his first real girlfriend and he felt that he should do everything he could to make the relationship work.\" Abby replied, watching the bucket descend that contained her brother and his girlfriend. She couldn't help but laugh when Sam, upon spotting her watching them, raised his hands in the air and yelled enthusiastically: \"Look, Mom! No hands!\" Abby noted that Josie had her arms wrapped securely around Sam's waist as if to anchor him in place. \"I think your brother has lost his mind.\" Tim Coulson pronounced to both Abby and Russ as Sam settled back into the bucket and wrapped his arms around Josie. \"Actually, I think that he'd just being herself.\" Abby countered as she looked at her father seriously. \"Sam's always been a bit of a character. Remember what he was like when we were growing up? He was maybe have been easy going and fairly quiet, but I've learned from experience that it's the quiet ones you have to watch out for the most. Remember what happened with the squirrel and Mom's new vacuum cleaner?\" Her father rolled his eyes and nodded. \"I remember.\" His daughter's expression sobered and she shook her head angrily. \"When I think of all the things that Lara took away from him I want to just.I could just.\" She bit down on the threat before she said something she knew she'd regret later. Her husband put a consoling arm around her shoulders as he said seriously. \"Keep in mind, honey that Sam let her take all those things away from him. He's the one that gave up baseball and hockey and all those other things that he gave up.\" \"Yeah, but only because he was trying to get Lara off his back and make her happy.\" She commented bitterly. \"All she ever did was take, take, take. She never gave anything. Except heartache and grief.\" She watched as the bucket holding her brother and his new girlfriend descended again. This time its occupants were engaged in a conversation, their arms still wrapped around each other. \"I certainly hope Josie doesn't turn out to do the same. After all, Lara pretended to be sweet as pie in the beginning too.\" \"Yeah, but we all saw right through Lara's 'sweet-as-pie' image.\" Tim commented with an earnest smile. \"I don't think we have to worry about Josie being selfish or demanding.\" He assured them knowingly. \"She quite obviously cares about others.\" Looking directly at Abby he told her. \"She found Sam's Gordie Howe helmet and got it back for him.\" Abby gaped at him in surprise. \"But how?\" She managed to stammer. \"I thought Lara threw it out?\" \"Apparently Lara sold it to a sports memorabilia shop. The helmet and display case it was in.\" Her father explained. \"I guess once Josie had heard that Lara had gotten ride of it she started looking for it all over Chicago. She said that based on what she'd learned about Lara from Sam's friends she couldn't imagine her just throwing it out. She figured she'd be sneakier than that and sell it and pocket the money. After all, an autographed item was worth a lot of money to the right person.\" \"It must have taken her ages to find it.\" Abby commented, trying to fathom the hard work the other woman must have gone to. \"Josie said that it took her four weeks of searching every second hand store, pawn shop and sports place in Chicago before she found it.\" Tim told the group must to their amazement. \"I don't believe it.\" Abby continued to stare at her father in surprise. \"Josie actually went to all that trouble to find the helmet for him?\" \"She did.\" The older man confirmed. \"She said that she'd put an ad in the Sun-Times looking for an autographed Gordie Howe helmet, but only received one reply. Unfortunately, it wasn't the helmet she was looking for.\" \"Which helmet was she looking for?\" Russ asked, a frown on his face. \"Sam's.\" His father replied simply. \"She wanted to find Sam's helmet because she knew how much it meant to him.\" Abby shook her head in obvious amazement. \"I can't believe it.\" She looked back to the ride and smiled as she watched Sam and Josie pass by again. Sam was waving to them frantically with both hands, a huge smile on his face. Josie was sitting beside him laughing heartily at his excited gestures. \"Looks like he's gotten over his fear of heights.\" Bill remarked to his wife, an amused smile on his face. \"Oh, he's scared.\" Abby assured him with a smile and pointed out. \"Notice how Josie's arms are wrapped tightly around him to help secure him. He's just trying to pretend he's not scared, but I bet you anything he's actually quaking inside. He's probably dying for that ride to be over.\" The four adults around her all started to laugh as the pair in question can into view again. This time they were locked in each others arms sharing a very passionate looking kiss. \"Oh, yeah.\" Bill commented with a mischievous smile. \"Your brother really looks like he's eager for the ride to be over.\" His wife just shook her head in disbelief. \"Sam was right. That Josie Geller of his is truly amazing!\" Josie sighed contentedly and leaned her head against the end post of the verandah railing and wrapped her arms around her knees. She was sitting on the front steps of the Coulson's farmhouse, gazing up at the stars. She couldn't believe that her weekend in Wisconsin was almost over. The two days had flown by like nothing and tomorrow morning she and Sam would be heading back to the city and their normal routine. In some ways she dreaded going back. She really loved the peace and quiet of country living, but in other ways she was glad to get home. Even though it had only been a couple of days she missed Rob and Aldys and all her other friends very much. She wasn't use to being away from home, since she very seldom ever left the city. Yes, as much as she'd enjoyed her time with Sam and his family she would definitely be glad to get home. She turned her head when she heard the front door creak open and found Abby coming out of the house with two steaming mugs in her hands. \"I thought you might like some tea.\" She said, offering Josie one of the mugs. \"You take it black, right?\" \"Yes, thank you.\" Josie acknowledged, taking the mug from her. \"The guys still playing golf on Russ' computer?\" \"Yeah.\" Abby nodded as she sat down on the step beside Josie. \"The last time I checked Sam was extremely annoyed because he was stuck in a sand trap.\" Josie laughed knowingly. \"That'll really kill his score.\" \"He didn't look too impressed.\" The other woman acknowledged. \"He kept blaming it all on the computer, of course. He said that if he'd really been playing he wouldn't have ended up in the sand trap in the first place.\" \"Sounds like typical male logic.\" Josie laughed in amusement. \"I could see my brother Rob saying the same thing.\" Abby smiled and leaned back against the corner post of the railing behind her and looked up at the night sky. \"The stars sure are beautiful out here, aren't they? They seem to go on forever.\" \"They do.\" Josie agreed as she once again lifted her eyes to the vast Heavens above. \"You don't get to appreciate them like this in the city.\" \"No, you certainly don't.\" Abby agreed. Then with her eyes still fixed on the twinkling lights above she said. \"I use to spend hours at night sitting out here trying to count the stars. I remember one winter Russ and I spent most of one night out here watching a meteor shower. Sam was off at Yale at the time. We must have counted about two hundred shooting starts.\" She laughed slightly. \"We tried to wish on as many of them as we could.\" \"What did you wish for?\" Josie asked curiously, taking a sip of her tea. \"Oh, different things.\" Abby replied thoughtfully, never shifting her gaze. \"Mostly that we would all have happy lives with someone in it that loved us and made us feel special. I got my wish a few months later when I met Bill at a party in town. He's originally from these parts, but shortly before we got married he was offered a job in California that he just couldn't turn down. So we got married and moved to California.\" \"How long have you and Bill been married?\" Her companion asked curiously. \"Seven years.\" Abby replied, taking her eyes off the stars and turning her attention back to Josie. With a soft chuckle she added. \"Sometimes it seems longer than that and other times I seems like we were just married.\" \"You and Bill make a good couple.\" Josie commented honestly. \"You're obviously very close.\" \"We are.\" Abby acknowledged with a nod. \"Bill's my best friend. I love him very much.\" She watched as Josie nodded and glanced back up at the stars. After a few moments she said, her tone very gentle. \"I want to thank you, Josie.\" When the other woman looked at her in surprise she explained. \"You have made my brother so happy. I haven't seen him this relaxed or happy in several years. His relationship with Lara took an awful lot out of him, a lot more than I think any of us realized. Sam was never moody before he started dating her. Even as a teenager he was very easy-going and level- headed. But that all changed when .got her hooks into him. Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to say that Sam's spineless or anything, because he's not. He's just loyal, loyal to a fault sometimes. And for whatever reasons, he felt that he had to be loyal to her. Anyway, Dad told me about the helmet.\" She gave Josie a serious look as she said. \"I can't tell you how much that meant to me, to all of us, that you went to all that trouble to return it to him. I doubt Sam told you, but he was absolutely devastated when Lara got ride of that helmet on him. I had secretly hoped that that incident would give Sam the incentive he needed to break up with her, but he didn't. Instead he tried once again to keep the peace by giving up hockey. My brother has given up so much for that witch.\" She pressed her lips together in an attempt to stop the barrage of angry words that threatened to come. She gave Josie an apologetic look. \"I'm sorry. I really shouldn't be talking about my frustrations with Lara to you. I'm sure you're sick of hearing me complain about her.\" \"It's okay.\" Josie assured her good-naturedly. \"I'm getting use to people going off on tangents about her. It seems like everyone Sam knows has something to say on the subject.\" \"I know, and we're not being fair to you.\" Abby commented contritely. \"And you shouldn't be forced to listen to our complaints about Sam's ex- girlfriend. I know I wouldn't like it if I was in your shoes.\" Josie hesitated for a moment before venturing to say in an earnest tone. \"Abby, I want you to know that I love you brother very, very much. He is the most caring, considerate, wonderful, supportive man that I have ever met. And I would never do anything to hurt him.\" Abby gave her a warm smile and reached over to pat her hand reassuringly. \"I know you wouldn't. In fact, I think you're the best thing that ever happened to him.\" \"Thank you.\" Josie gave her a bright smile, her heart soaring at the compliment. \"I feel the same way about him. Now that I've met him I don't know how I ever lived the last twenty-five years of my life without him.\" The two women smiled warmly at each other before turning their attention back to the night sky, falling easily into a comfortable and companionable silence. \"Now you two had better come back and see us again before summer's over and Sam has to go back to work.\" Sarah admonished Sam and Josie the next morning as everyone said their good-byes. Glancing at Sam momentarily Josie looked back to the older woman and warmly assured her. \"We will.\" Sarah gave her a bright smile and pulled her in for a hug. \"You make sure you take good care of this girl of yours, Sam.\" Tim told his son seriously as he favored Josie with a warm look. \"She is most definitely a keeper.\" As Josie blushed Sam put his arm around her waist and pulled her close. \"She most certainly is.\" He agreed with his father whole-heartedly. As Sam said his good-byes to his mother Abby pulled Josie aside and asked. \"Would it be all right if I called you from time to time in Chicago? I like for us to get to know each other a lot better.\" \"I'd like that.\" Josie told her sincerely. \"Me too.\" Abby gave her a warm smile. \"I've never had a sister before and I have the feeling that you will make a very nice one.\" Josie blushed slightly. \"I'm not your sister yet. Sam and I aren't even engaged.\" The older woman smiled knowingly. \"I think the operative word is 'yet'. Something tells me that before this summer is out Sam will be proposing to you.\" When Josie blushed even redder she added. \"My brother is quite obviously head over heels in love with you. It's as plain as the love sick look on his face.\" Josie couldn't help but laugh at that. Glancing at Sam who was play fighting with Russ she admitted honestly. \"Sam has already mentioned marriage to me.\" \"He has?\" His sister exclaimed in surprise. Josie nodded. \"The night I first told him the truth about myself. And actually he's brought it up a few times since then. Just talking, he hasn't officially proposed or anything.\" \"Well, something tells me that's not too far off.\" The other woman commented knowingly. \"And to be perfectly honest, I couldn't be happier for Sam or you. I think you two make a wonderful couple and I'd love nothing more than to have you as a sister-in-law.\" Josie gave her another warm smile. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" Abby replied, then pulled her in for a warm hug. About twenty minutes later Sam and Josie were on the road again heading towards Chicago and their day to day lives. \"So how did you enjoy your weekend?\" Sam finally asked after they'd been on their way for a while. \"I enjoyed it very much.\" Josie told him sincerely. \"I really like your family.\" \"Good, because they really loved you.\" He told her serioulsy. \"You think so?\" She asked eagerly, giving him a hopeful look. Sam reached over and gave her hand a tight squeeze. \"I know so. Dad kept telling me all weekend that you were a keeper, especially after you gave me the helmet. He was really impressed that you would go to all that trouble to get it back. Everyone was actually.\" Josie gave his hand a tender squeeze and said. \"I knew how much it meant to you and I felt so bad that Lara had gotten rid of it on you. That wasn't right of her to do. It was your property, not hers.\" \"That didn't matter to Lara.\" Sam told her sadly, his expression turning thoughtful. After a few minutes he spoke his thoughts. \"I heard what you said to Abby last night.\" When Josie looked at him with puzzlement he clarified. \"When you two were talking on the porch. I'd come out to find you and overheard you comment about how everyone's been expressing their opinion of Lara to you whenever they hear that she and I are over. I want to apologize for that. That's not really fair to you. You don't really know Lara and you shouldn't have to be exposed to people's complaints about her.\" \"It's okay, Sam.\" She assured him with a smile. \"I'm getting use to it.\" \"Well, you should have to.\" He told her seriously. \"Lara is part of my past and that's where I want to put her - behind me. I don't want her brought up every time I turn around. I've already asked my family to put her to rest and I'm going to do the same with my friends. I don't want Lara to be thought of as my former girlfriend, I want people to focus on you, my current and very much loved and admired girlfriend.\" Josie gave him a tender smile. \"I love you too, Sam.\" Sam smiled and lifted her hand to his lips. \"From now on its just you and me. Lara Patton is history!\" Sam smiled to himself as he casually wandered through the streets of downtown Chicago. It was a beautiful July day and his spirits were incredibly high. Tonight he was taking Josie out for a very special dinner. Tonight he was finally going to ask Josie the question that had been burning on his lips and in his heart since she'd first tone him the truth about herself. He was finally going to ask Josie to be his wife. He knew they had only been dating for a couple of months, but he just couldn't wait any longer. He wanted Josie to be his wife, of that he was convinced without a shadow of a doubt and he was pretty sure that she wanted to marry him too. Everything was set for tonight. He'd made reservations at Luigi's. Both Marina and Luigi were beside themselves when Sam had told them his plans for the night. They insisted on handling everything themselves. When Sam tried to protest, they cut him off and told him they weren't taking 'no' for an answer. Sam finally conceded, knowing it was pointless to argue. He had taken Josie to dinner there several times during their seven week courtship and both Luigi and Maria absolutely adored her. They shared the same feelings as everyone else that Sam knew: that Josie was perfect for him. Sam wholeheartedly agreed with them all. He was so excited about tonight that he didn't know how he was going to make it through the rest of the day. The hours seemed to be just creeping along. Josie was spending most of the day shopping with Nikki Finlay and Sheila Clarke. He was so happy to see that Sheila and Josie had been able to renew their friendship after all this time. It was very apparent that there were happy about it too since they tried to get together as often as possible to rehash old time and create some new ones. And Nikki had fit in with the pair with complete ease. Sam was happy to see Josie with so many friends her own age. It was something she'd obviously been lacking for too long. Sam was amazed at how much Josie had grown and blossomed during the last few weeks. She had gone from a nervous, uncertain girl to a confident, more self-assured young woman. All of her friends and family attributed the change to Sam and his love and support of Josie. Anita teased that all it took was the love of a good man. A few hours later Sam unlocked the door to his apartment and stepped inside. It was almost five o'clock and he had barely an hour to get ready and leave to pick up Josie. Their reservations at Luigi's were for seven. Dropping his keys on the table beside the answering machine he noticed that the message light was blinking. Hitting the 'play' button he walked into the kitchen to get a drink of water. \"Hey, Sam! It's Jon! I was just wondering if you'd be interested in a round of golf with Matt and I this afternoon. It's about ten-thirty. Tee off time is at one. Give me a call if you can make it. Bye.\" \"Well, I guess I missed tee-off time.\" Sam commented after downing his glass of water. He was just reaching to refill his glass when Tom Geller's voice came over the machine. Something in his tone made Sam freeze and chills to run up his spine. \"Sam, its Tom. I'm trying to locate Josie, but she's not answering either her cell or her home phone. Please call me when you get this message. Something's happened.\" Without hesitating long enough to turn off the water tap Sam raced for his phone and punched in the Geller's home phone number. Tom Geller picked up on the first ring. \"Josie?\" The man asked hopefully. \"No, Tom. Its Sam.\" The younger man replied, the concern he was feeling earlier heightening at the near panic in the other man's voice. \"What's wrong?\" \"Is Josie with you?\" Tom inquired eagerly, ignoring Sam's question. \"No, she's shopping with Nikki and Sheila.\" Sam told him. \"They met at the mall about noon.\" \"When was the last time you saw Josie?\" Tom pressed anxiously. Sam frowned, wondering at the sharpness in his tone. \"This morning. We had breakfast together and then I dropped her off at the mall to meet the others about ten to twelve.\" \"Are you suppose to be picking her up there, too?\" Her father demanded eagerly. \"No, Nikki or Sheila were going to drop her off.\" The young man told him. \"Which one?\" Tom asked, his tone rising in panic. \"Nikki or Sheila?\" \"I'm not sure.\" Sam shrugged his shoulders when the other man didn't say anything else he prompted. \"Tom, what's going on? What's this all about?\" There was a long pause on the other end of the line before Tom said, his tears evident in his tone. \"I just got a phone call from Sheila Clarke's sister. There's been an accident. Sheila's car was hit by a van that ran a red light. It crashed right into her door as she crossed the intersection.\" He paused for a moment to get a handle on his emotions. \"She was killed on impact.\" \"Oh, God.\" Sam closed his yes and felt the blood drain from his face. Week-kneed he sank into his recliner. \"Was Josie with her?\" \"We don't know.\" Tom's anxious voice replied. \"We can't seem to find out if Sheila was alone in the car or if Josie was with her.\" Sam reached up and pinched the bridge of his nose as he willed himself not to panic. \"I've been trying her cellphone since I heard, but she's not picking up.\" Sam's eyes fell on the object in question that was sitting on his coffee table beside the tea cup Josie had been drinking from after they'd finished their breakfast that morning. \"She left it here this morning. She forgot it when we left for the mall.\" \"Please, Sam do you have any idea as to where she might be?\" Josie's father pleaded desperately. \"What do you think the chances are that Josie went with Nikki instead of Sheila?\" \"Let me think.\" He closed him eyes as he did some mental calculations. \"Josie walked over there this morning, so her car's at home. It's about the same distance for Sheila to drop her off as Nikki.\" He sighed with frustration. \"I really don't know!\" Suddenly and inspiration hit him. \"Nikki has a cellphone!\" \"Do you have her number?\" Tom asked eagerly. \"No.\" Sam ran his fingers through his hair, but then his eyes fell once again on Josie's phone lying on the coffee table. Jumping up he quickly moved towards it and scooped it up. \"But I think Josie has it programmed into her phone.\" Accessing the address book he scrolled down until he found the number he desired. \"It's here. Just hold on a minute, Tom. I'm going to call her from Josie's cell.\" Not even waiting for the other man to reply he dialed Nikki's cellphone number and pray that she'd pick up. After about four rings Nikki's cheery voice greeted. \"Hello.\" \"Nikki!\" Sam practically sobbed the name. \"Hi, Sam.\" Nikki returned warmly. \"You looking for Josie?\" \"Yeah!\" He quickly exclaimed. \"Is she with you?\" \"Yeah, she's right here.\" She assured him with a slight chuckle. \"I'm just about to drop her off at home.\" Sam collapsed onto his couch in profound relief. \"Thank God.\" He murmured. \"Sam? What's the matter?\" Nikki asked, suddenly getting worried by Sam's odd behavior. \"What's going on?\" Taking a deep breath Sam tried to steady his trembling voice as he said. \"Nikki, can you bring Josie to my place instead of dropping her off at home?\" \"Sam, what's going on?\" Nikki repeated, feeling the hairs on the back of her neck raise as a shiver ran down her back. \"You're scaring me.\" \"I'll explain everything when you get here.\" He assured her. \"Please hurry. But be careful.\" Before she could reply he hit 'END' on Josie's phone and returned to Tom who was waiting anxiously on the other phone. Taking a deep breath he let out a relieved sigh. \"Josie's all right. She's with Nikki. They should be here in a few minutes.\" \"Thank goodness.\" Tom also let out a sigh of relief and closed his eyes tightly against the tears that threatened to flow. Sam heard him speak to someone in the background. \"Josie's safe. She's on her way to Sam's with Nikki.\" Sam heard faint sobs in the background before Tom returned to the phone. \"Thank you so much for your help, Sam. We really appreciate it. So, now I guess the next question is how do we break the news to Josie.\" \"I'll tell her.\" Sam volunteered, then added soberly. \"I guess in a sense it's my responsibility if I plan on asking Josie to marry me.\" \"You're a good man, Sam Coulson.\" Tom told the young man seriously. \"I want you to know that Janet and I both think very highly of you. You're the best thing that could have ever happened to Josie.\" \"I feel the same way about her.\" Sam assured the older man earnestly. \"I love her very much. More than anyone else I have ever met.\" \"I know you do.\" Tom acknowledged with a nod. \"If you need anything, please let us know. If Josie feels she needs to come home, you're more than welcome to come too. We have plenty of room and Josie's room is just as she left it.\" \"I appreciate that, Tom\" Sam acknowledged gratefully. \"I'll let you know when the time comes.\" He looked up as the door of his apartment opened and Josie and Nikki stepped inside. \"They just got in.\" \"I'll let you go then.\" Tom commented, soberly. \"But like I said, don't hesitate to call if you and Josie need anything.\" \"Thanks, Tom.\" Sam agreed. \"We will. Bye.\" He hung up the phone and then turned to find Josie and Nikki both watching him curiously. Before either of them could say anything he rose to his feet and enveloped Josie in a tight embrace, burying his face in her hair. \"Thank goodness you're all right.\" He murmured as he held her tightly. \"Sam, are you okay?\" Josie stroked his back comfortingly, confusion written all over her face. \"What's going on?\" After a few moments Sam pulled away and directed her to the couch. \"You'd better have a seat.\" Looking at Nikki he added. \"You too.\" Nikki silently obeyed, sinking onto the armchair and watching Sam and Josie carefully. Taking Josie's hands in his he looked into her eyes, his own filling with tears. \"Josie, there's no easy way to say this. There's been an accident. A van ran a red light and smashed full speed into Sheila's car while she was crossing the intersection.\" He swallowed trying to push down the lump that was forming in his throat as he added gently. \"She was killed on impact.\" Josie looked at him blankly for a couple moments as the new slowly began to sink in. \"Sheila's dead?\" She repeated in a whisper, her tone completely emotionless. Sam could only nod as he waited for her response. Suddenly her face contorted and she crumpled against him crying broken-heatedly. \"No! No! NO! Not her! Not Sheila! Not her! No! NO!\" Then the tears came in full force and she sobbed hysterically against Sam's broad chest. Sam wrapped his arms around her and held her tight. Wordlessly Nikki, with tears of grief streaming down her own cheeks, slipped off the armchair and fell to her knees beside Josie, wrapping her arms around her distraught friend as well. \"I'm sorry, sweetheart.\" Sam kept murmuring to Josie as he stroked her blond head tenderly. \"I am so sorry!\" \"It's not true!\" Josie exclaimed angrily. \"It can't be true! We just saw her! She just left us a couple of hours ago! She can't be dead! She can't be!\" She sobbed again as part of her brain fought the truth of the situation while the other half numbly realized that it must be so.[Chapter 12] \"She's finally asleep.\" Sam told Tom, Janet and Nikki as he joined them in the kitchen of the Geller's home later that evening. When Josie had calmed down after the initial shock of Sheila's death had worn off, Sam had told her of her father's invitation to come home if she wished for the night. After a moment's consideration she nodded her head and agreed that she would like to go home, as long as Sam and Nikki came with her. Both had readily agreed. That was five hours ago and now Josie had finally fallen asleep on the couch after several hours of tearful reminiscing and self-reproaching regrets. After making sure that she was really asleep Sam had gently and carefully carried her up the stairs to her old room where he'd tucked her into bed. She'd woken momentarily, but fortunately had drifted right back to sleep. She was so exhausted and emotionally drained. Sam didn't feel much better himself as he rejoined everyone else downstairs. \"Hopefully she'll be out for the night.\" Tom Geller commented, taking a sip from his coffee cup. \"She was pretty tired.\" Sam replied, his thoughts suddenly far away. He pulled out the small velvet ring box that had been in the pocket of his jeans and squeezed it tightly in his hand. This wasn't exactly how'd he'd hoped to spend the evening. He'd been hoping that this night would be a time for celebrating, not mourning. Loosening his grip on the box he opened his hand so that it rest on his open palm, his eyes fixed thoughtfully on it. \"Is that what I think it is?\" Janet Geller asked the young man eagerly, a smile appearing on her lips as she watched him expectantly. Sam nodded and opened the box so she could see the ring inside. \"I was planning on proposing to Josie tonight.\" He told them seriously. \"I'd made reservations at Luigi's and figured we'd take a nice moonlight walk by the water after.\" \"That sounds beautiful.\" Janet told him as she looked at the engagement ring that was meant for her daughter. \"She would have loved that.\" \"Well, I guess I'll just have to bide my time for a little while.\" Sam said as he gently closed the box and returned it to his pocket. \"Give Josie a chance to deal with Sheila's death.\" \"She's not going to have an easy time of it.\" Janet shook her head sadly. \"She and Sheila were so close in school and then the last few weeks they've gotten close again. It was like they'd never been apart. It was so nice to see the two of them together again. Brought back some found memories of times Sheila use to hang out here with Josie.\" She sniffed slightly and wiped her eyes with a tissue. \"She's going to be missed.\" \"Well, I'll do everything I can to help her get through this.\" Sam assured them sincerely. \"We know you will.\" Janet gave him a warm smile. \"And we want you to know how grateful we are to you, Sam for everything that you've done for her. You've really brought her out of her shell.\" \"She's a wonderful girl.\" Sam told them honestly. \"And I love her very much.\" \"And she's quite clearly crazy about you.\" Janet told him earnestly. Stepping towards him she pulled him into a warm hug. \"Welcome to the family.\" Sam hugged her back, chuckling slightly when he pulled back he said with amusement. \"Josie hasn't said 'yes', yet. I haven't even asked her yet.\" \"You will and she will.\" Janet assured him as she reached up to pat his cheek affectionately. \"I have absolutely, absolutely no doubt that you two will be together forever. Oh, I'm so happy!\" She hugged him again while Sam and Tom exchanged amused looks over her shoulder. The next week passed with a blue for Josie. Some days she felt so numb that she barely remembered or noticed what was going on. Other days she spent shedding buckets and buckets of tears over the sudden loss of her dear old friend. She still found it hard to believe that Sheila was really gone. It seemed so unreal at times for her. This was the type of thing that happened to other people, but not to her. Not to someone that she knew. Wednesday had been Sheila's funeral. Attendance had been in the hundreds as family, close friends, college peers and co-workers all showed up to pay their final respects to the young woman who'd touched their lives. The funeral was the first time Josie had seen Derek since she'd heard the news. After everything was over and people were approaching him to give their condolences Josie and Sam did the same. Her eyes teared up as she remembered how she and Derek clung to each other, sobbing heavily on each other's shoulder. When she'd finally pulled away Sam had stepped up and offered Derek his sympathies, his own eyes overflowing with tears. It was the first time Josie had ever seen Sam cry. \"How you holding up, sweetheart?\" Josie looked up from her Perks ' tea and gave her boyfriend a lopsided smile. \"I'm still here.\" The words caused tears to well up in her eyes again. \"Oh, honey.\" Sam reached over and gave her hand a tender squeeze. \"I know it's hard. I wish there was something that I could do to ease your pain.\" \"I'll be okay.\" She quickly assured him, giving his hand a squeeze in return. \"Just being there for me really helps. I don't know how to thank you for that.\" \"No charge.\" He assured her, raising her hand to his lips and placing a kiss on her knuckles. Then changing the subject he asked. \"What did Gus say when you asked him if you could skip your column this week?\" \"He and Rigfort were both surprisingly understanding.\" She told him, taking a sip of her tea. \"They just said that they'd print a little note saying that due to personal reasons Life and Times of Chicago wouldn't be appearing in this week's Friday paper.\" \"I'm glad that they didn't give you a hard time about it.\" He told her sincerely. \"I mean you're in no shape to handle the pressure of writing a column this week.\" \"Gus and Rigfort can both be gruff and all that stuff.\" Josie commented thoughtfully. \"But deep down they're both great guys.\" \"Yeah, I guess they are.\" Sam agreed with a nod, then after a slight pause suggested. \"Listen, why don't we do something this weekend? Maria's agreed to hold our table tomorrow night if you're interested.\" Josie gave him a horrified look. \"Our date at Luigi's! We didn't get there last week! Oh, Sam. I am so sorry! I completely forgot about it! I…\" \"Hey, sweetheart, it's okay.\" Sam quickly reached over to grab her hand and give it a reassuring squeeze. \"That's perfectly understandable. Don't worry about it, I explained everything to Maria and Luigi and they told me to tell you how sorry they are and that whenever you feel up to it our table will be waiting for us.\" \"Oh, Sam.\" Josie sighed slightly. \"Your friends are so wonderful! Joanna called me last night to see if there was anything she and Jonathan could do to help. Matt even emailed me a sympathy card offering his condolences and a shoulder to cry on if I wanted it.\" When Sam raised his eyebrows slightly she laughed and said. \"I already emailed him back and told him that while I appreciated the offer I already had a shoulder to cry on if I needed one.\" \"And whose shoulder would that be, Miss Geller?\" Sam asked with mock innocence. \"That of my extremely wonderful and adorable boyfriend.\" She gave him a warm smile. \"Lucky boyfriend.\" He teased as he smiled back, reaching out to cup her cheek with his hand. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" She returned, covering his hand with hers. \"So, what do you say to Luigi's tomorrow night?\" Sam asked gently, clasping her hand tightly in his as he waited for her answer. Josie thought about his question for a few minutes before shaking her head slightly. \"I don't really feel like getting dressed up and going out for a fancy dinner. Why don't we just order in a pizza and watch a movie? That's about all I feel up to.\" \"Sounds fine to me.\" Sam agreed with a smile. \"Whatever you feel up to. As long as I get to spend the evening with you.\" \"You're the greatest.\" Josie told him with a grateful smile, her eyes shinning with love and appreciation. \"So, what movie did you get?\" Sam asked the next evening as he and Josie curled up on her couch with pizza and Cokes. \" The Horse Whisperer .\" Josie replied as she hit the 'play' button on the VCR remote and then snagged a piece of pizza. \"Anita's been telling me for ages what a good movie this is. She saw it when it first came out in theaters with one of her many boyfriends.\" \"Speaking of Anita and her boyfriends, how are she and Gus doing?\" Sam asked curiously. \"I don't think I've seem them since we came back from Wisconsin.\" \"They're doing fine.\" Josie assured him. \"Anita's talking about moving back to her place at the end of the month. She's been doing a lot better and her cast is suppose to come off in another week or so.\" Noting the sad look on her face Sam commented. \"You're going to miss her, aren't you?\" Josie took a bite form her pizza slice and nodded her head. \"It was kind of nice having a roommate. Someone that you could talk to about whatever you wanted, to share things with. I liked coming home and finding someone here instead of coming home to an empty apartment.\" \"I know what you mean.\" He commented earnestly. \"Actually, you know I've been thinking about getting a roommate myself.\" \"Oh really?\" Josie looked at him with genuine surprise. \"I thought you liked living on your own.\" \"Well, like you I've decided that it would be nice to have someone to come home too. \" He admitted as he chewed thoughtfully on a piece of pizza. \"Someone to ask me how my day was, to sit down and watch movies or sports with.\" He looked her in the eye as he added softly. \"Someone that I could hold in my arms all night long.\" Josie felt her face redden slightly as a mental picture of her being the one that he held all night long flashed through her mind. \"That would have to be a very special roommate.\" She commented softly. \"I think so too.\" He agreed. \"Do you have someone specific in mind?\" She felt her heart skip as she waited for his answer but before he could reply the phone rang. Josie eye's flickered towards it, but then quickly returned to meet Sam's gaze. He sighed slightly and encouraged with evident disappointment. \"You'd better get it. I don't want someone panicking if you don't answer the phone right away.\" Ever since Sheila's accident last weekend everyone's been on edge about keeping tabs on each other, especially Josie. Sam didn't think she fully realized how much of a scare she gave her parents and him for those few minutes when they didn't know where she was. Josie nodded and rose to answer the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hi Josie, its Joanna.\" The caller identified herself with a friendly tone. \"Hi Joanna.\" Josie returned the greeting warmly. \"How are you?\" \" I'm fine.\" The other woman assured her. \"Its you I'm worried about.\" \"I'm fine.\" Josie quickly assured her but then admitted. \"Okay, I'm not fine but I'm coping. Thanks to Sam and my family. Everyone has just been great.\" \"Listen, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out for lunch tomorrow afternoon.\" Joanna suggested eagerly. \"I think Jonathan was going to see if Sam wanted to go golfing with him and Matt and Scott.\" \"I don't know.\" Josie hesitated slightly. \"I'm not really in the mood for socializing.\" As much as she liked the other woman, Josie still didn't really know her that well so Joanna wasn't one of her friends that she could just relax with. Josie was also nervous to go out with her because she was still prone to bursting out into tears at the slightest remembrance of Sheila. \"Oh, come on, Josie.\" Joanna pressed gently. \"It'll be fun. If you want to, you can invite some of your friends to join us. I'd love to meet them. Maybe afterwards we can do a little bit of shopping. We'll make it a real girl's day out. What do you say?\" Josie hesitated for another moment before finally agreeing. \"Okay, I'll come. Where and what time?\" \"Shall we say Victorio's at twelve-thirty?\" Joanna suggested. \"Do you know the place?\" \"Yeah, I know it.\" Josie nodded. \"I'll call the others and see if they're free. What time are the guy's teeing off?\" \"One o'clock I think.\" Joanna replied hesitantly than confirmed. \"Yup, one o'clock.\" \"Okay, we'll I check with the girls and see if any of them are free and I'll see you there.\" Josie told the other woman, actually starting to look forward to the luncheon. \"And Joanna? Thank you. I really do appreciate your concern.\" \"Hey, no need for thank yous.\" She quickly assured the younger woman. \"After all, you're not just Sam's girlfriend, your our friend too.\" \"I appreciate that.\" Josie smiled into the phone. \"Um, did Jonathan want to speak with Sam about tomorrow?\" \"Is he there?\" Joanna asked then chuckled. \"That explains why Jon can't get a hold of him at home. Yeah, if you don't mind getting him.\" \"Just a sec.\" Josie turned and held the phone out to Sam. \"For you. It's Jon.\" \"Jon?\" Sam pulled himself to his feet and moved towards the phone. \"Hello?\" As Sam made plans with Jonathan for the next day Josie returned to the couch and the movie that was still playing. A few minutes later she watched in horror as two young girls - best friends - were separated by a riding accident which took one of their lives. Sam returned a few minutes later to find Josie sobbing softly on the couch. Worried he dropped down beside her and quickly pulled her into his arms. \"Sweetheart, what's wrong? What happened?\" Josie continued to sob, unable to speak, but Sam soon realized what had set her off. Reaching for the remote he turned the tape and the television off. \"It's okay, honey. It's okay.\" \"How can it be okay?\" Josie cried stormily against his chest. \"Sheila's gone, Sam. Sheila's gone and things will never be the same again.\" \"Josie!\" Joanna waved and smiled at the young woman as she made her way through the crowded restaurant towards her. \"Hi Joanna.\" Josie greeted the other woman with a warm hug. \"It's good to see you.\" \"It's good to see you too.\" Joanna echoed. As they took their seats she asked curiously. \"Where are the others?\" Josie smiled and said. \"They all had lunch dates of their own. Anita and Gus were going to catch a matinee, Rob and Aldys were having lunch together and then going to the park to toss a ball around and Nikki had plans to meet her mother. So I'm afraid you're stuck with me all by yourself.\" \"Hey, that sounds just fine to me.\" Joanna assured her with a warm smile. \"I was kind of hoping it would just be the two of us. I don't think we've ever spent any real time by ourselves to get acquainted. Just a couple times in the kitchen while we made supper.\" \"I guess you're right.\" Josie nodded. \"You know, now that I think about it, there's something I've been wanting to ask you.\" \"What's that?\" Her companion prompted, giving Josie her full attention. \"You've known Sam a long time, right?\" The younger woman commented carefully. \"About twenty years.\" Joanna said proudly. \"And you'd say you know him fairly well, right?\" Josie continued to press. \"I'd say so.\" Joanna nodded. \"I'd say between Jon and I we probably know everything there is to know about Sam. Why do you ask?\" Josie opened her mouth to reply, but was interrupted by the waiter who wanted to take their order. \"And what would you two lovely ladies like today?\" \"I'll have the Lasagna with Caesar Salad and garlic bread.\" Joanna requested after glancing at the menu for a moment. \"And a Coke too, please.\" \"Good choice.\" The waiter acknowledged and then looked at Josie. \"And you, miss?\" \"I think I'll have the Fettuccine Alfrado and a small Caesar.\" Josie replied. \"And to drink?\" He prompted. \"I'll have a large ice tea, please.\" She told him. \"Very good choice.\" He told her and he took her menu. \"Can I get you ladies anything else?\" \"No, that should do it for me.\" Joanna replied as she handed him her menu. \"Me too.\" Josie echoed. The waiter smiled brightly at her and winked. \"If there's anything else you need, a nything at all, my is Sean.\" Josie giggled nervously and acknowledged. \"Thank you, Sean.\" With another wink he was gone. Blushing Josie looked at Joanna and asked. \"I wonder what that was about.\" Joanna chuckled slightly and teased. \"I think it means that you have an admirer.\" Josie blushed a little more. \"No way.\" She denied, but secretly the thought made her feel good. \"Besides, I'm already taken. Well, sort of.\" \"What do you mean 'sort of'?\" Joanna pressed curiously. Josie leaned forward and confided in a soft tone. \"I think Sam tried to propose last night.\" \"You think?\" Joanna questioned with a puzzled frown. \"You mean you don't know if he did or not?\" \"Well, we were talking about how much I'm going to miss Anita when she moves out of my place next month.\" Josie explained, trying to outline the conversation for Joanna. \"I was saying how nice it had been to have a roommate, to not come home to an empty apartment, but to have someone there to do stuff with. Sam then said that he'd been thinking about getting a roommate himself. Someone to ask him how his day was, to sit down and watch movies or sports with.\" She flushed slightly as she added his final comment. \"Someone that he could hold in his arms all night long.\" \"Oooh! That sounds romantic!\" The older woman said with a delighted smile. \"So what did you say?\" \"I said that that would have to be a special roommate.\" Josie related, a small smile on her face. \"And he agreed, but then before he could say anything else the phone rang.\" \"Wait a minute!\" Joanna exclaimed, giving her a dismayed look. \"Please don't tell me that's when I called!\" Josie hesitated then nodded her head. \"Oh, Josie! I am so sorry! Talk about rotten timing! Please tell me you two picked up after Sam got off the phone with Jonathan.\" Josie shook her head sadly. \"No, by the time he'd gotten off the phone I was upset and crying because the movie we'd been watching had just shown two friends getting separated because one was killed in a riding accident. I was a mess for a while after that.\" \"Oh, Josie. I'm sorry.\" Joanna repeated, truly feeling bad for unintentionally ruining a special moment for her friends. \"Oh, don't worry about it.\" Josie assured her seriously. \"If Sam really was trying to propose he'll try again some other time. If not, well I guess he won't.\" Joanna chuckled slightly. \"Trust me Josie, that guy is going to propose to you. I have never seen him so crazy about anybody in my life. Sam Coulson is so head over heels in love with you that he can hardly string two sentences together without including your name anymore. Face it, you've got that man hook, line and sinker.\" She paused for a moment before adding. \"I'd bet Jonathan's entire Star Trek collection that Sam'll propose to you before the new school year starts. But don't tell Jonathan. If I did by some chance loose he'd have a fit.\" Josie laughed knowingly. \"I think Sam's very happy to have his collection home again.\" Shaking her head slightly she said. \"I never imagined he'd have so much Star Trek stuff. He must have hundreds, if not thousands of dollars invested there.\" \"Well, both he and Jonathan have been collecting Star Trek memorabilia ever since they were about ten or eleven.\" Joanna told her. \"Actually I think some of the stuff they have is worth a pretty good penny if they ever decided to part with it. They both keep the stuff in mint condition. Even the books don't have any crease marks in the spine even though they've been read over and over again.\" \"I noticed that.\" Josie laughed. \"I was wondering why he had all these brand new Star Trek books that he'd never bothered reading. I guess he's just been very careful with them. He's offered to let me read them, but I'm almost afraid to touch them.\" \"That'll change.\" Joanna assured her with a chuckle. \"Not you being afraid to touch them, him offering to let you read them. Jon did the same thing when we were dating. He let me borrow any Star Trek book I wanted before we got married. After we got married if I even looked at the books he'd have a fit.\" \"Hmmm.\" Josie looked at Joanna thoughtfully. \"So I guess I have to decide if I can stand to live with a man who's obsessed with Star Trek .\" \"Think you can cope?\" The other woman prompted curiously, hoping in her heart that such truths about Sam wouldn't scare Josie off. But it was also good to let the girl know what she was in for if she did decide she wanted to marry Sam. \"Well, I've put up with Rob for the last twenty-three years and he's been obsessed with baseball since Dad bought him his first ball and glove at the age of five.\" Josie admitted with a wry smile. \"So I suppose I can put up with Sam's Star Trek addiction.\" \"Does Sam still have that big autographed poster of Deanna Troi?\" Joanna asked curiously. \"Yes.\" Josie nodded. \"But we have agreed that it stays rolled up in a poster tube in the back of Sam's closet.\" \"Smart girl.\" Joanna laughed as Sean appeared with their drinks. He set a Coke before Joanna and the ice tea before Josie and then added a glass of red wine for each of them. When Joanna opened her mouth to tell him they hadn't ordered any wine Sean interrupted her and said, looking at Josie. \"The wine is on the house. Compliments of a secret admirer.\" As he moved off Joanna looked at her friend and teased mischievously. \"I'll tell you, Sam had better get a ring on that finger of yours quick or else he's going to have a whole lot of competition buzzing around.\" Leaning across the table towards the other woman she prompted slightly. \"So, if I'm right and Sam's planning on proposing to you, what's your answer going to be?\" Josie gave her a mysterious smile as she took a sip of her ice tea. After she set the glass down she said softly. \"Yes. My answer would be yes.\" Joanna beamed at her in delight. \"This calls for a toast.\" Picking up her wineglass she said. \"To Sam and Josie. May he get a move on and make you his wife before someone else does.\" Josie just laughed and took a sip of her wine. LIFE AND TIMES OF CHICAGO A Weekly Column by Josie Geller Sun-Times Staff Writer Author's Note: I just want to thank everyone who sent cards and letters expressing their concern about the 'personal reasons' that prevented my being able to write my column last week. Your honest expressions were both appreciated and heart-warming in my time of grief. Thank you - J.G. My Dearest Sheila, I feel a little silly writing this letter, and I'll probably end up tearing it up afterwards, but I just had to get some of my feelings out. I miss you so much. It's been eleven days since the accident that took you away from us, but a day doesn't go by that I haven't thought about you. You were like the sister I never had. You've always been incredibly special to me, ever since we met in grade school. Remember? We were both swinging on the swings and we just started talking. We were pretty much inseparable after that. You've always been incredibly special to me and I've been kicking myself constantly for not getting together with you more often. For letting eight years go by without any contact. I know we both had busy lives, but I wish we'd stayed in better touch. I'm feeling so totally bereft of friends right now, which is silly because I'm surrounded by so many family and friends all wanting to help me through this terrible time. But they're not you. Nobody's you. And there are certain things about me and about my life that nobody ever knew except you. Things I've never told anybody else, things I never had to tell anyone because you were there, you already knew. There was no need to talk about it. But now there is, and that's scary. A couple of times you encouraged me to talk about them, but I don't know if I can. I'm not that strong yet, not that brave. You were always the brave one. You kept me going. Told me it was okay to hold my head up high. I needed that. I needed you. I miss you. I miss your cheery hello, the one I always got whenever I phoned you. That smile that seemed to be permanantly on your face. I can't tell you how lucky I am to have had a best friend like you. You will always be one of my best friends. Nobody can or will ever replace you. I love you, Sheila. Goodbye my dear, sweet friend. You will always be missed, but you will always be in our hearts. Sam glanced at his watch as he descended the steps of one of Chicago's many library branches, several books in his hand. He still had one more week left before school started and he was starting to go a little stir crazy. He always found himself chaffing to begin the school year, but this year was worse. He wasn't sure why, but he though it might have something to do with the fact that he'd promised himself that he would propose to Josie before the new school year started. He was determined and hopeful that he would begin the new term an engaged man. And he knew exactly how he was going to do it, too. He'd decided against trying another fancy dinner at Luigi's . He figured that they'd go there to celebrate instead. No, this plan was a little more unique than that and he was very excited about executing it. Without really thinking about it, Sam pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and dialed the familiar number for Josie's office. \"Good afternoon, Chicago Sun-Times .\" A male voice greeted on the other end. \"Merkin speaking.\" \"Hi Merkin, its Sam.\" He replied in a friendly tone. \"Is Josie in?\" \"Yes she is.\" Merkin acknowledged stiffly. \"But I'm afraid that Ms Geller is busy at the moment. May I take a message?\" Sam gaped slightly at his phone before pressing. \"Come on, Merkin. You know she'll want to talk to me.\" \"I'm sorry, sir.\" The assistant stood his ground. \"But she insisted that she not be disturbed.\" \"Tell you what.\" Sam persisted. \"Why don't you page her and ask if she'll talk to me. If she doesn't want to, I'll hang up and not bother you anymore. Deal?\" Merkin mumbled something under his breath before grudgingly saying. \"Just a minute, please and I'll see if she's available to take your call.\" Sam listened to the boring elevator music that droned through the phone line while he was put on hold. Finally the music stopped and he heard Josie's annoyed voice saying. \"Next time just put him through! When I said I didn't want to be disturbed I wasn't talking about screening calls from friends and family!\" Her tone changed as she spoke into the phone. \"Hi sweetheart. I'm sorry for the wait.\" \"It's okay.\" Sam assured her with a soft chuckle. \"Though you could use some more interesting HOLD music.\" Josie chuckled in amusement. \"Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not my department. Just a moment, honey.\" Sam could tell that Josie was trying to cover the receiving as she addressed her assistant, but he could still hear her quite clearly. \"No, Merkin! I do not want to take a call from 'The Sons of Satan's Belly'!...Because I am not going to do an article about how they eat live snakes and worship pigs!...\" Sam couldn't make out what Merkin's response was, but he couldn't help but smile knowingly when Josie sighed in obvious annoyance and exclaimed. \"Whatever! I don't really care! I'm not talking to them. I'm busy!\" Returning to Sam she apologized again. \"I'm sorry about that Sam. Sometimes Merkin can be so incredibly dense. Not to mention deliberately annoying. Why couldn't they have given me an assistant that could and actually would assist. Anyway, you didn't call to listen to me complain about him. How's your day going?\" \"Better than yours it sounds.\" He chuckled slightly. \"We still on for tonight?\" \"Dinner and a movie with my favorite guy? I wouldn't miss that for the world.\" She told him sincerely. Then glancing at the large bouquet of roses sitting on her desk she smiled. \"By the way, thank you for the flowers. They're beautiful.\" \"You're welcome.\" He told her. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" Josie felt her heart melt at his tender tone. \"So, I'll see you at six then?\" He said eagerly. \"The show starts at seven-forty-five. I thought we'd grab a quick bite before that.\" \"I'll be ready.\" She assured him. \"I'm really looking forward to it. Anita told me that she and Gus went to see Runaway Bride last month when it first came out. It's suppose to be quite good. I like Julia Roberts, and Richard Geere too.\" \"Just as long as it doesn't give you any ideas.\" He teased her lightly. \"Hey, I'm not a bride.\" She replied, fighting a grin. \"Not yet.\" He commented seriously. \"But summer's not quite over yet.\" \"Well then you'd better hurry up, Coulson.\" She boldly teased. \"You don't have much time left.\" Sam laughed and then said goodbye. As he hit END on the phone he sighed. He always felt so bereft when he said goodbye to her. Like a piece of him was always missing whenever she wasn't there. When he and Josie had started dating Sam had thought that he could never love anyone as much as he loved Josie. But he'd been wrong. The more he got to know her, the more he loved her. She was truly the most amazing woman that he had ever met. Sam's thoughts were suddenly interrupted as he came upon a large crowd of people gathered on the front steps of City Hall. Curious he closed in on the gathering, gently making his way through some of the onlookers as he tried to find out what was going on. When he got closer to the front of the crowd he saw that the Mayor of Chicago, the Chief of Police, several other uniformed officers and a lone man dressed in a bright red tunic and Stetson stood on the top steps of City Hall. It appeared that one of the officers was receiving some sort of commendation. \"Excuse me?\" A female voice suddenly said at his elbow. Turning his head Sam looked into the vaguely familiar face of the woman. \"You're Sam Coulson, right?\" \"That's right.\" Sam acknowledged with a friendly smile as he quickly tried to place where he'd seen her before. \"I'm Stella.\" She prompted as if reading his mind. \"Stella Kowalski. We met at a Law dinner about two years ago. You're Lara Patton's fiancée, aren't you?\" \"I was her boyfriend.\" Sam corrected. \"We were never engaged. And actually we broke up a few months ago.\" \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\" Stella acknowledged sincerely. \"She's still in New York I take it?\" \"Yeah, as far as I know she is.\" He nodded. \"I haven't spoken to her since we split up, but I'm assuming she's still there doing the bar scene. In more ways than one, I'm sure.\" Stella nodded in understanding. She'd gotten to know Lara once during a meeting about three years ago. They'd gone out for drinks with a few others and Lara had started flirting with every male in the room. Stella had already met Sam and knew that they were suppose to be a serious item, but when she'd questioned Lara about it she had just scoffed and said that she wasn't going to spend the weekend alone and what Sam didn't know wasn't going to hurt him. Stella had been appalled by her attitude. Even though her love life was nothing to boast about, she would never think of betraying whoever she was currently with by going after someone else. It just wasn't part of her nature. \"So what's going on here?\" Sam's question brought Stella back to the present. \"Ray's getting another citation for bravery.\" She told him, visibly proud of the fact. \"This will make number four.\" \"What did he do?\" Sam asked, intrigued as he watched the proceedings. \"He and Fraser captured three escaped convicts that had taken refuge in a daycare facility.\" She explained, applauding enthusiastically with the crowd as the Mayor presented Ray with his medal. \"The convicts took everyone hostage.\" \"That was him ?\" Sam looked at her in surprise. \"He snuck into the daycare and took them out single-handedly because they'd shot one of the caregivers!\" \"Well, he didn't exactly do it single-handedly .\" Stella corrected slightly. \"Fraser was there too. But thanks to both of them everyone got out alive and the convicts were apprehended.\" \"Which one is Fraser?\" He asked curiously. \"He's the one in the red suit.\" Stella told him, a small smile tugging at her lips. \"The one that looks like a toy soldier.\" \"Who is that guy, anyway?\" He asked as the two men posed with the Mayor, the Police Chief and another man who looked vaguely familiar to Sam for some pictures. \"Constable Benton Fraser, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\" She replied. \"He first came to Chicago...\" \"On the trail of the killers of his father.\" Sam finished, realization striking him as some pieces fell into place. \"How did you know that?\" Stella gave him a surprised look. \"I met Constable Fraser last month.\" Sam explained. \"He and the Detective,\" He gestured towards the partners who were now talking with the Mayor. \"were in charge of investigating a hit and run where my girlfriend's best friend was the victim. They stopped by the hospital a couple of times to ask questions.\" \"I'm surprised you didn't recognize Fraser.\" Stella remarked. \"Not too many people go around in a red tunic.\" \"He wasn't wearing his uniform the night I saw him at the hospital.\" Sam replied. \"He was wearing jeans and a leather jacket. He did have the Stetson on though.\" Stella smirked knowingly. \"Yeah, he never goes anywhere without it.\" Sam glanced back at the partners who were talking to the other man Sam thought he recognized. \"They seem to have a very... unique partnership. How long have they been working together?\" \"About two, two and a half years. They were partnered up after Fraser's original partner went undercover with the mob.\" Stella suddenly spotted someone she recognized just behind Sam. Lifting a hand she waved it slightly and called. \"Meg! Over here!\" A moment later a dark-haired woman pushed her way through the crowd. \"Sorry, I'm late.\" She commented breathlessly. \"I got tied up at the Consulate. Are they finished yet?\" \"Yeah, all except the press pictures and questions.\" Stella told her. Meg rolled her eyes. \"We'll probably be here forever.\" \"Only if Benton starts in on one of his Inuit stories.\" Her friend teased. \"He wouldn't dare!\" Meg laughed knowingly. \"Ray would kill him.\" \"Don't worry.\" Stella chuckled. \"I think Lieutenant Welsh is keeping a close reign on them.\" Glancing at the pair in question Meg chuckled. \"I think this is the first time that I've ever seen Ray in his uniform. He looks good. Uncomfortable, but good.\" \"He absolutely hates that thing!\" Stella laughed in amusement. \"He does nothing but complain whenever he wears it.\" As she glanced back to where Ray and Fraser were standing she suddenly remembered Sam. Looking at the younger man she apologized. \"I'm sorry, Sam. I'd like you to meet a good friend of mine, Inspector Meg Thatcher of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She's Constable Fraser's superior officer as well as his fiancée. Meg, this is Sam Coulson. His ex-girlfriend, Lara Patton is a lawyer in New York. We met a couple of times at some of those boring Law dinners.\" \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" Meg acknowledged, giving Sam a friendly smile. \"So what do you do for a living? Are you a reporter?\" She glanced at the members of the fourth estate that surrounded them. \"No.\" Sam replied with a smile. \"I'm a High School English Teacher. Actually, my girlfriend's a reporter. Columnist really. She writes for the Chicago Sun-Times .\" \"I read the Sun-Times regularly.\" Stella told him eagerly. \"What's her name?\" \"Josie Geller.\" He replied, his face full of pride. \"She writes the weekly column entitled...\" \" Life and Times of Chicago .\" Stella finished for him. \"I read her column every week. She's a very talented writer.\" Suddenly something occurred to her and a broad smile broke across her face. \"So you're the teacher that she mentioned in her first article. The one she'd said she'd fallen in love with. I always wondered who he was! Congratulations!\" \"Thank you.\" Sam acknowledged with mild embarrassment. \"So, how are the two of you doing?\" She pressed curiously. \"You still going strong?\" Sam smiled good-naturedly and replied. \"Yeah, things are going fine. We're doing very well actually.\" \"Good.\" Stella commented with obvious delight. \"It's nice to know that someone's love life is in order.\" She sighed slightly as she glanced over to where Ray and Fraser were finally wrapping things up. \"It takes time, Stell.\" Meg told her seriously. \"You know the expression 'once bitten, twice shy'.\" She noticed the curious look on Sam's face, but to his credit he didn't voice his thoughts. \"Ray and Stella were married at one time.\" The dark-haired woman explained. \"They got divorced about three years ago. But ever since the incident at the daycare she's been having second thoughts.\" \"But ever since Ray's expedition with Fraser in the Northwest Territories he acts like he and I are nothing more than old friends.\" Stella complained sadly. Looking at Sam she added. \"Before that he was always trying to get back together with me. Of course, I had to be a real witch to him.\" At Sam's surprised look she gave him a wry smile. \"Let's just say that your ex-girlfriend and I had a lot in common when it came to how rotten we were to our guys.\" \"Have you actually come right out and told him that you've had a change of heart?\" Sam asked curiously. When Stella shook her head he added. \"Maybe you should. If there's anything I learned from my relationship with Josie its that communication and honesty can save you a lot of heartache and frustration.\" Stella considered his words as Ray and Fraser joined them. She was startled out of her musings when Ray suddenly grabbed her and spun her around. \"Ray!\" She protested despite the fact that she was secretly pleased by the action. He hadn't done that since the earlier years of their marriage. When they were actually getting along. Where had those days gone? Why had they let them disappear? \"What's gotten into you?\" \"I think Ray's happy.\" Fraser ventured, trying to explain his friend's unexpected action. \"I gathered.\" Stella commented wryly as Ray set her back on her feet. Looking at his friends Ray asked eagerly. \"I'm starving! You guys wanna go for something to eat? How about some pizza? My treat.\" \"My aren't we feeling generous today.\" Stella teased, smiling slightly as Ray draped an arm around her shoulders. \"You're feeling pretty good about yourself right now, aren't you?\" \"Why not?\" Ray gave her a broad grin. \"Thanks to me and Frase, three goons are off the streets and back behind bars where they belong. What's there not to feel good about?\" Then without skipping a beat he asked. \"So what does everyone want? Chinese? Mexican?\" His three friends couldn't help but smile at his enthusiasm. \"Let's go some place special.\" Stella suggested eagerly. \"After all, we should celebrate your heroics properly.\" \"Got any place in mind?\" Ray inquired looking at her expectantly. Stella shrugged her shoulders and shook her blond head. \"I don't know. Someplace nice. Maybe even a little romantic.\" Ray's eyebrows raised slightly. \"Romantic, eh?\" \"If I may.\" Sam ventured to interrupt. \"I know the perfect place for your celebration.\" When they all looked at him curiously he added. \" Luigi's . It's a little Italian restaurant by the waterfront.\" \"Not far from Navy Pier.\" Meg remarked eagerly. Looking at Stella she added. \"That's the little place I was telling you about.\" \"The one with the fabulous lasagna.\" Her friend recalled with a smile. \"But didn't you say that it was very hard to get a reservation there.\" \"They were pretty busy.\" Meg acknowledged a little sadly. \"I doubt we could get one on such short notice.\" \"If you guys are interested in going, I'd be more than happy to set it up for you.\" Sam quickly offered. When they gave him a surprised look he explained. \"I sort of have an inside connection. I tutored Luigi in English a couple years ago and ever since they've sort of adopted me as a surrogate son. I'm sure they'd be more than willing to squeeze you in if I asked them to.\" Ray looked at his three friends and asked. \"What do you think? You guys wanna go?\" Both Stella and Meg nodded their heads eagerly. \"I'd say that's a yes, Ray.\" Fraser commented with a smile. \"I'd say it is, Benton buddy.\" His partner agreed with a chuckle. Turning to Sam he accepted the other man's offer. \"If you wouldn't mind makin' that reservation we'd like to try Luigi's .\" \"My pleasure.\" Sam pulled out his cell phone and dialed Maria and Luigi's number. \"Why don't you and your girlfriend join us, Sam.\" Stella invited warmly. \"I'd love to meet her and you're being so sweet making this call for us.\" At Sam's hesitant look Meg echoed. \"Yes, do.\" The two men encouraged him as well to join them. \"All right.\" Sam nodded and then smiled as his call was answered. \"Hello, Anna. It's Sam. Can I please talk to Maria or Luigi?\" \"Just a moment, please.\" Anna acknowledged and then put him on hold. Less than a minute later Maria's excited voice filled the line. \"Sam! My wayward son, where have you been? We've missed you!\" Sam chucked as he said. \"I know, Maria. I'm sorry we haven't been in lately, things have been kind of hectic for us the last month or so. But actually that's why I called. Would you be able to find room for six tonight for supper?\" \"For you, i mio ragazzo caro, anything!\" She assured him without hesitation. \"What time?\" \"Just a moment.\" He looked at the others. \"What time?\" His four companions looked at each other. \"Seven?\" Stella suggested. The others nodded their approval. \"Is seven okay?\" \"I'll check.\" Returning to Maria he asked. \"Is seven o'clock okay?\" \" Perfectto !\" Maria assured him. \"Luigi and I will prepare something special. And some chocolate cheesecake too, non ?\" \" Si .\" Sam acknowledged in amusement. \"Josie will love you for it. We'll see you at seven.\" Ending the connection he looked at his companions and said. \"We're on for seven.\" \"Excellent!\" The two women exclaimed in unison. \"It pays to know someone with connections.\" Meg teased, shooting Ray and Fraser mischievous looks. Fraser nodded in agreement while Ray snickered sarcastically. Stella glanced at her watch. \"It's almost four o'clock. I have to stop by the office for a bit, so I'll see you all later.\" Turning to Ray she gave him a warm smile. \"I'm very proud of you, Ray.\" Then leaning up she kissed him gently on the lips. \"I'll see you later.\" As she turned to leave Meg called after her. \"Wait up, Stell! I'll come with you.\" Looking up at Fraser she said in a mock stern tone. \"I'll expect to see you back at the Consulate by six o'clock, Constable.\" \"Yes, Inspector .\" The man in red nodded, standing at attention. The only hint of his amusement was the twinkle in his eyes. Meg chuckled slightly and leaned up to brush a kiss on his lips. \"You look so cute when you do that.\" Fraser gave her a full blown smile before she turned and joined her friend. \"Now there go two fantastic ladies.\" Ray remarked to Fraser and Sam as he watched the pair walk away. Then looking back to his partner he suggested. \"What's say we change out of our fancy duds and get a bite to eat? I'm starved now and I don't think I'll be able to make it until seven without perishing.\" \"Well, if you had eaten lunch like I suggested, Ray you wouldn't be feeling hungry now.\" The Mountie commented without the least bit of sympathy for his friend. \"Couldn't do, Benton buddy.\" The blond detective countered. \"Was way too nervous to think about food at lunch time.\" Fraser smiled and clasped his friend's shoulder warmly. \"You did very well today, my friend. I'm very proud of you.\" Ray flushed slightly at the praise. \"Couldn't a done it without ya, partner.\" It was now the Mountie's turn to look embarrassed. \"Come on.\" The blond encouraged, slapping his friend on the back. \"Let's go get something to eat. I'll buy you a cup of bark tea.\" Fraser looked at him in surprise. \"I didn't know there were any restaurants around Chicago that served bark tea.\" \"There aren't.\" Ray confirmed. \"But I have some at home and I got to get out of this uniform before it kills me.\" \"I highly doubt that it's going to kill you, Ray.\" His partner commented with a slight smile. \"And besides, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I actually find something comforting about the restrictive fit of a dress uniform.\" \"Look, I know you love that thing. That you basically eat, sleep and live in it, but I haven't worn mine since the last time I got a citation.\" Ray remarked with growing annoyance. \"And there's a reason for that. I hate it! So come on before I die of uncomfortableness!\" The blond man started trudging down the sidewalk. \"I'm not sure if a doctor would actually put that on a death certificate.\" Sam commented to Fraser as they watched Ray walk away. Fraser smirked slightly and shook his head knowingly. Reaching up to rub his eyebrow he apologized to the other man on behalf of his friend. \"Please excuse Ray. He tends to get a little cranky when he hasn't eaten. I think he may be hypoglycemic. But of course he'd never listen to me if I suggested it. He doesn't pay me much heed when it comes to his eating habits.\" Sam chuckled slightly in amusement at the comment. He'd learned shortly after meeting the pair at the hospital when Anita was injured that the blond-haired man was almost always cranky. But it was actually in a likeable kind of way. \"It's quite all right, Constable. There's no need to apologize.\" \"How's your friend doing, by-the-way?\" The Mountie asked with obvious concern. \"The one that was hit by the underage driver.\" Sam gave him a look of complete surprise. He hadn't realized that the officer had remembered him. \"She's doing much better. She went back to work a couple of weeks ago. She's still healing, but she's doing fine. Thanks again for all your hard work on that case. We all really appreciated it.\" \"No need to thank us.\" Fraser assured him earnestly. \"We are officers of the law. It's our duty to apprehend those who are determined to break the law.\" Before Sam could reply Ray's impatient voice carried back down the block. \"Come on, Fraser! Before I die of waiting!\" Sam and Fraser looked back down the street to the impatiently waiting man who was standing beside the driver's door of his black GTO. \"He's always dying of something, isn't he?\" Sam remarked with a smirk. Fraser nodded his head and gave a slight sigh. \"Sometimes I wish he'd just hurry up and get it over with.\" Looking at Sam he added. \"We'll see you at seven.\" \"See you later.\" Sam acknowledged as the other man walked away. He laughed as he heard Ray saying to his partner. \"I thought we'd call Tony and order a pizza before we go out to dinner.\" Sam chuckled as he pulled out his cell phone and punched in the number for Josie's cell, deciding it would be easier to just bypass her incompetent assistant. When she answered he greeted brightly. \"Hi, honey. There's been a change of plans for tonight...\"[Chapter 13] \"Ah, Sam! Josie! Benvenuto !\" Both Sam and Josie laughed at Maria's hearty welcome. \"Hello, Maria.\" Josie gave the older Italian woman a warm hug. After Maria hugged her back she pulled back and cradled Josie's face in both of her hands. \"How are you, cuore curo ? You okay?\" The younger woman favored her with a sad smile. \"I'm okay.\" \"Come, let's get you seated.\" Maria encouraged. \"Some of your friends are already here.\" She led them to a large round booth in one corner of the restaurant. Benton Fraser and Meg Thatcher were already seated, waiting for their friends. \"Honey, I believe you remember Constable Fraser.\" Sam indicated the dark-haired man seated at the table. \"And this is his fiancée, Inspector Meg Thatcher.\" Josie gave the officers a warm smile. \"It's nice to see you again, Constable.\" \"Likewise.\" The Canadian acknowledged pleasantly. \"Sam tells me that your friend is doing much better.\" \"Yes, she is.\" Josie acknowledged, scooting into the booth beside Meg. \"She just started back to work the week before last. She's still sore, but she's definitely doing better.\" When Meg gave Fraser a curious look he explained. \"Ray and I investigated a hit and run incident a couple of months ago. Josie's friend was the victim.\" \"Oh, my.\" Meg gave Josie a sympathetic look. \"I'm glad to hear she's doing better.\" \"A lot better than Sheila.\" The young girl felt her lips begin to tremble as she glanced at Sam, her eyes starting to well up with tears. Sam slipped a comforting arm around her shoulders and pulled her closer to him. Josie flashed him an appreciative smile. He gave her shoulders a squeeze in return. Then realizing that Meg and Fraser were looking at them curiously he explained. \"Josie's best friend from High School was killed in a car accident last month.\" \"Oh, dear.\" Fraser gave her a sympathetic look. \"That must be very hard. I know how upset I was when Ray was injured last year.\" \"What happened?\" Sam pressed curiously, grateful to get the conversation off of Sheila. \"Meg and I and the two Rays were pursuing a suspect called Muldoon.\" Fraser began but was interrupted by Josie who asked curiously. \"Two Rays?\" \"Both my partners since I came to Chicago were named Ray.\" Fraser explained. \"Yeah, but I'm the better lookin' one.\" A male voice commented jokingly. The two couples looked up to find Ray and Stella standing before them. \"That's a matter of opinion.\" Fraser teased as his friend slid into the booth beside him. Stella slid in beside Ray. \"Well that's mine, Benton buddy and that's the only one that really matters.\" The blond replied with a decided nod of his head. Fraser smiled at the firmness of the other man's reply. \"I don't know.\" Meg commented with a mischievous look. \"You may be the better looking one, but I'd also say you're the more aggravating one too.\" \"Spoken like a true Ice Queen.\" Ray retorted shooting her a mock annoyed look. \"Ray, you know very well that Meg is not an Ice Queen.\" Fraser commented dutifully, playing his expected part in the ongoing sparing game between his best friend and his fiancée.\" \"Maybe not to you, buddy.\" The Chicago cop remarked with a sly grin. \"But we're not all so fortunate.\" Stella shook her head and said. \"You guys have got to come up with some new material. This argument is getting so old!\" Her three friends chuckled in agreement. Josie looked at the quartet curiously and asked. \"How did the four of you all meet up anyway? If you don't mind my saying so, you all seem quite different personality wise, yet you appear to be quite close friends. What's your story?\" Sam couldn't help but chuckle and give her shoulders a squeeze. \"Asked like a true reporter.\" When Josie shot him a surprised look he teased. \"I told you that you were a great writer and that all you needed to do was find your story. Well now you seem to be finding several of them.\" Josie flushed slightly at the praise. \"You wanting to interview us for your column?\" Stella asked eagerly, secretly pleased at the idea. \"Well, I hadn't thought about it really.\" The columnist admitted but then looked thoughtful. \"But its definitely a thought. If you guys don't mind that is.\" \"Sounds fine to me.\" Stella agreed readily. Then looking at her friends she asked. \"How about you guys?\" Ray and Fraser looked at each other for a few moments, seeming to be communicating without words. After a couple nods Fraser turned to his fiancée and asked curiously. \"What do you think?\" Meg gave him a bright smile and said. \"I think its a wonderful idea!\" The partners exchanged another look before nodding simultaneously. \"Okay.\" Looking back to Josie they repeated. \"Okay.\" Josie gave them a delighted smile. \"Wonderful!\" Reaching into her bad she pulled out a notebook. \"Well then, why don't we start at the beginning.\" Before anything further could be said Maria came bustling over with Luigi in tow. \"Sam! Josie!\" Luigi greeted his friends warmly, an enthusiastic smile on his face. \"It's good to see you!\" \"It's good to see you too, Luigi.\" Sam rose to his feet and greeted the other man warmly. Josie followed suit. \"We've missed you both.\" Luigi told them sincerely. \"You here to celebrate?\" He gave Sam a knowing look and glanced at Josie warmly. Sam smiled, knowing what the other man was thinking and wishing it was so. \"We are here to celebrate, but not what you think.\" He gestured towards Ray and explained. \"This is Detective Ray Kowalski of the Chicago Police Department and this is his partner, Constable Benton Fraser of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A few months ago Detective Kowalski and Constable Fraser caught some escaped criminals who had taken a daycare center hostage. Detective Kowalski received a citation for bravery for it today, so we're celebrating their heroics.\" Luigi looked at the partners with clear admiration. \" Congratulazioni ! And benvenuto to Luigi's !\" He told them eagerly. Looking at his wife he said something in Italian. She smiled and nodded her head in agreement. Luigi looked back to the group and informed them. \"In honor of your celebration, everything you order tonight is on us!\" Everyone chimed in trying to refuse the generous offer, but the Italian man wouldn't be dissuaded. \" Assurdita ! We insist! Maria will take your order and I will prepare the best meal you've ever had!\" He flashed them all a broad smile before disappearing back to the kitchen. Maria smiled affectionately after him. Looking at Ray and Fraser she said seriously. \"Luigi has a soft spot for police officers. He was an officer in Italy for five years until he was seriously injured in the line of duty.\" \"I never knew that.\" Sam gave her a look of pure surprise. \"He doesn't like talking about it.\" Maria told him sadly. \"When he was injured his partner was killed. He's very sensitive about the whole thing.\" Ray and Fraser looked at each other and nodded. \"That's understandable.\" They both said together. The subject then changed as Maria took their order. When she moved off Josie looked at Sam and shook her head sadly. \"I never knew that about Luigi.\" \"Neither did I.\" Sam echoed, his expression mirroring her own. \"There's a few things worse for a cop then loosing his partner.\" Ray remarked truthfully, an unreadable look in his eyes. \"Have either of you ever lost a partner that way?\" Josie asked gently. Both men shook their heads. \"Fortunately not.\" Ray told her seriously. \"But I've seen the reaction of those that have.\" \"As have I.\" Fraser echoed, a sad look in his dark eyes. Seeing how pensive the two men had gotten Josie decided to change the subject. Looking at Ray and Fraser she prompted. \"So, how did you two end up working together?\" Stella and Meg exchanged knowing looks. Looking back to the younger woman Meg told her with a grin. \"I hope you don't have any big plans for the rest of the night.\" \"Why's that?\" Josie pressed with a puzzled look. \"Because we could be here for a while.\" Stella added with a mischievous look at Ray and Fraser. \"You've just asked them to relate their favorite story.\" \"And its a long story.\" Meg added. \"Well, I'm all ears.\" Josie gave the partners an encouraging smile. Fraser began the tale. \"It all began in 1994 when I came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father. During the course of that investigation I worked very closely with the District 27 station of the Chicago Police Department. The detective in charge of the case was Raymond Vecchio. We had a bit of a rocky start since he wasn't all that interested in solving a case involving a Canadian police officer, but we eventually became friends. So after we solved the case and I found myself permanently assigned to the Chicago branch of the Canadian Consulate...\" \"Permanently exiled you mean.\" Ray Kowalski corrected a trifle bitterly. It still bugged him that the RCMP higher ups had treated his best friend so abominably because he'd had to turn in a fellow member of the RCMP for murder. It was like Fraser had been the criminal instead of the other guy. Fraser ignored his friend's indignant remark and continued his story. \"Ray Vecchio and I worked together for about three years until he was hand picked to go undercover with the mob as Armando 'the Bookman' Langostini. When that happened they needed someone to take over as Ray at Division 27.\" \"You mean for Ray?\" Josie corrected his grammar out of habit. \"No, he means as Ray.\" Ray Kowalski confirmed. \"If they were going to convince everyone that Ray Vecchio was really Armando Langostini then they needed to convince everyone that Ray Vecchio was still working at the District 27 police department. So that's where I came in.\" \"So you came in pretending to be Ray Vecchio?\" Sam commented, an impressed look on his face. \"That must have been hard.\" \"It certainly was.\" Ray nodded. \"If I was to be Ray Vecchio I had to be able to think like him, have the same memories, the same knowledge of case histories. It took a lot of time and coaching.\" \"So did you two hit it off right away?\" The reporter asked curiously. The two friends looked at each other and smiled. \"Pretty much.\" Ray acknowledged with a nod. \"It took us a little while to get use to each other, but we finally worked out our differences.\" The partners shared a knowing smile. Before Josie could ask them to elaborate Maria returned with their drinks. After placing them on the table she said. \"I'll be back in a minute with your salads.\" When she left Stella looked at Josie curiously and asked. \"So you think you got something for a story?\" Josie considered her notepad carefully for several moments, thoughtfully scanning the notes she'd made during the conversation. \"Yeah, I think I do have something here. But I do have a few more questions.\" \"Fire away.\" Ray encouraged eagerly. \"Do you have any memorable cases you'd like to share?\" Once again Stella and Meg exchanged knowing looks. LIFE AND TIMES OF CHICAGO A Weekly Column by Josie Geller Sun-Times Staff Writer Most of us have had the privilege of having at least one really good friend in our lives. Someone you felt you could share anything with; trust anything to. Trust your life with. For most of us our friendships don't involve putting our lives in the hands of our friends, nor having them put there's in ours. But for members of Chicago's finest such trust is a part of every day life. A couple of months ago I had the great honor of meeting two very remarkable police officers with a truly unique relationship. These two men, who are as different as night and day, were thrown together by chance and circumstance and have made a truly exceptional team. This team consists of a well respected Chicago detective who has been recently awarded a citation for bravery, his fourth in his ten year career, and a Constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Canadian officer first came to Chicago about five years ago on the trail of the killers of his father and for a variety of reasons he stayed working as a liaison with the Canadian Consulate. Now some of you may know this remarkable pair, some of you may have witnessed them at work. An odder team you've never met you may think, but a closer one neither. They argue about everything from eating habits to the best way to pursue a case. And sometimes you'd swear that they hated each other, but that is far from true. If you have something bad to say about one of them, you'd better be prepared to face the other. They say that opposites attract and this friendship is the perfect example of that saying. Thrown together by a variety of circumstances beyond their control, they made a partnership seemingly doomed from the start grow and flourish. So much so, that they've become best friends. When asked about the unique partnership both officers' bosses merely shook their heads and grinned with amusement. They're a handful, they said, but they're the best crime fighting team Chicago has ever seen. They're a one-two punch; a duet. The Canadian sets the criminals up, the American knocks them down, or so I'm proudly told. So the next time you see a Chicago flatfoot and a Canadian Mountie walking down the streets of Chicago remember you are seeing true friendship and partnership in action. And from what I understand, you'll never miss seeing them. Just look for the blond man with the crazy hair arguing with the life-size toy soldier. \"I can't believe that we made it to the championships this year!\" Josie commented eagerly to Anita and Aldys. The three of them were sitting in the bleachers watching the two teams warm up. \"I mean when was the last time that the Chicago Sun-Times team actually made it this far?\" \"As much as I hate to voice this out loud, I'm sure that Rob had a lot to do with that.\" Anita remarked, glancing over to where Rob and Sam were having a tête-à-tête by the pitcher's mound. \"Why do you hate to say that out loud?\" Aldys, Rob's now official girlfriend asked curiously. \"Isn't it good to give praise where praise is due?\" \"Of course it is.\" Anita readily agreed. \"But that adorable boyfriend of yours tends to take things to extremes, especially where baseball is concerned. If he heard me giving him credit for getting us this far, next year he'll be even more insufferable then he was this year.\" Josie laughed knowingly. \"If that's at all possible! He's been pretty bad as it is.\" Glancing down at her watch she noted the time. \"Speaking of the beast, I'd better get down there and warm up before he notices that I'm not out there.\" \"Break a leg, Champ!\" Anita teased lightly. \"Gee thanks.\" Sending her friend an amused smile Josie put her baseball cap on and started trotting down the steps to the field. She was so excited about today's game. She had a feeling in her gut that today was going to be the day. The day that Sam finally proposed to her. She'd been waiting for him to try again after that failed attempt last month shortly after Sheila's accident. She knew without a shadow of a doubt that she wanted to be Mrs. Samuel James Coulson. These last few months as Sam's girlfriend had been wonderful. In the confines of his love she had finally put all her insecurities aside and had come to realize just what a valuable and special person she was. She'd finally managed to exercise Billy Prince and the rest of her High School bullies from her life. It had been a real liberating experience. One that made her feel much stronger and more self-assured. Unfortunately, that didn't make her anymore sure footed. Just as she reached the last step her foot caught on the unlevel edge and she started plunging head first into the field. Suddenly her fall was stayed as a pair of muscular arms grabbed her, pulling her against a broad chest. \"Are you okay?\" A male voice asked with visible concern. Josie nodded her head against the chest, a bright stain burning her cheeks. As she pushed herself gently away she mumbled an apology. \"I'm sorry. My mother always warned me about running down stairs.\" \"Hey, it's okay.\" He told her easily, an amused smile on his face. \"I always enjoy having a beautiful woman fall for me.\" Josie flushed even hotter at his comment and kept her eyes down. She couldn't bare to look him in the eye. \"But maybe before we get married we should try dating a bit first.\" At those words she looked up at him and then nearly gaped in surprise. He gave her a curious look, but took her reaction in stride. Extending his hand he introduced. \"My name's Bill Prince. What's yours?\" \"Josie.\" She whispered, her eyes still wide as she unconsciously reached out and shook his hand. \"Well, Josie it's a pleasure to meet you.\" He told her sincerely, giving her a pleasant smile. \"What do you say about going out and getting a pizza after the game? We can celebrate together.\" \"Celebrate?\" She gave him a puzzled look. \"Sure,\" He acknowledged eagerly. \"We're on opposite teams after all. One of us is going to be needing to celebrate. What do you say? Looser buys winner supper. Or winner buys looser supper. Whatever I end up being that allows me to buy for you. What do you say? We can get better acquainted over pepperoni.\" He flashed her a charming smile. Josie's eyes narrowed slightly as she gave him an angry look. \"I think that you and I are well enough acquainted, Mr. Prince.\" She told him coolly. \"As a matter of fact, as far as I'm concerned I wish that you and I had never met.\" Then without another word she turned on her heels and fled back to the dressing rooms. Bill gaped in astonishment after her. \"What did you say to her?\" An angry voice demanded from behind him. Bill turned around and found an all too familiar face behind him. He felt his jaw start to ache as his mind traveled back to the last time he'd seen this young man so upset. Holding his hands up in surrender Bill said lightly. \"Hey, Rob, how's it going?\" \"What did you say to her?\" Rob demanded again, his eyes sparking with hatred. \"Nothing!\" Bill insisted earnestly. \"She tripped on the stairs, I caught her, we said 'hi', I introduced myself and invited her out for supper after the game and then she flipped and took off. I swear to you, Rob I never did anything to her! I was a complete gentleman. I was even charming.\" \"That would be a first.\" Rob spat out bitingly. \"I don't think you've ever been any of those when it comes to her. You certainly weren't on Prom Night and she's lived with that for the last eight years of her life.\" Bill frowned at him, not understanding what he was talking about. Suddenly Rob realized that the other man hadn't recognized his sister. \"What's going on over here?\" Another voice suddenly interrupted the pair. Rob and Bill looked over to see Sam approaching them, a concerned look on his face. Looking at Rob he added. \"You've got Gus in a panic. He thinks that you're about to take a round out of the other team's shortstop.\" He gave Bill a friendly smile and gestured towards Rob. \"I hope this guy hasn't been giving you too much of a hard time. He tends to get a little over zealous when it comes to baseball.\" Bill gave Rob a cautious look. \"Yeah, I've heard that.\" \"Sam, this has nothing to do with baseball or the game.\" Rob quickly informed the other man. \"This is about Josie.\" \"What about Josie?\" Sam's concern returned, the pit of his stomach tightening up as he awaited Rob's reply. \"Sam, I'd like you to meet the scum ball who made Josie's Senior Prom night a living hell.\" Rob glared at the man. \"Mr. Billy Prince.\" Bill watched nervously as Sam's face registered several different emotions: surprise, revolution, confusion, anger, hatred. Finally he seemed to settle on one and spoke, his tone one of controlled fury. \"So, you're the guy who's responsible for Josie's insecurities.\" \"I...\" Bill began to speak but Sam cut him off. \"And you're the guy who treated her like dirt on what should have been the most special and memorable night of her High School career.\" \"I didn't...\" Bill tried again, but Sam once again interrupted him. \"You know something, you are an incredibly stupid man.\" When Bill raised his eyebrows at him he continued. \"You had the admiration and adoration of the most incredible young woman that I have ever met and you just threw it away. If that's not stupidity, I don't know what is.\" \"I know she's great.\" Bill acknowledged, finally managing to say something. Sam and Rob both gave him a surprised look. \"But she's just so...\" \"Amazing.\" Sam supplied. \"Intelligent, witty, crazy. Not to mention the most beautiful woman that I've ever laid my eyes on.\" By the time he finished he was looking past Bill to Josie who was standing behind him, tears in her eyes. Bill looked over his shoulder and was surprised to find the young woman that he'd stopped from falling earlier. Suddenly something clicked and his jaw dropped to his shoes. \"Josie Geller?\" \"That's right.\" Josie nodded, glancing at Sam for courage. She had come back to the field just in time to hear what Sam had said to Billy. If she'd thought she couldn't love Sam anymore than she did five minutes ago, she was wrong. She loved him so much more now. \"Wow!\" Billy exclaimed after giving her the once over twice. \"You look wonderful!\" At the flicker of surprise in her eyes he quickly insisted. \"I mean it, you look terrific!\" \"I'm afraid your praise is a little late, Mr. Prince.\" Sam told the other man seriously as he walked over to Josie and slid a possessive arm around her waist. \"I'm afraid you blew your chance at this prize catch.\" He looked down at Josie and gave her a loving smile. \"She's already spoken for. And I'm smart enough to realize what I treasure I have.\" Josie favored him with a tender smile and leaned up to give him a kiss. When they pulled away Sam gave her waist a squeeze and then turned his attention back to Bill. \"I guess I should be thanking you for your great act of stupidity.\" \"What do you mean?\" Bill gave Sam a confused frown. \"Well, isn't it obvious?\" Sam replied lightly. \"Your loss is my gain. And I can assure you that I am never letting her go.\" Once again he turned his smile on Josie. Josie returned the look of affection before looking back to the man who had ruined her life for so long. \"You know, for a longtime I let what you did to me affect how I viewed myself. Every time I looked in mirror all I could see was 'Josie Grossie'.\" \"I didn't start that nickname.\" Bill pointed out a little defensively. He jerked his finger towards Rob. \"That was your brother's invention.\" \"Hey, don't shift the blame.\" Rob objected seriously. \"I've already come clean about that. Besides, that nickname was nothing compared to what you did to her! You humiliated her to the lowest! You...\" \"It's okay, Rob!\" Josie's exclamation interrupted her infuriated brother. When he looked at her she gave him a small smile. \"Rob, I appreciate you standing up for me.\" She looked at Sam. \"Both of you.\" Then squaring her shoulders she added. \"But this is my battle and one that I have to fight for myself.\" A proud smile spread across Sam's face as her confident attitude. Giving her waist a tight squeeze he said. \"I always knew you could.\" He gave her a tender kiss before releasing her. Looking at her brother Sam encouraged. \"Come on, Rob. There's something that I need your help with.\" Rob continued to glare at Bill until Josie gave him a gentle shove. \"Go on, little brother. I can handle things from here.\" Rob gave her a skeptical look for several moments before finally nodding. \"Okay, but if you need anything I'll just be over here.\" \"I appreciate that Rob.\" She gave him a warm smile. \"But I'll be okay.\" She gave Billy a cool look. \"He has no power over me anymore.\" She shifted her gaze to Sam and gave him a warm smile. Sam reached over and gave her arm a supportive squeeze. \"Come on, Rob.\" He encouraged his companion. \"Let's go get ready.\" As Sam and Rob moved off Josie turned her attention back to the young man who had haunted her dreams and plagued her life for eight long years. She was surprised to find that he was watching her nervously, maybe even a bit shamefully now that they were alone. Josie opened her mouth to begin the speech that she had so carefully rehearsed a few minutes ago in the locker room. She was really going to let him have it for all the horrible, uncalled for things that he had done to her Promo night and during the weeks that followed. He'd made her life a living nightmare, the memory of those weeks affecting her life right up to now. But all that hurt, all the anger, all the cutting remarks died instantly on her lips with Billy's next words. \"I am so sorry.\" Josie blinked a couple of times at his heartfelt apology, not sure she had heard him right. But Bill took advantage of the silence and rushed on. \"I don't blame you for being angry with me - for hating me even, but please believe me when I say that I am really and truly sorry for what happened.\" \"Why?\" Josie took him back by the question. \"Why?\" He repeated, not quite sure what she was looking for. \"Why did you do it?\" She asked, her tone very cool and controlled. \"Why did you take what should have been one of the greatest nights of my life and turn it into a horror fest? Why did you do that?\" \"It was Mike's idea.\" Bill told her honestly. \"It was all Mike.\" Mike Fenton had been Billy's best friend in High School. When Josie had read the poem that she had written for Billy in front of the class, Mike had sat behind Billy and laughed and thumped his friend on the shoulders the whole time. \"He was the one that put me up to it. He was the one that made the videotape, who posted the pictures, who set the whole thing up. It was all Mike.\" \"But why did you go along with it?\" She pressed, her tone trembling slightly. \"Why did you throw eggs at me? Why did you flaunt your gorgeous cheerleader date in my face? Why did you let Mike do all that other stuff?\" Heavy silence hung in the air as she awaited his reply. \"Because I was a chicken.\" He finally admitted shamefully. With a deep sigh he started to explain. \"I knew you had a crush on me, hell the whole school knew it. You weren't exactly subtle about the fact.\" Josie flushed slightly at the memory of how she'd continually fawned and fussed over him. \"Anyway, Mike use to have a hay day teasing me about it. He was really getting quite obnoxious about the whole thing. Then the day that you read that poem...well he really thought that was great. He rode me the rest of the day about it until I'd finally had enough.\" He colored slightly as he told her. \"Truth be told, I really liked your poem. As a matter of fact, I was really touched that you'd bother to write it, especially after the fact that I'd always made fun of you before that.\" \"Then...\" \"Why?\" He finished with a knowing smile. Billy sighed and sat down on a cement step at the base of the stairs that Josie had earlier tripped down. Looking at his hands for a few moments he paused before looking up at her and admitting. \"Because in my anger with Mike I unintentionally confessed that I liked your poem.\" She was very tempted to dismiss his words as false, but her experience with the cool kids at South Glen South helped her to understand exactly how big a faux pas such an admission on his part would have been in the High School inner social circles. Sitting down on the step beside him she nodded her head and said. \"I see. So, let me guess. Mike used that little piece of information to blackmail you into humiliating me.\" \"Exactly.\" He nodded his head. \"He said that he'd tell the whole school that I was in love with you if I didn't go along with him. And my 'cheerleader date' was actually his girlfriend sent to make sure that I didn't back out at the last minute. She wasn't even suppose to show herself. That was her idea at the last minute.\" Josie gave him a careful look before gently asking. \"What would have been so wrong with everyone thinking you at least like me. All social standing aside.\" \"Nothing, in retrospect.\" He confessed honestly. \"But right then everything. I was one of the most popular boys in school and you were...\" \"Josie Grossie.\" She finished when he hesitated. He gave her an embarrassed look. She looked out to the ball field where the two teams were warming up. \"Five months ago I would have said that you were lying to me. That you were trying to shift the blame and weasel out of taking responsibility for what you had done. But due to some events since then I'm inclined to believe you. I'm not saying that I'm ready to forgive you, at least not yet, but at least I don't hate you anymore. As a matter of fact I feel sorry for you.\" She gave him a sorrowful look. \"I feel sorry for you because you missed out on what could have been, if nothing else, a wonderful friendship. Believe it or not I have turned out to be a pretty amazing person, or so I've been told. I'm smart, I'm funny and I'm really quite beautiful both inside and out. If I was you I'd be kicking myself pretty hard for missing out on a pretty good catch.\" Josie told him all this without the slightest hint of pomposity or egotism. She was merely stating the facts that she had recently come to learn and accept herself. She was surprised when he nodded his head in agreement. \"I do.\" He gave her a sad little smile. \"You really are amazing, Josie Geller. And I hope one day you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Maybe one day we can even be friends.\" \"Maybe.\" She acknowledged neutrally, not willing to commit to anything at this point. The sat in silence for several minutes as they continued to watch their respective teams warm up. Eventually Josie asked. \"So what happened to Mike? You two still good friends?\" With his eyes still fixed on the two teams Billy replied. \"I won't be seeing him for at least another five to ten.\" When she looked at him in confusion he added. \"Mike's in Joliet.\" Josie's eyes widened. \"What did he do?\" \"Armed Robbery.\" Bill replied. \"Held up a bank a couple of years ago from what I hear. I hadn't seen him really since a year or so after High School.\" \"So you lost your High School best friend too.\" Josie mused soberly, glancing slightly towards him. \"Looks like we have something in common after all.\" Billy looked at her sorrowful face and prompted gently. \"What happened?\" Josie gazed unseeingly back to the ball players. \"She was killed in a car accident last month.\" There was a long pause as Billy struggled to find something to say. Finally he settled for a simple. \"I'm sorry.\" Josie nodded in acknowledgement of his sympathy, but suddenly found that she was struggling to hold back tears. Not wanting him to see her cry she suddenly jumped to her feet and rambled. \"I should really go warm up before Gus has a fit.\" \"Gus your boyfriend?\" Billy queried, also rising to his feet. Josie shook her head. \"No, Gus is my boss and our coach. My boyfriend's name is Sam.\" \"He seems like a nice enough guy.\" Billy remarked, noticing that the man in question was watching them carefully from the pitcher's mound. \"And he certainly seems to adore you.\" Josie smiled and followed Billy's gaze. \"Yes he does. And the feeling is quite mutual. He is a wonderful man.\" \"Well, I'm glad that you've found happiness.\" Billy told her earnestly, reaching over and taking her hand in both of his. \"You deserve it. And please believe me when I say that I'm really very sorry for what happened Prom night and during the weeks that followed. If its any consolation, after I healed from the beating Rob gave me for what happened, I inflicted the exact same thing on Mike.\" Josie gave him a slightly amused smile. \"It makes me feel somewhat better.\" Her expression sobered slightly as she admitted. \"I'm glad we ran into each other today. Now I think I may be able to finally let go of the rest of the pain I've been harboring since High School and move on with my life.\" \"I'm glad that I could help.\" He told her. \"But I'm sorry that I inflicted the pain on you in the first place.\" \"Well at least now I know that it wasn't entirely your fault.\" She commented thoughtfully. \"I'm not sure why, but that thought helps take a lot of the sting out of what happened.\" Billy gave her a slow smile and shook his head in obvious wonderment. \"You know something, you were right You really are amazing.\" He leaned down and planted a soft kiss on her cheek. \"I wish you all the best.\" He whispered into her ear before giving her hand one final squeeze and moving off to join his teammates on the field. Josie watched him go, a mixture of surprise and confusion washing over her. For eight years she had wondered what it would be like to see him again. For eight years she had run hundreds of different scenarios over and over in her mind. What she'd say, what he would say, what she'd do. And now that it had finally happened she found that none of those scenarios had come true. That was because not once did she expect or imagine that he would ask her forgiveness. Never in a million years would she have suspected that he had been put up to it, that he himself had been a victim of an even more evil mastermind. Or that all this had happened because he had voice to his best friend that he had liked her poem. Before her experience at South Glen South she would never have believed such an explanation. She would probably have laughed in his face and accused him of telling tales, but her experience there had given her an inside understanding of the inner workings of the in crowd that she'd never had before. She hadn't realized before then that the popular kids were just as much a slave to opinion of their peers as the other kids were. Perhaps even more so because they were more in the spotlight. She was very grateful that she'd had the opportunity to acquire that knowledge since it would definitely help speed up the healing process. Josie shifted her attention back to the ball field and noticed that it was now devoid of players. Glancing at her watch she realized it was only five minutes 'til game time. Looking back up again she was surprised to find Sam standing on the pitcher's mound, a microphone in his hand. \"Josie Geller, would you please come to the pitcher's mound.\" He paged over the sound system. \"What's he up to?\" Josie mused to herself as she headed towards her boyfriend at a slow jog. \"What's going on?\" She asked him when she reached the pitcher's mound. Sam just gave her a warm smile and reached out to take her hand in his. Josie was vaguely aware that there was music playing over the ball field's stereo system. Her eyes widened slightly and her lips formed a perfect 'O' as Sam began singing the lyrics to Lonestar's new song Amazed : Every time our eyes meet, This feeling inside me, Is almost more than I can take. Baby when you touch me, I can feel how much you love me, And it just blows me away. I've never been this close to anyone, or anything I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams. I don't know how you do what you do, I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better. I wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side. Forever and ever Every little thing that you do, Baby I'm amazed by you.\" Josie found herself unable to move or to even breathe as she tried hard to comprehend what was going on. It felt like a dream. Here she was, standing on the pitcher's mound of a ball field before hundreds of onlookers, being serenaded by her wonderfully romantic boyfriend, who she was surprised to learn had a terrific voice. She strongly suspected that her earlier 'feeling' was coming true. That she was right now being proposed to by the most wonderful man she had ever met. She found herself trembling slightly with anticipation as he continued to sing: The smell of your skin, The taste of your kiss, The way you whisper in the dark. Your hair all around me, baby you surround me. You touch every place in my heart. Oh it feels like the first time, every time. I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes. I don't know how you do what you do, I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better. I wanna spend the rest of my life, with you by my side. Forever and ever Every little thing that you do, Baby I'm amazed by you.\" Josie watched wordlessly as Sam went down on one knee and released her hand to pull a small velvet box out of his pocket. Opening it to show her the ring he finished the last lyrics of the song: Every little thing that you do, I'm so in love with you, It just keeps getting better. I wanna spend the rest of my life, With you by my side, Forever and ever. Every little thing that you do, Baby, I'm amazed by you.\" \"Josie Geller, I love you. Will you marry me?\" Josie felt tears spring into her eyes as she whispered softly. \"Yes.\" The next thing she next knew Sam was on his feet and kissing her tenderly on the lips, all his love and emotions pouring into the kiss as cheers and applause exploded around them. After a few moments Sam pulled back and brought her attention back to the ring he still held in his hand. Taking her left hand in his he held the ring just at the tip of her ring finger. \"May I?\" He asked with a smile. \"You may.\" She assured him and couldn't help the tears that fell as he slipped the gold and diamond rind on her finger. After admiring it for a couple moments she pronounced. \"It's beautiful.\" Then she threw her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" He hugged her tightly and then kissed her again. They were interrupted by the sound of Rob clearing his throat. \"Sorry guys.\" Rob actually did look embarrassed about interrupting them. \"But the ump says its time to play ball.\" Sam nodded and looked back to Josie. \"You ready to play a little baseball?\" \"With you in my life, I'm ready for anything.\" She exclaimed excitedly, her eyes sparkling with eagerness.

Комнатный цветок – лучший спутник: не жалуется, не осуждает и всегда поймёт. Так говорил их друг. Утром он погиб в глубине каменных джунглей на том берегу Ист-Ривер. Отсюда здания кажутся шаткими, до неба, стопками старых, пожелтевших со временем газет: на этажах-страницах навсегда затерялись их имена и запутались все следы-строчки. Лишь цветок, немой свидетель, пережил на своем веку побольше, чем приходится иному человеку, и приехал во двор Школы Спенсера на ее руках. Всё, что им обоим осталось, – попытаться пустить здесь корни, смириться и как-то жить дальше. Закатный свет, пустой горшок на траве. – Думаю, тебе будет здесь хорошо... – маленькими ладонями она заботливо собрала комковатую почву, как поправляют одеяло. Добавила: – Леон… Смертельные игры закончились, закрыты все счета, ей крупно повезло – она осталась на этом свете. Ради чего? Несколько лет потратить за партой, о'кей, а что потом?.. «Ну, что я буду тут делать одна? Леон... Леон, почему ты не взял меня с собой?» Закат горел, сжигал ультрамариновое небо. Деревья чёрными узорами врастали в темнеющую синеву. Через реку бесчисленными угольками тлели окна враждебного бетонного острова. Она сидела в рекреации и делала вид, что вместе с другими учениками смотрит старенький телевизор. Мультяшные голоса мешали с назойливостью жужжащей мухи, яркая картинка прыгала в глаза, неоново мерцала по краю коротко отрезанных волос, отвлекала. К чёрту всё. И школу, в том числе, – о, она тут не задержится! Кто угодно прильнул бы душой к белым стенам, пыльным книгам и скучным учителям, но только не она! Тони сказал зайти через месяц… Чуть не упала с неудобной зеленоватой табуретки, круглой и наглухо закрашенной. Конечно же! Не мог ведь Леон разгуливать по городу, когда вся полиция на ушах! Полиция… С... Стэн. Стэнсфилд. Норман... Комната сорок шесть ноль два... Отзвук его голоса ещё звенел в ушах: не первый – срывающийся, резкий, а другой – вкрадчивый, вползающий под кожу… У этого голоса есть лицо, и на этом лице улыбка, искажённая грязной лампой и потому гадкая. – Как твоё имя, ангел?.. Нездоровая, неровная доброжелательность. И её ответ – правдивый, отважно-недоверчивый: – Матильда. От холодных твёрдых стен – насмешливое эхо в ответ на её лепет про убитого брата. – Это… что-то личное? Не так ли?.. У него костюм одного цвета с плиткой на стенах. С потолка – масляный жёлтый свет и грубоватые тени – не рассмотреть деталей. Револьвер, из которого он когда-то застрелил её братика, ещё совсем тёплый, у шеи, у щеки… Дрожь в ожидании прощального выстрела – но лишь касание за касанием, мимолётно, обжигающе… Кубарем прокатилась мелодия заставки, молниеносно сменились кадры. Матильда очнулась, когда девчонки уже проходили к выходу мимо неё, на краткий шаг закрывали экран, кто-то задел джинсовой юбкой за тонкую коленку с ссадиной. Политика, спорт, культура – жизнь текла полноводной рекой, как ни в чём не бывало… – Криминальная хроника. По предварительной версии, причиной взрыва в жилом доме, прогремевшего минувшим утром, оказалось взрывное устройство, приведённое в действие злоумышленником… Голос диктора бесстрастно препарировал её любовь и тревогу, раскладывал на затёртые фразы. Сейчас он скажет что-то вроде «задержать не удалось». – …Напомним, что утром началась спецоперация по задержанию опасного преступника. При штурме злоумышленником было оказано сопротивление, повлекшее потери убитыми и ранеными среди стражей правопорядка. Среди пострадавших числится начальник отдела по борьбе с оборотом наркотиков Норман Стэнсфилд… Продолжение «…лично осуществлявший руководство операцией» уже под взрывы воображаемых фейерверков… Интересно, как именно он сдох? Разделил жалкую участь продажных дружков или удостоился контрольного в дурную голову?.. Руководил операцией лично! Ну, как она тогда попалась в здании федералов?.. Почему не выхватила пистолет из пакета, не разнесла ему голову, а... замерла, и воля изменила, покинула с испуганным вдохом? Леон бы так не оплошал... Убеждал ведь забыть о мести, но всё-таки достал этого подонка… – …Сам злоумышленник погиб, по предварительной версии следственной группы, в момент приведения в действие взрывного устройства… Сердце упало и разбилось, внутри всё свернулось в холодный узел. Нет, он не мог... Другой бы мог, а он – нет. Леон бы обвязал гранатами того мерзавца, убившего её братика. – …В данный момент пострадавшие госпитализированы. Из них восемь человек, в том числе Стэнсфилд, в тяжёлом состоянии… Нет. Не может быть. Жив... Это несправедливо! «В тяжёлом состоянии». Лишь бы в крайне тяжёлом – таком, чтобы хотел поскорее откинуться. Грустная усмешка тронула губы Матильды: кажется, он словил «номер с кольцом». То, что от него осталось, хорошо пострадает перед смертью, он это заслужил. Дрожь потревоженной ярости, обиды и горя приковала к месту. Начиналась следующая программа, а она все сидела, обхватив голову. Экран мигнул и погас. – Об этом ты рассказывала, Матильда, ведь так? – прозвучал у нее за спиной голос миссис Макалистер, директрисы. Невысокая сухая женщина остановилась посреди пустой и холодной рекреации – как пламя свечи в обледеневших стенах. – Это всё враньё, – слова застревали тихо, царапали горло. – Всё наоборот. Этот урод из полиции убивал беззащитных людей, – разъясняла Матильда. – Он – тот, кто спас меня, – да, он чистильщик, самый лучший, да. Но у него было правило: «Ни женщин, ни детей». Это всё... что они говорят... неправда. – Матильда, – слова не поколебали спокойствия приглушённого голоса – в нём прозвучал резон, возвративший с небес на землю. – А тебе есть, чем доказать свои слова полиции? Матильда чуть встала, и ноги подкосились, она зябко всхлипнула и упала обратно. – Послушайте, он жив... – Мне жаль, девочка, но иногда... – Сдержанно, чуть скорбно. – Нет-нет... Про него... пока не знаю. Полицейский! Он жив! Он может вернуться... – Зачем? Ты же ничего не видела. И пустота. В маленьком холодильнике в углу завозился, побежал фреон. В синеве за окном зашумели почерневшие листья, сыграл пару нот жиденький дождик. – Мииссис Макалистер, прошу...– Матильда посмотрела снизу вверх. – Это очень важно! Вы не понимаете...Он на всё способен, просто... на всё. Эта тихая, но твердая, словно кремень, женщина... Хрупкая... Неужели она не боится? Неужели... не бросит?.. Во всяком случае, на неё не действуют милые уловки и полные слёз глаза. – Значит, ты не пойдёшь в полицию? – утвердительно и окончательно. Словно не замечая, как в Матильде гаснет надежда, она продолжила в ответ на тишину: – Ну, вот и славно. Если тебе не с чем идти в полицию, просто забудь эту историю и... держи имя своего друга в сердце. Хорошо, я... не буду тебя переубеждать. Но... будем считать, что тот парень уже наказан. А у тебя вся жизнь впереди! Это, Матильда, бесценный дар... но не вещь... Она похожа на цветок – ею нужно заниматься. – Тонкие, как веточки, руки твёрдо легли на поникшие плечи. – Учиться! – Директриса заглянула в лицо Матильде. – Кстати, я подыскала тебе соседку. Не настаиваю на вашей крепкой дружбе, но думаю, вы не будете друг другу мешать.[Chapter 2] Со следующего дня Матильда всерьез взялась за дело, как и было условлено. Посещение занятий, домашняя работа, никаких вредных привычек. А еще никаких чистильщиков и продажных копов. Небольшую комнату она делила с девчонкой по имени Кэт, и та действительно не доставляла проблем. Она принадлежала к той редкой разновидности, которая не вызывала у Матильды ассоциаций с ее покойной так называемой сестрой: была немногословна, тряпками не интересовалась, не придиралась и не выпендривалась. Пожалуй, для ее дел все складывалось наилучшим образом – Матильда как бы была не одна, но и не втягивалась в отношения между учениками. Ее заинтересовали познания соседки в бойскаутских делах – это, конечно, не заменило бы обучения чистильщика, но помогло бы не превратиться со временем в слабачку и неженку. Кэт разрешила под присмотром пользоваться своим биноклем, в который она сама рассматривала звездное небо, город вдали или птиц на деревьях. Увеличенные виды напомнили Матильде уроки с Леоном по стрельбе с оптикой, и картинка поплыла от некстати слез… Все прошло, надо было снова брать себя в руки. Единственное, чем Матильда первое время не занималась даже для вида, так это внеклассная активность. У нее был свой собственный, не терпящий небрежения, проект. Кое-что личное. Во второй половине дня, на бегу пообедав после занятий, девочка поехала в город. В самый первый день она посетила их с Леоном последнее убежище. Зданию здорово досталось: были выбиты стекла, разворочен и закопчен вестибюль, на тротуаре еще валялись обломки и мусор. Парадный вход бессильно разевал двери обугленной пастью. Тут все и произошло. Нырять в черноту за перекрестье желтых запрещающих лент девочке не хотелось – это было не то, что тогда, в квартире по соседству с Леоном. Сквозной коридор до самого выхода на другом конце дышал страхом. Нет, Леон не мог так просто погибнуть здесь! Матильда так и замерла: ей показалось, что у ближайшего углубления в стене она видит брызги крови. Даже если кровь принадлежала Стэну, это не делало картину приятнее. Она побежала прочь, обгоняя равнодушных прохожих. Надо было успокоиться. У нее еще были дела в городе. Этот день и несколько последующих Матильда дежурила у входа в Управление по борьбе с оборотом наркотиков. Чествовали погибших при исполнении служебного долга. Еще вчера она ненавидела тех людей в масках, подстроивших засаду. Но тут злость сошла на нет. Их гибель была печальна сама по себе и бессмысленна, ведь отправиться в могилу должен был только один человек. И это был не Леон. Ее неприятно удивило и возмутило, что Стэн считался здесь героем, доблестным копом, не побоявшимся встретится лицом к лицу с коварным киллером-боевиком-террористом после того, как тот уложил пару десятков бойцов специального отряда полиции. То и дело все говорили об ужасном взрыве, но единого мнения на сей счет не было. Стэн получил серьезные травмы, но в ад не торопился, еще занимая койку в реанимации. Мужчины скорбно качали головами, а женщины прикрывали губы ладонями, словно выражая обеспокоенность его судьбой. Они даже не подозревали, какой моральный урод на самом деле работал рядом с ними все эти годы. Насколько все плохо, никто не говорил, но она уловила пару разговоров его коллег насчет необходимости пожертвований на лечение пострадавшим в операции. А еще узнала, что несколько сотрудников планируют навестить товарищей. Но самым ценным был адрес госпиталя. Так что Матильда могла навестить Стэна в индивидуальном порядке до того, как он отмучается сам. «И я отомщу ему за братика и за Леона», - думалось ей в те вечера за обязательной помывкой листьев цветка по имени Леон. Через неделю энтузиазм начал покидать ее. Выяснилось, что те месяцы, которые Матильда училась убивать, ее сверстники провели с большей пользой. Во всяком случае, программа давалась ей труднее, и девочка не представляла, как догнать и перегнать ее. Получая назад свою работу, Матильда не понимала, в чем ее ошибки, а если и понимала, то не помнила, как могла их совершить. Будет время, когда она осознает, что тогда могла снова скатиться обратно, едва попробовав учиться. Но Матильда была слишком упряма, чтобы спустить все на тормозах, и обратилась к соседке. Та подсказала учебник, по которому Матильда смогла восстановить пробелы, а за домашним заданием объясняла ей на простых примерах ту базу, которой не хватало. – Кэт, – спросила как-то Матильда, – неужели тебе все это интересно, что ты готова со мной сидеть? – ее душа требовала честного обмена. Например, ее учат убивать, а она взамен покупает молоко и стирает. – Что ты, – небрежно махнула Кэт своей мощной ручкой, – повторенье – мать ученья! Кто же еще меня погоняет по старым урокам? – А зачем это тебе? – спросила Матильда и тут же пожалела о глупом вопросе. – Высшее образование – важная ступень на пути к успеху, - убежденно сказала Кэт. – Позволить его себе могут либо богатые, либо способные и трудолюбивые. Первое – не наш случай, а над вторым надо стараться. – А кто твои родители? – вырвалось у Матильды. Она впервые видела такое искреннее стремление к успеху в сочетании с добротой. На самом дне, где она выросла, такого не встречалось. Девочка начинала осознавать глубину этого дна. – Мама – официантка. Отец – полицейский. Был. А твои? – У меня никого нет. – Прости. – Это ты прости. – Проехали, – Кэт сделала паузу. – Матильда, ты сегодня опять в город до вечера?.. К слову, разведка в госпитале столкнулась с непредвиденным препятствием. Людей с улицы к реанимации не подпускали на пушечный выстрел, не говоря уже о посещениях. Даже справиться о состоянии пациента Матильда не могла – она была ему никто, и звать ее было, соответственно, никак. В любом случае, подобраться к клиенту пока было проблематично. И Матильда решила ограничиться внешним наблюдением. – …Да, поеду в город. И вот еще... – Матильда замешкалась, так как в голове у нее вертелся план, а на языке – просьба. Соседка вопросительно посмотрела на нее. - Можно мне брать на прогулки твой бинокль? А я буду тебя про все-все уроки спрашивать! – выпалила девочка. – Можно, – сурово ответила Кэт, – но никому не показывать, не ронять, каждый день отчитываться о состоянии. Не брать, когда он мне нужен. Условия более чем устраивали Матильду. Иногда она даже представляла, как они вместе вламываются в офис Стэна и расстреливают всех копов-оборотней. За Леона. Позже эти детские фантазии ушли. И не только потому, что Кэт, дочь копа, никогда бы не стала вести такую жизнь. План с биноклем был элементарен. Когда сгустились бы сумерки, и в госпитале включили бы свет, девочка планировала изучать его обитателей из окружающих зданий подобно коту, наблюдающему за рыбками в аквариуме. Но это оказалось не таким простым делом. Понадобилось исследовать подступы к высотам, а высот требовалось немало, учитывая протяженность периметра стационара госпиталя. Не все эти здания имели свободный выход на крышу, у некоторых охранялся подъезд. И тем не менее, за неделю ей удалось gjcvjnhtnm во все окна. Увиденное Матильду разочаровало. Во-первых, изнутри палаты выглядели иначе, чем она себе представляла – это могло доставить сложности. Во-вторых, что самое главное, она так и не увидела лицо, которое узнала бы из тысяч и от которого ее воротило. По какому-то закону Мерфи, лучший обзор плохо «простреленных» окон открывался как раз с единственной непокоренной ею высоты. Охранники того офисного здания были многочисленны, бдительны и непреклонны. А ей-то надо было лишь высмотреть в одном окне нужного человека. Леон бы решил эту проблему за пять минут. И, будучи готовой мстить за его гибель, Матильда все равно ждала его – для нее он был жив и скрывался где-то. Так хотелось знать больше, а до визита к Тони надо было выдержать еще две недели. Ее вендетта буксовала. Стэн мог отправиться в мир иной до их прощальной встречи. Его могли перевести в другую палату или в другой госпиталь, и тогда все усилия пропали бы впустую. От нечего делать Матильда не только просматривала доступные окна госпиталя в слабой надежде, но и отслеживала ситуацию у здания Управления. К ее удивлению, о той громкой спецоперации уже успели подзабыть: Стэна вспомнили один раз, мол, и другим парням тогда досталось. Главная черта обыденности - короткая память людей на события. Ведь за каждой старой сводкой новостей остаются без внимания чьи-то перевернутые жизни. Под действием всеобщего равнодушия и затишья Матильда задалась вопросом, с которого, как она поняла, и надо было начинать. А зачем ей самой нужна эта встреча? Чего она хочет? Убить его? Но как знать, смерть может стать для него лучшим подарком. Радовать его она не собиралась. Посмотреть собственными глазами на его страдания и сполна удовлетвориться местью? Напомнить, за что это ему?.. А вдруг он не сможет ее видеть или слышать, или вообще будет без сознания? Спросить о Леоне? Сердце екнуло. Но ведь Леон найдет ее сам, разве нет? Убедиться, что этот гад уже никому не навредит? А если все совсем не так, и он еще вполне силен, чтобы доставить проблем и ей в том числе? Даже в первую очередь. Таким образом, Матильда знала лишь, что, пока Стэн жив, ей остается только подбираться к нему все ближе, чтобы при необходимости нанести удар первой. Чувство неопределенности и бессилия угнетало. Зато домашние задания стали лучше – она была зла и хотела разорвать этот несправедливый мир с его законами подлости, пусть хотя бы успехами в школе. Все однажды заканчивается. Хорошо это или плохо, зависит от ситуации. В начале четвертой недели своей новой жизни Матильда столкнулась с обеими сторонами этой истины. После неумеренных разъездов по городу у нее почти закончились деньги, что ей выдал Тони, – это было плохо. Неприступное офисное здание напротив вожделенных окон госпиталя предстало перед ней в строительных лесах – это было хорошо. Когда стемнело, Матильда приступила к отложенному плану. Свист ветра в ушах и скрип опор воспринимались, как должное. По-настоящему ее страшила перспектива разбить бинокль. Высоты она почти не боялась – пока лезла, вспоминала, как в детстве любила сидеть, свесив ноги в бездонную темноту лестничного пролета, в котором бесследно исчезала поспешно выброшенная папироса. Привычная жизнь без руля и ветрил, а с нею и детство, ушла совсем недавно – после той перестрелки, которую устроил негодяй, полеживающий сейчас в здании напротив. А чувство такое, словно за эту пару месяцев безвозвратно отжила свое еще одна такая Матильда. Утвердившись на достаточной высоте, она с величайшей осторожностью достала свою оптику и изучила просматриваемые окна. Первые два этажа разочаровали ее, и девочка поднялась выше. Безрезультатна была и вторая позиция. Отчаянье ее росло по мере сокращения неисследованного пространства. Бинокль предательски прыгал в уставшей тонкой руке, лицо свело судорогой от ветра и напряжения, надо было дать себе отдохнуть. Но ей было не до того. От неожиданности она едва не сорвалась. ...Это лицо с обманчиво мягкими чертами она сразу узнала, даже частично скрытое повязкой. Матильду затрясло. Она словно оказалась в холодном свете разрядной лампы рядом с больничной койкой своего заклятого врага. Складывалось впечатление, что на нем живого места нет – все в бинтах и гипсе. Девочка ничего в этом не понимала, ей было достаточно того, что он жив и, вроде, даже не особо увечен. А это значит, что он может и должен понести наказание в полной мере. Время шло, ветер становился прохладнее, но Матильда не могла оторвать взгляд от цели. В палату то и дело заходил кто-то из медицинского персонала, видимо, проверяли аппаратуру, переписывали показания. Стэн лежал ровно, не реагируя на людей и их манипуляции. Больше всего Матильда жалела, что в руках у нее просто бинокль, а не винтовка c оптическим прицелом. Когда человек в халате потянулся к выключателю, и счастливо обретенное окно обернулось темным провалом, Матильда поняла, что задержалась непозволительно долго.[Chapter 3] – Так, прохлаждаемся? – Учительница физкультуры бодрым шагом подошла к группе учениц на матах. – А кто через пару лет будет сидеть на диетах и обходить Макдональдс после шести вечера? Ответ: кто мало двигается! Вон, посмотрите на Ландо. Девочки нехотя поднялись и вышли на круг ленивой трусцой. – Ландо, Ландо… – угрюмо заметил кто-то из них уже на ходу. – Да она вообще странная. Может, мне еще по два литра молока в день выпивать, как она?.. Матильда решила возобновить тренировки. Учить ее было некому, набор убийцы-новичка погиб на съемной квартире, но развивать ловкость и силу она могла самостоятельно. В бытность ученицей Леона эту часть жизни профессионала она находила тяжелой и скучной, но сейчас ничего другого не оставалось. Девочка рассудила, что, придет ли Стэн забрать ее драгоценную молодую жизнь, или она сама отправится вершить правосудие – когда что-то из этого случится, она должна быть в хорошей физической форме. Она могла и не вспомнить о важности упражнений, если бы не ее злополучное позднее возвращение с удачной разведки. Миссис Макалистер рассказывала, как ждала ее почти до полуночи и уже собиралась начать обзванивать больницы, когда пропажа появилась на пороге школы – в синяках, ссадинах, стучащая зубами от холода, но с бешеным огоньком в глазах. И Матильда была готова поспорить на что угодно, что директриса догадалась о ее интересе в городе, хоть та не сказала об этом ни слова. Последствия не заставили себя ждать: Матильде запретили покидать пределы школьного двора в ближайшую неделю и обязали усиленно готовиться к контрольным. Стэну бы это понравилось. «Дети должны были быть в школе, не так ли?» Ей же было ни холодно, ни жарко: львиная доля ее последних карманных денег осталась в ночном такси, и, будучи лишенной средств на проезд, она ровным счетом ничего не теряла от этих ограничений. А после контрольных и домашнего ареста как раз подходило время навестить старика Тони. И этой встречи Матильда начинала побаиваться. Она слишком часто вспоминала те события: неудачное покушение на Стэнсфилда, людей в масках на пороге дома, исчезновение ее друга. По мере того, как она приходила в себя от пережитого, ей постепенно открывалась цельная картина, в которой оставалось все меньше противоречий и проявлялось все больше взаимных связей. И эту картину удивительным образом завершали синяки на лице Тони в тот день, когда она с всклокоченными волосами и комнатным цветком на руках пришла в его забегаловку в поисках Леона. Наверняка люди Стэна выбили из Тони информацию, и они заранее знали, где смогут ее получить. А если он связан с этими подонками, то велика вероятность, что они снова сделают ему предложение, от которого он не сможет отказаться. В худшем случае, Стэн потребует выдать ее… Матильда ощутила злость на Тони: а вдруг это он сдал их с Леоном местоположение? Но ее деньги ей понадобятся, иначе она не сможет довершить начатое. Хотя при таком не очень радужном раскладе Тони может отказаться от своих обещаний. Миссис Макалистер и учителя настаивали на важности контрольных. Чтобы как-то себя мотивировать, девочка загадала, что, если хорошо напишет тесты, то и вендетта будет удачной. Сидя за учебниками рядом с Кэт, Матильда всеми чувствами и помыслами находилась в городе, на шестом этаже госпиталя, у койки Стэна. Мысль, что в это же самое время он еще дышит, и его сердце бьется, была невыносима. Ну, ничего. Вот разделается она с учебой, посетит Тони, и тогда ничто не помешает торжеству справедливости. Главное – качаться, пить молоко и мыть листья цветка в саду. – Ну, здравствуй. Получше выглядишь, сразу видно, по улице не мотаешься. Нашла хорошую школу? С виду Тони был благодушен, будто ничего не случилось месяц назад. Желтоватые пятна вокруг левого глаза – вот и все напоминание о том дне. – Да. – Матильда сделала глоток молока. – Я вернулась туда, куда меня записали до всего этого. – Она удержалась от того, чтобы сказать, что в школе у нее оплачен ближайший учебный год, а в дальнейшем потребуется круглая сумма – мало ли, это может стать аргументом в пользу избавления от нее самой, если Тони прижмут обстоятельства. – Про меня кто-нибудь спрашивал? – Нет. – Тони выглядел спокойным. Как и обычно. Только на мгновение посмотрел в сторону. – Ты же понимаешь, что теперь все иначе. Не оглядывайся, живи дальше. У тебя получается. И вот совет – пока поменьше высовывайся в город и не околачивайся здесь: Леон наворотил дел, и тебя могут выловить для расследования. Девочке в твоем возрасте надо учиться, а не показания давать, верно? Матильда снова с трудом сдержалась - на этот раз от вопроса, знает ли он, что Стэн жив. Тем временем Тони положил на стол купюру с портретом Франклина и продолжил: – Вот твои сто баксов, как и договаривались. Увидимся через месяц. Приходи лучше по утрам, когда посетителей немного. Матильда допила молоко. Для храбрости. И серьезно сказала, напустив самый мрачный вид, на который была способна: – Мои расходы возросли. Форма, учебники, канцтовары, экскурсии. А иначе упадет успеваемость, меня отчислят, и я буду доставать тебя, чтоб ты дал мне работу. Тони помедлил, неодобрительно посмотрев на девочку, и положил сверху две десятки. – Приходи через месяц. Но работы для тебя тут не будет. И учись считать деньги, это полезное умение. Покинув заведение Тони, Матильда замедлила шаги у перекрестка в раздумьях, куда отправиться дальше: в Управление или в госпиталь. Поколебавшись, она посчитала маршрут \"У Тони\" – госпиталь – Управление оптимальным. Так получалось быстрее и выгоднее. Старик дал хороший совет. В фойе госпиталя все выглядело так же, как в прошлый раз: очереди к окнам, снующий тут и там персонал, столпотворение. Матильда решила подойти к кабинету, рядом с которым в прошлый раз ей удалось подслушать отрывки разговора. Все-таки бродить по доступным коридорам в надежде встретить кого-то из людей, заходивших в палату Стэна, было крайней мерой. Примерно через полчаса из помещения вышло два человека – как поняла Матильда, это были врачи – и она последовала за ними, стараясь держать дистанцию. С безопасного расстояния она не слышала толком их разговор, но до нее донеслось, что один из них занимается тяжело раненым полицейским, и теперь она твердо знала, как выглядит ее промежуточная цель в этом учреждении. У лестницы в конце крыла врачи расстались, пожелав друг другу удачи, и Матильда продолжила идти за своим объектом наблюдения. Врач свернул в немноголюдный коридор, где исчез за дверью, видимо, своего кабинета, так как воспользовался ключом, который носил с собой. Матильда остановилась у двери. Табличка гласила: «Доктор Дж. А. Баркер», дни и часы приема, в верхней одежде не входить, стучать. Стучать или каким-то другим способом привлекать внимание мистера Баркера девочка не собиралась. Пошуровать в его кабинете в одиночестве было проблематично. Да и она представляла себе очень смутно, что собиралась там найти, и как это что-то приблизило бы ее к палате Стэна. Ее мучительные раздумья за кадкой с фикусом в углу рекреации прервал шум за дверью по соседству с заветным кабинетом. Оттуда вышел молодой парень, видимо, лаборант, в руках которого был целый блок с новенькими пробирками. Он пытался пристроить его и так, и эдак, удерживая на весу и при этом готовясь закрыть дверь подсобного помещения. Пошарил в кармане халата, чертыхнулся, зашел обратно. Вышел озадаченный, видимо, не найдя желаемого, сиречь ключей. Матильда поняла, что это ее шанс. ...Лаборант болезненно хмурил брови, нашептывая: «…Куда я мог их положить… только не сегодня… дерьмовый день… не нарваться бы на Баркера… Джонсон меня убьет…» Это въедливый и вредный тип ждал его в лаборатории еще десять минут назад, надо было срочно идти, а оставить дверь незапертой было нельзя. Слишком много ошибок он совершил за время практики, а теперь еще и эта мелочь… – Э-эй… Лаборант чуть блок не уронил от неожиданности. Темноглазая девочка с короткой стрижкой приветливо ему улыбнулась. – Идите, мистер. А я пока постерегу вашу дверь. Вы надолго? А то я еще маму жду… У Матильды было полчаса. Проводив глазами незадачливого практиканта и оглядевшись по сторонам, она шагнула в подсобку. Стеклянная тара была очень кстати: она нашла что-то вроде стакана и попробовала прослушать через него, что творится в кабинете. Судя по звукам, доктор иногда вставал со стула, брал что-то с полки рядом, листал, выписывал или делал пометки – на слух было трудно разобраться в деталях - и ставил обратно. Матильда огорчилась и вернула стакан на стеллаж. А чего она ждала? Что он будет сам с собой говорить? «А как у нас там мистер Стэнсфилд себя чувствует? А плохо мистеру Стэнсфилду! Да, батенька, не жилец ты, долго не протянешь…» Так удачно все сложилось, и эта выгодная позиция могла пропасть впустую. Интересно, можно ли подружиться с парнем-лаборантом, чтоб пускал тут посидеть? Раздались шаги в коридоре. Ну, вот и все, парень вернулся, а она даже не придумала, как с ним договориться. Но шаги были звонкие, чеканные, уверенные – совсем другие, нежели у лаборанта. И их обладатель остановился, не дойдя до подсобки. За стеной раздался стук в дверь, низкий и сильный голос доктора пригласил войти. Они с посетителем обменялись приветствиями, пока взволнованная Матильда устраивалась поудобнее со стаканом у уха. – Доктор, я должен предупредить о необходимости конфиденциальности своего визита. – Голос посетителя был под стать звуку его шагов. – Наш телефонный разговор подразумевал формат нашего дальнейшего взаимодействия, – заверил мистер Баркер, – и сказанное в этом кабинете не выйдет за его пределы. – Перейду сразу к делу, – не стал медлить посетитель. – Были ли обнаружены следы наркотических веществ в крови вашего пациента? – Так вот оно что, – хмыкнул доктор. – Я не имею права передавать вам данные анализов вне зависимости от их результатов. Приносите соответствующий ордер и тогда получите желаемое. Воцарилась тишина. – Вы не понимаете. – Голос посетителя зазвенел сталью. – Мне не нужны подробные выписки с цифрами, которые ничего мне не говорят. Мне достаточно услышать «да» или «нет». – Нет. Снова пауза. – Вы хотите сказать, не обнаружено? – Хочу сказать, что чту врачебную тайну и клятву Гиппократа. А еще знаю свои права и обязанности, а также права моих пациентов. Матильда испытывала душевную боль, обиду за этого сильного человека, пребывавшего в неведении, и потому искренне защищавшего в тот момент права распоследнего негодяя и подонка. Что речь идет о Стэнсфилде, она не сомневалась. – Мы готовы возместить неудобства, - начал посетитель вкрадчиво. – Неудобства мне возместит ордер, - мягко, но решительно пресек этот поворот доктор. – Благодарю за внимание, - после некоторой паузы сдержанно ответил посетитель. – Жаль. Наше сотрудничество могло способствовать безопасности жителей этого города. Всего доброго, мистер Баркер. – И вам всего доброго. Будьте здоровы. Девочка тихонько подошла к двери, выглянула в коридор и посмотрела вслед уходящему посетителю доктора. Его темные короткие волосы лежали безукоризненно, темный костюм сидел как влитой. Он удалялся стремительно и с таким видом, словно находится у себя дома. Лаборантик, выскочивший с лестницы, так и впечатался в стену, не ожидая встретить на своем пути такое воплощение решительности и деловитости. Матильда твердо решила не упускать этого странного типа из виду и немедленно покинула подсобку. – Девочка! – радости практиканта не было предела. – Спасибо тебе! Подожди, – спохватился он, – в рюкзаке у меня меня \"Сникерсы\" есть! Сейчас вынесу один. – Мама не разрешает мне есть \"Сникерсы\", – сказала Матильда, избегая задержки рядом с благодарным пареньком и переходя на бег. - Бывай! Она проследила, как незнакомец сел в машину на стоянке рядом с госпиталем, и тут же сама поймала такси. – За той машиной! – сказала она таксисту и сразу протянула две десятки – отдавать сразу сотню было жалко. На многозначительный взгляд, в котором читалось недоумение от увиденного – то ли не в меру борзой девчонки, то ли недостаточной, на взгляд этого парня, суммы - она ответила: – Остальное – когда приедем. Когда машина проехала угол с ресторанчиком Тони, Матильда начала ловить себя на чувстве дежавю. Вот так же когда-то она кинулась выслеживать Стэнсфилда по обманчиво прямым и сквозным улицам этого лабиринта из стекла и бетона. Зачем она тогда его спугнула, ну зачем? Глупая девчонка, не продумала план до конца, и Стэн пришел мстить… Она исправится, все учтет, и он пожалеет о содеянном. Раздумья девочки были прерваны. – Приехали! – сказал таксист. Матильда автоматически вышла, не отрывая взгляда от преследуемой машины. – Э! - возмутился водитель. – А остальное? – Мне надо разменять, - отозвалась Матильда, наблюдая, как цель выходит и направляется прочь от стоянки. – И где ты будешь менять, хотел бы я знать? – неприятно удивился таксист. – Это же копы, мне здесь нельзя долго задерживаться! – А двадцатки недостаточно? – Парня нельзя было упускать, все средства были хороши. – То же расстояние утром я проехала за два бакса. Не давая таксисту задержать ее хоть на секунду и запороть всю операцию, Матильда отдала все, что осталось у нее от предыдущей партии денег – все пять долларов – отдала бы больше, но на сотню надо было жить ближайший месяц - и кинулась следом за парнем в… На секунду она встала, как вкопанная, перед знакомой громадой здания Управления. – Офис сорок шесть ноль два, Уилсон, – сказал деловой тип, протягивая удостоверение охраннику на вахте. Голос его выдал отвращение к этой формальной процедуре.[Chapter 4] Матильда сидела в кабинете директора, ожидая миссис Макалистер. Между стеклами лениво жужжала осенняя муха, косые лучи неяркого солнца подсвечивали кружащие в воздухе пылинки. В последний раз ее вызывали сюда две недели назад, если так можно назвать то, что директриса сама дождалась девочку, дабы удостовериться в целости и сохранности непутевой ученицы и сделать внушение. То есть Матильде имело смысл задуматься, что же такого она натворила для того, чтобы находиться сейчас здесь и ждать, возможно, приговора. Как знать, может, так же недоумевал Стэн, когда встретил ее среди бела дня, вооруженную до зубов, готовую пустить в ход весь свой арсенал? «Что же за ужасную мерзость я совершил на этот раз?» А совершил он много чего и продолжал вредить ей, не покидая палаты. Он занимал все ее мысли, перспектива его выживания подпитывала ее страхи, и сравниться с этим могла только вероятность его легкой смерти. Иногда, когда в свободное время ее отпускали злобные размышления о Стэне, она могла позволить себе со светлой грустью вспомнить о Леоне и в очередной раз ощутить свое ни с кем не разделенное одиночество. Молчаливую темноту, которую освещало лишь предвкушение возмездия. Матильде было одновременно сладостно и досадно от перипетий своей тайной миссии. Те минуты ожидания в кабинете она должна была бы связать с провалом на контрольных тестах или со своим поведением, а вместо этого девочка была очень обеспокоена появлением нового игрока на своем поле. Учеба маячила где-то на втором плане, а первый застилала мысль о том, что времени для осуществления мести у нее оставалось все меньше. Да и какой, к черту, план без пистолета и пары гранат? Матильда слышала, что любящие люди могут испытывать страшное чувство – темную сторону любви, называемую ревностью. Ей было не к кому ревновать Леона, кроме цветка и давно погибшей возлюбленной, но, как рассудила девочка, нет дыма без огня. Не зря же Отелло душил Дездемону. И она задумалась, есть ли аналог ревности в ненависти. Если и есть конкретное слово, то оно упорно не шло на ум. Однако девочка знала точно, что именно такое чувство она испытывала к агенту Уилсону. И на то была веская причина: свои мотивы она полагала более серьезными, чем его мелочные карьерные притязания. «Я тут своего человека потерял. Какого еще черта вы от меня хотите?» В связи с разведкой у Управления по борьбе с оборотом наркотиков опасения Матильды успели подтвердиться. Этот парень по-своему мог доставить Стэну неприятностей. Мало того, что он копал под наркозависимость своего коллеги, так было еще кое-что. В Управлении начали поговаривать о том, что инициативы Стэна бывали сомнительны, операции по изъятию зелья получались порой слишком накладные, да и арестовывать зачастую было просто некого – все подозреваемые отправлялись прямиком в морг. Такая смена настроений сотрудников на фоне тяжелого состояния их коллеги не могла произойти без чьей-то меткой подачи. Говорят, если зажигаются звезды, значит, это кому-то надо. Так вот, виновником такой бузы, с большой вероятностью, являлся тот, кто временно занимал офис сорок шесть ноль два и не хотел покидать начальственное кресло. Судя по настрою, Уилсон был готов идти к цели по трупам. Правда, Стэн делал это из любви к искусству и в буквальном смысле слова. Конечно, цели Матильды частично совпадали с целями Уилсона: устремления их обоих не понравились бы Стэну. Но это была ее игра, ее месть, ее вендетта. Это было личное дело. А этот совершенно чужой человек, незнакомый с ее мотивом отомстить за Леона и брата, развернул бурную деятельность, которая могла сорвать это священное действо. Если бы Уилсон добился своего, то Стэну оставалось бы перевестись в другое отделение, уехать, навсегда пропасть у нее из виду, сесть в тюрьму, в конце концов. Конечно, он предпринял бы ответные действия, иначе это был бы не Стэн, но такая ситуация полностью выходила из-под контроля Матильды - начинались бы агентские игры. И эта мысль будила в Матильде вот эту «ревность в ненависти». Для себя она решила: ничего не случится с ее врагом, пока он не заплатит ей по счетам. Девочка задумывалась над тем, не предложить ли Уилсону услуги чистильщика, а взамен попросить лишь оружие и возможность навестить клиента. У нее сложилось впечатление, что он бы не отказался. Но Матильда сообразила, что, сделав грязную работу, окажется левой в этой истории, и оставила эту затею. Доступ к оружию того не стоил... – Матильда, ты делаешь успехи, – с порога заявила миссис Макалистер, в общем-то, не сияя особым счастьем, что было ожидаемо при ее сдержанности. – Здравствуйте. – Надо было обязательно поздороваться перед серьезным разговором, к тому же, Матильде не верилось в свои так называемые «успехи» в учебе. Вот как она выследила агента – было круто, но кто ж это оценит, кому можно рассказать? – Неужели все тесты на \"А с плюсом\"?* – Нет, до этого еще далеко, но я думала, что будет хуже. – Директриса открыла папку с бумагами. – Миссис Бэйкер, между прочим, не хотела признавать твое эссе на тему «Как я провела лето». Матильда напряглась. Несмотря на конспирацию, недавняя история рвалась на бумагу, в разговоры, в намеки. Миссис Макалистер продолжала, перебирая листы: – Она сказала, что ты нагло списала это из какого-то детектива, но вместе мы с ней нашли стилистические ошибки, и она согласилась, что сочинение твоего авторства достойно оценки \"В\". – Это нормально? – Матильда избегала смотреть в глаза директрисе. – Нет, - строго ответила та. – Ты, как Раскольников из «Преступления и наказания» – есть такой роман у русского писателя Достоевского – возвращаешься к тому криминалу и не можешь отпустить. Раскольников, кстати, попался, помяни мои слова. А еще эти твои поездки и плохое поведение. – Вам кобылы со старших классов нажаловались? – не церемонясь, спросила Матильда, вспомнив мимолетный эпизод, как старшеклассницы выманивали карманные деньги у первоклашки. Она не смогла пройти мимо. – Полегче, – удивительно спокойно отреагировала директриса. – Ты бы еще назвала их свиньями. – Нет, – ответила Матильда меланхолично. – Свиньи лучше многих людей. Не люблю, когда обижают маленьких. У меня был маленький брат. – А поездки? – не забыла директриса. Матильда задумалась, собралась и решилась. – Можно, я буду иногда рассказывать вам о своем друге? Я постоянно думаю о нем, и мне не с кем этим поделиться. Поэтому я не могу отпустить. Поэтому у меня нет толком друзей. Поэтому я езжу по нашим с ним знакомым местам в свободное время. Миссис Макалистер согласилась иногда брать на себя роль слушателя, раз уж это может помочь девочке. Матильда была безмерно благодарна, но не была до конца честна. Да, ей хотелось поговорить о Леоне с тем, кто не упрекнет и не выдаст. Но забывать и отпускать эту историю она не собиралась. Пока не умрет Стэн, это было совершенно точно исключено. Она уже направлялась к выходу из кабинета и была готова попрощаться, когда директриса ее окликнула: – Матильда, я забыла еще кое-что. – Девочка мысленно напряглась. Директриса начала издалека: – Вот с чем у тебя, определенно, прогресс, так это с физкультурой. Преподаватель хочет тебя поощрить – допустить до стрельбы в тире уже на следующем занятии. Стрельба? Улыбка озарила лицо Матильды. Это был подарок судьбы, на который она не смела надеяться. И не собиралась его упускать. Вечерние тени от высоток подкрались к госпиталю и постепенно погасили отражение пылающего закатного неба в зеркалах окон. Бинокль в рюкзаке приятно тяготил спину. Через час-другой строительные леса на фасаде офисного здания по другую сторону улицы освободятся, а темнота скроет маленькую мстительницу от глаз ненужных свидетелей. В ожидании своего выхода Матильда коротала время в ближайшем парке, перебирая в уме события последних дней. Вокруг кипела жизнь: кто-то совершал вечернюю пробежку, у кого-то было назначено свидание, кое-где расположились с репетициями уличные музыканты и танцоры. И мысли девочки звучали диссонансным сопровождением к мирным картинам, что представали перед ее взором. Ибо ее помыслы несли смерть. Занятие в тире прошло удачно, если не считать двух обстоятельств. Они вскрылись после того, как Матильда, предварительно вежливо подняв руку, спросила инструктора после вводной, можно ли из спортивного пистолета убить человека. Ну, должна же она знать, что будет, если, забывшись на минуту, навести ствол на товарища и случайно выстрелить. По рядам сверстников прошел смешок, слова «шустрая малявка» и посулы мести «малявки» тому, кто это сказал. И первое, что девочку разочаровало – она в очередной раз ощутила, насколько ей безразличны эти люди, которые, в свою очередь, никогда не смогут ее понять и поэтому считают ее странной. Это было ей как будто и не очень нужно, но отвлекало от самого главного. Шикнула Кэт, инструктор жестом призвал всех к порядку и ответил на насущный, а отнюдь не праздный, вопрос Матильды. И ответ этот был вторым, куда более сильным разочарованием. «Убить можно чем угодно и совершенно случайно, но энергия выстрела спортивного оружия такова, что с близкого расстояния можно нанести травмы, и только выстрелы в упор в область жизненно важных органов могут привести к смерти. Так что, дети, это вам не игрушки». Матильда усмехнулась воспоминанию о последней реплике. Когда можно выстрелом полголовы снести – вот это она понимает, детям не игрушки. А такое «оружие» по требованиям к ее мастерству приближается к ножам, так как его необходимо использовать в упор, и поразить цель не абы куда, а в висок или в глаз. Если она доберется до Стэна с таким снаряжением, то он сначала вдоволь посмеется и только потом испугается расплаты. Но выбирать не приходится. Скрылись последние алые лучи, сгустились сумерки – пришло время выдвигаться на позицию. Проделав знакомый путь по лесам, Матильда укрепилась на любимом месте. Девочка с досадой отметила, что недолго осталось наслаждаться отличным обзором, ведь фасад преобразился за время реставрации – работы, а вместе с ними и срок службы ее сторожевого поста, подходили к концу. Совершая приготовления к разведке, выкладывая бинокль в чехле, накидывая ремень, она предвкушала встречу со своим врагом. Вспыхнувший свет в окне отозвался пронзительным холодом в сердце. Матильда поспешно поднесла бинокль к глазам. И прямо-таки опешила: цели не было на месте, лишь санитар осматривал палату в штатном режиме. Весь следующий день прошел, как мимолетный сон, который не помнишь после пробуждения. Уроки, лица, кросс, стрельба, молоко и цветок. Матильда ждала вечера, чтобы наверстать упущенные возможности для наблюдений. Поездка до места тянулась бесконечно долго. Для чего, спрашивается, она приехала заранее, вскарабкалась на верхотуру и потеряла два часа? Чтобы увидеть, что Стэна нет на месте, и предпринять отчаянную попытку снова обнаружить цель за другим окном? Ей пришлось преодолеть сотни ступенек за кратчайшее время, чтобы вернуться вовремя и без последствий в виде домашнего ареста. Возможно, она вызвала подозрения отдельных прохожих. Одно точно было хорошо – руки стали легче переносить манипуляции с тяжелым биноклем, все-таки тренировки давали результат. Благо, в тот момент, когда она уже была готова отложить все соображения до следующей поездки, последнее, вымученное усилие воли было вознаграждено. Стэн нашелся – его просто перевели в другую палату. Жаль, что нельзя было задержаться дольше, ведь зрелище было интригующее. Палата была обычная, значит, делала вывод Матильда, попасть туда было проще, чем в предыдущее помещение. Однако, комнату Стэну выделили одноместную, следовательно, были причины, но вот какие именно, было неясно – к счастью или нет, девочке не доводилось оказываться в подобных учреждениях. И самое главное, подлец был в сознании и даже перекидывался неведомыми фразами с персоналом! А лежал он, как раньше, и никаких движений, кроме поворота головы, не совершал. Часть повязок исчезла, но вот конструкции, напоминающие о переломах, еще присутствовали – судя по всему, досталось левой руке и левой ноге. Как бы там ни было, возможностей бинокля было вполне достаточно, чтобы убедиться, что Стэн жив. Пока Матильда шла к заветному зданию по стремительно темнеющей улице, она успела подумать, что этот день точь-в-точь похож на день предыдущей вылазки, словно кто-то на небе решил вернуть все обратно, дабы она могла переиграть свои вчерашние решения. Прямо-таки «День сурка». Она вспомнила, как урывками смотрела этот фильм давно, еще с братиком. Ей он показался скучным тогда, но другого в программе не было. Братик просто сидел с ней рядом, как он делал это обычно, что бы ни шло по телеку, и что бы там ни кричали взрослые… Кем надо быть, чтобы послать пулю в такого малыша? «Мы еще посчитаемся, ублюдок», – мысленно пообещала Матильда, враждебно оглядываясь на стационар перед тем, как войти в здание напротив. С замиранием сердца девочка вышла на позицию и расчехлила бинокль. Что еще сказать – Стэн продолжал преподносить сюрпризы. Он был не один. Матильда не могла вспомнить, где могла видеть посетителя раньше. Но что этот смуглый мужчина плотного телосложения был ей знаком, и что он - коп, она знала почти наверняка. Он сидел рядом с койкой Стэна и старательно записывал что-то с его слов карандашом в блокнот. Вид у посетителя был спокойный и даже немного скорбный. Потом он что-то переспросил у шефа – что-то в том, как держались собеседники, говорило о том, что посетитель является подчиненным – и Стэн стал что-то ему объяснять так эмоционально, что двинул здоровой рукой. Видимо, этого не стоило делать, потому что, к удовольствию Матильды, выразительная мимика мерзавца пополнилась гримасой боли. Хоть она не умела читать по губам, но была готова поспорить, что он выругался в этот момент. Посетитель виновато заговорил, показал на дверь. Мол, может, позвать медсестру, укольчик сделать? Стэн отрицательно помотал головой – ограничился этим, чтоб не тревожить все остальное. «Что? Не нравится? А жертвам твоим каково было, урод?» – мстительно подумала Матильда, отмечая, что, раз он чувствует боль, значит, вероятность пожизненной обездвиженности резко уменьшается. Пока Стэн переводил дух, глядя в потолок, его коллега украдкой смотрел на него с легким недоумением и даже сочувствием. Так смотрят, произнося фразы вроде «совсем себя не жалеешь». Будто его шеф взвалил на себя кучу дел, когда надо лежать смирно в спокойной обстановке. А что этого парня вызвали по серьезному делу, Матильда не сомневалась. Стэн был сверхъестественно предусмотрительной скотиной. Иначе как бы он жил на свободе при своих наклонностях? И вот сейчас она наблюдала одну из сотен, если не тысяч, встреч, подобные которой и обеспечили Стэнсфилду его особое положение. Через минуту Стэн продолжил давать указания, иногда на словах проверяя, правильно ли подчиненный его понял. Через несколько минут тон беседы изменился, что было ясно даже без возможности слышать разговор. В выражении лица Стэна появилось что-то, похожее на просьбу, позвать медсестру с укольчиком, например. Его посетитель кивнул и достал что-то из объемной сумки. На самом интересном месте руки Матильды отчаянно запротестовали против веса бинокля, и пришлось опереть его об раму. Она что-то пропустила, потому что решительно не понимала, зачем коп тянет какие-то провода к ушам Стэна. Точно, наушники. Плеер он заботливо приладил в ладони шефа и сам нажал на пуск. Лицо Стэна, секунду назад напряженное, сначала обрело отрешенное выражение, а через некоторое время озарилось блаженной улыбкой, с которой у Матильды были связаны худшие воспоминания. Она тоже навестит его, пусть он не скучает в разлуке. Но вместо плеера будет пистолет, а вместо кнопки «Play» она нажмет на спусковой крючок.[Chapter 5] Вечера стали холоднее, листва на деревьях в парках вспыхнула красками осени. Бетонный город все чаще представал серым и неуютным, а небо дразнило жиденькой синевой в прорехах грязноватых облаков. Матильда уверенным шагом направлялась к дверям госпиталя. Во всяком случае, она старалась держаться так, будто это место для нее ничего не значит, и она просто девочка с улицы, в джинсах, куртке и тяжелых ботинках, с тощим рюкзаком за спиной. Ей пришлось долго ждать этого дня. Многое произошло за это время. И многое совпало так, что именно в этот день все и должно случиться. Казалось, ей была обеспечена отличная позиция для наблюдений за клиентом и его сообщниками. Но не тут-то было! Стэн словно чувствовал ее пристальное внимание. Со следующей вылазки к госпиталю Матильду неизменно встречали задернутые шторы, так что у нее в распоряжении оставался лишь краткий миг перед включением ламп, чтобы убедится, что цель ждет ее на прежнем месте. Две недели до второй встречи с Тони были расписаны по дням и, как ни странно, пролетели очень быстро – школа забирала столько времени, сколько Матильда была готова ей пожертвовать. А днями без возможности приблизиться к Стэну она не очень дорожила. И тем не менее, она делала определенные успехи, а сверстники прозвали ее «киллером» за уверенность в обращении с арсеналом. Это ничего не значило, но льстило девочке. В тире Матильда только не ночевала, и, в конце концов, у нее созрел план, как заполучить пистолет на один день. Пришлось потратить немного времени и денег, чтобы найти похожий игрушечный в качестве муляжа, а на последнем занятии подменить им настоящий. Она провернула замену буквально за пару часов до того, как ступила на плитку холла в госпитале. Если подмена обнаружится, то кредит доверия будет потерян навсегда. Но ей было все равно – этот день стоил жертв. Матильда заодно вспомнила, что был шанс, хоть и очень призрачный, получить настоящий пистолет. Разговор с Тони был сухим и коротким, хоть старик был радушен, как и всегда. Матильду занимали только две вещи – судьба Леона и месть Стэну. О первом Тони не хотел говорить, а о втором, она точно знала, не стоит даже заикаться. Стодолларовая купюра уже лежала на столе, когда к Тони подошел молодой итальянец из его родни и что-то сказал. Как поняла Матильда, это что-то и послужило причиной немедленной инициативы Тони показать ей кухню. Секунду она надеялась, что под «кухней» он имел в виду дела его чистильщиков. Но нет, кухня как кухня: паста, пицца, все дела, и сиди тихо – к Тони пришли. Тони явно не хотел ее столкновения с этими парнями, и Матильда, пользуясь шумом и оживлением в святая святых ресторанчика «У Тони», проскользнула в подсобное помещение поближе к столу переговоров. Слышимость, конечно, была никакая, но общая идея была понятна и надолго взбудоражила маленькую шпионку. Посетители приходили предупредить Тони, что если к нему заявятся незнакомые парни с полицейскими значками, то не надо торопиться соглашаться с ними сотрудничать на их условиях. Это новые игроки от полиции, которые попытаются «кошмарить» его бизнес. Если это произойдет, он должен поставить людей Стэна в известность, чтобы сохранить то, что у него есть. Стэн помнит его заслуги и выражает надежду, что вскоре сможет повидать друга лично. Матильда догадывалась до чего-то такого, но одна из последних тонких ниточек ее веры в человечество лопнула в тот день. Тони не потребовалось даже оборачиваться на появившуюся в дверном проеме подопечную после того, как те парни покинули зал. – Ты все слышала. – Он сказал утвердительно, без тени вопроса, с таким видом, будто приготовился к удару молнии. – Хочешь, я убью их? – спросила Матильда и тут же удивилась сама себе. Тони, видимо, не ожидал такой поворот в следующей же реплике. Он обернулся и пристально посмотрел на девочку. – Идем за стол, – позвал он и заказал молока у пробегавшего мимо официанта. Когда Матильда уселась, и перед ней появился непременный стакан, она продолжила шепотом: – Дай мне оружие, и я зачищу их шефа. И они больше не будут лезть в твои дела. – Ты не сможешь, – отстраненно ответил Тони. – К тому же, когда у тебя есть такие дела, то кто-то обязательно в них лезет. И пусть лучше это будет тот, с кем ты уже договорился. – Тогда, – Матильда подалась вперед и зашептала еще тише, – я не буду его трогать. А если ты дашь мне оружие, то буду даже защищать. А когда он перестанет быть нужен тебе, я его убью. Мне плевать на деньги, Тони! Просто дай мне хотя бы пистолет! – Леон погиб не за это, – задумчиво ответил Тони. – Вот твои сто баксов. Увидимся через месяц, только не натвори глупостей. С тех пор один месяц минул, уже подходил к концу и второй. Стэн тихой сапой вел свои дела, и Матильда сошла бы с ума от неизвестности и бессилия, если бы не ушла с головой в учебу и тренировки. Ей пришлось быть предельно осторожной в госпитале, ведь в один прекрасный день она обнаружила, что ее враг начал предпринимать робкие попытки ходить на костылях. Видимо, это не очень легко ему давалось, и он злился, выкрикивал ругательства, а то и запускал чем-нибудь в стену. Стэн достаточно окреп для того, чтобы развеять слухи о своей недееспособности, которые пустили его конкуренты вроде Уилсона. Нашлись копы, которые решили навестить товарища. «Да, Бэнни, придется денек побыть хорошим парнем», – сказал Стэн своему доверенному лицу (достопамятному посетителю), осторожно поддерживающему его под локоть во время прогулки по коридору. И Матильда зацепилась за этот шанс. Извини, Тони. Прости, Леон. Она отлично знала дорогу к палате Стэна и устремилась прямиком к цели, не забывая, однако, отслеживать возможное появление знакомых в лицо сотрудников Управления. За дверью палаты было довольно шумно и, к удивлению Матильды, как будто даже весело. Судя по бодрому тону Стэна – его голос она не перепутала бы ни с чьим на свете, – он шутил или рассказывал что-то достаточно забавное, на его взгляд. И коллеги, что характерно, разделяли его мнение или хотя бы притворялись из вежливости. Небось, этот урод хвалился, как разобрался с Леоном. Затем слышались пожелания скорого выздоровления и прочая чепуха, а через четверть часа открылась дверь, и копы стали покидать палату. Их можно было по пальцам пересчитать, но шуму они производили много. Видимо, пришли те, у кого была возможность в этот день, в том числе, человек по имени Бэнни и толстый охранник из фойе Управления. Если вышел даже Бэнни, то клиент стопроцентно остался в одиночестве. Матильда хотела было воспользоваться этим моментом, но в коридоре появилась медсестра и зашла в заветную палату. Судя по интонации, Стэн на что-то жаловался, а женщина его успокаивала. Через пару минут она вышла, но Матильда не сразу решилась зайти. Она вспомнила дверь уборной Управления, и что тогда получилось из ее дерзкой выходки. Отбросив сомнения, она сняла и открыла рюкзак, ухватила в нем пистолет, вслепую сняла с предохранителя и так – рука в сумке, ладонь на рукоятке, а указательный палец на спусковом крючке – вошла в палату. В светлом помещении находились только она и убийца дорогих ей людей, но побеспокоить ее могли в любой момент. Глаза подонка были закрыты, вероятно, он не понимал, что произошло. «Да, возможно, этот укол ты уже не почувствуешь, а жаль». Матильда сразу приступила к делу. Она достала пистолет, размяла плечи, затекшие в ожидании, на мгновение посмотрела в белый потолок. Леон и брат, может быть, смотрят сейчас на нее, и они увидят заслуженную смерть своего убийцы. У девочки захватило дух, глаза защипало. Она подошла к изголовью койки, положила рюкзак на пол. И всмотрелась в лицо Стэна. Он заметно похудел и побледнел с их последней встречи, шрам пересекал его лоб и терялся в коротких отрастающих волосах, на свободной от повязок части руки и на щеке виднелись отметины, в которых Матильда заподозрила следы ожогов. «Ну, здравствуй, Стэн, давно не виделись. А ты легко отделался, ублюдок». Она ненавидела его все это время, желала страшнейших мучений, и его слегка жалкий вид ее радовал, конечно, но был слишком малой платой за его деяния. Леон совершил первое убийство в девятнадцать лет, а вот она - сейчас, в двенадцать. Леон говорил, что месть хороша, пока ее не совершишь. Но она сейчас лишь доводила до конца то, что по случайности не смог доделать он сам, для чего чуть-чуть не хватило мощности взрыва. Ствол остановился в четверти дюйма от виска ее врага. Но Матильда передумала стрелять – там кость, мало ли, вдруг не пробьет – лучше сразу в глаз. Пусть будет правый. Затаив дыхание и отчаянно пытаясь справиться с волнением, она медленно начала выжимать спусковой крючок, целясь чуть выше ресниц. Палец остановился – нужно чуть большее усилие нажатия до щелчка и выстрела. – Ни женщин, ни детей, – сказала Матильда, чтобы подхлестнуть свою решимость. Почему она медлит? Боится ответственности за преступление? Жалеет его врача? Или коллег? Матильда разозлилась на себя. Этот человек зверски расстрелял ее семью, убил ее маленького брата, а еще ее спасителя, любимого и друга в одном лице. И с ней бы расправился, если б не Леон. Дважды. А она не может отправить его в ад, когда ничто не может остановить ее? Или она боится запачкать об него ручки? Или ее волнует, что подумают о ней в школе?! Она снова выжала спусковой крючок. Очень быстро. Отчаянно сжалось сердце, внутри похолодело, онемели руки до самых плеч. Она остановилась в последний момент каким-то чудом. И испытала облегчение. Стэн не откликнулся на звук ее голоса и все так же размеренно дышал. Вот в чем дело. Перед ее выходом на эту сцену он просил обезболивающее или снотворное. Он спал и не знал, что сегодня к нему решила заглянуть смерть, а главное, за что она почтила его своим присутствием. Вот наговорил бы он Матильде гадостей, будь в сознании – она бы с радостью нашпиговала ему черепушку. – Стэн, – тихонько позвала Матильда, на всякий случай не отводя дула от его лица. – Стэнсфилд… Ноль реакции. Может, оно и к лучшему? Она позвала громче. Поборов страх, даже осторожно прикоснулась к его руке. Тот же результат. А ведь эти самые пальцы прикасались к ее лицу в тот день, когда подлец собирался ее убить… Матильда не устояла перед странным соблазном. Продолжая держать на прицеле, она осторожно погладила его по здоровой щеке и чуть затронула волосы, и обнадежила себя тем, что продолжать это делать ей противно. Слишком уж он ей омерзителен, чтоб притрагиваться, например, к губам. Можно было бы его пристрелить, пока не помешали. Но дело в том, что ее месть будет неполной, если этот мерзавец умрет, не прочувствовав весь ужас перед уходом. «Я не получу никакого удовольствия, если заберу жизнь у кого-то, кто ее не ценит…» Матильде словно стало дурно. Да, «ни женщин, ни детей». Хоть он и беспомощен в данный момент, но он ни то, ни другое. Да, она согласна пойти на жертвы, пусть жизнь ее не станет прежней, и до конца своих дней она будет спать вполглаза. Но… Подобно кому она поступит, выстрелив в этого негодяя? Она думала, что поступает, как Леон. Но почему тогда она ощущает себя таким же вот Стэном? Вот что имел в виду Леон, вот чего он для нее не хотел… По лицу ее текли злые слезы, пистолет висел в бессильно опущенных руках. Из коридора донеслись какие-то звуки, и она поспешно убрала несостоявшееся орудие убийства в рюкзак. – Ты что здесь делаешь? – строго спросил врач – ах да, здравствуйте, мистер Баркер. – Я жду папу, – автоматически сказала Матильда, вытирая под глазами. – Он пришел навестить друга, я с ним, а потом я его потеряла. – Подожди его снаружи, он не пройдет мимо, – сурово сказал мистер Баркер, но это странным образом успокаивало. – Хорошо, до свидания! – Матильда устремилась к выходу, но перед дверью решила задать вопрос. – Простите… – За что? – спросил врач, не оборачиваясь. – Мистер Стэнсфилд поправится? Доктор перестал записывать что-то и обернулся. Видимо, беспокойство маленькой девочки о пациенте его умилило. – Он будет стараться. Этот парень очень ценит жизнь. Уже направляясь к остановке под накрапывающим дождиком, она поймала себя на мысли, что сердится на себя, а никак не на врача, спасшего Стэна. Он делал свою работу и делал ее хорошо: множество раз давал отпор костлявой с косой, в каком бы обличии та не являлась за его пациентами. А она, Матильда, еще только должна стать профессионалом. Девочка лет двенадцати стоит во дворе школы. Ее цветок преуспел в деле обретения корней на новом месте. Жаль, она пока не может сказать о себе того же самого. За серебристыми водами залива до самых отяжелевших от влаги лиловых небес высятся джунгли из бетона, в глубине которых сегодня днем она не смогла выстрелить в своего злостного врага. И теперь на весь город обрушился ливень, уносящий с потоками воды пылинки, которые когда-то окружали ее с другом в теплом воздухе, и мертвые листья, некогда оживлявшие знакомые улицы зеленью деревьев. Ливень, смывающий следы и кровь, стирающий напрочь то лето, изменившее ее жизнь. Но пока дышит ее враг, эта история не закончится.[Chapter 6] Мегаполис живет своей жизнью, оставляя позади дни, месяцы, годы, забытые сводки и хроники. Среди высотных зданий спешат люди, гудят в пробках такси, шумит листва на аллеях и в парках. Ясный летний день и суета не располагают к размышлениям о вечном – жизнь идет своим чередом, только поспевай за ней. И мало кто придает значение самому ее ходу до тех пор, пока нечто не прервет его. С большинством это происходит естественным образом и в свое время. Но на это нечего рассчитывать тем, чья совесть нечиста. Для них в арсенале смерти припасены причуды на любой вкус. Это может быть нелепая случайность или закономерная расплата, стечение обстоятельств или рука злоумышленника, чей-то расчет или месть. А порою смерть исключительно взыскательна и непредсказуема. А какой еще она может быть в лице молодой девушки? Вот она идет по солнечному тротуару среди других жителей города и его гостей, миниатюрная, шустрая, даже милая. Строгость и в то же самое время ребячливость, легкая походка и твердый взгляд темных живых глаз, брючный костюм, стрижка каре на черные волосы. Мало кто знает, что за этим безобидным обликом скрывается ненависть семилетней выдержки. И один из посвященных в ее тайну – это тот, кого в ближайший час должно настигнуть неумолимое возмездие. И даже она сама еще недавно не предполагала, какое оружие выберет в конечном итоге для своей затянувшейся вендетты. «Как капризна сегодня смерть!» «Да, мерзавец, это сказано давно, но до чего же верно сказано. И, надо же такому случиться, она идет именно к тебе!» – подумала Матильда Ландо, практикантка, поднимаясь по ступеням здания Управления по борьбе с оборотом наркотиков. Внутреннее убранство Управления мало изменилось за эти годы. Фойе циклопического здания подавляло размерами и царящей полутьмой, которую не мог разогнать даже свет, льющийся из широких окон. За три недели практики Матильда утвердилась в мысли, что длительное влияние здешней гнетущей обстановки вполне может подтолкнуть к употреблению конфиската как к средству ухода от реальности. Во всяком случае, рутинная бумажная работа, которой на радостях нагрузили ее здешние канцелярские крысы, запросто могла к этому располагать. Матильда по свежей привычке направилась прямиком к рамке-металлодетектору. – О, мисс Ландо, будущая надежда Управления! – шутливо поприветствовал ее коп на пропускном пункте – на удивление славный мужик, которого, видимо, с высоты жизненного опыта забавляли ее боевой настрой и рвение новичка, вот он ее и запомнил. – День добрый, Барни! – ответила на приветствие девушка, как ни в чем не бывало. – Смотря что ты имеешь в виду под словом «надежда»! – Ну, выкладывай все пирожки для бабушки, – перешел Барни сразу к делу. Хоть она и подружилась с охранником, это ровным счетом ничего не решало. В связи с недавними терактами ужесточились меры безопасности, и Управление эти новшества не обошли стороной. Все досматривалось в поисках металлических предметов и взрывчатых веществ, в том числе, любых жидкостей. Через это чистилище на пропускном пункте нельзя было пронести и бутылку с водой, не то что нож, не говоря уж о более соответствующем случаю инструменте. Это были не первые трудности на пути ее планов мщения и, возможно, не последние. Но сопротивление среды, всегда появляющееся в самый ответственный момент, начинало раздражать. «Если нужно принять меры против одних подонков, то зачем затягивать гайки так, что это мешает борьбе с другими подонками? – с досадой думала Матильда, однако с готовностью ставя сумку на досмотр. – Почему бы не объединить усилия или хотя бы не мешать друг другу?» Мнение Матильды о параноидальности новых мер разделяли многие сотрудники, а особенно – дежурные на входе. Как и обычно, рамка начала «сходить с ума», стоило пересечь запретную черту. – В рукаве шестиствольный пулемет принесла, не меньше, – предположил шутник Барни. На столе друг за другом появились толстая тетрадь в жестком переплете, ручки, карандаш, ключи, бесцветная помада, отдельно кошелек и пригоршня мелочи. – Не густо, – прокомментировал коп, пролистав тетрадь. – Значит, налет на Управление сегодня в очередной раз отменяется. Мало того, что жарища, так еще и скука смертная. – Он вздохнул и подмигнул Матильде. – Проходи. Напоследок улыбнувшись Барни, Матильда направилась к лифту. Ждать предстояло долго, собиралась очередь. Девушка оглянулась на охранника, который проверял уже следующего сотрудника. Жаль, если этому парню придется туго после того, как она завершит свою миссию. Но Матильда слишком долго ждала этой возможности и готовилась ее использовать, чтобы так просто от нее отказаться. У девушки было время подумать над совместимостью своей «преступной» цели и интересов других людей в обычной жизни. Матильда еще не решила, сделает ли она тайную деятельность Стэнсфилда достоянием общественности, если попадет в руки правосудия. Но она уже точно знала, что возьмет всю ответственность на себя. Тесная полутемная кабина лифта, толпа мрачных, напряженных людей. Открылись двери на этаж, целиком занимаемый архивом – нужно протиснуться к выходу, извиниться на всякий случай. Узкий высокий коридор, уже привычная дверь. Обмен дежурными приветствиями, не забыть милую улыбку. – Вот твое сегодняшнее задание, Матильда, – сказала миссис Паркер, высокая женщина за тридцать, сотрудница архива и руководительница практики, ставя на стол перед девушкой внушительную кипу папок и отдельных листов. – Как я и обещала вчера, это бумаги оперативных отделов, нужно привести их в порядок и проверить, все ли из них внесены в электронную базу данных. А если там чего-то не хватает, то внести в базу самостоятельно. Ты поняла? Матильда с готовностью кивнула, ее руководительница продолжила: – Если чего-то не хватает в самой папке, то откладывай в сторону – надо уточнить в одном из соответствующих отделов. Матильда на это рассчитывала. Только ради возможности пройтись по отделам она подписалась на эту работу и слушала сейчас этот чертов инструктаж. – Извините, миссис Паркер, – осторожно обратилась она и после разрешающего кивка продолжила: – А можно, я сама попробую уточнить в отделах, если в делах недостает документов? Видимо, вопрос сотрудницу удивил. Работы у Матильды было и так достаточно, и она не пыталась отлынивать, как это делали некоторые практиканты. Да еще и готова была выполнять поручения сверх того, что было. Во взгляде Паркер Матильда прочитала едва заметную грустную усмешку. – Это не так часто бывает, – ответила Паркер. – Можешь попытаться, но предупреди сначала меня – сама ты не справишься. Только не ходи в комнату сорок шесть ноль два – точно нарвешься. Там не любят глупых вопросов. «О'кей», – подумала Матильда и сделала в точности, как задумала: нашла и отложила самую тощую папку и дождалась, когда Паркер отправится в другой кабинет на собрание. Подхватив папку в качестве предлога, а заодно взяв с собой свою тетрадь, девушка отправилась к цели. За эти три недели Стэн не доставил ей проблем, что было странно, и она очень надеялась, что отголоски той истории еще живы в его больном мозгу. …С помощью нехитрых манипуляций Матильда извлекла свое оружие из переплета. Она подбодрила себя тем, что ее экстравагантное решение оправданно при невозможности пронести в здание что-то металлическое. Комната номер сорок шесть ноль два звала ее, и на этот раз она шла сюда сама, а не под конвоем из убийц ее семьи. Сегодня предоставлялся редкий шанс застать Стэна в одиночестве. Обычно он разъезжал со своими людьми на служебной машине - якобы патрулировал или работал с агентами под прикрытием. На самом же деле встречался с дилерами и мониторил ситуацию с точками. В офисе ему тоже не приходилось скучать – сравнительно краткое пребывание было расписано по минутам: инструктаж, собрание перед очередным рейдом, разборы полетов. Сегодня по плану он ждал звонка до десяти утра, а потом отправлялся в очередной обход своих «владений». Матильда успела вовремя. Телефонный разговор был в разгаре – за дверью бушевал ее враг: – …Как это – не можете?! Вас там – несколько здоровых мужиков против одного сопливого торчка, и вы ждете, когда я притащу к вам свои штифты?! Мы с тобой договаривались, что в без пятнадцати десять вы его возьмете, и после этого ты позвонишь мне. Не до, не во время, а после! У меня есть дела поважнее вашей херни! Стук брошенной трубки. – Чтобы сделать хорошо, надо идти и делать самому, – заключил Стэн. Его голос прозвучал тихо, спокойно и даже немного растерянно. Так говорят вслух самому себе, в одиночестве. Или жалуются портрету великого деятеля прошлого на измельчавшее поколение. Матильда бесшумно проскользнула мимо наполовину стеклянной двери, заглядывая в помещение. Прильнув к стене, она обдумала увиденное. Стэн был в кабинете один. Он стоял спиной к двери, лицом к шкафу, запрокинув голову к потолку. К облегчению девушки, его не трясло, значит, он не принимал свой наркотик, а просто что-то обдумывал. Со спины он мало изменился. Его волосы лежали словно мокрые, как и раньше. Светлый костюм мог быть из той же партии, что и прежний. Она уже давно отметила его странную консервативность в облике, даже болезненную зацикленность на подобии. Стэн был не только беспринципным убийцей, наркоманом и при этом копом. Он был еще и ненормальным, что проявлялось буквально в каждой мелочи. Руки чесались покончить с ним раз и навсегда. Отбросив сомнения и не дожидаясь случайных свидетелей, Матильда толкнула дверь и вошла в страшную комнату номер сорок шесть ноль два. Эту сцену она продумывала во множестве вариантов бессонными ночами, во время тренировок, за утренним стаканом молока, за поливкой растения. И она начала разыгрывать свой любимый сценарий с первой же реплики. – Норман Стэнсфилд. – Собственный голос показался Матильде голосом Фемиды. Интересно, Стэн все понял? Он испугался? Попытается напасть? Или будет молить о пощаде? – К вашим услугам, – сухо ответил Стэн, чуть повернув голову вправо и не глядя на посетительницу. – Но только на одну минуту – я спешу. – Этого достаточно. – Матильда сделала несколько шагов и стояла уже у него за спиной, видела чуть заметные движения стоящего в покое человека, чувствовала едва уловимый запах сигаретного дыма и кофе – протяни руку с оружием и пронзи сверху до сердца без всяких разъяснений. Но она не удержалась – после стольких лет ожидания она хотела насладиться этой роковой встречей сполна. – У меня личное дело... Семь лет назад ты убил моего брата и моего друга. Я пришла за тобой. – Ох. – Стэн выдержал равнодушную паузу и повернулся.[Chapter 7] Дождь лил с ночи и не думал переставать барабанить по жестяным козырькам серым утром. Матильда сидела на краю узкой кровати и не торопилась идти толкаться у раковин с другими ученицами в общей уборной. Там сейчас шум, брызги, дрязги и глупые вопросы, а вода в трубах за ночь остыла. А ей необходим покой, чтобы обдумать произошедшее накануне. Перед сном она добросовестно пыталась извлечь выводы из своего провала, но разум застилали эмоции. Перед глазами представали картины прошлого. Разбитое стекло, вызвавшее бурю дурных предчувствий. Труп того, кто был ей отцом, в луже крови на полу в дверях квартиры, что была ее домом. Слова неведомого негодяя за стеной, из которых она поняла, что ее брата больше нет. Обморочный ужас под взглядом дежурившего в коридоре бандита, заставлявший упрямо раз за разом нажимать звонок соседской двери. Она ловила себя на чувстве стыда перед Леоном, ведь она подвела его – не смогла сделать намеченное, оказалась никудышным подмастерьем чистильщика. Единственное, что ее утешало, так это его сопротивление ее намерению стать убийцей. Но сейчас уже не удастся спросить его, вдруг после налета на их квартиру он изменил свое мнение на этот счет? Дважды находиться так близко от него и не оставить на поганце ни царапины! Она вспоминала, как стояла в оцепенении, а он смотрел ей в глаза и вещал о жизни и смерти, ничуть не опасаясь, что она припасла что-нибудь смертоносное в карманах широкой куртки. Он разговаривал с ней лицом к лицу, касался ее щеки, можно было почувствовать движение воздуха от его дыхания. Это был идеальный момент для сведения счетов. Но тогда ее завораживали зрачки-точки, голос, серьезный тон разговора с ней – девчонкой, неуловимые изменения в выражении лица - от сдержанной враждебности до наигранного ласкового дружелюбия. Упоение ненавистью к этому человеку заставляло ее ловить каждое его слово, каждое движение бровей и губ. Матильда хотела вновь взглянуть в эти просвечивающие безумные глаза, но чтобы при этом говорила она, а он молчал и в ужасе ждал своей участи. Но, похоже, это исключено, иначе она напрасно испачкала бы об него руки… И девочка представила себе, что сейчас творилось бы с ее жизнью, выстрели она в госпитале… Разбирательство, полиция, характеристика от учителей – она представляла это как-то так. А самое главное, все изменилось бы навсегда, жизнь уже не стала бы прежней. Но однажды придется решиться, ведь дело не только в ее мести. Стэн шел на поправку, а это значило, что он не останется в долгу. А ему есть, за что с ней поквитаться. Ночью девочке снился кошмар, в котором она стреляла в Стэна, а на его месте через секунду мучительно умирал на ее глазах совсем другой человек. И сердце Матильды заполнил липкий страх пополам с едким чувством вины, от чего она проснулась в слезах, с тем самым ощущением оцепенения до плеч. Она не выспалась и клевала носом, пытаясь в последние минуты перед началом заурядного школьного дня выработать какое-то решение по самому главному делу в ее жизни. Делу, в котором у нее нет друзей и союзников. – Матильда! – В приоткрывшуюся дверь просунулась Кэт. – Десять минут до завтрака. Ты что сидишь? Знаешь, что? Эти твои прогулки до добра не доведут. – Кэт… – надо было кому-то хоть немного выговориться, а соседка – Матильда это знала – поняла бы правильно. – Ты представить себе не можешь, как мне надоела вся эта детсадовская херня… Школьная пора у Матильды составляла неразрывную ассоциацию с промозглостью, серостью, холодом и темнотой. В такую погоду нечего было и думать о полноценной разведке, и девочка посвящала такие периоды учебе, пропуская через сознание исключительно отсчет времени до поездки к Тони. Такое восприятие усугубилось тем, что цель ушла у нее из-под носа. Стэна выписали буквально через несколько дней после ее неудачного покушения. Тут пригодилось знакомство с лаборантом, который остался подрабатывать в госпитале и до сих пор был признателен Матильде. С его помощью удалось выяснить адрес, по которому якобы проживал пациент. Но неделя наблюдений на месте показала, что ни Стэн, ни кто бы то ни было из знакомых Матильде лиц там не бывал. На протяжении месяца девочка предпринимала попытки выследить Бэнни от здания Управления до настоящего места обитания его шефа. Ее усилия в поиске логова монстра привели к определенным результатам. Если, конечно, можно считать таковым вывод, что Стэн неуловим. Замерзнув после очередной долгой вылазки, Матильда грелась под одеялом, сложив руки под головой и глядя в потолок. Не может быть такого, что Стэн просто исчез... Ладно, что он пока не вышел на работу, это понятно - Леон здорово потрепал этого гада напоследок. Но должен же он где-то жить, спать, умываться по утрам, куда-то же он вешает свой костюм… Матильда впервые подумала, что он даже может жить не один. Тем хуже всем, кто ему дорог, если, конечно такие люди вообще существуют. Холод отчаянно цеплялся за кости, не хотел уходить. Надвигались полугодовые итоговые тесты. И Рождество, к которому ученики должны готовить программу с хором и традиционными сценками. Нужно было взять тайм-аут – на все ее сил явно не хватало. Нового появления ее врага надо было терпеливо дожидаться, по ходу дела расправляясь с нагрузкой. Интересно, Стэн вообще празднует Рождество? «Будем считать, урод, что я сделала тебе подарок», - подумала Матильда, погружаясь в сон. Бесконечные дни за партой и домашними заданиями складывались в месяцы. Три вещи не давали Матильде сойти с ума без личного дела в окружении сверстников, то и дело шептавшихся у нее за спиной. Первой, но отнюдь не главной, среди них был мультфильм «Трансформеры»*, про который она забыла на время подготовки планов мщения. Но и с ним успело произойти что-то странное, как бы символизирующее новый виток в ее собственной жизни. И это разочаровывало. Не было и не предвещалось привычных Оптимуса Прайма и Мегатрона, зато был какой-то чокнутый Гальватрон и совсем уж невнятные персонажи. Второй точкой опоры была Кэт, компенсируя, видимо, отсутствие Мегатрона и Оптимуса. Она одна не открещивалась от Матильды и хоть как-то вдохновляла своим примером на работу. В тир они по-прежнему ходили вместе. Так случилось, что она поджидала Матильду именно там в тот несостоявшийся роковой для Стэна день и знала тайну подмены настоящего спортивного пистолета муляжом. И уже было трудно сказать, забыла ли она тот случай или просто очень хорошо скрывала свое мнение на этот счет. Началось что-то необычное, новое в среде сверстников. И Матильде это «что-то» не нравилось. Она чувствовала, что оно таит в себе много лишних проблем, особенно для одиночки вроде нее. Еще вчера были наивные, но отдельные личности, с которыми худо-бедно можно было поболтать на разные темы. А сегодня это - уже амебы, слипшиеся в кучки. Значение приобрело количество, а не качество. Их с Кэт было двое, формально они выполняли правила этой игры и могли спокойно заниматься своими делами. Третьей и главной опорой была память о Леоне. Хранить и поддерживать ее помогала миссис Макалистер, согласившаяся когда-то иногда выслушивать истории из прошлого девочки. Но Матильда быстро убедилась, что просто не представляет, как будет рассказывать о некоторых вещах этой строгой женщине, что сводило богатство общения на нет. Матильда продолжала пить молоко, хотя в холодное время его стало необходимо подогревать, но она решила привыкнуть к преодолению этого неудобства. Она не пропускала ни одной тренировки – хоть Стэну досталось в том здании, надо было быть готовой ко всему. Растение она не рискнула оставить в открытом грунте на зиму – все-таки оно относилось к тропической флоре. Теперь оно составляло компанию девочкам, занимая подоконник. Одна отрада до самого лета, не сдохнуть бы с тоски к тому времени. Но Стэн проявил признаки жизни уже к концу февраля. И как! В местных новостях сообщили об успешной деятельности его отдела, в ходе которой была разоблачена крупная банда наркоторговцев. Потягивая молоко, Матильда перебирала в уме предположения. Можно, конечно, допустить, что, пройдя по грани между жизнью и смертью, он понял что-то и решил творить добро… Но это просто смешно. Скорее, тут надо выбирать между заказом конкурента за кругленькую сумму для продажных копов и жизненной необходимостью для самого Стэна доказать свою профпригодность и защитить пошатнувшуюся репутацию. Вот он, похоже, и решил пожертвовать мелкими сошками, которые оптом сошли за банду. – Вот это профессионал, – убежденно сказала сидящая рядом Кэт. На испепеляющий взгляд Матильды она ответила: – Другой бы сдался – такое не проходит насовсем. У Матильды всегда была уверенность, что Стэн вернулся бы при малейшей надежде на работу в прежнем качестве. О судьбе семьи одного незадачливого мелкого дилера, в том числе четырехлетнего мальчика, она деликатно промолчала. Кэт не виновата, что Стэнсфилд убедил весь мир в своей непогрешимости. Наступила пора, когда весна взяла свое, и городские посадки покрылись дымкой раскрывающихся молодых листочков. Матильда шла по тротуару и наслаждалась теплом. После монохромных видов холодного города, разбавленных лишь вспышками вывесок и рекламы, создавалось чувство, что еще немного, и та прошлогодняя история повторится вновь на улицах, купающихся в ярком свете. Но только уже не с ней и не с Леоном. Если он жив, то почему не придет за ней? Если он погиб, то почему она до сих пор не верит? Матильда часто вспоминала его в последнее время, и это было как-то особенно грустно, ведь мир вокруг просыпался после очередной зимней смерти, утверждая таким образом жизнь. Что-то особенное она чувствовала в этой весне, точно душистый воздух сам льется в легкие, а она идет, не касаясь земли – и в небо взлетела бы, стоило захотеть. Но у нее еще были незавершенные дела. Здание Управления возвышалось над площадью, весна была не властна над его мрачными стенами, подпирающими небо. Матильда взяла за правило следить за этим объектом с биноклем с безопасного расстояния. Она дежурила здесь неделю, и сегодня ожидание было вознаграждено. У ступеней остановилась служебная машина, и впервые с самого первого своего покушения Матильда увидела Стэна, поднимающегося к парадному входу в Управление. Это был тот самый Стэн в своем светлом костюме. На мгновение Матильда поймала себя на мысли, что она провалилась в прошлое, где подлец еще цел и невредим, и вот-вот за ним прокрадется девочка с большим пакетом – она сама из прошлого. Но нет, было нечто, возвращающее в реальность. Стэн хромал на левую ногу, не сильно, но по сравнению с прежними их встречами заметно. Костюм был как будто слегка велик ему, но это могло показаться. Это все такая мелочь по сравнению с тем, что он жив и способен самостоятельно двигаться! Люди, попадавшиеся навстречу Стэну, приветствовали его и пожимали руку, идущие за ним догоняли и выражали то же самое. Матильда нахмурилась. Ладно, делегацию не выставили у дверей. Ублюдок, оборвавший жизни Леона и ее брата, купался в лучах всеобщего уважения и дышал в этот момент пьянящим весенним воздухом. Эта несправедливость ранила не хуже ножа. И она, Матильда, была готова исправить это.Дождь лил с ночи и не думал переставать барабанить по жестяным козырькам серым утром. Матильда сидела на краю узкой кровати и не торопилась идти толкаться у раковин с другими ученицами в общей уборной. Чего ради бежать, как на пожар? Там сейчас шум, брызги, дрязги и глупые вопросы, а вода в трубах за ночь остыла. А ей необходим покой, чтобы обдумать произошедшее накануне. Перед сном она добросовестно пыталась извлечь выводы из своего провала, но разум застилали эмоции. Перед глазами представали картины прошлого. Разбитое стекло, вызвавшее бурю дурных предчувствий. Труп того, кто был ей отцом, в луже крови на полу в дверях квартиры, что была ее домом. Слова неведомого негодяя за стеной, из которых она поняла, что ее брата больше нет. Обморочный ужас под взглядом дежурившего в коридоре бандита, заставлявший упрямо раз за разом нажимать звонок соседской двери. Она ловила себя на чувстве стыда перед Леоном, ведь она подвела его – не смогла сделать намеченное, оказалась никудышным подмастерьем чистильщика. Единственное, что ее утешало, так это его сопротивление ее намерению стать убийцей. Но сейчас уже не удастся спросить его, вдруг после налета на их квартиру он изменил свое мнение на этот счет? Дважды находиться так близко от него и не оставить на поганце ни царапины! Она вспоминала, как стояла в оцепенении, а он смотрел ей в глаза и вещал о жизни и смерти, ничуть не опасаясь, что она припасла что-нибудь смертоносное в карманах широкой куртки. Он разговаривал с ней лицом к лицу, касался ее щеки, можно было почувствовать движение воздуха от его дыхания. Это был идеальный момент для сведения счетов. Но тогда ее завораживали зрачки-точки, голос, серьезный тон разговора с ней – девчонкой, неуловимые изменения в выражении лица - от сдержанной враждебности до наигранного ласкового дружелюбия. Упоение ненавистью к этому человеку заставляло ее ловить каждое его слово, каждое движение бровей и губ. Матильда хотела вновь взглянуть в эти просвечивающие безумные глаза, но чтобы при этом говорила она, а он молчал и в ужасе ждал своей участи. Но, похоже, это исключено, иначе она напрасно испачкала бы об него руки… И девочка представила себе, что сейчас творилось бы с ее жизнью, выстрели она в госпитале… Разбирательство, полиция, характеристика от учителей – она представляла это как-то так.

Ублюдок, оборвавший жизни Леона и ее брата, купался в лучах всеобщего уважения и дышал в этот момент пьянящим весенним воздухом. Эта несправедливость ранила не хуже ножа. И она, Матильда, была готова исправить это.[Chapter 8] Месяцы пролетали один за другим, отмеченные встречами с Тони. Матильда все пыталась вызвать его на разговор о Леоне, хотя бы о чем-то хорошо ей о нем известном – о чем-то большем она и не мечтала. Каждые четыре бесконечных недели она жила, словно воды в рот набрав, если не считать ответов у доски и обмена фразами с соседкой, и всегда надеялась на один день, в который можно было отвести душу и разделить с кем-то невысказанные чувства и мысли. С директрисой она обсудила ровно столько, сколько могла доверить постороннему человеку – дальше лежала непреодолимая черта, за которую был заказан путь всем, кто был в стороне от их с Леоном истории. И Матильда очень надеялась на общество Тони. Но тот всякий раз переводил тему в другое русло, да так ловко, что девочка не замечала, как на столе оказывалась купюра в сто долларов, знаменующая завершение разговора. Тони не выражал тревоги по поводу того, что Стэн вернулся в строй. Во всяком случае, внешне он был всегда одинаково спокоен и даже помогал строить планы: вместе они продумали, как удобнее оплачивать занятия в школе и пансион. Матильда же опасалась ответных действий от оправившегося врага, но только первое время. Напряженные годы учебы не давали сосредоточиться на упреждающем ударе, тем более, Стэн не предпринимал попыток добраться до нее. Матильда подумала, что в стремлении отомстить по горячим следам ею двигала не только ненависть, но и страх. Но страх со временем угас до легких опасений, которые не давали расслабиться в ожидании удобного момента для свершения ее мести. Вместе с Кэт она записалась на курсы самообороны, рассудив, что раз негде учиться нападению, то не стоит терять время даром, и есть смысл поучиться защите. Почему-то ей запомнилось самое смешное занятие – тогда они учились удару по глазам. Чтобы усилить пальцы для удара, надо было развести их по два: мизинец соединить с безымянным, а средний – с указательным. За безуспешными попытками проделать этот трюк группа шутила, мол, может от вулканских* приветствий сразу перейти к вулканскому захвату? Редкие люди, проявлявшие интерес к жизни Матильды, удивлялись ее замкнутости и столь странным увлечениям. Все-таки она вступила в тот возраст, когда обостряются чувства, душа бунтует и просит новизны впечатлений – от молодой девушки пятнадцати лет ждут именно таких установок. Но Матильда для себя уже все решила. Самого дорогого человека больше нет, и второго такого никогда не будет. И единственный смысл в жизни – отомстить его убийце, который коварством (в этом она не сомневалась) избежал справедливого возмездия. То, что Стэн ходит по одним с ней улицам, заставляло Матильду каждый день подниматься на занятия, делать домашнее задание, тренироваться, мыть листья растения и пить молоко. То, что он, руководитель отдела в Управлении, каждый день совершает какие-то действия – тайные преступные и явные на страже закона – вдохновляло ее учиться по-настоящему, тянуться вверх, чтобы не стыдно было при встрече, и Леон мог бы ею гордиться. Постепенно месяцы складывались в годы, из которых запоминались только отдельные происшествия, оставившие наиболее глубокие впечатления. И в тот день, когда ей довелось бы взглянуть в глаза своего врага, она вспомнила бы именно такие моменты. На протяжении трех лет Стэн всегда был где-то рядом. Его можно было застать у входа или в холле Управления, но Матильда предпочитала наблюдать издалека, осторожно и не слишком часто. В самом здании он редко задерживался, а разузнать, куда он ездит по делам, было рискованно. Также не удалось выяснить, где же он живет. Но видимая близость цели создавала приятное ощущение, что можно в любой момент протянуть руку и сорвать сладкий плод мщения. По иронии судьбы, у Матильды даже появилась возможность оценить его высказывание о предпочтении жизнелюбивых людей в качестве жертв. В один прекрасный день, наблюдая в бинокль площадь перед Управлением, она увидела мерзавца веселым, хоть и слегка хромым, и прогуливающимся в обществе незнакомки. Судя по совершенно очарованному виду, молодая женщина явно не понимала, с кем имеет дело. А судя по виду Стэна, он что-то принял. Матильда поморщилась от неприятных воспоминаний. «Если он ее убьет, то она сама виновата», - подумала девушка. Душа ее кипела от возмущения и ненависти. Будь в руках снайперская винтовка, застрелила бы на месте. Обоих. Одного – за брата и Леона, за то, что жив и даже счастлив, другую – за то, что дура. Ну, что же, тем приятнее будет отнять у него жизнь. Матильда уже придумала план, разделалась с учебой – сдала годовые тесты на отлично, и тут… Стэн пропал. Она поняла это через неделю безрезультатных наблюдений у Управления. Сначала Матильда решила, что он ушел в отпуск, но через месяц с лишним поняла, что это слишком для такого спеца. Мир разом померк, дни полетели без счета, было чувство, словно дно ушло из-под ног. Будь это время учебным, она прогуливала бы занятия, просиживая дни напролет напротив Управления, но кто-то хранил ее от таких опрометчивых поступков. Леон на небе, не иначе. Она впервые по-настоящему дурела от бездействия. Не зная, куда себя деть, Матильда согласилась съездить вечером в город погулять с компанией сверстников, впервые в жизни. Но разговор не заладился: ее шуток не понимали, ответы игнорировали, и она довольно быстро поняла, что может исчезнуть совершенно незаметно. Она чувствовала себя настолько бессмысленно и тоскливо, что выбить это состояние можно было только клин клином. Навестить, например, их последнее с Леоном жилище. Интересно, кто там живет теперь? Помнит ли кто тот роковой день? Матильда получила ответы на свои вопросы у приветливой пожилой женщины из числа жильцов. Оказывается, там долго вспоминали о террористе, который взял в заложники девочку, а когда понял, что храбрый коп его если не поймает, то точно застрелит, взорвал полдома. – Ни себе, ни людям! – подытожила женщина и добавила, чуть не плача: – Полицейского жалко. Жить бы и жить… А девочку больше никто не видел, представляешь? – Полицейский жив и здоров, – успокоила ее Матильда. – А девочка умерла. Она совершила две роковые ошибки: потратила чуть больше денег на прогулку и прошлась до памятного дома пешком, надеясь сэкономить деньги на проезд. В итоге к тому моменту, когда Матильда подходила к нужной остановке, в переулках разлилась довольно густая сумеречная синева, и это нагоняло двойную порцию тоски и отчаянья. Она не плакала с самой попытки убить Стэна, но то было от раздражения и злобы, а сейчас глаза жгли обычные горькие слезы беспомощности и обиды. Всерьез не восприняли, она одинока, зря потратила время и деньги, добираться теперь с приключениями, даже слухи могут пойти… А главное, никто не знает правды о Леоне, а она даже не может открыть всем глаза и покарать его убийцу… – Мисс Ландо, могу ли я чем-нибудь помочь? Матильда не сразу вспомнила, где она слышала этот голос, а вспомнив, удивилась. И посмотрела на обратившегося. Агент Уилсон смотрел на нее поверх опущенного стекла машины, жесткое лицо его изображало подобие сочувствия, но тон обещал серьезный разговор. А он, пожалуй, постарше Стэна. Интересно, как он ее нашел? Ах, да, она всегда садится на этой остановке. Надо бы разнообразить привычки. Они зашли в кафе вроде того, что держал Тони, и Матильда допустила, что у этого заведения тоже есть секреты – не зря же они так удачно попали, что отдаленный столик в углу с приятным светом как раз пустовал. От предложения перекусить за счет Уилсона она тактично отказалась – мало ли, придется потом бесплатно работать на него за эти случайные харчи. Главное было не выдать при знакомстве, что она уже видела его раньше и более менее представляла себе, кто он такой. Матильда отметила, что сидеть напротив Уилсона за столом ей более комфортно, чем на соседнем сидении в машине. Зарождающимся чутьем она расценивала его мимолетные взгляды на свои коленки как неприятные. – Мисс Ландо, – начал Уилсон с ноткой печали, не выбивающейся, однако, из его официального стиля. – Примите мои запоздалые соболезнования. Представляю, как вам тяжело вспоминать те события, и прошу прощения за то, что вынужден напомнить о них… – Прошло три года, – ответила Матильда, отмечая, что речь идет явно о ее семье, расстрелянной людьми Стэна. – Время лечит, мне стало легче говорить об этом, и я могу слушать вас без оговорок. Как это произошло? Рассказывайте все, в подробностях, я выдержу. – О, это было ужасно. – Уилсон поморщился, словно увидел перед собой место преступления. – Злоумышленник выбил замок выстрелом из ружья, он шел по коридору, убивая всех, кто попадался ему на пути. Его первой жертвой стала женщина в ванной. – Агент сделал паузу и проследил за реакцией Матильды, та кивнула. – Дальше он догнал молодую девушку и застрелил ее выстрелом в спину. После этого глава семьи побежал к выходу, а преступник выхватил револьвер, и расстрелял его, опять-таки, в спину, добив тремя выстрелами в упор. У него кончились патроны, он достал пистолет-пулемет и расстрелял выбежавшего в коридор мальчика. При упоминании мальчика Матильда чуть моргнула, справляясь с жжением в глазах, и сдержалась – все-таки она морально приготовилась. – Продолжайте, мистер Уилсон. Со мной все в порядке. – На этом самое страшное заканчивается и начинается суть дела, – хищно оскалившись, с готовностью сообщил агент. – Мы нашли человека, расправившегося с вашей семьей. На стол легла фотография, озадачившая Матильду. Она была немного мутная, явно официальная. Судя по засвеченному блику, оригинал висел за стеклом. И точно не на стенде «Их разыскивает полиция», уж скорее на доске почета. Запечатлен на ней был хмурый, но, судя по виду, не злобный молодой мужик. Бесцветные волосы, светлые глаза. До впечатления полного уныния не хватало только двухдневной щетины, однако он был гладко выбрит, а его форма была застегнута на все пуговицы. За мгновение до того, как Матильда до конца осознала, кто это, Уилсон озвучил: – Его зовут Норман Стэнсфилд. Он оборотень в погонах, сделал карьеру в полиции, обзавелся связями. Так просто его не взять. Мы долго расследовали это дело, это был бы глухарь, если бы мы не попытались найти вас. Теперь благодаря вашим показаниям мы можем упечь его за решетку навсегда. А в тюрьме не любят бывших копов, даже продажных. Думаю, вас удовлетворит такой исход дела. Нам нужны только ваши показания. После того, как он сядет, вас не потревожат. Под выжидающим взглядом Уилсона Матильда соображала, что же делать. Она догадывалась, что весь разговор придет к Стэну, но вот так… Она хотела расплаты для него, но она хотела сделать это тихо, лично, адресно, а тут ей предлагали поучаствовать на подпевках в шоу имени Уилсона или еще кого-то. Сгноить убийцу в тюрьме, конечно, более жестокий вариант, чем просто застрелить или зарезать, но… Там он будет, как горошина в пироге, и она никогда не сможет его достать, чтобы даже сказать, кто и за что помог его туда упрятать… Нет, даже не в этом дело… Дело в этих моментах близости к жертве, ее дыхании, биении жизни, которая в твоей власти. Что можно позволить себе каприз и не причинить вреда… – Прошло много времени, – как можно решительнее начала излагать свою позицию Матильда. Уилсон при этом всем видом продемонстрировал непонимание ответа, отличного от «да» и «я согласна». – К тому же, у отца было ружье, он мог оказать сопротивление, что могло повлечь жертвы среди полицейских. И полицейский был не один, наверняка не вся вина на нем. Уилсон не подавал виду, но надо было ему показать, что официальную-то версию гибели своей семьи она знает. – Так ответ «нет», мисс Ландо? – холодно спросил агент. – Мне надо подумать, – уклончиво ответила Матильда, разглядывая фотографию. Предвосхищая обвинения в нерешительности, она заверила: – Впереди учеба и важные экзамены, мне надо вспомнить, насколько этот человек виноват передо мной, и прикинуть, когда я смогу вам помочь. Все-таки это была наполовину чужая мне семья. Как я могу связаться с вами? – Я сам найду вас, – многозначительно ответил агент. Матильда не могла расстаться с изображением Стэна, точно с какой-то диковиной: оно было, точно дверца в его жизнь, откуда он всегда будет смотреть на нее. И девушка позволила себе наглость. – Можно, я откопирую фото и верну вам при встрече? – Забирайте, – махнул рукой Уилсон. Матильда поблагодарила агента за эту любезность, но от того, чтобы он ее подвез, отказалась. Не хватало еще влезать в долги и слушать потом сплетни о себе в раздевалке.[Chapter 9] «Месть хороша, пока ты ее не совершил… Всю оставшуюся жизнь придется спать вполглаза...» Матильда лежала в темноте, чувствуя себя комком оголенных нервов. Да какая, к черту, разница, чего бояться и чего ради не спать, вздрагивая от каждого шороха, каждого вздоха ветра в кронах деревьев за окном? А разница та, что ее враг еще коптит небо. С самого ухода Леона она постоянно чувствовала себя в опасности. Но тревога уходила на второй план, день за днем уступая рутине. Порою, увлекшись новыми знаниями, девушка начинала интересоваться миром, заглядывать за рамки выставленных вокруг нее фальшивых декораций обыденности, будто снова обретая вкус к жизни. А ведь когда-то она сама могла дарить это чувство. Сейчас же ей очень не хватало его, словно жизнь покинула ее, и лишь тихо тлеющий огонек ненависти поддерживал движения души, разума и тела. Прошлое никогда не отпускало. А в этот раз оно предательски напомнило о себе. Произошло нечто совершенно ужасное и невозможное. И теперь Матильде хотелось перенестись во времени на три недели назад, к разговору с агентом, и уже тогда сказать, что она согласна сотрудничать. Не было бы второго их нескладного разговора с неприятным послевкусием, когда девушка отказалась от участия в деле своего врага. Тогда она чувствовала, что ее продуманная речь теряет всю свою убедительность в присутствии саркастичного Уилсона. Но она проявила тогда волю. Отказалась, чтобы покарать мерзавца своей рукой. По иронии судьбы, она теперь ждала в гости людей Стэна, сжимая под подушкой нож и обмирая от чувства обреченности. Получилось одновременно страшно и нелепо. Утром Матильда заехала в город к Тони, но сначала решила немного прогуляться. По дороге к ресторанчику она размышляла о том, куда же мог исчезнуть Стэн. Он мог выделить время на поправку подпорченного здоровья, мог заболеть, уехать в командировку или заняться личной жизнью. Последнее, конечно, едва ли возможно. Как и то, что он мог покинуть этот город насовсем, ведь конкуренты по-прежнему хотели устранить его. В раздумьях Матильда пнула банку из-под колы. Впереди уже маячил знакомый перекресток, и мысли девушки привычно обратились к Тони, их обычным разговорам, неизменному стакану молока, который в это время, вероятно, уже ждал ее на столе. Люди шли по улице, и Матильду не удивило, что с кем-то из них, идущим навстречу, она секунду не могла разойтись. Так бывает, когда люди витают в своих мыслях, ничего не замечая вокруг, и идут по оживленному тротуару или коридору. Когда вторая попытка обойти этого человека не увенчалась успехом, девушка посмотрела ему в лицо. Надо же было столкнуться с ним именно там, в двух шагах от спасительной двери «У Тони», словно в дурном сне! Но это был не сон. Стэн преграждал ей путь. Он как будто стал меньше с их встречи в уборной, и сейчас девушка смотрела на него почти на равных, а не снизу вверх, как раньше. Он уже не казался всесильным и недосягаемым – обычный мужик в светлом костюме, какие во множестве ходят по городу и сидят в офисах. Но это чувство было обманчиво, ведь сложность клиента складывается не только из его собственных данных. Мельком Матильда успела заметить двух его подручных, а одного из них – парня в клетчатой рубашке – даже запомнила, хотя это было уже ни к чему. В свое время надо было отбросить привычку носить грубые ботинки и коротко стричься, отпустить и перекрасить волосы, выбросить в Гудзон массивную подвеску… Ужас сковал ее, и чем отчетливей она понимала, что не узнать ее было невозможно и единственно верное решение – бежать прочь изо всех сил, тем сильнее было искушение остаться на месте и решить все раз и навсегда. Бесконечно долгие доли секунды Стэн проходил мимо. Потом где-то далеко позади хлопнула дверь машины, завелся мотор, и Матильда облегченно выдохнула, не веря в свое чудесное спасение. Вечером она проклинала прожитый день по двум причинам. Первая из них: она поругалась с Тони. Не насмерть, но она чувствовала, что по-прежнему уже не будет никогда. На нервах после пережитого она потребовала от него ответа, правда ли это он сдал Стэну место жительства Леона… Вспоминать не хотелось, в сердце появилась еще одна пустота, маленькая и холодная. Вторая причина: она не могла определиться, что больше беспокоит ее – то, что Стэн мог ее узнать, или то, что он мог ее не узнать. Первое было опасно, второе же было оскорбительно. Дорогу к Тони он помнит, а девочку, пытавшуюся его убить, запамятовал? Как такое может быть? У Матильды появилось предположение, что это амнезия – вообще причудливая и очень избирательная штука: все-таки он пережил взрыв. Но потом она решила, что надо меньше ходить по вечерам мимо рекреации, где комендантша и старшие школьницы смотрят мыльные оперы, которые понижают айкью всего пансионата. Матильда сочла нужным предупредить директрису, но та не придала особого значения и даже нашла слова, которые поначалу успокоили. Но Матильда знала: Стэн все помнит, он лишь затаился, потому что чует – сейчас ей наплевать на свою жизнь, и убийство не принесет ему удовольствия. А ближе к ночи всё ее существо захватил холодный липкий страх. После бессонной ночи Матильда взяла себя в руки. Надо было признать, что в ее ситуации было что-то от давнишней попытки убить Стэна, только рядом не было Леона, который защитил бы ее от ярости потревоженного врага. Конечно, никто не заменил бы ей все, что составляло мимолетное счастье в ее короткой жизни, никто бы не смог этого понять, никто бы уже не воскресил то, что умерло в ней. Но тут дело было в другом. Матильда отчаянно нуждалась в защите и помощи. В чем бы она сама себя не убеждала и как бы не бравировала наедине с собой, расправа ее пугала. Тони не пойдет против Стэна, директриса не спасет ее от бандитов, переезд не решит проблему навсегда: чуткий сон потенциальной жертвы – изощренная пытка, муки которой она уже ощутила этой ночью. И единственное, что могло ее защитить сейчас – закон, в который она уже давно не верила. Посмотрев на то, как страж порядка расстреливает женщин и детей, а киллер в это время спасает маленькую девочку, трудно потом решиться подать заявление в полицию. На протяжении трех дней девушка дежурила на «своей» остановке в городе, и на четвертый день Уилсон вышел на связь. Разговор состоялся в уже знакомом кафе за тем самым укромным столиком, идеально подходившим для подобных случаев. – Что-то случилось, мисс Ландо? – Агент как будто был обеспокоен. Выражение лица было то же, что при их первой встрече – дежурно сочувственное, а взгляд при этом сверлил насквозь. – Ничего. – И теперь надо порадовать его новостью. – Я еще раз хорошо все обдумала и готова выдвинуть обвинения против Стэнсфилда. Агент то ли улыбнулся, то ли оскалился, показав длинные зубы, и эта улыбка не предвещала убийце Леона и братика ничего хорошего. – Поздно, мисс Ландо. – Злорадный тон показался Матильде неуместным и оттого пугающим. Агент усмехнулся и продолжил: – Я уже проконсультировался по вероятности положительного решения по этому делу. Как вы сказали, вас не было поблизости от места преступления во время совершения этого самого преступления, то есть вы лишь можете подать заявление, но не решить исход дела. – Не давая Матильде вставить слово, он говорил и говорил, повышая тон. – Показания других свидетелей не доказывают вины Стэнсфилда, повторное расследование затруднительно в виду уничтожения многих улик за давностью. Следствие остановилось на версии, что ваш отец, испугавшись ответственности за хранение наркотиков, застрелил одного сотрудника полиции и ранил Стэнсфилда из своего оружия. Завладев оружием стража порядка, ваш отец, пользуясь созданной неразберихой, расстрелял вашу мачеху и сводную сестру, потому что те были в курсе его дел. Его действия вызвали панику у одного из сотрудников полиции, и тот открыл беспорядочную стрельбу, в ходе которой случайно погиб маленький мальчик – надо думать, ваш родной брат. Стэнсфилд ранил вашего отца, дабы остановить преступника, но тот дернулся при его приближении. Стэнсфилд всадил в него весь барабан, потому что преступник был еще вооружен и опасен, а сам коп был в состоянии аффекта от увиденной бойни… – Агент понизил голос до презрительного неодобрения. – Вас устраивает такая версия гибели вашей семьи, мисс Ландо? Это при том, что их убийца разгуливает на свободе и считается одним из лучших сотрудников Управления. Но стыдить или как-то иначе пробуждать ее к действиям было излишне – Матильда чувствовала лишь желание сжать рукоять ножа и самой совершить правосудие, никому ничего не доказывая, обманув систему, надежно защищавшую Стэна. Ночь в страхе и ожившие картины гибели ее близких отодвинули желание спасти свою жизнь на второй план. Месть ее и спасет, а этот скользкий тип может и дальше думать, с какой стороны подкопаться. Матильда уже думала сказать что-то на прощание и направиться к выходу, раз уж свидетель из нее не получился, но Уилсон ее остановил. Как он это сделал, девушка не поняла, но вид его говорил, что разговор не окончен, и она то ли из любопытства, то ли из вежливости спросила о дальнейших планах по этому делу. – Знаете, есть одна возможность. – Уилсон смотрел ей в глаза, казалось, его сероватое лицо совсем близко. – Но от вас потребуется все ваше мужество. Они шли темным ночным переулком – черной влажно блестящей пропастью между кирпичными стенами зданий. Машину пришлось оставить во дворе за пару кварталов от пункта назначения – это было необходимо для дела. Матильда строила догадки о цели их вылазки, обходя сточные канавы и разнообразный мусор. Самой правдоподобной ей казалась мысль, что они идут следить за темными делишками Стэна и компании. А что еще могут сделать два человека? Например, агент может попытаться кого-то арестовать… Хотя, может, он сотрудник спецслужб – выправка заметна. Тогда было бы интереснее. Их путешествие закончилось в мрачноватом тупике, заваленном строительным мусором. В здание вела железная дверь, к которой вели хлипкие ржавые лестничные марши. – Вот мы и пришли, – тихо, но ощутимо небрежно сказал Уилсон. – Дальше ваш выход. Вы входите в это здание, а дальше все происходит само. – Что… происходит? – спросила Матильда, начиная догадываться. – А происходит вот что. – Уилсон темным пятном закрывал обратный путь. - Ты идешь по этой гребаной лестнице в это гребаное здание. – Там… доказательства? – Матильда подняла на агента незамутненный взгляд. Тянуть время, любой ценой тянуть время! Валять дурочку, изобразить приступ. Надо сначала понять, что к чему. – Да, – с издевательской ноткой согласился агент. – Не бойся, там с тобой ничего не случится. Если доказательств нет, то их надо создать. Возможно, в здании люди Стэна – на рейде, например, но скорее всего, это сделка. Если она окажется в здании, то Стэн сведет с ней счеты, а уж Уилсон предоставит следствию все доказательства убийства. Ее убийства… И с ней не церемонятся уже – она же расходный материал! Мысли лихорадочно прокручивались в ее уме, перекрывались, точно стеклышки в калейдоскопе, но она лишь спросила: – Там Стэнсфилд? Агент дернулся, точно от пощечины. Да, Тони прав, когда говорит, что жизнь заставляет людей думать. Похоже, ее предположение попало в точку. И это был блестящий шанс, как ей тогда казалось. Матильда улыбнулась: – Дайте мне оружие, и я иду. – Время выходит, – угрожающе отозвался Уилсон. – Ты пойдешь туда в любом случае и так, как я захочу. А я хочу, чтобы ты была безоружна. Может, ты еще не заметила, но пути назад у тебя нет. Матильда начала было протестовать, но он продолжил шепотом, от которого ей стало окончательно ясно, что бесполезно взывать к человечности или предлагать всех устраивающие варианты: – Или ты сейчас просто поверишь мне и по-хорошему сделаешь, что я сказал. Или ты поползешь делать то же самое, но сначала убедишься, что нет того, что я не могу сейчас с тобой сделать. – Почему? – спросила девушка, размазывая слезы под упавшими на лицо волосами: так можно было незаметно высматривать что-нибудь, подходящее для самообороны. Покорность жертвы вдохновила Уилсона. – Потому что я знаю, что ты делала после гибели своих родных. – Это было неприятным сюрпризом, если он говорил о Леоне и ее обучении. Может, блефует? – Я могу упечь тебя в колонию для малолетних преступников, а могу рассказать всем твоим учителям и друзьям, какую веселую жизнь ты вела со своим сожителем. Я могу тебя сейчас избить до кровавых соплей, и никто, деточка, тебе не поверит, когда ты прибежишь жаловаться на меня. – Глаза его загорелись огнем, который Матильде совсем не понравился. – А могу прямо здесь вежливо попросить тебя показать, чему ты научилась у взрослого мужчины. И ты не сможешь отказаться, потому что, напоминаю, я могу сделать с твоей паршивой жизнью, за которую ты так цепляешься, все, что захочу. – Ну так и дайте мне оружие – и я покажу вам, чему меня учили! – только невидимый в грязной темноте румянец мог бы выдать, что девушка прекрасно поняла, к чему на самом деле клонил агент. Да как он смеет порочить ее любовь своим поганым языком! Леон бы сейчас подогнал ему гранату под ноги или отстрелил бы все лишнее. Стало обидно и горько. Уилсон, похоже, понял ее по-своему. А может, решил силком отправить ее безоружной навстречу безжалостному врагу. Да и зачем отправлять ее куда-то живой, если у него есть возможность подкинуть труп? Он неспешно приблизился к дрожащей заплаканной девушке, забившейся в угол, загроможденный разломанными деревянными коробками. Матильда даже не поняла, что произошло в следующий момент. Она знала, что в руках у нее что-то вроде бывшей ножки стола, чувствовала, как тяжело замахиваться, успела подумать, что бить по левой руке – неудачное решение. Агент перехватил ее оружие, слабо ударившее его, и она вслепую ударила его пониже колена, а затем – не очень удачный удар ниже пояса. Матильде не приходилось использовать свои навыки часто, но иногда приходилось. Был эффект неожиданности в темноте – нападение сломленной, деморализованной, зависимой жертвы, за которой было трудно уследить в темном углу. Мнение других, образ жизни, страх за будущее – девушка отмела все эти флажки, которыми ее обкладывали год за годом. Она опрометью бросилась на свет, скидывая в проход коробки и отвратительного вида большие мусорные пакеты. Ее удары были недостаточно сильны, Уилсон преследовал ее, и конец погони был вопросом времени: его дыхание, треск коробок и плеск грязной воды неумолимо приближались. Девушка уже видела улицу и была готова выскочить навстречу припозднившимся прохожим, когда пальцы разъяренного Уилсона впились в ее запястье с такой силой, будто он хотел выломать из него все косточки. Вскрикнув, девушка собралась, и, не дожидаясь, когда он схватит ее второй рукой, пнула, кажется, по колену и угостила напоследок «вулканским приветствием». Увернувшись от его объятий один раз, она почти достигла мутного пятна света от одинокого фонаря. Но почувствовала, что руки из темноты позади вцепились в куртку. – Помогите! – вырвалось у нее впервые за три года. Но тогда она как можно тише сдавленно молила о спасении, а сейчас надо было позвать в полный голос. Улица безмолвствовала, но свет, кажется, фар, вспорол темноту. Хватка на ее хрупких плечах ослабла и исчезла совсем, быстрые шаги удалялись в зловонной темноте позади. – Ну, нет… – прошептала Матильда, оказавшись перед источником спасительного сияния – полицейской патрульной машиной. За рулем сидел обычный коп. Этот парень сразу бросился в переулок, но вернулся через пять минут, как можно было ожидать, без Уилсона. Матильда не сопротивлялась намерению отвезти ее в участок и добровольно села в машину. И в салоне она оказалась не одна. Парень в клетчатой рубашке, человек Стэна, иногда перебрасывался парой слов с копом за рулем. Неужели напарники? Едва ли полицейский катает своего приятеля на дежурстве. Тем поздним вечером Матильда впервые написала заявление в полицию, которое, она была готова побиться об заклад, забрал сообщник ее давнего врага, хлопотавший рядом. Чудесно, просто чудесно! Пусть продажные копы перестреляют или пересажают друг друга! Уже в своей комнате в пансионате девушка вспоминала вероломство и садизм Уилсона, равнодушие копа в участке, возмущения комендантши поздним включением душа. Она представляла, как Стэн посмеивается, читая ее заявление. Что еще завтра скажут о ее ночном возвращении и синяках… Она одна в этом мире, никто не удержит ее тонкую руку от выстрела в русской рулетке. Даже если она выбьет себе мозги, никто даже не заметит.[Chapter 10] – Привет, свинки! – весело крикнула Матильда, скидывая обувь в прихожей. – Привет, Матильда! – ответила она сама себе уже на кухне, изображая звонкий разноголосый хор. Задорный фартук в мультяшных хавроньях свисал со спинки стула. Таких стульев было два – рассохшиеся и скрипучие, они годились для размещения всякой мелочи куда лучше, чем для своего прямого назначения, и это был своего рода утешительный забег, почетная пенсия – все равно хозяева были против произвола жильцов в отношении старой мебели. Перед фартуком со свинками Матильда в свое время не устояла – именно его не хватало в скромной обстановке, до боли напоминающей дни с Леоном. За окном ярко светило солнце, и его лучи словно старались по-своему переложить клетку на скатерти тенями от оконной рамы, а заодно перекроить всю тесную, под стать маленькой квартирке, кухню. Матильда снимала это жилье недавно, сменив предыдущую уже привычную квартиру, которую она подыскала после пансионата школы в связи с поступлением в колледж. Тони очень помог ей с финансовой стороной поступления два года назад. Он не выдавал ей больше сотни на руки, но в принципиальных вопросах выполнял волю Леона, тем более, в его «лучше, чем банке» хранились и деньги ее семьи. Как бы она ни сердилась тогда на Тони, все равно всякий раз, когда он брал на себя заботу о ее делах, Матильда ощущала неудобство, почти угрызения совести. И тихо сердилась еще пуще. Хотелось свести это чувство к минимуму, а заодно обрести некоторую независимость. …Еще в школе она пробовала подрабатывать, но с месяц пожив, дни напролет сбиваясь с ног и едва донося голову до подушки уже в своей комнате, быстро поняла, что неинтеллектуальный труд, да еще и обставленный со всех сторон ритуалами и контролем, несовместим со смыслом ее жизни. Заказы, всегда приветливая улыбка и безукоризненная вежливость, лавирование между столиками, сотня мелочей ежесекундно в мозге, привыкшем впитывать знания и обдумывать месть, а не держать временный мусор. Самое ужасное, что в отупляющей череде однообразных дней за подносом она забывала, чем живет на самом деле. Тогда она ощутила очень остро, что образование пригодится, ведь ее операция требовала определенных вложений и информированности, а без времени и денег и речи быть не могло о достойной подготовке. Тогда же Матильда приняла решение о своей будущей специальности: она не знала точно, что это будет, интересно ли ей это, сколько за это платят и как с этим жить, но все это не имело значения – во главу угла ставились доступность, краткость курса и возможность бывать в Управлении на постоянной основе. Так она и сформировала приблизительную цель: колледж, что-нибудь не очень престижное, но желательно хоть как-то связанное с юриспруденцией или делопроизводством. За малыми шагами к промежуточной цели время летело быстро. Вокруг бушевали подростковые драмы, возникали и рушились парочки, собирались и распадались стратегические союзы. Но несколько человек были заняты делом среди этого непостоянного хаоса, одной из них была и Матильда. Что касается Кэт, то та уверенно переросла стадию юного натуралиста и шла в разряд будущих экологов. Иногда становилось жаль разъезжаться, все-таки столько лет они мирно соседствовали по своим углам. Оказывается, такое отношение – вроде равнодушное, но доброжелательно-ненавязчивое – было именно тем, что не тревожило старые душевные раны и не наносило новых. В один из последних дней в пансионате Матильда решилась дозировано рассказать Кэт часть своей истории. Слова образовывали неудержимый поток, и она осознала, как же давно этот рассказ рвался быть изложенным, разделенным с кем-то. Сердце ее билось, точно в вольном беге навстречу ветру, в этом биении не было режущего диссонанса холодного страха. Только свобода скинуть маску. …Девочка из неблагополучной семьи, оставшаяся одна наедине с бандитами, расстрелявшими ее родных – вот кто она была в минуту, когда он пришел ей на помощь – добрый плохой человек, живший по соседству, единственный, кто откликался на ее немой крик о помощи: вредные привычки, взгляд в пропасть через решетку перил, открытое лицо со следами побоев. Он защищал ее от убийц, приучил пить молоко, заменил родителей и весь белый свет – странный человек, замкнутый, мрачный и немногословный. От таких не ждут милосердия, но в этом мире давно все смешалось, и такой тип оказался самым преданным другом, заботливым родителем и единственным защитником, какого знала истерзанная детская душа. Его больше нет, и цветок, который снова растет в саду, был ему лучшим другом… Естественно, она опустила подробности, умолчала о настоящих именах и откровенном криминале, но не могла не ответить на вопрос, когда же с ней произошли все эти знаменательные события. На ее честный ответ Кэт задумчиво сказала просто: «Ладно», и Матильда была благодарна за отсутствие лишних вопросов – несколько минут откровенности вымотали не хуже полного рабочего дня. Этот разговор Матильда помнила отлично, а вот два года учебы в колледже смешались в один бесконечный день сплошных лекций, практик и контроля знаний. Выпив непременный стакан молока, девушка взяла пульверизатор и занялась растением. Неприхотливое и живучее, никогда не жалующееся и не упрекающее, оно скрашивало ее будни уже седьмой год. Лучший друг, которому можно было рассказать все. …Растение по имени Леон сменило множество листьев с тех пор, как в один недобрый день перепуганная Матильда – тогда почти девчонка – обратилась за помощью к федеральному агенту, точившему зуб на ее врага. Тот случай месяца на три отбил желание наведываться в город, кроме как для встречи с Тони. Вспоминать ту историю девушка не любила: до сих пор в памяти всплывали темнота, обманутые надежды, затяжное предчувствие предательского удара с неожиданной стороны. Но было в этом и кое-что полезное: тогда она раз и навсегда решила, что будет работать одна. Сначала от этой мысли было страшно, она была словно последняя горькая капля в чаше одиночества и беззащитности, но Матильде было не привыкать к подобному. Отмаявшись опасениями последствий крайне неудачного сотрудничества, от которого она приобрела лишь нового недруга, спустя некоторое время девушка решилась провести разведку. К ее облегчению, Уилсон сошел со сцены и, надо отметить, за четыре года ни разу не попался ей на глаза. А не то она убила бы его, честное слово. Скорее всего, он опасался Стэна и его людей, которые вполне могли пресечь его деятельность, если не свидетельствами о превышении полномочий, так пулей в лоб. Стэн же, напротив, как тогда вернулся, так и не собирался исчезать надолго. Раз в пару лет он мог неделю-другую не появляться в Управлении, а потом все снова шло по-старому. Он работал день за днем, из года в год и, похоже, без выходных: отправляясь на вылазку рано утром в субботу, Матильда знала, кого увидит на ступенях парадного. Не зря же он говорил, что дети должны быть в школе – эта истина не оставляла его болезненную уродливую натуру, видимо, с годами менялась лишь функция. Матильде все хотелось еще раз почувствовать, как она ненавидит его всеми фибрами души, еще раз увидеть его довольным жизнью, непременно в обществе хорошенькой женщины. Но это никак не удавалось: складывалось такое впечатление, что Стэнсфилд решил пересажать всех, кто причастен к обороту «зелья» любой природы в этом городе – иначе было трудно объяснить видимые методичность и упорство. Фотография, полученная от агента, прописалась в глубине ящика ее письменного стола в одной из библиотечных книг. Раньше это делалось для конспирации, но постепенно переросло в привычку. Когда у Матильды появлялось немного времени, чтобы побыть в одиночестве, она доставала на свет свою реликвию и погружалась во взгляд своего врага. Прошли годы, и это фото перестало вызывать у нее те самые всплески гнева: все-таки на фото Стэн был совсем молодой и малость даже наивный. Не было в его глазах неотделимой от ненавистного образа безуминки, скорее усталость, сквозящая через готовность честно нести службу. Совсем другой человек. Вместо того, чтобы вызывать жажду мести, этот взгляд навевал что-то вроде скуки и заставлял еще раз вспомнить все сомнения, обрушивающиеся всякий раз, когда повседневная жизнь надолго отвлекала ее от самого главного. Две версии гибели ее брата не давали ей покоя до сих пор. Она помнила ошарашивший разговор убийц у нее дома, меловой контур маленького тела на полу квартиры, помнила разговор Стэнсфилда с двумя следователями. В какой момент она решила, что ее брата намеренно и хладнокровно пристрелил лично Стэн? Говорят, человек может перепутать фантазии с реальностью, но как она могла нафантазировать себе такое? И что тут фантазия, принявшая вид воспоминаний, а где – воспоминания, неотличимые от фантазии? Открылись какие-то тайники разума, в которых была надежно спрятана память о том страшном дне. Матильда словно снова перенеслась в свое хрупкое двенадцатилетнее тело и брела на негнущихся ногах к двери квартиры Леона. Труп у порога в луже крови, топот и голоса за стеной. А ведь еще четверть часа назад все было как всегда. – Посмотри, что ты наделал! Ты убил четырехлетнего мальчика! Нельзя было обойтись без этого?.. …А вот уже унылые стены сортира в Управлении. Парень с дредами в прическе стоит у ряда казенных раковин и молча наблюдает, как Стэн целится из револьвера в нее, Матильду. Но в какой-то момент что-то переключилось в дурной голове его шефа. – Отведи ее в мой офис… Того подонка, косящего под растамана, звали Блад. Вот чего не хватало в мозаике. …Блад, отведи ее в мой офис… …Ну и что же ты наделал?.. Нельзя было обойтись без этого? Это был маленький четырехлетний мальчик!.. …Ну и что же ты наделал, Уилли Блад? Ты убил маленького мальчика! Нельзя было обойтись без этого?.. Матильда хотела забыть свое прозрение, но уже не могла. Ее братик погиб от шальной пули, выпущенной совсем другим подонком, который получил свое раньше Стэна. Живительное пламя ее ненависти поколебалось, руки были готовы опуститься. Надо было забыть о мести, как говорил Леон, и вот он снова оказался прав. И он продолжал бы жить, если б она послушала! Но ведь Стэн – просто отвратительный человек, который сам мог убить ее братика, если б добрался. Собирался же он пристрелить ее, в чем она после личной беседы не испытывала не малейшего сомнения. Он – двуличный оборотень в погонах, сам не прочь побаловаться веществами, так что ее месть по-прежнему имела смысл и даже несла пользу обществу. И если Леон все-таки погиб тогда, то виноват в этом опять-таки Стэн… Стайка солнечных зайчиков на столе увядала, приняв вечерний оранжевый оттенок. Матильда поставила растение обратно на подоконник, сбрызнула водой напоследок – возможно, у них осталось только торопливое утреннее прощание. Подлила себе молока – вечером ждало еще немало дел. «Завтра. Все случится завтра». – …Так чем же обусловлено то, что даже имея возможности для достойной жизни и самореализации, некоторые люди могут быть склонны к девиантному поведению? – задумчиво вещал преподаватель, окидывая взглядом ряды студентов в лекционной аудитории. Матильда любила открытые лекции куда больше, чем то, что было нужно по выбранным ею курсам. Студенческая жизнь открывала больше возможностей, чем школа, и девушка могла наконец-то попробовать разобраться в себе, нащупать то, что могло стать ее дорогой в этом мире, сложись все иначе. И это оказалось непростым делом, ведь все новое сразу же увлекало ее, особенно, если это касалось мира вокруг в целом и человеческого общества в частности. К социальным наукам она относилась с особым интересом… Собираясь на встречу всей своей жизни, девушка среди прочего вспоминала, какие мысли пробудила та давнишняя лекция. И она в очередной раз задумалась, как бы могла сложиться ее жизнь, не случись тогда той расправы. Ее братику было бы сейчас одиннадцать лет, он ходил бы в школу, возможно, они обсуждали бы всякие интересные явления, она была бы ему и мамой, и лучшим другом. А ведь при жизни братик практически не говорил. Ей было жаль его иначе, чем жалеют человека, прожившего долгую жизнь и оставившего после себя результат долгой работы, а также скорбящих детей и внуков. Такой укол жалости испытываешь, когда видишь мертвого котенка на обочине – как столкновение чего-то еще недавно невыразимо милого и равнодушной жестокости мира – предсказуемый результат злого случая, каприз смерти. Но так бы радужно все обстояло, не вторгнись смерть в их скрытый от посторонних глаз маленький домашний ад? Где-то Матильда даже начала жалеть отца, который скопил денег на ее обучение в школе, пусть он и свернул на скользкую дорожку. Но домашний террор она не могла простить и была уверена, что если бы вся ее жизнь прошла в помыканиях и побоях, то попытки дать ей хорошее образование мало чего стоили бы. Она продолжила бы прогуливать занятия, курить и пытаться обратить на себя внимание хоть одной живой души. Кем бы она стала? Уподобилась бы мачехе и пошла на панель? Или вела бы жизнь серой моли, которая ни слова поперек сказать не может? А еще она не узнала бы Леона – так и продолжала бы просто здороваться с незнакомым странным соседом и прятать дымящийся окурок. Целая жизнь прошла бы мимо – месяц, который стоил иных нескольких лет. И она потеряла это сокровище, словно данное ей взамен погибшего брата. Да, сейчас она была одинока. Да, она была мрачна и всячески поддерживала в себе одержимость местью. Но это становилось все труднее, ведь мир звал ее, вся жизнь расстилалась впереди широкой дорогой. И даже если она не сулила Матильде головокружительных перспектив, то все же была исполнена достоинства и некоторой красоты. И девушке было немного жаль, что с расплатой это может померкнуть, закрыться для нее навсегда. Они со Стэном еще не рассчитались, даже если признать, что разрушением он, сам того не ведая, принес ей благо. Матильда сидела за столом уже вечером, в янтарном свете настольной лампы. Если бы случайный прохожий, каким-то невероятным образом забредший в переулок, разглядел бы с улицы ее тень на шторах, то наверняка решил бы, что девушка читает неведомую книгу, разложенную на столе. Но на самом деле это была не книга. Перед ней на выщербленной деревянной поверхности лежал пистолет. Черный, словно провал в никуда, однако тускло отражающий слабое освещение краями и гранями. Свешивающийся пожухший лист растения, стакан молока и фотография Стэнсфилда дополняли эту композицию, символизирующую и подытоживающую всю ее жизнь. …На совершеннолетие она с небольшим опозданием сделала себе подарок – будущее орудие убийства. В ассортименте были ножи, пистолеты, ружья. Лезвия неуловимыми изгибами словно просили крови ее врага, крупный калибр же обещал смертельный фейерверк. Но девушка знала: для ножей она недостаточно профессиональна, и она не терминатор, чтоб вламываться с большой пушкой наперевес в здание, где полно копов. Пистолет, «Беретта», как у Леона – вот ее выбор. Была единственная сложность, за которую она волновалась – обоснованность приобретения оружия, и какова же была ее радость, что вероятная необходимость самообороны была признана весомым аргументом. Матильда вспомнила бытность подмастерьем киллера: все разбирала и собирала обратно свое приобретение, любовно чистила, выбиралась на стрельбище. Пистолет для нее был одновременно подобен произведению искусства, инструменту, отзывчивому к руке мастера, и живому существу. О, лучшей лаской для него было бы хоть раз коснуться дулом лица обмирающего от страха подонка!.. …Это было еще на той, старой квартире. Поначалу девушка снимала ее одна, но последние месяцы она готовилась к экзаменам и отказалась от подработки, целиком перебиваясь мелкими заказами по оформлению бумаг и набору текстов. Какая ирония: она оформляла бумаги за Леона и теперь занималась тем же самым. Когда выросла квартплата, Матильда решила, что настал момент, когда пора либо снять угол подешевле, либо оплачивать с кем-то на пару. Переезд был некстати, поэтому она дала объявление. Среди нескольких обратившихся Матильда выбрала меньшее зло в виде приезжей девушки, которая с полтиной в кармане собралась покорить подиумы. Конечно, эта Вики не была таким удачным вариантом, как Кэт. Правило «ни гостей, ни животных» она нарушила неоднократно, без умолку трещала про неизвестных Матильде знаменитостей, боялась мелкой живности, разбрасывала вещи и всячески проявляла противоположность. Но до почти забытой сводной сестры ей было очень далеко, ведь делала она это не со зла и даже как будто слушалась, стоило хозяйке принять угрожающий вид. Сразу начиналось «Ма, прости». Сколько же ей лет? Пятнадцать, шестнадцать? Бестелесная, всегда разная из-за требований к фотосессиям и неприкаянная, словно сирота, которой она и оказалась на самом деле. Иногда это «Ма» западало Матильде в сердце, и она могла стерпеть попытки сделать прическу из своих коротких, точно под гильотину отсеченных волос или надеть платье, пару раз даже согласилась пройтись по магазинам. Но порой новая соседка была совершенно несносна. Однажды по приходу домой после отъезда на три дня Матильда обнаружила погром, взвод пустых бутылок из-под портвейна и не до конца развеявшийся дым чего-то сладковатого, от чего начинала кружиться голова. Эх, покуражились бы Стэн и компания в этом притоне! Полусонная соседка с облаком растрепанных светлых волос на голове, в длинной дизайнерской майке на одно плечо и в разводах смазанной косметики восседала на диване королевой этого бедлама. Матильда отобрала у нее папиросу, отчитала, c гордостью чувствуя себя Леоном, и выдала такую речь о ценности и неповторимости жизни, что, как ей казалось, Стэн под кайфом нервно курил бы в сторонке. Вики на это лишь сонно, лишь бы от нее отстали, затянула следующее: – Ма, ну почему ты такая скучная? Не отрываешься с друзьями, не встречаешься ни с кем… Все по конференциям мотаешься… Ты что, хочешь умереть девственницей? Британские ученые говорят, что миллениум будет в этом году. На Новый год все часы обнулятся, могут быть сбои в этих… системах запуска ядерных ракет, и наступит конец света. Матильду не особенно тревожил такой поворот. Все ее мысли и чувства были отданы без остатка: сердце она подарила Леону, разум в свободное время был предоставлен Стэну. Окружающие либо казались ей трусливыми и расчетливыми, не способными защитить, зато вполне готовыми воспользоваться, либо были слишком беззаботны и добры, чтобы тянуть их за собой в бездну с каждой минутой, проведенной рядом. Поэтому ей не хотелось думать об отношениях. Куда больше она жалела о том, что непредвиденные события могли навсегда помешать ей отомстить Стэнсфилду. Но надо признать, что конец света, приди он хоть с километровым цунами, хоть с адским пламенем, уравнял бы их на под толщей воды или на ядерном пепелище. Именно из-за соседки пришлось переезжать при первой возможности. – Ну и урод твой парень, только не обижайся, – как бы между делом сказала Вики вместо приветствия, лежа на диване и рассматривая, вероятно, что-то из своих журналов. – Какой еще парень? – автоматически спросила Матильда, направляясь на кухню выгрузить пакеты молока. Когда она вернулась в коридор, перебирая в уме всех сокурсников и курсантов академии, с которыми могла оказаться рядом на глазах у соседки, то нос к носу столкнулась со Стэном. Не буквально, конечно, а с той самой его фотографией. – Вот этот! – задорно провозгласила Вики, протягивая фото к ее лицу, как неоспоримое доказательство чего-то. – Он не мой парень, – только и сказала Матильда, молниеносным движением вырывая драгоценность из ее рук. – Где ты это взяла? Есть же правило – не трогать мои вещи. – Конечно, я так и поняла, что нет, – зачастила Вики, игнорируя вопрос. А потом выдала: – Потому что он – твой клиент, тебе его заказали! А я-то думала, к чему эти глупые правила, затворничество, и ужасная одежда: пальто, башмаки и круглые темные очки… А потом я увидела пистолет, фотографию… И все поняла. Ты – киллер! Ма, ты такая крутая! Успокоившись, она оглянулась на входную дверь и заговорщицким шепотом поинтересовалась: – А сколько будет стоить нанять тебя? А то есть одна... вечно ее выбирают вместо меня на кастингах… – Нисколько, – Матильда шла в свою комнатушку, не оборачиваясь. – На фото мой дядя – он был опекуном, а пистолет – травматический, от хулиганов. После этого случая нельзя было откладывать переезд. Как раз все лучшим образом решилось со стажировкой, а соседка все не могла определиться ни с учебой, ни с работой, ни с общежитием. Подвергать ее опасности, пусть и вынужденно, было неправильно, но и откладывать дело жизни не было выходом. Квартиру пришлось оставить записанной на Матильду – Вики боялась, что раз ей меньше восемнадцати, одну ее не пустят жить. Но сама «хозяйка» стала проживать на новом месте, иногда проведывая бывшую соседку и изредка помогая небольшими суммами. Матильда принципиально не собиралась выдавать ей свой настоящий адрес, хотя та всякий раз спрашивала или навязывалась в гости. Здание Управления нагоняло на Матильду тоску. Несколько лет она мечтала о дне, когда переступит порог этого учреждения, покорит его первую ступень. Да, она делала это ради одного лишь мгновения, одного взгляда… Но представить на секунду, что она могла бы провести здесь всю жизнь, выучить наизусть каждую царапину на облицовке и каждое пятнышко на асфальте по дороге сюда… Для себя, а не для мести, она бы выбрала что-то другое. Ближе к свету, к людям, приносящее новое каждый день, меняющее мир к лучшему без запретов и подавления. Но тут тоже была работа, важная работа. И ее надо было выполнять, за что девушка и взялась с азартом протеста. Бывалые над ней подтрунивали, например, наглый, но вроде не вредный охранник, или выдавали неиссякаемый запас заданий, как начальница из архива. Стэна она неоднократно видела издалека, благо, всякий раз была возможность смешаться с толпой. В чем преимущество строгой одежды, так это в том, что она делает человека неузнаваемым среди таких же. Но драгоценная, бесчисленными днями оплаченная стажировка в Управлении принесла неприятное открытие: меры безопасности последний год были таковы, что пронести оружие становилось очень проблематично. Девушка чувствовала себя в ловушке, в которую, как оказалось, она шла годами своих ученических и студенческих усилий, днями одиночества, бессонными ночами. Основа для идеального плана рушилась, увлекая за собой цель ее жизни. И она отказалась от первоначальной задумки, обманула коварную судьбу… Матильда еще раз посмотрела на стопку вещей, которые она собиралась взять с собой в день совершения мести. Завтра, или, возможно, уже никогда. Застать Стэна и улучить при этом удобный момент оказалось не так просто, как она себе представляла, да и покинуть архив не всегда представлялось возможным. И вот случайно стало известно время, когда он будет один в своем кабинете, а к этому моменту у нее может появиться предлог, чтобы обойти Управление по делам. Раз нельзя пронести ничего металлического, режущего и взрывчатого, то у нее и не будет с собой ничего такого. Любимый пистолет займет свое место в тайнике под половицей на кухне, а крови ее врага отведает стеклянный нож. Она нашла две полоски стекла у ремонтируемого здания довольно далеко от дома, строительный мусор вокруг которого и подал ей эту идею. Обмотав один конец изолентой и сделав таким образом импровизированную короткую рукоять, она обколола оставшиеся края до бритвенной остроты. В таком виде «ножи» были помещены в жесткий переплет блокнота, который после этой операции выглядел как обычно и по-прежнему безобидно. Матильда неумолимо несла смерть своему врагу. Этому не могли помешать ни солнечное легкое утро, ни настрой людей вокруг, ни семь лет жизни без Леона. За Стэнсфилдом долг, и немалый: это он виноват в гибели ее брата, это он убил ее единственного друга, это он совершает преступления, прикрываясь служебным положением. Семь лет одиночества, холода, молчания. Моменты слабости, соблазна бросить все. Множество препятствий, преодолеваемых на боли от давних потерь, когда нельзя жаловаться, нельзя никому излить душу. Просто нельзя оставить все как есть, и не у кого просить помощи в этом невозможном деле. Семь лет она не просто ждала этого дня – она шла к нему через неимоверные усилия, преодолевая себя и обстоятельства. Остается последний, отчаянный, непредсказуемый шаг.[Chapter 11] – …У меня личное дело... Семь лет назад ты убил моего брата и моего друга. Я пришла за тобой. – Оу… Стэн повернулся к Матильде. Несмотря на знакомые ей уже застарелые шрамы, отпечаток адской работы и возраста, это был все тот же Стэн: образ безобидного с виду чуть небрежного эстета, слипшиеся отросшие волосы, щетина. Мужчина средних лет ненамного выше самой девушки, сейчас он показался ей даже хрупким. Было в нем что-то болезненное, надломленное, невозможное и неуместное, что хотелось немедленно исправить, вычистить. Он казался не менее чуждым самому лучшему, что есть в этом мире, чем федеральная атрибутика кабинета – вендетте Матильды. Государственная символика, чей-то портрет, мутные стекла, ориентировки, фотороботы, а также многочисленные папки и коробки, загромождавшие все свободное пространство под столом и в углах, казались девушке неподходящими декорациями ничем не лучше памятного сортира. Но и Стэн достоин лишь удара осколком стекла в темном пыльном офисе. Впервые за долгое время она смогла взглянуть в его глаза, – глаза убийцы Леона и братика – на этот раз не пронзительно прозрачные, а темные из-за полумрака, царившего в кабинете. Выражение его лица, секунду назад омраченное тенью раздражения, неуловимо быстро сменилось на пугающее любопытство, в глубине глаз словно проскочили искры. Почти забытый страх предательски кольнул девушку в сердце, хотя их взгляды встретились лишь в первое мгновение. Матильда не смела пошевелиться, не то что поднять руку на мерзавца. Однако ее ладонь лишь сильнее сжалась на рукояти ножа в рукаве. Стэнсфилд задумчиво и немного удивленно посмотрел куда-то вниз и в сторону. – Тут такое дело… – Его тихий голос чуть дрожал, но Матильда знала точно, что желанное для нее чувство страха здесь ни при чем. Придыхание, с которым он начал свою речь, было ей знакомо. – Очень многие люди приходятся кому-то братьями и друзьями. – Он прикусил губу и нахмурился, изображая мучительную попытку что-то вспомнить, а затем с самым невинным видом посмотрел ей прямо в лицо: – Сделай милость, просвети меня, чем я заслужил вот это. И он кивнул на ее чуть отведенную назад руку, тайком сжимающую орудие убийства. Матильда почувствовала себя так, будто стоит в школе у доски и безнадежно «плавает» во время ответа. Только на этот раз ценой ошибки может стать исход операции или даже ее собственная жизнь. Пользуясь ее замешательством от блестящего разоблачения, Стэн отступил за угол массивного стола, то отводя взгляд в сторону в притворной застенчивости, то насмешливо рассматривая неожиданную посетительницу. Время и место встречи работали на него. Интересно, он узнал ее, раз продолжил разговор? Или не узнал, но мстительницы и покушения для него в порядке вещей? Паниковать было рано: хоть Стэн раскусил ее замысел, она только выигрывала от его уверенности, что ее удалось с легкостью перехитрить, как тогда, семь лет назад. Как ни странно, Матильда поймала себя на мысли, что ее сердце бешено колотится вовсе не от растущего риска, а от близости к долгожданной цели. – Из-за тебя погиб мой брат. Ему было всего четыре года, – сами собой тихо, словно осенние листья, срывались слова. – Мой друг не вернулся после облавы, которую ты устроил… Стэн прикрыл лицо ладонями. – Как же я мог! – прошептал он патетически, но почти сразу опустил руки на стол и заговорил сбивчиво, горячо и нетерпеливо: – Да, облаву я помню, и даже слишком хорошо помню. А, представь себе, хотелось бы забыть… Кстати, ты не против, что мы сразу на «ты», без всяких там «мисс» и «мистер»?.. Не против?.. Хорошо… Так вот, облава! Это я такой плохой, что ее устроил. Да! Там все тоже началось с этого самого мальчика, которого я в глаза не видел. А был ли мальчик, а? В этот кабинет ворвался какой-то итальяшка и на этом самом месте убил двух моих людей. И меня бы отправил в морг! Но в тот день смерть распорядилась иначе… Стэн резко успокоился, и некоторое время он стоял, покачиваясь, закрыв глаза и молитвенно сложив ладони. Матильда успела отсчитать несколько ударов сердца, прежде чем он собрался что-то сказать. Удары эти были сильными, захватывающими дух… Впервые кто-то заговорил с ней о Леоне – пусть и зло, с обидой. Но по своей инициативе, с энергией и страстью! Тем временем Стэн потряс рукой в указующем жесте в сторону ее оружия, с которым Матильда и не думала расставаться без прямого распоряжения. – Предлагаю обмен, – деловым тоном заявил он. – Положи эту страшную штуку на стол и подтолкни сюда, и я покажу кое-что. – Если я останусь безоружной, то какие будут гарантии? – осмелилась спросить Матильда, все же извлекая распознанный «клинок» и уже прикидывая, как сподручней выхватить второй, когда Стэн подойдет поближе. – Никаких, кроме того, что нам могут помешать, – очаровательно улыбнулся подонок. – Но тебе понравится. Сами слова звучали двусмысленно, и Матильда представила удовольствие, с которым она оборвет его никчемную жизнь, рискни он еще и руки распускать. Но то, как эти слова были сказаны, обещало нечто совсем иное – так предлагают, например, посмотреть на светлячков в банке. Стеклянный нож скользнул по столу и остановился недалеко от ладони ее врага. Бегло, однако осторожно рассмотрев его со всех сторон, Стэн щелкнул языком и покачал головой, изображая изумление. Посчитал ли он эту самодеятельность достойной уважения или счел несусветной глупостью, сказать было трудно, но что подыхать с этой штукой внутри ему не улыбалось – факт. Брезгливо поморщившись, он отправил нож в дальний захламленный угол. После этого настроение его неожиданно улучшилось. Он посмотрел в глаза Матильде, и взгляд этот выражал пронзительное узнавание. В мгновение ока Стэн преобразился. Лицо его просияло от ласковой улыбки, руки широко раскинулись, словно для дружеских объятий. – Здравствуй, ангел мой. Матильда, не так ли? А ты думала, я тебя забыл? Нигде и никогда прежде ее не встречали с такой бурной радостью. Учителя были холодны и отстраненны, одним словом, профессиональны. От полузабытых родственников она не видела ничего, кроме побоев и издевательств. Лишь семь лет назад прямо в этой комнате она бросилась в приливе чувств на шею Леону, своему единственному и неизменному спасителю и лучшему другу. Но то было другое. Стэнсфилд же был душевно болен, и все у него было иначе, чем должно быть у людей. Голос Стэна был исполнен такой нежности, так легко для своей хромоты он оказался рядом с ней, так трепетно потянулся было обожженной некогда ладонью к ее щеке, что Матильда поняла – ей не выйти отсюда живой. Стэн, должно быть, заметил в ней перемену: он несколько смешался, отвел взгляд в сторону и с досадой убрал руку от ее лица прежде, чем коснулся – видимо, списал скованность девушки на испуг, вызванный следами давних ожогов. А может, хотел поскорее приступить к делу – для начала извлечь оружие из наплечной кобуры, например. Некоторое время он сосредоточенно копался во внутреннем кармане пиджака. Предчувствуя занятную игру с жертвой, которая снова вообразила себя охотником, он искал коробочку с волшебными таблетками, не иначе – револьвер бы он уже достал. Но ничего, ждать осталось недолго. И Матильда терпеливо, однако заранее мысленно содрогаясь, ждала момента, когда он примет наркотик. Чего ради он готов терпеть нечто, доводящее его до судорог и зубовного скрежета? Что он видит там, в глубине своего нездорового разума? Матильда настроилась именно из этого мимолетного мучительного рая отправить его прямиком в ад. Сейчас он неспешно достанет коробочку, потрясет у самого уха, прислушиваясь, достанет одну желто-зеленую капсулу, зажмет в зубах и отвернется от невольной свидетельницы его конвульсий. И тогда она ударит его ножом по горлу. – Дай руку, – прервал Стэн поток мыслей. В ответ на недоуменный взгляд ошарашенной девушки он широко улыбнулся, но тут же посмотрел на мгновение в сторону и зло оскалился. – Это совсем не страшно – со мной уже было, но я живой, как видишь. Он взял ее миниатюрную ладонь и вложил что-то в кулачок. Прикосновение как прикосновение, почему-то не возникло желания выдернуть руку и вытереть обо что-нибудь. Разжав пальцы, Матильда обнаружила кольцо. От гранаты. «Номер с кольцом». Она вздрогнула, ожидая всего, что угодно. Но взрыва не произошло. – Узнаешь? – мягко поинтересовался довольный Стэн, но вопрос был, скорее, риторический. Дальнейший его тон выразил наигранное разочарование. – А ведь его передал мне твой дружок! Так и сказал: «Это тебе от Матильды». Это было излишне щедро, дорогая – я же ничего не успел тебе подарить. – Взгляд в глаза, оскал. – Так считай это запоздалым сюрпризом. Кольцо с чекой, потемневшее и будто помятое, исцарапанное – последнее, что держал в руках Леон. Стэн почему-то хранил его, небось носил в одном кармане с мелочью на связке ключей. Кольцо от гранаты, которая должна была разорвать этого ублюдка, стоящего сейчас перед ней, на куски. Немой свидетель того, о чем она жаждала узнать всю свою новую жизнь. Но никто не мог ей рассказать. Лишь грязное кольцо, у которого больше общего со Стэном, чем с Леоном, покоилось сейчас на середине ее ладони. Стэн подошел совсем близко. Он отлично выбрал позицию, чтобы продолжить разговор – небольшая дистанция и хлам вокруг не оставляли Матильде пространства для маневра: либо враг мог на корню пресечь ее поползновения, либо удар получился бы слабым или недостаточно точным. Уж цепочка ли рассуждений или шестое чувство подсказало ему, как заблокировать ее – непонятно. Вариант с истеканием кровью до смерти от филигранно нанесенной раны, кроме удара по шее, она отмела с самого начала – не факт, что получится, тем более, мерзавец мог позвать на помощь, или кто-то мог случайно зайти. – Ты, я смотрю, не теряла зря времени. – Он окинул Матильду взглядом. – С тех пор ты старалась быть в школе, верно? – Лицо его выразило переигранное сострадание. – Тоска смертная, согласен с тобой. Но дети должны быть в школе, милая. А потом они должны быть в университете… Ты ведь закончила университет, да? – Колледж, – тихо поправила его Матильда. Когда же выдастся подходящий момент? Надоело уже играть в смиренное ожидание участи. – Колледж, – задумчиво повторил Стэн. – И вот ты работаешь! – засмеялся он. – Ты должна быть на работе, почему ты занимаешься личным делом? Ну и как тебе? Удиви меня. Не сидишь еще на кофеине? Или на чем поинтереснее? – Личное дело и есть моя работа, – спокойно ответила девушка. Стэн изобразил, будто поперхнулся, услышав неожиданный ответ. – Так это… все… ради меня? – растроганно спросил он. – Ты совсем не ценишь жизнь, как печально. Быть может, ты не знаешь, что такое смерть, лапочка? – Очень хорошо знаю. И тебе это известно, – парировала Матильда. – Не думаю, – зло усмехнулся Стэн, вглядываясь в ее лицо. – Позволь тебе рассказать. Смерть – это когда твой взгляд проходит вровень с загаженным полом. Можно было бы порадоваться, что ты почти ничего не видишь… Если бы не перспектива, что ты не сможешь видеть уже никогда. Но это не самая большая твоя проблема, потому что боль не дает тебе думать о таких пустяках. Все тело становится болью. Ты не знаешь, где у тебя что! Сломанные кости, лопнувшие ребра, вывернутые суставы – все это в сплошной боли из кожи. Ты все это чувствуешь, но не можешь пошевелиться – вот такая несправедливость, ангел. Ты еще помнишь, что в кармане у тебя было лекарство от всего. Но у тебя нет уверенности, что еще есть карман и рука на месте. Зачем жить, если нечем сыграть? Сыграть, понимаешь? Ты на грани и знаешь, что если потеряешь сознание окончательно, то уже не вернешься. И ты хочешь покончить с этим, но не можешь. В какой-то момент ты хочешь знать, стоит ли бороться, и ты пытаешься говорить с людьми, которые собирают тебя из багровой лужи с пола. И тут, Матильда, ты понимаешь самое страшное… Кружилась голова. Стэн словно приглашал испытать все это на собственной шкуре, и он достиг в этом определенного успеха. И, слушая его, Матильда не заметила, как последние слова он шепнул ей уже в самое ухо, прижавшись своей колкой щекой. Она ждала продолжения этой страшной исповеди, но Стэн умолк, уткнувшись носом в ее волосы. Словно хотел подпитать свою пустую душу и разваливающееся тело ее жизненной силой и молодостью. Именно это делало странные объятия неприятными – непонятно, на что он рассчитывал после всего. – …И ты понимаешь, что такое жизнь? – подсказала шепотом Матильда, осознавая, что она совсем запуталась и не взялась бы судить, что здесь вообще происходит и чем закончится. Стэн смущенно отстранился, поправил на ней жакет, мол, не понял, что на него нашло. – Ты понимаешь, что больше никогда не услышишь музыку. И ты не можешь им объяснить, что лучше дать тебе умереть… Он с вызовом посмотрел на Матильду и подкрепил выражение глаз широкой улыбкой, мол, «расскажи мне, что такое смерть, ангел». Отвратительно запищал телефон на столе, разрушая атмосферу жутковатой мистерии. «Что еще? Не видишь, я занят?» – Я занят, Бэнни… Вы его взяли?.. Что ты сказал?! Он сам подумал и вышел?.. Бэнни, да ты стратег!.. – Стэн снова был начальником отдела и на этот раз с чувством превосходства хвалил подчиненного, точно ребенка. Было трудно поверить, что минуту назад этот человек живописал свой посмертный опыт. – Он согласен сотрудничать?.. Тогда ты знаешь, что делать! «Сотрудничать». Люди Стэна наверняка понимали под такими расхожими словами что-то свое. Положив трубку, веселый Стэн показал Матильде стеклянный нож. Второй. Видимо, он извлек его из ее кармана, пока она слушала его историю. – …А потом, – продолжил он, понизив голос и рассматривая смертоносные сколы, – ты месяцами лежишь на койке, и морфия в тебе больше, чем воды. Потому что боль вернется, стоит о ней забыть. И ты боишься того, каким же ты себя обнаружишь, когда встанешь. – Он гневно нахмурился и продемонстрировал ряд нижних зубов. – Я четыре месяца провел в больнице, полгода не мог жить по-человечески, три года лечился. Я ненавидел твоего приятеля-итальяшку и до сих пор ненавижу, по правде говоря. – Нежнейшая улыбка, не предвещающая ничего хорошего. – Но он умер, ангел, а ты живешь! И это, заметь, благодаря ему. – Тебе легко говорить – ты всегда жил полной жизнью в обществе людей. А он только в последний момент понял прелесть жизни, – не выдержала Матильда. Стэн пристально на нее посмотрел. Девушка поняла, что сказала лишнее. – Матильда, – он облизнул губы, – рад, что я настолько хорош, что ты так считаешь. Он глянул на часы и вздохнул. – У нас будет много времени, ангел, – шепнул Стэн мечтательно. – Но сейчас нужно расходиться по своим углам, потому что люди должны быть на работе. Трудно подобрать момент для чего-то личного, согласись. Может не получиться совсем или не принести удовольствия… А то и выйти потом боком! И он искренне, от души засмеялся. Матильда была подавлена, растеряна, мрачна. Она планировала что угодно, только не это. Она представляла, что к этому времени Стэн уже нехотя, мучительно попрощается с жизнью, а ее, возможно, возьмут под стражу. Но смерть капризна сегодня. Здание Управления по адресу Федерал Плаза, двадцать шесть, комната сорок шесть ноль два, пять минут одиннадцатого, они оба – она и Стэнсфилд – живы. Матильда до боли сжала кольцо от гранаты – подарок ей от Стэна, а Стэну – от нее. Последний привет ей от Леона. Не глядя на своего заклятого врага, она пообещала: – Когда ты обретешь вкус к жизни и познаешь счастье, вот тогда я тебя убью. – Когда будет подходящий момент – к твоим услугам.

It's been years since she and he talked saw or even looked at each other. And remembers how he risked his life to protect her and how it felt kissing him. She still is acting and singing but wishes she never let Frank go? Frank is now protecting the United States president from an unknown stalker and is continuing his career. Will he ever put aside his career for Rachel or will he continue his work and try to forget his true feelings about her? Another day passes thru at the mansion, Rachel puts her C.D player on and listens to her most up to date songs while is trying to write a letter to Frank. Her letter said s \"Frank i was wondering how you are doing? We haven't talked or saw each other in a long time and I was wondering if we could some day. I know we said we wanted a professional relationship but I cannot live like this any longer. I remember the old days when I would receive death threats and I knew I wouldn't have to worry cause you were there to protect me and be there if something did happen. I sit here all day wishing I had you in my arms and that I could see you again without having to dream about it. I miss you and I am still in love with you. I hope we can meet up again soon. Much Love, Rachel. Rachel goes down to the kitchen where Bill Devaney is and asks him to put this in the mailbox to get sent. He said s sure I will when I go down town in a minute to pick up Fletcher at work. And then asks her if she's ok? She said s not really had thought of Frank and how I miss having him around. Bill said s you do know he's away on the job protecting someone? She said s I know but I felt a lot safer when he was around. Bill told her only time will tell if he loves you he will come back? If he doesn't he will continue his work and career.[Chapter 2] Sy saids well i still think if you sing this song it will be one of your biggest hits. Rachel saids well it might be but i still dont know sy. Sy asks should i call bill and ask him about his opinion. Rachel saids no i will sing it only because it might bring Frank back in my life. Sy saids ok well if you read the lyrics and then we will start. She saids i dont need the lyrics lets go. They start the recording and when she gets to the \"And i will always love you, Sy realizes that it was for real now after its all over with and tears shes cryed everybody cheers for her. Sy saids i am sure now it will be a big hit. Bill calls Sys phone and asks can i talk to Rachel. Bill saids i talked to Frank he got the letter. Rachel saids what did he say? Bill saids nothing to me but said he would write to you soon. Rachel saids ok thanks and asked if he metioned her? Bill said no but he did mention a new job he might take but wasn't sure. Rachel saids ok thanks and saids we will be home soon. Bill saids ok and latter that day Sy and Rachel come home and grab diner. Then night comes and Rachel goes into her room and pray \"Please can i have him back as mine i still love him\". Meanwhile Frank looks at the letter and thinks of how to write his answer. Yes i still love her but i thought we agreed it wouldnt work out. Then starts to write the response. \"Rachel I was hoping someday we could talk again but i dont know about seeing since i am on duty and me flying to squrriel hill wouldnt work. i know you still love me but i thought we agreed that the relationship wouldnt work out. i still love you but i dont think our paths will collide, only time will tell love Frank.[Chapter 3] Rachel everyday thinks about Frank and dreams about them but then Bill decides to tell Rachel about how he saw him and how they talked. Rachel asks did he change his mind. Bill saids no but I think in time he will. Then Rachel saids I will refuse to sing or act until I see him and talk to him. Rachel asks do you think he will come to the studio if you call him and ask him. Bill saids we can try. Bill calls both phones but no answer. Bill saids I'm sorry he's not answering I will try latter though. Then hours fly by and then Frank calls back. Bill tells him the situation and how Rachel is refusing until they see each other again. Frank saids I will try to come tomorrow morning if that's ok with her. Bill saids ok. Then tells Sy, Tony about the plans and how to distract Rachel. Rachel asks if anything Bill saids not yet but maybe latter. Then Rachel heads towards her room when Tony saids I think even though he may not come you should still sing and act you love doing it so show him what your worth. Rachel saids I know but its hard when they all expect so much from you. Tony saids I know hun. Then the next morning Bill Sy and Tony all get ready for Franks arrival. Tony tells Rachel we need to go up stairs and fix your hair. So they go upstairs when the phone rings its Frank saying he's on his way and is about 15mins away. 15mins gone by when he drives in and then sneaks into the living room where he stands when Rachel comes down and saids\"OMG is that really you Frank?[Chapter 4] Ch.4 The drive Rachel then tells Bill that they need to go to Frank's house. He asks why you just saw him. She saids I need to find out his true feelings and whether or not I am going to be his. Bill saids well idk what happens if he's not home and well doesn't want to talk about it. Rachel saids idc lets go. So Rachel and Bill tell everyone they will be back. While driving Bill tells Rachel that Frank doesn't know what he wants yet and if he did she would know. Rachel saids idc anymore I want to know and I have a reason to. Five hours later after a long drive they arrive at Frank's house it's beautiful with wood painted walls and wooden floors. Then Rachel knocks on the door. Frank answers and then Rachel asks have you chosen yet? Frank doesn't answer but does say hello to Bill and invites them in. Rachel doesn't speak until Bill gives her the eye and then asks Frank so I was wondering if we could sometime go on a date and spend some time with eachother if that was ok. Frank saids maybe when come back to squirrel hill. Rachel doesn't answer but then Bill saids I will go outside and give you two time to talk. Rachel then saids I don't have nothing to talk about anymore. Frank saids look Rachel I am sorry for everything I have done lately but I am confused with my life I need to think what's best for us and right now I cant see just us I see you as a celebrity and me as a old bodyguard I need to know you are behind me and need me as much as I need you. Rachel tells him that she feels the same way but it hurts to try when all you see is pain in your eyes I am sorry that you feel as that I am a celebrity and that I get a lot of attention. Franks tells her that right now our paths don't cross I am sorry you drove here for nothing but that's how I feel and want. And I will write another letter soon and then i will make the decision of my life and what I want. Then Rachel tells Bill I am ready to go home ive had my heart broken again so then they drive home again. When they arrive home, Tony and Sy greet them and ask if it went alright. Rachel saids no I am going to my room and going to get ready for bed while up in her room she writes frank a letter. \"Dear Frank I know that you are scared about us but please I am begging you I need you and want you and I want us. Im ready decided I am going to retire so I can live with you and that I am ready to be yours and I was wondering if maybe when you are ready to go out on a date and a movie again just please think about it I love you always Rachel.[Chapter 5] Rachel puts the letter in an envelope and then Rachel tells Bill to send this letter out as soon as possible which then Frank starts to write her a letter. He said's dear Rachel I know its hard to let feelings go but without having to quit both of our jobs I can't see us I know we still have hard feelings for each other but I don't want to crush our dreams for each other. I still love you very much and always will but I guess only time will tell for us. I would love for it to be the old times but I need to know will you risk your life for me and our future? Or will you run away? Love Frank. He looks at her scarf she left at his house and thinks about them. Meanwhile the next day arrives and Rachel heads down stairs to see Tony, Sy and Bill. Bill said's I will be back in a few after I take this letter to the mailbox. Then Sy said's we will leave for rehearsal in a hour so Rachel please be ready. Meanwhile Frank puts his letter in the mailbox and then sighs and said's I hope she will understand. Then Rachel Sy and Tony head towards rehearsal. Then while at rehearsal and starts to sing a new song for the album called where do broken hearts go. Sy then said's this I think will be a number 1 song. Then said's I am sorry we had made you sing it but it will be good for the Oscars and they will love it. At rehearsal the press hit Rachel with a lot of questions regarding if retiring will be true next year and when the next album will be produces? Tony tells them she will tell you latter and goodbye. Then Sy reminds her about the interview with Clive Healy and to be ready for it. While in the interview she thinks about Frank and how he saved her at the Oscars. Then they head home and she receives a letter from Frank and starts to read it.[Chapter 6] Rachel reads the letter and then starts to cry. Bill Sy and Tony all ask who was it from and what it says. Rachel saids Frank and his feelings. They all say they are sorry. Meanwhile Frank sits down and has a drink and watches TV and thinks. And then Rachel comes on TV with Clive Healy's interview and he saids I am stupid I hurted her and now I don't know what to do I only know when her concert comes to see her and tell her my true feelings. And then decides to call Bill and tell him to not to tell Rachel he was coming to the concert it was going to be a surprise. Bill saids ok and what time? Frank saids around 11. Bill saids ok and wear something nice. Frank saids ok I will. Then Rachel asks Bill who we was talking to? Bill saids a friend and asks so tomorrow are you ready for the concert? And then asks are you ready for the last song on your album you are singing today? She saids yes and I am excited also. He saids good. Sy comes out and saids Rachel you ready for today lets go get that last song. She saids yes let's go. So they head to the studio where she performs a song called I'm Every Women and then they leave knowing the album is done. They head home and await tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and by 9:00 Frank starts to leave and head towards the place the concert is. Meanwhile Rachel, Sy, Bill and Tony get ready and go down the road they get to the place where the concert is and Bill see's Franks car and tells Tony to go to the back. They head to the back and Rachel goes to her room to get ready. Frank who awaits Bill saids so where is she? She is in her room getting ready saids Bill. Frank saids ok I will see you down in the audience in a minute. Bill saids ok and not to upset her. Frank saids ok I won't. So Frank knocks on her door and she opens and screams \"FRANK what in the world are you doing here? He saids came to see you and talk to you. She saids I read your letter I understand. He saids don't I didn't mean it its been hard to let you go and I cant seem to do it anymore so what I am asking do you still want to be a thing, I am retired and I need you I can be ok with you being a celebrity but I need to know can I run to you? She saids don't worry im retiring at the end of the year. He saids oh ok well I will let you get ready and be safe he laughed. She said ok I will before you go can I have one kiss. He saids sure and then they kiss.[Chapter 7] They sleep the night away when Frank realizes it is quarter after 6 and jumps out of bed waking Rachel. Rachel saids Frank what are you doing where you going? He saids I am sorry babe I need to get going back home I have a conference in a bit for my retirement. Rachel saids oh ok are you going to come back before the Oscars? He saids probably not but I promise you I will be at the Oscars. She saids ok well before you go here's the emerald cross you gave me years ago I would like you to have it back. He saids no I gave this to you it is yours and anyways babe I still have your scarf. She laughs and saids ok well let's get this over with give me a kiss. He saids goodbye Rachel again and she starts to cry. He saids don't worry next time will be forever I promise I will be back. She stops crying and heads downstairs with him. He saids goodbye to everyone and then to Rachel one last time then goes toward his car. She runs out to the driveway where he is parked and saids I can't do this anymore I need to know if you are staying with me or leaving me. He saids ok listen I really want you I do but I need to know one thing is it true you are retiring for me? She saids yes and no I am getting to old to sing and act anymore my poor body won't let me anymore and well I need you and want you and I don't want to lose you but I keep doing it anyway and I don't know why you can't leave your dads house. He saids because I still haven't forgiven myself for letting Nikki die. There's a piece of silence and then Rachel saids it wasn't your fault. He saids it kind of was and well I should have known he would get her on the first floor. Rachel tells him I know you tried to protect the both of us but couldn't I understand now. Frank saids well I don't. There's another silence before Rachel saids I love you and I want you now can we both live happy lives and quit the bickering 24/7. He saids I know and I want that to but can we wait for the retirement to be over with and then I can come to Squirrel hill and live with you. She saids I guess I am sick of waiting Frank chose me or your fathers house? He saids Rachel don't do this I am sick of you trying to control me. She saids I know but I want you. He saids well fine I will live here I will put the house for sale and leave. She saids that's not what I meant. Frank saids well Rachel what did you mean? I meant that you need to be happy to Rachel saids. Frank saids well I have no choice but to put the house for sale and live with you. Rachel saids really Frank. He saids yeah but it will take a month or two so you got to live with it[Chapter 8] Then Rachel saids well what about the Oscars? He saids babe I will be there don't worry. Then again there's silence then Rachel saids Frank I need to tells you something and I should have told you or Bill a while ago. He saids ok then tell me. She tells him in the past she still is receiving death threats and well one guy mailed her a letter threatening to kill Fletcher and her if she did not sign his autograph. Frank saids why could you keep this from me bill or tony? She saids idk but it needs to stop and I want your protection again. He saids well I can do that but it will cost you something. And she asks what? Then he reminds her, the passionate love they made and reminded her again and again till she screamed \"Frank. After that they both realized what love was and how it worked. Then after an hour or more of passionate love they both were hungry so they grabbed some clothes on and headed down to seen Rodney the cook. Rachel tells Rodney that they both would like some diner and then Frank who see's Bill decides to tell Bill what was actually going on with Rachel. Bill saids the first thing we need to do is make sure she is in the best protection as possible and that's where you will come in and you will make sure at the Oscars nothing will happen like it did last time\". Frank saids I will try but no guarantees. Sy steps in and saids well I think Bill has a great plan but I also think that she doesn't need to worry about her life at risk once again at the Oscars this time. Bill saids yes I agree but she still needs to be aware that Frank is doing his job. Sy then agrees and looks at Rachel. He asks her Honey are you ready for your big night\" She saids of course I am ready for tonight nothing bad is going to happen unless a lose another fucking award. Sy stares at her and reminds her that they are leaving in a few hours for it so be ready. She is and wares a beautiful blue silky dress with bedazzles on it. All the men say \"WOOWEE\" and they all head into the limo and head to the Oscars. They get there and the crowd goes wild and wild for Rachel. Then Tony finds them a spot to park for a minute and they all get out and head into the Oscars when the press start talking to Rachel and a blond blue eyed \"6 \"7 guy is staring at her. He approaches her and asks her ?'s but she refuses to answer him and heads into the Oscars and gets checked in by security. Then they are all set and they get seated and await the award ceremony. By 8pm the blond guy approaches her again and that's when Frank gets involves and saids to back off leave her alone. He saids no I am not going to leave her alone until she answers my ?'s. Frank escorts him away and without knowing he was armed the blond fellow shoots at Rachel and Frank leans over her body to save her again. He gets shot thru the left shoulder and 2inches from the heart. The crowd is screaming and scared and police are trying to escort them out of the building. Then has enough strength left to kill him and tells Rachel you stay here get that award and make me proud. She saids no I am not leaving you and yells \"We need help over here he is bleeding terribly. Then an ambulance full of nurses comes to get frank and take him to the hospital. Meanwhile Rachel, Bill, Sy and Tony follow the ambulance and then Rachel prays and saids please be with him and keep him safe I can't live without him. They reach to the hospital they get the room number and there Frank lies under surgery through the window again. Rachel paces thru the hospital until Bill calms her nerves.[Chapter 9] After hours later and Rachel pacing, Frank wakes up and looks at Rachel and saids \"What happened\"? She saids you saved my life that's all. He asks how did I mange that? She saids well a guy pulled a gun on me and tried to shoot me but you jumped in front of the bullet and stopped it before it hit me. He saids I am really sore and drowsy. Rachel saids well I wonder why dear you jumped in front of the bullet for me. He saids Rachel don't make me laugh I am to sore. Rachel then saids well they did drug you up and did surgery for hours to get the bullet out of you. Then the doctor comes in and saids you were lucky that the bullet did not make it to the heart. Then saids I know you did it for a reason but you had almost died. Frank saids I understand and thank you. Then the doctor saids you will need to have plenty of rest and need to have someone who would be willing to keep you company in your needs of rest. Frank saids \"doc I already have someone who would be willing to do that. So with that said Rachel agreed to take care of Frank and agreed to be his personal nurse. Frank stayed at the hospital for a couple of days for observation but came home in time to see Fletcher head to work. Frank saids to Fletcher don't work too hard. He saids try not to. Frank laughs and then Rachel asks him do you want anything or need anything? He saids no but if I do I still have the bell in my room. Rachel laughs and saids Baby I will come up to read you a story so you can rest your eyes. Frank saids Babe you don't need to I will be ok I promise. Rachel saids I still am coming up to keep an eye on you. Frank saids ok you win. And then Rachel and he head towards his room and then she starts to read him a story when Bill interrupts and saids \"Rachel Fletchers on the phone. Rachel saids ok and saids can you keep an ear for Frank\"? He saids yes and then Rachel saids \"Hello\". Fletcher saids \"Mom I don't feel well\". She asks what's wrong he saids I think my appendix is about to burst. She saids ok well can you drive or should I have Tony come get you from work? He saids I'd rather have Tony come get me. She saids ok I will tell him you stay in there you here. He saids I will mom just tell Tony to hurry. She gets off the phone and tells Bill to tell Tony to get Fletcher at work. He saids why? She saids because he needs to go to the hospital and get his appendix checked out. Bill saids ok and tells Tony. Tony runs out of the house and then jumps into the car and goes and gets Fletcher and takes him to the hospital. The doctor tells Tony that he will have surgery and will have the appendix removed. Tony calls Bill and tells him and then Bill tells Rachel. Rachel saids that's good he's in the best possible care and tells Bill to tell Tony to tell Fletcher she would be there as soon as possible. Frank hears the news and tells Rachel to go to the hospital and see him. Rachel saids no you need me more than he does now. Frank saids no he needs you go for me please. She couldn't leave Frank and then Bill saids if something changes with Frank I will call you. Frank nods and then Rachel heads into her car and drives to the hospital and there lays Fletcher in those wires of i.v and blood pressure wires. Then he awakes and saids mom what are you doing here I thought you were home with Frank. She saids you need me more than he does now, he's in good hands with Bill. Fletcher saids mom I'm ok Tony is hear if I need something you go home to Frank, he saved your life again. She saids I know but I wanted to make sure you were ok. He saids I'm fine go home to him I will be home in a few days or maybe a week. Tony nods and saids they said probably a few days bud. Rachel saids if I go home I will think about you all day just like I am with Frank. Fletcher tells her mom I'm ok please go home. Finally Rachel goes out of the hospital and back in her car and heads home to Frank. She gets home and Frank asks how he is? She saids fine but he insisted me to come home to you. Frank laughs and saids typical boy. She saids yeah but I am worried about him and you. Frank saids don't he will be fine and so will I. She saids are you sure. He saids Babe yes now will you please relax. She hugged him and was relaxed for a few and then fell asleep on his chest. Days latter him and Fletcher were better and then he proposed to her and she said yes. Then they planned the wedding for July but then Rachel found out one thing she was pregnant. She told Frank, Bill, Fletcher, Tony and then Sy who became family. They were all happy and thrilled and that's how they lived for about a year until Karen Elizabeth Farmer was born on February 1, 2013. She was a beautiful 8lb baby and with black hair like her mothers and that's how it ened for Rachel and Frank The End ","Summary":" Rachel sits in her room looking at her awards and looking at the stained blood dress hanging in her"},{"Movie":"King's Speech","Title":"Proper Elocution","Author":"cruisedirector","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7616855","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Endearments [] David is as careless with personal correspondence as he is with state papers. Bertie blushes when his gaze falls on the letters spread out for all to see. \"My sweetheart,\" they begin. Edward VIII calls himself a boy; he calls Mrs Simpson and himself WE. He invents endearments. He signs the letters \"more & more & more,\" sometimes following \"I love you,\" sometimes leaving it understood. The notes sound pathetic for a man, let alone a king. Yet when Bertie thinks of the restrained letters he has exchanged with Elizabeth, even after their wedding, he can't help envying his brother. [] \"It isn't just fear of stammering,\" he tries to explain to Logue, later, having escaped from David's noisy weekend party. \"Even when I write, I find that there are things I can't express.\" \"Do you mean politics or social conventions?\" Always Lionel assumes that official duties are Bertie's only concern, unless Bertie tells him otherwise. \"I mean affection.\" The word comes out sounding cross. Anger is one feeling that Bertie has never had trouble expressing. \"Can't say those words.\" Logue's eyebrows shoot up. \"Such as?\" \"'Sweetheart,'\" Bertie tries to say. He doesn't stammer, but the word sticks on his tongue. [] \"Say them to your daughters,\" Lionel had suggested, but now that Bertie is conscious of trying, he can't force the words to come. His own mother never called him darling . Now that Lilibet is older, she resists her nickname, wanting to be called after her mother and the famous queen. And Margaret talks so quickly that he can't slip in his adoration. \"Love,\" he calls Elizabeth one afternoon. She shoots him a look, reminding him that his equerry and secretary are just outside. Even among friends, she refers to him as \"The Duke.\" Bertie would prefer a bit less propriety. [] \"Pretend it's the F word.\" Lionel grins. \"Say it as though you aren't supposed to say it.\" \"Darling,\" Bertie spits at him. \"Dear one.\" \"Beaut,\" chuckles Lionel. \"B-beloved.\" Bertie can't muster the anger to say it to Lionel like a profanity. He thinks Sweetheart , but, because Lionel keeps grinning, says \"Bugger!\" instead. Lionel only smiles more. \"Very good, love,\" he says, as easily as if he were speaking to a sweetheart. Perhaps it's not just for encouragement. Bertie wonders, again, how it would feel to have the gift over and over, like a parent to a child. Like true love.[Chapter 2] Rewards [] He may be next in line to the throne of England, but Bertie is also a sad boy gazing at a model that Lionel won't let him finish until he sings. Until, not unless; Lionel doesn't doubt that Bertie is going to give in. Perhaps Lionel should be kinder. Bertie just lost his father. But it won't take long for him to sing. He can't wait to get his hands on the little plane, and Lionel wants him to, not just for Bertie's sake. Lionel has been waiting for such an opportunity to observe Bertie's fine motor skills up close. [] The grand old Duke of York, he had ten thousand men... As often happens when Lionel recalls Bertie's title, the nursery rhyme creeps into his thoughts. He must be careful lest he should start to hum it in the office. At home, he's less vigilant. \"Are you using that as an exercise with your pupils?\" asks Myrtle. \"'And when they were up, they were up, and when they were down, they were down.'\" She acts out the words, standing and sitting. \"Like you do with Jack and Jill.\" \"You're brilliant, sweetheart,\" he says, walking over to give her a kiss. [] \"Here's your shilling.\" Bertie sets it down as if he can't risk touching Lionel to put it in his hand. Lionel is too surprised at first to thank him, then doesn't want to interrupt Bertie's train of thought as Bertie accepts Lionel's apology and plunges ahead. Where did the shilling come from? Did Bertie think of it as he left the car, asking the driver if he had a bob? Or had the King asked someone at the Palace for some cash? Lionel is itching to touch it, to discover whether the coin is warm from being in Bertie's pocket. [] Bertie seats Lionel and his wife in the royal box at the coronation, giving Myrtle the thrill of her life as she dresses in finery surpassing even her wedding gown. Lionel feels self-conscious in silk stockings and is afraid of tripping over his ceremonial sword, but one glimpse of the medal on his chest makes even his toothache diminish. The night before the coronation, Lionel learned that he would be recognized in the Coronation Honours List for his services to the King, becoming a Member of the Victorian Order. All that Bertie seeks in return is Lionel's smile as he speaks. [] Lionel fears that, as King, Bertie will feel even more constrained by decorum. Yet once he has been crowned, Bertie seems more at ease with the notion that he can make the role his own, not trying to emulate his father or his brother. \"Keep everyone out,\" he laughs to his secretary. \"I shall be rolling on the floor doing my speech exercises.\" Once they are alone, Bertie orders Lionel to sing with him. When Lionel tells him to waltz, Bertie grabs him and swings him around the room. He rarely stammers now, but Lionel doesn't point it out. [] \"Mmmmmother.\" Bertie's eyes are closed, his face unusually relaxed. \"Mmmother. Mother.\" Then his jaw tightens fractionally. \"Ffffffffather. Ffffa-fa- Fuck. Ffffffffather.\" \"Deep breath,\" Lionel reminds him, touching his chest to remind him to inhale from the diaphragm. \"Where is it getting caught?\" \"Here.\" Grabbing his hand, Bertie brings it up, placing Lionel's fingers just below his jaw. Lionel's thumb brushes his throat, and Bertie's breath hitches. Unexpectedly, so does Lionel's. \"It gets tight right in there.\" Gently Lionel presses down with a finger, massaging the spot. \"There?\" he asks. Bertie doesn't speak. His eyes have closed again, chin nodding, lips curved. [] It is Bertie's moment, yet Lionel has never received such friendly praise and acceptance at court, even from friends of the king and hangers-on who have made their disapproval of his origins apparent. \"Thank you, again,\" says the Queen when she steps back inside. \"I've never seen him so pleased with himself.\" \"A marvelous job,\" Wood whispers while the BBC technicians pack away their equipment. \"Well done, old chap,\" mutters Grieg as he passes with Lascelles. The loveliest welcome comes from Princess Margaret, who introduces her new tutor to Lionel. \"This is Mr Logue. He is Papa's friend,\" she announces. [] Lionel witnesses the burdens firsthand. He sees how hard it is for Bertie to spend his days touring the shattered streets of London, talking to people who have lost family members, greeting returning soldiers who have given up limbs in defense of the nation. There are few, thinks Lionel, who would wish for the wealth and prestige of royalty if they understood the sacrifices that came with them. Bertie's greatest privilege, thinks Lionel, is the ability to demand absolute privacy. When he asks to be alone, his people know better than to meddle. No speech rehearsal will ever be interrupted. [] \"If I were someone else, would you do all this for me?\" asks Bertie, rubbing his tired eyes. \"Of course I would.\" Lionel waits for Bertie to look up before smiling. \"Most of my patients aren't royalty, you know.\" \"Most of your patients don't demand that you give up dinner with your family to work on speeches. Or make you drive across London during air raids. Or ruin your Christmas.\" \"You've never once ruined my Christmas,\" Lionel says firmly. \"Serving you is the greatest joy of my life.\" \"Because I'm the king,\" scowls Bertie. \"That's not true.\" And it isn't. [] Bertie is in no mood to rehearse the broadcast. \"I want to celebrate, like everyone else.\" \"But afterward there will be congratulations, and all that food.\" It's not easy for Lionel to cajole, though Lionel, too, has been invited to join the festivities. As happy as he is that the war has ended and his sons are safe, he feels sad. His work with the king may be coming to an end. Bertie studies him. \"You enjoy the practice more than the congratulations,\" he guesses. \"I owe you for all you've done, Logue. We'll just have to keep at it.\"[Chapter 3] Shillings [] \"Come and have a look at this,\" says Bertie. He's holding the designs for new coins bearing his likeness. \"Remember when you said that my face was next? Here it is.\" Lionel is impressed with how confident Bertie looks, not only in the official profile on the shilling, but standing here proudly in what Bertie had always suggested to Lionel that he thought of as his father's place, or his brother's. \"You look very regal,\" Lionel tells him, and is rewarded with a wide smile. From the doorway behind Bertie, where she stands watching, Elizabeth smiles at Lionel as well. [] \"It's going to be difficult this month,\" Myrtle tells Lionel, showing him the page with the numbers. The war has sent most of Lionel's patients far from London, yet he knows that he must stay, because of the king. Even with the boys gone, it isn't easy to buy what's needed. He looks at the projected expenses, saying, \"I need a few bob for a gift.\" \"What gift?\" \"A book.\" Lionel always gives Bertie a book for his birthday. He won't let the war prevent that. \"Of course,\" says Myrtle, lowering the amount of money allotted for paper and ink. [] Lionel never spends Bertie's shilling. During the worst weeks of the war, he carries it with him in his pocket, as if by protecting Bertie's coin, he can keep Bertie safe. Later still, when he hears on the radio that the king must have an operation, he sits by the heater, warming the shilling in his hand. He passes it on to a grandson who will treasure it as a reminder of his grandfather, yet never understand what it meant to Lionel. How could he? The face of George V is on this coin, not the king whom Lionel knew. [] The boy watches while his grandfather buys him a model airplane kit. He wonders why this cheerful event has made his grandfather sad. His grandfather pays without looking at the money, trusting the shopkeeper to count it for him. It's as if the old man can't bear to see the faces on the coins. When the shopkeeper hands over the change, it goes quickly into a pocket. A shilling slips out, drops to the floor, and rolls to the boy's feet. His grandfather sighs in relief when it lands face down. \"I don't like to give him away,\" he murmurs.[Chapter 4] Bereft [] Two days before Christmas, all seems right with the kingdom. Lionel goes to Windsor to go over the wording of the holiday broadcast, the most optimistic of Bertie's reign. \"Let us hope that before next Christmas Day, the story of liberation and triumph will be complete,\" Bertie will tell his people. Lionel changes \"calamities\" to \"disasters,\" since it would be calamitous indeed to hear the King stumble over the hard C. Then, as they sit by the fire, Bertie shatters the peace with one sentence: \"Logue, I think the time has come when I can do a broadcast by myself.\" [] Bertie doesn't mean to shock. His recent speeches have gone over exceptionally well. And Bertie feels guilty that Lionel is never home with his family for Christmas dinner, though Lionel's sons are grown, though even Myrtle knows that Lionel would just as soon be with the King. The Queen suspects as well. She has already declared her belief that she and their daughters should sit beside the King while he speaks. If his voice is strong and confident, his subjects will credit it to the nearness of his family, not to guidance by a teacher whom Bertie has finally outgrown. [] To Queen Elizabeth, Lionel is all smiles. \"I feel like a father who is sending his boy to his first public school,\" he says, chuckling as she pats him on the arm. To his guests, Lionel appears so busy with preparations for Christmas dinner that he nearly forgets the speech. Minutes before it begins, he disappears into the bedroom to listen, then comes back, beaming, to their congratulations. To his wife, Lionel tries to make light of his feelings. He even allows their guests to hear him afterward speaking on the telephone, joking to the King, \"My job is over.\" [] Lionel will try to remember it as a happy Christmas, particularly the next year when he must face the holiday without Myrtle. The speech goes as well as Lionel or Bertie could have hoped. When, afterward, Bertie half-apologizes, telling Lionel that he wanted to get through just one on his own, it is with pride in his voice. Lionel expresses pride as well. He does not give voice to the pain that made him listen in privacy, neglecting his guests, feeling his age. Bertie has gone on alone before, on tour, at meetings, among royals. Yet Bertie has always returned. [] \"I wonder if you realize how grateful I am to you for having made it possible for me to carry out this vital part of my job,\" Bertie writes in the new year. \"I cannot thank you enough.\" Lionel claims that he only ever wanted Bertie to be able to speak without stumbling, replying, \"I would not be human if I were not overjoyed that you can now do these things without supervision.\" It's a lie, like what he told the Queen. Yet Lionel only confesses the truth to his diary: \"I felt like a father bereft of his son.\"[Chapter 5] Three Queens [] Elizabeth fidgets as Bertie introduces Lionel to Queen Mary. Being presented to Her Majesty is considered a great honor, and the Queen Mother gives Lionel a gracious greeting. But when Lionel asks whether she enjoyed the King's Christmas broadcast, she replies, \"My husband always gave very fine speeches.\" Bertie knows to school his features to indifference, though Lionel can't hide his surprise. \"She would never acknowledge that Bertie had trouble speaking,\" Elizabeth whispers to Lionel, \"Royal children must be perfect. Like Bertie's poor youngest brother.\" Elizabeth loves Lionel then for stepping closer to Bertie, like a wolf protecting a pup. [] \"She'd make a fine Queen,\" Elizabeth says once the door to the Logue home has closed. \"Do you think so?\" Apparently Bertie has been too focused on Lionel's reaction to have formed an opinion of Myrtle Logue. \"Did you see how quickly she pounced after he introduced you? 'Will Their Majesties be staying for dinner?' She hates being kept in the dark as much as I do.\" Elizabeth chuckles. \"We should invite them to the Palace for dinner.\" \"I'm sure she'd like that.\" With the two women there, Elizabeth thinks, Bertie and Lionel both might have reason to be frightened. [] \"I'm surprised His Majesty is so nervous,\" Lionel admits. \"A wedding is a happy occasion, and he'll only be speaking in front of family.\" \"The King has to say something nice about the Hun,\" jokes Elizabeth. Her feelings about Lieutenant Mountbatten are hardly a secret. \"To tell the truth, I think he's more worried about going to pieces when he has to give away his little girl.\" Elizabeth had been concerned about summoning Lionel while he was still in mourning for Myrtle, but Lionel seems happy to help with the celebration. Now, though, he looks teary. \"Deep breaths,\" he prescribes.[Chapter 6] Sturm und Drang [] Bertie would watch for Lionel out the window if he could. Instead, he can see only the stony sky, dark as iron, with clouds swirling like fits of temper about to erupt. Of course Lionel will come. Lionel has never missed a speech, not even when he's had to drive through air raids to reach the Palace. Sometimes Bertie thinks his nerves might be calmer if he didn't have to worry about Lionel risking his life to come to him. But Bertie walked away once. Tried to lock Lionel out of his home... his heart. He can't do it again. [] Reports come in waves, like guilt. The numbers horrify. Thousands have died, mostly on ships, serving their own Navy as Bertie did before he became a King. It is a time for mourning, not for relief so profound that it borders on exultation. Yet submerged beneath the sorrow, the King can see salvation for his people. Churchill sees it too. Now the Americans must join in the war. Now Roosevelt must keep his promises to Britain and her monarch. When the United States enters the fight, Bertie will not wish it undone. But did his own prayers bring it about? [] Elizabeth has been the Queen Mother for half her life, twice as long as she was married to the King. Bertie has faded to dull grey in her photographs. He'd known that he was gravely ill for months, yet the end came suddenly, too quickly for farewells. After Logue's wife died, though Logue was a man of science, he went to spiritualists and seances, trying to speak to Myrtle. When Bertie learned of it, he thought Lionel must have gone a bit mad. Still, Lionel followed Myrtle - and Bertie - to heaven fairly quickly. Would Bertie's own wife recognize him there?[Chapter 7] Soar [] \"Dad, whose airplane's this?\" \"Please don't touch it.\" \"Is it Valentine's? You wouldn't even let me get the Albatros, why does he get a Fokker?\" \"It's not Valentine's. It's a gift for a patient who's been working very hard. A bit of a joke to make him smile.\" \"Is it for that boy you let finish my Curtiss? The one whose dad wouldn't let him build models at home? You could bring him round to our house. We could work on them together.\" \"That's a very nice idea, Antony. I think he'd enjoy that. I only wish it were appropriate.\" [] God Save the King. For years it's been the phrase that Lionel has repeated silently to himself when he's needed a moment to compose himself, to control his temper, to stop and think. He's angry enough to catch his son smoking a cigarette. But when he tries to calm himself down before speaking, the inner recitation has the opposite effect. Suddenly he's shaking with fury. \"Dad?\" asks Laurie. \"Are you all right?\" \"Never again,\" Lionel says. He isn't speaking of the cigarette, already dropped, forgotten. It won't ever be so easy to forget Bertie, with cigarette in hand, striding away. [] It wouldn't rankle so much without all the reminders. The name mentioned every time one of Lionel's boys turns on the wireless. The hastily printed new portraits on the wall of every shop. The chatter of neighbors. The posters declaring \"Stand By the King.\" It's like being pricked by pins, always in different spots, a dozen times or more a day. Neighbors, pupils, Lionel's own family may mention the monarch. He can't guard against the sting without cutting himself off from everyone. Even fleeing back to Australia wouldn't make it stop. He'll have to bear his pain alone. Like Bertie. [] Cold, dismal rain. A last-minute cancellation. A scratched phonograph record. A leak in a window, a puddle on the floor. An empty milk bottle hides a hole in the tablecloth. The engine sputters like it needs work again. The boys are too busy, or too restless, for Shakespeare. They're small things, easy enough to overlook, yet they weigh on Lionel like punishments. The ring interrupts while he's with a patient. He nearly ignores it. He is not polite when answering. \"Yes? What is it?\" The name. The request. The schedule. The confirmation. And quicker than sunrise, all fixed, all forgotten. [] The final rehearsal has concluded. The next morning, Lionel will be the only common colonial seated in the royal box, while Bertie will be crowned King of England. \"Wear this tomorrow.\" Bertie opens a drawer in his desk. From it he takes a medal of the Royal Victorian Order. The Sunday Express editor had told Lionel that his name was on the Coronation Honors List, but Lionel hadn't believed it; most of the honorees are nobles. \"Thank you,\" he says humbly. The King smiles. \"Not at all. You have helped me. I am going to reward those who help me.\" [] Lionel bursts through the door in alarm. He hadn't thought he was late. Bertie sits cross-legged on the rug beside Lionel's youngest son, studying a book of airplane diagrams. Behind them, Lionel's middle son slumps in a chair with his homework in his lap, mocking them for using the wrong screw on a propeller. \"Dad,\" Antony greets him. \"Bertie says we should build a Sopwith Baby.\" \"Because you're a baby,\" Valentine grouses. \"Shut up,\" Bertie says, elbowing Valentine in the leg. He looks perfectly content. Valentine stalks out, muttering. \"Who does he think he is, the bloody King of England?\" [] When his family sits down to dinner, Lionel refuses to switch off the wireless. The BBC will eventually report on the King's trip to America. If Bertie has spoken in some public venue, Lionel might even get to hear his voice. Bertie had asked Lionel to come along, but Lionel had declined, citing Bertie's need for independence. His real reason was more complicated. He feared becoming too attached to following Bertie around. \"You're moping,\" chides Myrtle. \"He'll be back soon, and ring you up to tell you about it. Even the boys tease. \"He's not your sweetheart, is he, Dad?\" [] It's an old fear, probably foolish now, yet rainy afternoons trigger it nonetheless. Lionel can't forget the misery that struck him that awful day at precisely the same moment as the first drops fell on his coat, when he realized that Bertie had no intention of speaking to him again. Bertie has since apologized, of course, and welcomed Lionel warmly each time he's arrived at the Palace. But when the sky is so dark, Lionel can't escape the desolation of the memory... the cold face of Bertie's Equerry dismissing him, the finality of the steward shutting the door behind him. [] Bertie finds Lionel with three BBC technicians, rerouting the wires in the little room Lionel redecorated. They won't remove the equipment. Another speech, soon, will be inevitable. \"I'll finish,\" Lionel tells them, hiding a microphone behind a drape as they scuttle out of the King's path. The Prime Minister has gone to plan for war. The Queen has taken the girls upstairs. The King, too, has work to do, but waits to speak to Lionel alone. \"Thank you,\" he says, clasping Lionel's hand. Lionel smiles. \"You've already thanked me.\" \"Not properly.\" And before Lionel can disagree, Bertie kisses his cheek.

Bertie"},{"Movie":"Never Been Kissed","Title":"The first step towards a fairytale like love affair","Author":"MajjeL","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12426612","Passage":"[Chapter 1] As Josie and Sam are kissing each other for the first time, in the middle of a fully packed stadium. The euphoric crowd continues to cheer for Josie's first personal grand slam. She holds his hand in hers, as they are strolling towards the stadium seatings, before the pitcher is about to through the first ball. They meet many warm congratulatory smiles from the audience! Shyly, Josie lifts her head up and says \"I am glad that you are here with me, at last. What a surreal moment! I was never as happy as the moment, when we were kissing; at the same time I was so afraid that everything was just a wonderful hallucination.\" Sam looks into her eyes and embraces her tenderly, as if she were a newborn puppy. With his soft baritone voice, he says \"My charming princess, you just never stop surprising me with your fantastic ideas and your elaborating narratives.\" He pauses a short moment and gives her a kiss on her lips again. Thereafter, Sam cradles her upper torso with his right arm, as they sit down next to each other. Josie enjoys being so close to him. The scent of his breathe reminds her of a favorite gum, which she often chews, when she feels insecure. As she leans her head on his chest, she asks:\" I just do not know how to apologize to you. When you left me, after the prom night. All I could think about was our last conversation, your dance steps, and most of all … \" Josie touches his face nervously and looks into his eyes innocently.\" What would happen, if we met each other through another context. I am not sure if I could ever be as exciting or beautiful as Laura. When you told me that you broke up with her a few weeks ago, I was so certain that you just need someone to talk with. Also, you would probably like to enjoy you fabulous single life for a while.\" \"Oh, sweet Josie!\" Sam replies. \"Do you have any idea about the feeling of being accepted for who I am. When I am with you, I am so certain that my choice of working as a high school teacher is the best decision I ever made.\" \"Why is it so controversial to work as a teacher? It is a wonderful job! Beside, you have all the time in the world to indulge yourself with a few of the most dramatic narratives, also to discuss with your students about how people from various socio-economic groups, in different age, envision the contradiction between heroes and villains, love and hatred, vision and reality! It must be a fantastic experience to observe how young people develop through their years in South Glen, under your guidance and encouragement!\" \"Oh, my delightful Josephine Geller!\" Sam kisses her forehead affectionately. \"You remind me of the valiant Celtic warrior princess, Cartismantua. As a college student, I was very interested in Celtic history. I always thought I will one day travel to Ireland, to hike along the treacherous coastline in Dingle!\" \"That sounds like an exciting vacation plan! I would love to spend a few days upon Aran island, visiting the Gaelic speaking community. Another wish is to visit St Michel island, to make friends with the lovely puffins in their natural environment.\" Josie replies dreamingly. Sam looks at her warmly. Josie is an interesting and thoughtful woman. Behind her insecure smile, there is a strong determination to live her life to its full potential. At the age of 25, she still retains a strong urge to continue to dream, searching for her next adventure, which would define the greatness of life; at the same time, she has displayed a sharp intellectual depth in a number of different fields, as if she were an experienced UN diplomat. He has never been intimidated by any girls before. As the best forward in his college ice-hochey team who has a degree in English literature, he was often the center of gravity in various campus parties. Many pretty girls loved competing for his attention. At the age of 22, he was certain that he was the luckiest man in the entire universe. Suddenly, his fate changed, after his left arm, the good arm, was terribly injured in a game. From one day to another, he could no longer be the most celebrated hero on the ice. The pain from the fracture kept him awake night after night. In a few months, the operating room in the hospital was his second home. \"What are you thinking?\" Josie's question brings him back to this fervent baseball match again. What a night! Sam looks at Josie! She is extremely graceful in her pink dress. As the warm breeze blows her soft, curly blond hair up and down, he cannot help himself from holding her tighter, inhaling the scent of her hair and feeling the warmth of her body. He wants to dance with her, under a huge Bohemian crystal chandelier in a baroque styled ball room, just like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire; or to hike with her, towards the highest mountain peak and enjoy the most spectacular view, under the cloudless autumn sky, like two tenacious Vikings; most all, to enjoy this moment with her. Josie asks him again: \"Sam, Sam, Mr Coulson, are you alright? \" \"Oh, sorry, I just have some thoughts in my head.\" Sam is so afraid of revealing what he is thinking about at that moment. He does not want to give this brilliant and timid woman any pressure, which she could not bear so early in their relationship. Instead, he continues to discuss their last topic, with a slightly shaking voice. \"How come you are so interested in Ireland, Josie? Do you have any Gaelic ancestors?\" \"No, my maternal grandparents moved from Norway and Sweden with their families in the twenties. Both families settled in Nebraska. My paternal grandparents are children of German immigrants. There is no direct connection between me and Ireland biologically. Nevertheless, I have always enjoyed reading National geographics. As a teenager, I wanted to travel with a backpack through Europe.\" She responds softly. \"I would love to visit Padua, to admire the wonderful Giotto fresco in Scrovegni Chapel; also drinking a cup of hot cocoa with a dash of the finest French brandy in one of the Viennese cafés in Austria, experiencing the enigmatic atmosphere, which once encouraged Freud and Breuer to discuss the psychological problems underneath Fräulein Anna O's physical illness.\" Suddenly the applause from the crowd breaks out and drowns out her voice. South Glen has brought home the title. All the spectators are standing up and cheering the victory togethers with the boys in the field. Josie has only her eyes for Sam, a gentleman who has just given her the first real kiss in her life. The feeling of kissing him is nothing like what she imagined previously. His lips are soft and moisture; his newly shaved cheeks are smooth and soothing; his tongue is silky and playful. The feeling of touching his cheek with her hand, while looking at his eyes in a crowded stadium, is as intensive as being hit by a thunderbolt. At that moment, all her previous sad memories vanish into the oblivion instantaneously. The sensation of being passionately kissed by him, washes away all her anxieties for any potential future hazards. At the same time, she feels so apprehensive about entering a relationship, a real relationship with its own up and downs. Every cell in her body wants this moment to last forever. Now, he is standing next to her in his gorgeous grey coloured jumper and smiling back to her, as if they have always been a couple. She is so proud that this sophisticated and athletic man is now her official companion, her prince charming, her heart desire.[Chapter 2] When Josie wakes up in the morning, she still retains her bright smile. What a night! Her first piece of story is an instant success. Young people from South Glen high and many other local schools have been discussing her first kiss in various popular social media. The shop owner, who sold her that pink dress two days ago, has just announced that she still has ten identical dresses in her storage room. She is no longer Josie Grossie! In fact, she is the centre of everyone's attention! The telephone rings. The display shows that the caller is Anita from the office. \"Hi, Josie! I am so happy for you!\" Anita sounds cheerful. \"What a kiss! You are so brave Josie! You deserve all the happiness!\" \"Thank you, Anita! I still cannot comprehend fully what just happened last night! It went so fast and it was the most magnificent moment in my life insofar.\" Josie replies with a trembling voice. \"Sam is a lucky guy! You are not only special, you are the most interesting and caring person in the entire universe! Do you have any idea how pretty you were yesterday?\" \"Oh, Anita! I have never seen myself as a pretty girl! Ever since I was young, I always thought it will take a huge bottle of magic potion, before I would master the art of being popular! \" Josie rumbles quietly. \"Oh, Josie! You just did not met Mr Right!\" Anita says with a raucous voice! \"By the way, when you are going to have your first official date? I want to know every detail! I hope it will be a fancy one! \" \"But...\" Josie is suddenly in a great panic. They have talked a lot last night, comparing Brontë sisters with Austen, discussing the iconic love story between Nora and Robin, even why he was obsessed with Willa Cather's pioneer narratives for a while, after his beloved grandmother has passed away. However, they never exchanged their telephone numbers or addresses. What will happen? Has she just lost the greatest gift, life has given her? \"Josie, you do not need to reveal any detail yet\" Anita says with a teasing voice. \" Sooner or later, you are going to record each and every juicy detail in a Pulitzer prize winning novel, about a self-reliant career woman's self-discovery journey through a perilous path in the 21st century!\" \"But Anita! We never exchanged either our telephone number or anything else! He does not work in South Glen anymore. All his furniture is on their way to his new apartment in Milwaukee. He craved for a new beginning, after I have unveiled my disguise in that prom. At that moment, he was so certain that I would write a horrible story about him, about how he seduced a promising young high school girl in the most disgusting way! \" Josie screams anxiously with a high-pitched voice. \"But he came back, didn't he?\" Says Anita with the calmest sound she could produce. \"Yes he did! But...\" Josie does not dare to speculate if they would meet again in this lifetime. The past has suddenly caught up with her again! \"He is moving to Wisconsin! He will meet pretty girls again in Milwaukee! Girls with long and blond hair, long eyelashes, bright blue eyes, perfectly manicured nails, just like Laura, his former girlfriend!\" \"They might be nice to look at for a moment, but he is not in love with them! You are a spectacular woman, eloquent, adventurous, brave and entertaining! You are one in a million, Josie!\" Anita continues: \"If he is mature enough, he will look for you, probably already today! Or next week. Everyone in Chicago Sun time knows who you are! It takes one phone call to the front desk, to find out your telephone number! Don't worry, Josie! He is in love with you, passionately and seriously!\" After talking with Anita, Josie pulls out her laptop and hopes that Yahoo search engine would help her to find out more about Sam Coulson, her Sam! To her great surprise, she receives around half a million results, ranging from a famous guitar player, to a number of university professors and business owners, also a mugshot of an eerie looking fugitive with a huge scar on his left cheek, who escaped from a penitentiary in Alabama a few weeks ago. She knows neither where he graduated or what his full name. Sam could be either Samuel, or Samson. In her college, she even knew a Sam, whose name was Balsam! \"How little I know about this mysteriously attractive man.\" She murmurs to herself. Standing in front of the mirror, she scolds herself with the roughest voice: \"Josephine Amelia Desideria Geller, why? I need a special magic trick, to go back in time!\" When she records her memory from her time in South Glen, she remembers that he once mentioned that his friend, Philip Fitzpatrick, who works in the admission group in Dartmouth. It is not difficult to find any information about this Philip, however there is only a telephone number, which goes his office. She can't call him! She does not want to act like if she were a desperate crazy woman! But she cannot find out any other method to trace him down. She wants to see him again. The rest of her sunday passes by in the most dreadful way. She has neither any desire to do some needlework, which she enjoys doing in any other day, nor reading one of the books that she just bought from an online vintage book store. When she does her weekly grocery shopping, half of her cart is filled with chocolate cakes and popsicles instantly. Again and again, she asks herself if Sam would contact her in the following days.[Chapter 3] Monday passes by quickly. Her telephone line has been extremely busy. A number of anxious parents ask her if she has a key, which could help them to warm up their frozen relationship with their teenage children; a principle from a suburb high school wonders who this brilliant English teacher is, also if he would like to have a new position in the next autumn term; a famous TV presenter from a cable network invites her to participate a talk show, to discuss how high school kids today shopping their prom dresses. After the lunch break, there is a stunning bouquet of ruby coloured tulips on her table, from Mr Rigfort. Together with the flower, there is a new assignment, a much more serious topic: to find out why some families, which have adopted their children from abroad, regret their decisions; also, how they treat their new family members afterworth. To her great disappointment, none of the callers is Sam. When ever she has a moment for herself, she daydreams about that moment, when her lips were touched by his for the first time. She craves for the scent of his skin and his soothing voice. On her way home, her tear pours out, unexpectedly. The novel feeling of being a respected journalist, can not erase the fact that Sam, whom she is fervently in love with, has not contacted her yet. At the same time, she is annoyed by her own lamenting reaction. She has always been an independent and resourceful woman. Silently, she keeps repeating to herself that she has just received the most difficult assignment in her career yet, a task she looks forward to working with. Deep down, she believes that this story would encourage many families to open up their homes, welcoming the abandoned children with open arms, albeit their individual problems. To her great surprise, there is a brown envelope in her letterbox, when she comes home. She recognizes the handwriting at once! My darling Josie: I am 32 years old this year and I have never kissed a girl, who has \"rocked my world\" and altered my understanding of love and affection from its foundation. I cannot stop thinking about you! It is my turn to make a proposal to you! I would like to see you next weekend, for a classic date night: a nice dinner in that rustic Polish restaurant a few blocks away from South Glen; thereafter, Ibsen's A Doll's house in the theatre. I hope we can take a stroll along the water and enjoy an ice cream, (there is a wonderful shop which sells the most delicious ice cream, my favorite is the creamy Italian chocolate ice cream, with small chunks of fresh raspberry and lightly toasted almond on top) before driving you home and kissing you goodnight. Please give me a call, if you see this letter! I will be in Milwaukee next week, to have a few meetings with my new job. love Sam On the backside, there is his cellphone number. The anticipation is finally over. She rushes into the living room and picks up her telephone at once. When she dials his number, her hands are trembling with excitement and anxiety. Sam picks up his telephone after only one signal. \"Thank you for your letter, Sam! For a while, I thought I would never hear from you again!\" Josie says with her bright and quivering voice. \" How could I forget to discuss with you about how we could communicate with each other.\" \"Nice to hear from you, Josie! I was completely carried away with the entire event last Saturday too. How are you doing, sweetheart? \" Sam is as composed as ever. By some strange reason, he still talks to her in the same way as if she is one of the students in his class. \"Oh, I am fine, or at least fine now. It is wonderful to hear your voice again. How did you find out where I live? From the phone book?\" Josie asks. \"Please give me some credit for being a teacher. I still have the class list. I am not sure if it is a good idea to call you. It would be terribly embarrassing if one of your parents would answer the telephone.\" replies Sam shyly. \"I see! By the way, what is your name? Is it Samuel or Samson?\" Josie asks with a juvenal voice. To know him better is her highest goal in life at this moment! \"It is Samuel, Samuel Nicholas Coulson\" He replies politely. \"Nicholas is the English version of my grandfather's Polish name, Nikola. Everyone called him Nico, when I was a young boy. As a child, he was my hero, my role model! I always thought he was the most ingenious person on earth!\" \"I see why you prefer a stylish candle dinner in a Polish tavern. Have you ever visited your family in Poland? \" This is her favorite subject. As a child, Josie loves to ask her own grandparents about their lives and families in Europe. \"Sadly no, but I would love to visit Zamosc, my grandfather's old home town in eastern Poland.\" He hesitates a second, before continuing to reveal a rather personal narrative: \"For my family, it is a painful history, which we never talk about in any occasion. My grandfather's father was a respected Jewish merchant, who lived in one of the elegant Armenian villas in the Old town. According to my mother, this gentleman could speak both Russian and German fluently, beside Polish and Ladino. As the age of 45, two years after his wife, Edith, passed away from a struggling child birth, he met a young, feisty Gypsy girl, a brilliant Cello player from Transylvania. In his delusional days, he often spoke fondly, with his paraphasic jargon, about her idiosyncratic interpretation of Smetana's melodies and her dark honey coloured eyes. If my mother were a boy, her name would be Bedrich.\" \"What an intriguing story.\" Right now, Josie wishes that Sam is not two hours away. She has so many questions about his family constellation and why such a lovely story is still the most shameful memory. It would be wonderful to take a look at their old family album. \"Do you want to visit Zamosc with me? I know we have not gone to our first official date yet, but I really want to spend a few weeks with you in Poland. As a child, my father often read Henryk Sienkiewicz's stories for us. The bloody Teutonic battles still haunt me in my nightmares from time to time. If you want to, I would love to visit L'viv in Ukraine too.\" \"Oh Josie, my lovely valentine! Where have been all these years?\" Sam continues: \"I would love to share this traveling experience with you, to taste the freshly baked authentic Polish gingerbread with a cup of smoky black tea in the afternoons, or to attend one of the open air piano concert in the evenings.\" Their conversation continues for a long time. Josie loves the feeling of being able to discuss with this charming, eloquent man, about her personal view upon the \"big\" issues, which she often thinks about. As a fervent feminist, she loves to discuss how the changing idea of justice and democracy has altered the common understanding of a self-reliant life, from a female's perspective, although many reality shows promote a very different set of ideas. Moreover, she is interested in discussing why some of the ancient philosophies still matter today. Sam, her Samuel Nicholas, is one of the most \"rufusly\" interesting men in her life at this moment, who is just as eager as she is in exploring how the digital tools have changed modern people's general conceptions upon what is pertinent from what is insignificant. Before she goes to bed, a new message appears in her telephone: \"Goodnight, my Celtic warrior queen! I can't wait to hold you tightly in my arms again!\" This is her first serious relationship, a marvelous love affair which could be celebrated with the most poetic language by both Emily Brontë and Christina Rossetti![Chapter 4] In the following days, Josie has learned that Sam, her handsome Samuel Nicholas, spent his childhood years in a suburb to Chicago. His parents are two devout catholics, who still attend the church service every sunday morning. Many of the grave traditional Christian virtues are by all means important guidelines in that household. For his mother, Rebecca, living a healthy and righteous life is much more important than any worldly success in terms of position, influence or wealth. Around five o'clock in Saturday evening, Sam appears in front of her door, with a nicely wrapped package in his hand. Josie loves the fact that he wears a lavender coloured shirt with a well starched collar and a pair of fancy midnight blue coloured pants. \"Good evening, Mr Coulson! Nice to see you!\" Josie, who dresses her up with a fancy white sailor dress, answers the door with a timid voice. When Sam kisses her on her lips, she beams with joy. \"Good evening, Josie Geller!\" Sam also acts as if he still is her teacher in English literature in South Glen and speaks with his stern voice. \"I thought you need a special private lesson in Ibsen's plays this lovely Saturday evening. I hope you have prepared yourself well. Otherwise I will have a very serious discussion with Mr and Mrs Geller tomorrow, or probably already this evening!\" Josie giggles with her sweet girly voice. \"Oh, Mr Coulson, I just had so much to do last week, the shopping trips with my best girlfriends, the cheerleader activities with the team and...\" She rolls eyes mischievously and says with a whining tone \"There is a boy, an amicable ice hockey player, with a pair of seductive eyes. I was just too busy enjoying my daydreams, in which I am on an outing in a park with him, just like Mary Poppins and Bert, dancing with the penguins under the cherry trees and munching cupcakes with the soft, creamy strawberry frosting on top.\" \"In that case, the only adequate action I should execute is giving you a huge amount of extra homework this weekend. Believe me, this is not an impetuous action! You need to learn what is essential in life! Nice to know that I am still an authoritarian figure in this relationship! \" He wraps his left arm around her and kisses her lips again, thereafter he hands over the small package to her. \"I have missed you tremendously, my lovely Josie-Cosy! I hope you like chocolate with lavender truffles.\" Inside the small box, there are nine handmade chocolate bars. Their lips meet again. This time, none of them are in any hurry to part them away. The Polish restaurant, Isabella, has been Sam's favorite place for a while. He likes the folk baroque styled interior decoration and the hearty dishes, the baked Russian pierogis with a creamy chanterelle sauce, bigos and a basket of freshly baked rye bread or roasted duck thigh with potato knodel and red wine sauce, which he once enjoyed in his grandparents' house every Sunday afternoon. The waiter is an old, chubby gentleman, with a curly, copper coloured mustache. When he wears a red cardigan in the winter season, he looks like the kindest Santa Claus in every toddler's fantasy. It feels like going back to a carefree time of his life, every time Sam talks with him. The sound of his charming Slavic accent reminds him about the happiness he felt, when he went fishing with Nico in the early Summer mornings. In the summertime, most guests prefer eating their dinner in the beer garden. Josie and Sam have more or less the entire restaurant for themselves. \"Do you mind, if I order your dinner for you this evening, Josie Cosy! I know you guard your independence fiercely, but, please allow me to surprise you with a Polonia feast, which Nico would enjoy with a huge smile on his face!\" Sam asks with a sweet voice. He knows this woman well enough to understand that he would never be able to impress her with champagne in crystal glasses or a dozen of red roses with a silk ribbon. If he wishes to gain some real importance in her heart, especially when the initial infatuation fades away and the reality catches up, he needs to share his own personal stories, which he values more than any great literature; also his personal, undisguised view upon the fundamental issues. She challenges him with her thoughtful and unforeseen questions; she excites him with her ideas and dreams; above all, she makes him feel that she believes in his ability to change the world! Josie gives him a gentle smile and replies:\"How nice! I could already sense the terrific smell of their fermented pickled cabbage! I think I will love everything, as long as they do not give me too much uncooked onion or garlic.\" \"How nice!\" He beams back. Without looking at the menu one single time, he places his order in Polish with a beguiling voice. \"It is so exciting! Finally we are on a date together, Sam! How has your week been?\" Josie asks. Sam knows this question will come up sooner or later. He has been all by himself in a new city. Milwaukee was suppose to be his escape from her, this fantastic woman, who is sitting in front of him and listening to his stories enthusiastically. Not in a million years, he could envisage what a poignant story she composed. How could this fascinating woman fall in love with a humble man like himself? \"My week has been good. It will be interesting to work in a adult high school this Autumn.\" He gives her hand a squeeze affectionately. \"The role of being a teacher is very different, when standing in front of a group of adults who have accumulated very different personal experiences through life. Some of them are in fact much older than I am.\" \"You did well, when you taught me in South Glen, Mr Coulson\" Josie teases him with her honeyed voice. \"However, the likelihood of teaching a group of North Western graduated top students, like yourself, my sweet pumpkin pie, is very, very low, I assume.\" He gives her a playful smile, while they receive their entrée, which is a small bowl of thick cabbage soup from Malopolska region, with finely diced smoked bacon, potato chunks, sauerkraut and a dollop of sour cream on top. This is his favorite dish, which his beloved granny, Tekla often made in the evening time. Sam certainly hopes that Josie would like the taste of this soup; deep down inside he knows that she is precisely the kind of women, whom he would like to introduce to Nico and Tekla, if they still are alive. \"The taste of this soup brings back so many nice memories from my summer holiday in my grandparents' cottage in Pennsylvania.\" Josie whispers happily, while devouring her soup enthusiastically, without considering any eating etiquette or other social conventions. \"If your future date dinners will be half as good as this soup, I would never say no to any new invitation!\" \"Nice to know!\" The number of subjects of their conversation increases with each minute it goes. Sam is surprised that this sophisticated woman is just as interested in the latest boyband music, as the ancient scripts which were conducted by Seneca or Cicero. Most of all, she is interested in life itself, to explore what is hiding behind the next hill which lies ahead of her. Her words are as magical as the wings of the most explosive eagers, which could carry his mind away, from here and now, to a fairytale like surrounding, in which the action of defying any physical laws is not only possible, it is encouraged! Her laughter is as spellbinding as the last ray of twilight! When she smiles, he has the urge to kiss her dimples, to stop time from moving forward.[Chapter 5] The development of Romania has been a favorite subject, which Jossie has wished to write about for sometime. The transition from a communist dictatorship to a democratic state is an intricate object to scrutinize from a number of angles. The current lives of the children, who have been adopted from the crowded state run children's homes, are by all means a complex story. From an adoption agency, she learns that many American parents were not prepared for their forthcoming difficulties, when picking up the pretty Romanian toddlers with blond curly hair, fair skin and blue eyes in the orphanages in the early nineties. Very few have consulted the professional psychologists before making such a huge decision. As an undercover reporter, Josie assigns herself in a weekly group meeting for fifteen stay-at-home mothers in Madison every Tuesday afternoon through the internet. Those women have adopted their children from Romania in the past. Her identity in this group is a young wife, who hopes that her dream of becoming a mother would be achieved by adopting an infant internationally in the near future. She is happy that she has now a good reason to visit Sam in the middle of the week in Wisconsin. Before her first meeting, she and Sam meet up for a casual lunch in a small Greek tavern. Sam wears a tight, white T shirt with a large Black Hawks' slogan and a pair of blue jeans. When Josie is giving him a nice kiss on his lips, she realizes how much she enjoys kissing him and smelling the aroma of his aftershave, which is mixed with a light scent of coffee from his breathe at the same time. \"So nice to see you in Milwaukee, Mr Coulson.\" Josie loves to tease him by addressing him as Mr Coulson. \"Hello, pretty girl! Nice to see you too!\" He holds her tightly with his hands and gives her one more kiss on her forehead. \"Are you nervous for your meeting?\" Of course she is nervous. When looking at Sam's worrisome eyes, she knows that she is not be able to disguise her anxiety for the first meeting. Whilst driving up, she has gone through a number of opening lines for her self-presentation in the meeting. This is a subject, which she has never had any incitement to touch upon. Although she would like to have a child or two in the future, up to this moment, she has never seriously contemplated about a life in a quiet house in a picturesque suburb with a husband and a couple of children. She has read a number of articles about the tormenting pain, which many women have experienced, after years of unsuccessful attempts to be pregnant. As a young woman, she can not imagine the ambivalent feelings to the sexual intercourse with the loved one, after being use to have coitas after a scheme, which is based on the monthly cycle, in a number of years. By reviewing various internet forums, she has learned the number of reasons of adopting a child is as many as the total pairs of parents. At the same time, she loves the fact that she has the opportunity to work with such a serious topic, so early in her career. The prospect of being able to describing such a controversial subject from a different angle, despite all prevailing stereotypical pictures, is her most important incentive to work hard with this story. \"It is an intimidating experience! In comparison with the last task, I cannot imagine what I have to do, in order to act normal.\" She sighs lightly. \"I really hate to use the word normal, in any context, nevertheless I have to act in a normal way, in order to fit in, to get to know the women. I cannot use their narratives in any conventional sense, it is not a portrait of a desperate mother. It is a discussion upon a general level. I want to act in a genuine way, I really hate the thought that they will be feeling that I have used their stories for my career ladder in the future.\" \"Don't worry, my talented Martha Gellhorn! There is so much integrity and warmth in your heart, I am confident that you will find a brilliant story, which is both complex and exciting at the same time!\" He gives her one more kiss on her cheek before going to the restaurant with her. \"Yes, Mr Coulson! I think you have to say that, because you are my teacher!\" She gives him a mischievous smile. \"Or should I address you, as my Earnest from now on?\" He strikes her hair gently.\"I would rather like to be addressed as your Sam, than Hemingway or FitzGerald. I really think you are an extraordinary writer, an adventurer who is not afraid of searching the path, which would be all means redefine the new general convention about what is important in life and love, the real fear that we are too afraid to scrutinize its possible consequence beneath the enigmatic surface.\" \"My Sam, my own Samuel Nicholas! What a beautiful sentence. If the future would be as promise as this moment, nothing would be impossible!\" Josie says silently. \"Please tell me if you have have ever envisioned the feeling of having the children of your own in your arms?\" Sam looks her quizzically. \"Are you? \" How to reply him. This is only their second date. She is infatuated with him through her entire body, but she also hopes that she will enjoy her career for a number of years, to do things she has always wanted to do; also to enjoy his company. But the idea of having a child with this handsome man, who is sitting in front of her is not a scary thought. On the contrary, she loves to have a child, especially a boy, who would have his eyes and those delightful lips. \"Do you want to have a child with me? Already?\" \"I just want to know if you would understand the intensive yearning for the experience of being a mother.\" There is an awkward smile which flashes on his face in a blink of an eye. \"Please understand me right. I do think this is a very interesting topic and I would love to listen to your thoughts.\" \"I see. I have thought about it a number of times the past ten days. I do believe that the motif behind each adoption is unique. But I do not understand how the discussions went before each displacement from the original adoptive families took place. I would love to believe that the intentions were altruistic in every case. I am perfectly aware the mothers, who I am going to meet today are not flawless saints. But... \" Josie stops for a second and attempts to search for her own thoughts by looking at his eyes. Various thoughts come and go randomly the last days. When reading the interviews from the popular woman magazines, she is perfectly aware of her own inadequate picture of the complex relationships between the adopted children and their American parents who belong to various different socio-economic groups. \"I just hope this will not be a self-discovery journey like the last article, rather a fairy and rational description of their own struggles which they have been through.\" \"Most of all, I hope you will not discover a new guy, a fairytale like penguin with a pair of vigilant eyes, who possesses all the specially qualities which would wobble your world, whoever he now is.\" Sam give her a playful look. \"My fair Tinkerbell, I would love to follow you through this intriguing roller coaster ride, from the beginning till the end, either as your devoted listener, or as your discussion partner any hour through the day. You are the most fascinating woman in the entire universe!\" Josie is almost tearful. What a fantastic speech, from her Samuel Nicholas. \"I hope you would be my penguin!\" Before Josie finishes her sentence, the waitress brings their lunch to the table, freshly grilled rabbit thighs with garlic sauce, a few chunks of halloumi, potato wedges and a pile of baby carrots. Although this is only their second meal together, Josie feels relaxed in his company, as if they have known each for a long time.[Chapter 6] Seven women sit in the room, when Josie enters in her first meeting; one is a pretty Latino, one is an Asian, to her surprise, and the rest are Caucasians. All of them are dressed in rather expansive outfits. The youngest is around 30 years old, the oldest is at least 40 years old. There is also a Sephardic Jewish psychologist, whose name is Judith Toledano. According to the website, she has obtained a PhD in developmental psychology from an Ivy League university. She wears a tiny golden tree of life necklace. With a strong East coast accent, she declares that the theme of the meeting is 'how to define the meaning of true American Grit in the new Millennium.' With a shaking voice, Josie delivers her self-presentation for this group. \"My, My name is Josephine Geller. I live in Chicago. Through an internet forum, I found this group meeting. I hope, oh, I hope I will be able to collect as many experiences from you as I possibly can. I hope I can prepare myself well for our forthcoming adoption.\" Afterwards, her both palms are moist. The youngest Asian woman says at once \"It is so nice to meeting you, Josephine. To which country are you going to travel to, to get your kid?\" Thereafter she scrutinizes Josie's left ring finger and asks \"Are you adopting alone, as a single mother?\" Josie suddenly realizes that she does not have a ring on her finger. How could she ignore such an important detail? This also remains her that she needs to have a photograph of Sam in her wallet. She just hopes it will not be difficult to convince Sam to take a photo with her. Also, she needs to make up a story about their romantic past, which leads to his grand proposal. It would be nice to tell the lady what a beautiful proposal in Vienna or Madrid her engagement was. She takes a detour in her mind and envisioned a romantic proposal, in a balmy Spring afternoon. Sam, her Samuel Nicholas gives her an elegant ring, which Zelda would have on one of her fingers, when taking a sojourn with Scott to France, also a dozen red roses afterwards. Sam would probably read a charming passage from one of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poems. If he would like to propose in Vienna, they would probably attend a fancy party afterwards and dance along a dramatic piece of Waltz, which was composed by Strauss, under grand crystal chandeliers, which are lighted up with candle lights. If their engagement takes place in Cordoba, they would probably go to a cosy Oriental tavern and have a fancy meal with lots of fresh vegetables and tasty herbs, whilst the violinists playing Granados' Spanish Dance passionately. As an Andalusian senorita for a night, she would wear a red Flamenco dress, a cute silk mantilla, which is fastened on her hair with a handmade wooden peineta, when dancing with Sam. \"You'd better think one more time, if you really want to have a child on your own, especially if you considering to adopt an infant, who cries a lot in the evening.\" A modulated voice takes her back from her reverie. A blond woman with a thick ponytail, who wears a dark brown coloured blouse and a fancy white skirt sermonizes with a serious complexion. \"As a single career mother, it is difficult to pull everything together. The kids are not always cute and fun, especially when they are tired or hungry.\" \"I have a nice husband at home, the matter in fact, and his name, his name is Sam.\" Josie stammers with a quiet voice, as if she were afraid that someone in her groups would uncover her disguise and accuse her for acting as a charlatan in such a personal meeting. \"He loves children. And, and he loves me.\" A signal flashes quickly on her telephone, there is a new message from Sam. \"Good luck with your first meeting with the ladies in Madison.\" \"You will be fine, if you are on your own, without a drunken Irish husband, whose devotion to Guinness or Bushmill single male is a billion times deeper than his attachment to you!\" A sarcastic voice comes from a skinny lady, who is busy checking her finger nails. \"Although he wears adult jackets och has an American driver's license, when he talks with his mates, the only subjects they would touch upon are either the latest ball games or the important pub nights with the lads. His cute accent becomes a painful remainder of how foolish you once were, when you let him cast a spell on you with his charming singing voice, a set of excotic vocabularies and his vintage photographs from the Ring of Kerry, which his grandfather took, when the fanciful American automobiles still were a symbol of one's position in a callously stratified society.\" There is a strong determination in her eyes, which penetrates through the entire room; her sight is as sharp as a Celtic dagger. Josie cannot make up her mind whether she should laugh or cry. In comparison with her tragic story, the romantic fantasies, which Jossie has recently been through in her day dreams, are only bizarr, juvenal illusions, which she is ashamed of all in a sudden. Slowly, Judith stands up. With a kind voice, she attempts to direct the topic towards the theme of the day. \"Ladies, I think Audrey has just demonstrated for us how important it is to be a tenacious mother, a safe haven for her offsprings, with this personal narrative. Thank you, Audrey for sharing your story with us today!\" She clears her throat discreetly. \"Let us talk about how to cope with constant stress, day after day What is your take on this, Cynthia?\" She directs her eye towards the Latino lady. \"In the previous meetings, you have described a number of times, how often your husband, Anthony, traveled month after month. How do you do?\" Cynthia gives Josie a polite salute with her eyes and replies with a tired voice: \"Tony was the one who wanted to have a child from Romania from the beginning. He has a bunch of relatives, who moved to the US from Wallachia fifty years ago. When we brought the boys home, Claudiu was already eight years old and Dorian was five. On top of this, our daughter, Alice, was only two years old. It has been a constant battle. Sometimes, no, every day, I think I need to to give up, to walk away from this mess, with Alice.\" After a short stop, she continues: \"It has been three very, very difficult years.\" Her tears pours out. \"I am so ashamed that I want to abandon those two boys, but… But I just do not know when things will turn around.\" Audrey gives Cynthia a hug. before she delivers her comments: \"It is crazy that the boys still talk with each other in Romanian at home, after they have lived in Wisconsin in three years. I can imagine the feeling of being an Alien in your own house. All their friends are Romanian speaking kids in school. It is strange that Tony only wants to be a fun dad, and shovels all the responsibilities to you. What a cynic world!\" The discussion turns to such a serious lamenting session after just a few minutes, despite all the women have such happy profiles in the forum, showing up the photographs of the interior decorations of their homes, the perfect smile of their children, their after school activities, the joyful family vacations. Josie excuses herself by asking where the bathroom is. She has to get out of this asphyxiating room at once, to escape from the miserable family tragedies for a moment. What is real? What is an illusion? No one plans to go through a dreadful marriage with a handsome, well-paid and narcissistic husband, who treats his wife like a pretty Barbie doll, who is happy and content all the time, despite all difficulties. The tormenting pain and the terrifying loneliness which destroys their mental strength slowly, becomes only more and more unbearable with every day it goes, whilst the gentlemen continues with the same family routine days after days. The good-bye kisses are nothing more than a standard procedure each morning. The weekly coitas only satisfies the basic biological needs; when eating the family dinners in the evening, all they exchange with each other is either their children's next activity or which bills they need to pay in the near future. It is difficult to speculate why the husbands no longer pay any attention to their wives' inner world, their opinions upon various political reforms or artistic development, although they continue saying the magical sentence 'I love you' every day. Their adopted children are too young to understand the feeling of being an inadequate mother, who does not have the slightest ability to understand how their idea of the prevailing social convention functions. When the women are all by themselves in the morning hours, the feeling of being left alone by the entire universe, terrorizes them frequently. All their childhood dreams are as far away as the brightest nova in the midnight heaven. At last, Josie walks in again and joins a new heated discussion, regarding how to be stoic and fair, when their adopted children keep revolting day after day. Many children, who have lived in a orphanage for a number of years, suffer some severe mental disorders. The memories of living in a overcrowded confinement, moulded their special social instinct. Due to various different circumstances, the staff in their orphanages have never assessed if some of the children might be autistic in one way or the other. As a new parent, their first challenge is to establish a mutual trust and respect, despite the cultural barriers. By listening to different women's experiences, Josie realizes that some of adoptive children are reluctant to trust their American parents, who occasionally have shown some disdainful attitude towards their old homelands unintentionally. When the meeting is finally over, Josie is overwhelmed with all new impressions. The predicament of becoming a mother, when the adopted child refuses to bond with you open-heartedly in any circumstance, is only a dismal reality, it is the worst nightmare for someone who have tried so hard for such a long time to become a mother. When most women have scattered away, the young Asian woman, Rui-Kim, approaches to her and asks: \"Are you alright? You look sad, Josie.\" \"I am okey, I think. It is just, everyone has such a sad story to share with the group. I am not sure...\" Josie is still shaking. \"It is a good reality check. Everything you read from the newspaper is how a child would complete your life; or how much joy and happiness a vulnerable teenager would bring to their new adoptive family. There is always a different reality, when the camera has turned down. \" She puts one hand on the banister and gives Josie's hand a cordial squeeze with another. \"Your experience might be very different. The happy mothers do not participate this group meeting.\" \"I know what you mean.\" Josie murmurs. \"I will see you next week, if you still want to participate this meeting. I have two hours of driving ahead of me now.\" Rui-Kim vanishes soon from her sight.[Chapter 7] When Josie comes home to Chicago, she has a strong urge to talk with her mother, for a meaningful discussion about the idea of motherhood. Her telephone pips again, there is a new message from Sam: \"I miss you, my delightful baby doll! Good night, Sweet dreams! I am looking forward to talking with you tomorrow evening!\" In any other days, Josie would be happy to read this message, but not today. \"Who am I?\" She looks at her own image in the mirror, whilst repeating this question over and over again. The idea of being someone's wife, a couple of children's mother is an impossible challenge. Cynthia's voice continues to create new questions in her head, questions which encourage her to scrutinize her ability to love someone unconditionally, whilst people around her refuse to acknowledge the misery she is going through every day. Sam has been a pleasant gentleman up to now. Will he continue to be a sweetheart? What will happen in the future, after they have become husband and wife? The prospect of hearing Sam saying \"I love you\" in a romantic candlelight dinner, scares her, although she has fantisised this moment so many times in her solitude. On Thursday, Josie meets up with her mother, Amelia, and her aunt, Andrea, for lunch, in a small Vietnamese restaurant. Both of them became mothers in a rather mature age. Amelia is a shy lady, who works as an experimental chemist in the hospital. She has always been a supportive, quiet and sensitive mother, who takes care of her two children on the daily basis. When they need someone to talk to, she has always been an open-minded listener. Andrea has been Josie role model, since her teenage years. As the travel reporter, a talented photographer, she has been to places, most people have only seen on a detailed map. A few years ago, she was awarded with a famous prize, for her travel article about the cave monastery in David Gareja in Georgia in Caucasus. Both sisters love the freshly prepared Vietnamese Summer rolls, with shrimps, crispy lettuce, green herb and finely diced scallion. The crown of everything is their salty chili dip sauce, with a dash dark sesame oil on top. \"It is so nice to see you, both of you. I really need to talk with you, mom and auntie! What a week! I have no idea what it takes to be a mother!\" The opening lines sounds desperate already. \"What are you talking about, Sweetheart? Are you and that Mr Coulson...\" Amelia asks unsecurely with a trembling voice. \"No, mom. We have not even, you know.\" Josie collects her breathe in a second. \"We have only kissed, many kisses although, but...\" \"What a night, you are so magnificent, Josie. That Mr Coulson must be immensely impressed! Not many people can pull through a thing like that, my darling! You are such a brave warrior, just like your grandmother, Hilda.\" Andrea looks at Josie, with a smile. \"How I miss her. You and that blond gentleman, Sam, make a beautiful couple together. I hope you will have a nice Summer together.\" \"It is not that fantastic to enroll myself in a relationship, at least not now.\" Josie sighs lightly. \"I am not even sure who he would be, when he will metamorphose from my prince charming to a conventional man, who is both narcissistic and vain, when the excitement of this new companionship ceases.\" Josie does not want to believe a day like this will arrive soon. In her eyes, her Samuel Nicholas is perfect in every aspect. When she thinks about him, he is as charming as an elegant nineteenth century pianist, who plays one of the most elaborated Polonaise which was composed by Chopin, on a Grand piano in a large Baroque party saloon in Krakow. This room is dimly lighted with ivory candelabras. All she could see is the movement of his fingers and the glistening stars in the night sky. What is his unproud true nature, beneath his happy and sincere demeanor? A ferocious hunter, who loves to kill the most splendid rhinos in the savanna, just to prove his manhood for the world; or a blood thirsty vampire, who would blow his stunning cover away, when he is dehydrated with human blood in the night time; or a soulless plutocrat, who has only his eyes on the items, which are profitable, regardless which consequence he will cause for his posterity. \"Oh, my sweet darling! What happened? \" Amelia looks worried. \"I know you have always been an insecure girl, but, I always thought you are confident about yourself.\" \"Mom, the thing is...\" Josie cannot find an adequate way to express her ambivalent feelings, when she contemplates about Sam and her own future. \"I am scared. There are awfully many things which could go wrong in a relationship, probably already tomorrow. \" \"True, it makes me happy that you have gone through Schopenhauer's view upon life! Always trying to carry a pessimistic attitude and taking cautious preparation is an admirable virtue, which few modern people would like to emulate. Nevertheless, Josie, there are many fabulous love traps in a relationship as well, especially when Sam has metamorphosed to his ordinary self.\" Andrea continues with her dreaming voice, whilst looking through the menu. \"Having someone by your side in a cold, grey morning, when the rains strikes against your window, is a cosy feeling. \" \"If the only attachment a husband has for me is the raw carnal desire, I would rather like to live alone. This is not my idea of a relationship. I am not looking for a person to just have fun with. I want to experience the epic love story, in which the craving and jealousy are not only two painful contradictions, rather the basic elements which infuriating the passion, as well as the mutual admiration.\" Josie looks away with tears rolling in her eyes. \"I want to believe that the tenet of my life is not only about a biological process, to eat, sleep and to copulate. When I close my eyes in the evening time, with a husband beside me, I want to be loved for who I have transformed myself into, through our relationship, love and support from my family and friends, also my working experience. When he holds me in his arms, I hope both of us are certain that we will be holding each other like that for the rest of our life, hopefully the whole way into the otherworld, after we have passed away.\" Amelia gives Josie's hand an affectionate squeeze. \"The mutual trust is the most paramount foundation of a worthy relationship. You need to set your bar high, my darling. I feel content that you are not in any hurry in your relationship. I have always known that you are a smart mademoiselle.\" Josie continues. \"I have not returned any of Sam's message or phone call the last three days. I just cannot collect my strength, when thinking about the stories the women in that meeting shared with the group. Sam keeps calling me, two or three times a day. In one of his messages, he expresses his concern in a rather emotional wording.\" \"I wish Hilda is still alive! She would love hearing your words.\" Andrea says. \"She loved to lecture us about the importance of finding a companion, when selecting a suitable husband. I would kill myself instantly, if my husband only discussing about my outfit, my body or my makeup, other other worldly activities, in our conversations!\" Both Amelia and Andrea continue to express how pleased they are to see how serious Josie is, regarding both her career and her love life. Although the feeling of loneliness and alienation has followed her through her school years, these horrible experience also shaped her in a positive way. Today her tenacious and thoughtful personality shines through unapologetically. It is hardly possible that she would allow any mysterious happenings which occur in life from time to time to perturbate her plans, which she would like to actualize with a good work ethic and a strong conviction, that anything is possible. With a reluctant voice, Andrea admits: \"Darling Josie, regardless how embarrassing it is to confess this, but you are much more mature now that I was, at the age of 25. Sam is a lucky man, if he understands what an amazing butterfly you are!\"[Chapter 8] Sam's last meeting is scheduled at four o'clock on Friday afternoon. Sam is not sure if he will be able to see Josie this evening. Once again, he looks at his telephone. He realises that Josie has not replied anything back in three days. Is it really suitable to send one more message to her? Sam does not like to think that Josie has a change of heart already, two weeks after their grand first kiss, in front of everyone they know. Sam is happy that he is going to work with the newly developed online education program, a very flexible course, which allows more people to work and study at the same time. This is a very positive development of his career; however, he is two hours away from Josie, the most brilliant lady he has ever met yet. She is pretty and innocent, when she smiles, her complexion is as lovely and unfathomable as Flora's tender facial expression in Botticelli's La Primavera; she is also the only person, who could recognize every quotation he picks up from any transcendentalists' writings at once; Moreover, she understands instantly the intricate relation between the quotations and his idea when discussing a certain topic in any casual conversation. He takes out Josie's photo, which he cut out from the Yearbook, and kisses her face affectionately. Sam dials Josie's telephone number again, whilst murmuring for himself: \"Josie-cosy, Oh Sweet apple pie with strawberry frosting, please answer your cell phone! If I have done something wrong, please let me know. Do not neglect me, like this, please!\" \"Hi, Sam, this is Anita speaking. Josie is not feeling very good lately.\" Anita answers with a sweet voice. \"I know she has been through a minor personal crisis lately.\" \"What happened? Is someone from her family...Oh, is she alright, herself, Rob or her parents?\" Sam becomes alert instantly. \"No, not at all. It is about her latest story. She has met a few unhappily married ladies. Josie is an artist, who is very sensitive in every possible aspect. She probably just needs some space to collect herself. Our Josie is as brave as the Iron lady, at the same time, her heart is as fragile as Empress Alix of Russia. Sometimes, she just needs to take a refuge in her Walden bubble for a while.\" Sam knows how supportive Anita has always been. She has become the feisty big sister, Josie never had in her family. \"I just hope she does not have a change of heart.\" Sam replies with a sad voice. \"Poor Sam! I know Josie is crazily in love with you. You are her Mark Darcy. Believe or not, she actually talked about how much she would like to travel with you to a tiny Polish town, called Zamosc in the future. Also a visit to Bialowieski national park, enjoying the sight of the European bison in their native environment. If you do not hustle anything now, and let her settle her emotional ups and downs in her own speed, everything will be alright at the end.\" Anita reassures him. \"Thank you Anita. I just hate to think that I will let her slip away one more time. I will probably give her a call on Sunday, if she would like to talk with me.\" Sam murmurs. \"Oh, Sam. I will talk with her. She has been a very effective copy editor, in the last three days. She is a smart girl, she knows that she can not hide herself from everything forever. Take care of yourself, Sam. Have a good weekend!\" Anita says with a kind of voice. On his way down to Chicago, Sam keeps thinking about Josie's reaction. When reaching Josie's building block, he pulls his vehicle into a parking lot. Josie's window is lighted up. He rings the entry phone hesitantly. \"Hi, who are you?\" Josie answers after a few seconds. \"This is, this is Sam.\" Sam murmurs. \"I just want to know if it is too late to visit you, Josie-Cosy? I miss you, I know you are my Catherine Morland.\" There is no response for a while. \"What happened? Are you there, Josie, my darling?\" Sam is in a great panik. A few minutes later, Josie appears behind the wooden door, wearing the same white long sleeves T shirt she had, when they met each other in the classroom in South Glen. She is in tears. \"You are my Henry Tilney!\" Josie embraces Sam with open arms. \"You still remember that my favorite Austen romance is Northanger Abbey! Thank you for coming here tonight! Would you like to come up for a cup of tea?\" She gives him a kiss on his lips. What an overwhelming sensation. As her lips touches his, the electric current streams through his entire body, as if he were a superconductor. \"I love to be your Henry Tilney, nevertheless I do not own a fancy Gothic castle, or a horse drawn carriage, my sweet Kitty!\" He gives her a tender kiss on her cheek. \"The last three days have been the longest three days of my life! I miss you terribly, darling Josie-Cosy!\" On their way up, Josie holds his hand tightly, as if this is their last moment together. Sam want to grab every second he has with Josie. The warmth of her hand and the scent of her body is the only thing that could comfort his wearisome heart. Before they enter her apartment, Josie says with a quiet voice: \"You are not only my Henry, you are so much more. When I talk with you, words from you are the brightest beacon in the night. When I touch you, all the worldly troublesome events just vanish into the oblivion at once. But, I am so afraid this is the highest peak of our relationship.\" How to comfort this smart lady, who is standing in front of him? Sam searches through his head, without finding any clue. Any overused cliché would only undermine his position as her prince charming with 100% likelihood. After years of studying and teaching the greatest literature in the world, he knows too well how to lose a girl, by applying the conventional thinking pattern when talking with a special girl. In a moment like this, he could only use his heart to take in every word she articulates, in order to investigate what her real fear is. He cannot assure her that he will always be in love with her or their relationship is likely to be better and better with everyday it goes, by giving her a speech with the most popular words, which every glossy magazine is using, when describing a Cinderella like romance. But he does not want to lose her or make her feel insecure about his intention with this relationship. When sitting together in a white couch, which is surrounded with a huge pile of well embroidered pillows, Sam has his arm around her shoulder. He is more convinced than ever that Josie does not need any protection from a guy, she is a self-reliant warrior queen. With a guttural voice, he says: \"So, my sweet Josie-cosy! I just want to know what happened in your life lately. I never thought the feeling of wanting someone could be so painful.\" He kisses her gently. \"I… I know it is stupid to speculate too much, but I just hope you do not have a change of heart.\" Josie looks at him with both eyes wide open. \"I… I keep listening to an Irish boy band song, it called Father and Son, very often. After talking with the women in Madison, I begin to realize how naïvity and too much unrealistic romantic expectations, with a capital R, could destroy one's life. What will happen to us, if we still will be a couple, ten years from now? Do you really think my thoughts upon literature or art will still matter to you? Do you think the main reason that keeps our relationship going would be our daily routines and the children's activity schedules; as we both keep compromising to each other and the rest of the world, at last, we hardly recognize the meaning of living a life together? One day, we both would arrive to a dismal conclusion that life is just a battle, whilst none of us understands why we still sleep in the same bed night after night. What you see in me, reduces to my genitalia. What I expect from you is only a new wave of broken promises.\" How to reply a speech like this? In the past, he has never met any lady, who challenges him like Josie does. After a while, Sam replies: \"I hope it will never happen to us, but I cannot give you any prophecy. I am not a Gaelic druid. What I can give you today, is a promise that I will always be honest with you.\" He gives her a bear hug, whilst inhaling the scent of her hair with a devour appetite. \"Min fair princess, my experience of life is not by any means impressive. School is a relatively simple environment. Nevertheless I have seen how broken families destroy teenagers in the most horrendous ways. Also, how absent parents corrupt their children's idea of what is a righteous action in the grown-up worlds.\" He stops for a second to give her one more kiss on her lips. \"What I see in you is a passionate soul, an urge to defy the prevailing social consensus, by revealing how life could be lived, if we are open to other options. Being with you here and now, is more exciting than following Jules Verne, on his journey up to the Moon and back again. My lovely Josie-Cozy, I love everything about you. You are amazing!\" Sam is surprised that he have just articulated those magical words without any anxiety or reservation, as if it were the most natural feelings he has always carried with him. Josie looks startled and confused at the same time. Josie looks up and replies : \"You talk so well, My Samuel Nicholas.\" One signal from her telephone interrupts their conversation. Josie does not recognize the telephone number. The message contains only two sentence. 'Josie, I would like to talk with you now, if you have time! My world is falling apart!'[Chapter 9] Josie picks up the telephone and calls back at once. A sobbing voice on the other end answers before the first signal has gone through:\"Hi Josie, this is Audrey. Do you remember me from our last meeting. I really need someone to talk with, but I am too embarrassed to tell my friends about Kian's latest bomb.\" Could this really be that disparaging Audrey from the Madison meeting? Josie can not untangle why she calls her in a late Friday evening. Her voice is really sad. She asks: \"Audrey, yes I remember you well. How did you get my telephone number? Did we exchange our contact information? What has happened?\" Sam gives her bewildered look and asks: \"What happened? \" Josie turns up the speakerphone. Audrey replies: \"I found your telephone number from the forum. I have to talk with someone. Most women in our meeting are more or less my personal friends now. If one of them knows what happened, we will only be talking about Kian on our next meeting.\" \"Audrey, please calm down a little. Who is Kian? Is he your cynical Irish husband, that musician?\" Josie organises what Audrey mentioned in their last meeting in her head. \"Has he done something really bad this time? What happened? I promise, I will not mention anything to anyone, unless you ask me to do it. \" \"Kian is my stay-at-home husband. Today, our nanny dropped a bomb on our dinner table.\" \"Is she pregnant? Is Kian the father?\" Josie sounds nervous. She hopes this is not the case, for Audrey's sake. \"No, no one is pregnant, at least, not yet. When her little sister visited her at our house, Kian had intercourse with her a number of times in my bedroom. This girl is only 14 years old.\" Audrey screams desperately. Sam take over the telephone from Josie and says to Josie: \"Let me. You look terrified. I have handled sadly similar problems earlier. \" After he clears his throat lightly, he does his best to talk in a normal voice: \"Audrey, this is Sam. I have a few questions for you. Are you sure your husband really has done all the nasty things, which your nanny claimed? Is there any misunderstanding? What are they going to do, the parents and the young girl?\" \"Hello Sam. You must be Josie's husband, right? The thing is, that teenager and her parents have already visited both the police station and the hospital. On her body, they have detect both saliva and the remnant of other biological issue. His sperm has been collected from both her stomach and her genitalia.\" Audrey replies with a desperate voice. \"He blames me for everything. If I could get pregnant, he would never touch any other ladies, according to him.\" Josie holds Sam's arm tightly. What a horrible moment this is. How could Sam handle such a predicament so confidently? He gives her a kiss on her forehead, before continuing talking with Audrey: \"Where is Kian? Do you have anyone around you? Where is your Nanny? \" Audrey speaks in a delusional voice: \"Kian has drifted away, with my car. I have no idea where he will be. He has a pile of cash with him, which he took from my bag. It would be difficult to track him down by checking my bank account.\" Something is not right in her narrative. Sam asks with a confident voice: \" If your nanny is sure that they have visited the police station, it does not sound right to me that she would break the news to you like this. Why did the police officer never come to your house to arrest Kian? Did they really have all the solid evidence they claim they have? Where is the nanny now?\" From the speakerphone, Josie hears that Audrey's voice has relaxed somehow. She says \"I see your point. The nanny has gone angrily. I have been all by myself.\" Sam continues: \"Please collect yourself as much as you can. It is not the end of the story. Many things could happen in the near future. I think you need to find yourself a very good lawyer as soon as possible. I also think you need to talk with a professional psychologist. We can listen to you, but we can not help you to overcome such horrible traumatic feelings that would probably follow you around for a long time in the future. I know it is hard. But ...\" Audrey continues with her crying voice: \"I know, I know. Okay, I will not take more time of your Friday evening. Everything is probably not as horrible as I thought.\" Josie replies warmly: \"Audrey, please keep us posted. It is not easy to be alone, when a nanny, who takes care of your child, delivers such a news. It is hard, when you realize that all your trust to the one, whom you are in love with, has gone. Good night! Please take care of yourself!\" When Josie hangs up the telephone, she collapses at once. It is unthinkable that such a horrible story actually occurs in reality. \"Why did this Kian fellow do such a thing, to his wife? She is a pretty and smart lady! I cannot think of one good reason for a man in his age, to commit such a horrible crime.\" She tries to find an answer, which she could believe in, in Sam's eyes. \"I hate to think that Kian did everything deliberately, in order to hurt Audrey. I know I know nothing about this lad, other than he is a good singer who loves singing Irish songs. Most of all...\" She looks away for a second, to collect herself, whilst Sam gives her a nice kiss on her lips. \"I would like to know why she remains in that marriage, which breaks her down, Sam.\" \"Oh, my lovely polar bear, my sweet Josie-Cosy, I can imagine how overwhelmed you are at this moment. I am glad that I paid a visit to you today, although I was not sure if this is an adequate decision. I just wish...\" Sam caresses her cheeks with his fingers affectionately for a second. \"It is painful to unveil the fancy parcel of a broken family. All the filthy realities would not leave you unconcerned. I remember so well how I felt, when the school informed me how one of the smartest kids in my English class, who did well in school, hurt herself, by cutting both of her legs with her father's razor blade in solitude. She was only 16 years old.\" \"What? I know such things happen. But I have never met someone who actually does such terrible things to themselves.\" Josie looks at the clock and says: \"Oh, it is eleven o'clock already! What a night!\" Josie does want this evening to end already, not now. She enjoys being so close to her Samuel Nicholas, the Prince Charming she thought she has to abandon before he turns to ghostlike evil. She likes the scent of his aftershave and the soothing sound of his sweet talking voice. \"Are you tired, my sweet chocolate cupcake? I will sleep in my old room at my parents' house this evening. It is only 25 minutes drive away from here. Please give me a call, if you need me.\" He gives her a kiss again, before standing up. \"Please promise me one thing!\" \"What Sam?\" Josie replies. \"We know very little about Audrey and her family. At this moment, we can only pray for her. I know how much you enjoy reading Alice Munro's dramatic depictions of various family tragedies. Please read a cheerful book this evening! If you want, I can bring my old Donald Duck alba with me tomorrow, if you would like to see me tomorrow.\" \"You are such a gentleman!\" Josie is not ready to let Sam leave. At the same time, she knows that she has no energy for any cuddling or snuggling. Audrey's sobbing voice keeps resonating in her head and distracts her from enjoying her time with Sam. With a tired voice she makes an attempt to keep him staying a few minutes extra: \"Oh, Sam, it is cold outside. Don't you want to have a cup of tea, before going? I have a few piece of small chocolate cookies which my mother baked for me.\" Sam replies with a mischievous voice: \"A cup of tea would be nice. For your information, neither my sister, nor my brother will be searching for me this evening.\"[Chapter 10] Sam follows Josie to her kitchen, as she preparing two cups of tea, with a small kettle. The room is cosily lighted up with an Art Deco styled ceiling lamp. Upon her oak shelf, there are ten small tin-cans, with cute German nutcracker prints. On the bottom, there are small paper stickers, with the name of each tea leaves. From her upper kitchen cabinet, she takes out two large stoneware cups. \"Sam, I hope you like the tea from Darjeeling district in India. It has always been my favorite flavour. When studying for my finals in Northwestern, I could consume up to fifteen large cups a day.\" Josie talks in her sweet voice. \"Also a huge pile of chocolate cakes. I love sweet things, especially when I am unhappy. The creamy taste of the chocolate ice cream is often my best friend, when everything goes wrong at the same time.\" The forlornness in her eyes goads him to reassess who this girl is. Although she is an extremely ambitious, talented journalist, who is not afraid of any worldly challenge, there is clearly a childlike honesty, which shines through her sophisticated appearance, in a moment like this. There are so many layers in her personality. Some of which are smoothly related to each in the conventional way; others follow their own set of logical chains, which is still excessively difficult for Sam to grasp. This is precisely the most imperative reason why Sam finds this lady very intriguing to be with. \"Oh, my graceful daffodil, Darjeeling is a perfect choice. I would be lying to you, if I say that I could bring your smile back again, no matter I badly I hope I could, by being here with you. The truth is, I am also deeply affected by Audrey's misery.\" The steam of the newly brewed Darjeeling tea brings him back to a distant past, when he worked with a group of newly emigrated teenagers. As a newly graduated teacher, he was eager to prove his capability, to prove for himself that he was a accountable leader. Many of the students had just escaped from the war zones. Many insignificant everyday details could easily trigger out a chain of whimsical reactions. It took a long time, before he could accept the dismal reality that he could not change the world in any radial fashion. What he could do be nice, regardless how they irritated him with their irrational reactions. During the breaks, he was often extremely distraught. His mentor, Abigale often treated him with the Indian brew, especially when he was frustrated over his own inability to teach. He would love tell her his old memories in the future. Right now, he only wants to be a good listener. With a dreaming voice, he says: \"I like the scent of the tea. Please be honest with me, sweet Josie-Cosy! Have you been sleeping well lately? \" \"Not really. I have been thinking my whole life about the wonderful feeling of having a boyfriend, also the moment of entering the nuptial in a European Gothic church. Somehow, I am not certain what I could expect from a relationship, from you! The other day, Anita from the office asked me how I felt about having a guy for the first time in my life. I could not give her an answer. I am not certain if I could address you as my boyfriend yet. I am also insecure if you are as infatuated in me as I am in you.\" Josie answers with a quiet voice. \"I hope I am your guy! I have never met anyone like you before, my brilliant Kitty. If you would allow me to be your Henry Tilney, I would be extremely proud to address you as my dearest, the queen of my heart.\" Sam gives her a kiss, whilst contemplating about how to explain his fervent admiration towards her, without pushing her away from him? also, how to express his genuine fascination of her unique personality, in order to ensure her that his feeling is not an impetuous reaction? In front her, he is nervous, as if she is his last hope of living a good life. When she is in such a dismal mood, he just want to escape with her, far away from here and now. He wraps his arm around her and murmurs: \"You are such a brave journalist! Right now, I really wish we can take our bags with us and fly over the Slovakia, to embark upon a visceral hiking journey upon the most scenic peaks around a small town, called Poprad.\" With an exaggerated impish voice he continues: \"And never come back!\" A smile breaks out of Josie's face. \"Let's us book a ticket, now! A one way ticket from here to Krakow. From there, we can take a overnight train to Slovakia, to enjoy a wonderful lifelong hiking vacation on the top of the world. You do have a teacher's certificate. Over there, you can provide a decent life for me, by teaching English. I can enjoy the view from our rustic mountain cottage everyday! The idea of a mundane activity would be a stroll upon the snow capped peak, or a glass of fine Slovakian white wine with a couple of big chunks of mature goat cheese. I am ready!\" Before Josie finishes her last word, a new signal from her telephone brings them down from the sagacious Carpathian peaks to Josie's kitchen in Chicago. Again, there is a new message from Audrey. 'Kian is seriously injured. I really do not want to see him right now.' Josie looks like a wreck and asks Sam in a petrified voice: \"Did she mentioned whether her children are with her this evening? The nanny has gone. She is probably drank. Where are her children?\" Sam capps her face in his hands and says: \"It does not sounds good. I never asked her this vital question. It is such a difficult thing to ask, when she is that bitter. Do you want to call her? Do you know any other people in your group, who might knows her better? It is probably not a good idea to invade too much of her personal space tonight, when she is as vulnerable as she is now.\" What a fantastic girl Josie is! Sam knows precisely why so many people love to reveal their most personal thoughts to her, without any reservation. When she looks at him, with her beautiful eyes, he feels that she likes him for a very special reason wholeheartedly, as if the entire universe would agree with her about why all his actions, regard the consequences in the long terms, are justified by the special circumstances, in which he cannot escape from. Back in South Glen, he has exposed so much more of his personal life than he should, as a teacher. He follows her to the couch again, carrying the teacups in his hands. \"I think I want to call her, although a trip to high Tatra sounds much more fantastic. As a journalist, I am curious about how her family constellation triggers her to make various strange decisions though the adoption process. Also, how her infatuation turned to such a bitter resentment, whilst the attachment is still very strong between them. As a friend, I wish she could survive this a calamity.\" She leans towards Sam. \"Love is such a whimsical thing. Sometimes it brings out the best in you, sometimes it turns you to someone, whom you hardly recognize yourself.\" Half an hour later, she dials Audrey's telephone number with her cell phone. This time, a male voice answers the telephone on the other end: \"This is Audrey McShea's telephone, this is officer Huntington.\" Sam could assess from her facial expression that Josie is extremely confused. She talks in a scared voice: \"I am Josie Geller, Audrey's friend from Chicago. I just received a message from her. I hope she is alright. Can I talk to her.\" That officer replies with a solemn tone: \"Mrs McShea is under an investigation at this moment. I cannot pass the telephone to her right now. However, I will tell her that you have called. Good night!\"[Chapter 11] Josie puts down the telephone with trembling fingers. The police officer's words put her head spinning with a fast speed. Could Audrey, the most lackadaisical person in that meeting, really be in the custody of the police now? What did she do to Kian or the teenage girl? Is that nanny in any danger? A dramatic revenge could be the most sweet reward, when you are out of your mind, especially when jealousy and hostility are actively involved. Sam uses both of his hands to massage her shoulders, whilst kissing her forehead softheartedly. It does not feel good at all. She does not want to be touched by either him or anyone else, as if any tenderness is only a disguise danger, which would evolve to a life changing calamity at any moment. She stands up suddenly and walks briskly towards the bathroom with tears in her eyes. Thereafter she shuts the door angrily. The darkness in the bathroom and the familiar scent of her soap gives her a sense of peace in her mind. \"Sweetheart, I know you are in a terrible shock! Please, please believe me, this is not the end of the story.\" Sam asks in a pensive voice on the other side of the bathroom door. \"Josie, do you want to be alone? If you do, I really understand. But please, please keep your telephone line open. I am worried.\" Josie opens the bathroom door and asks in an angry voice: \"Do you think Audrey has lied to me about it all? Who is Kian? Why did a police officer answer her cell phone? I do not understand. Nothing makes any sense to me.\" She sobs vehemently, without being able to look at Sam in the eyes. She notices that Sam tries to hold her hands in his. By some strange reason, she only wants to escape from this evening, from him. She wonders whether the men, or the relationships in general is the most repugnant element which corrupts a woman's happiness. With a furious voice she shouts out: \"I am done with this assignment and men in general. Someone else needs to work as a reporter. Not me, my rightful position is a brilliant copy editor, the best one Gus got in his stab.\" Sam gives her a kiss on one of her hand: \"Oh, sweet Josie-cosy, my charming panda-bear. You will create an amazing story, which will touch many people's heart, I know you will. You are such a caring person, a fantastic observer. I have corrected a pile of your brilliant essays, I know your special ability to penetrate through a rough surface, finding things, which nobody else would be able to identify, by analyzing what you have observed independently. Let us calm down a little for a moment.\" He looks at her with an amicable smile. \"If I were you, I would probably like to check her profile one more time on that internet forum, also other members' contact information, tomorrow. Let me tuck you in bed now, before driving to my parents' house.\" \"Please don't drive away tonight!\" Josie bursts out. \"Please Sam! Please take up your travel bag from your Chrysler.\" She embraces him passionately. The thought of being away from him is unbearably agonizing. She had faced many intimidating moments all by herself a number of times in her life, from Billy's cruel joke to her college professor's harsh and unfair comments on her Master thesis. Never one time, she had someone who has shown such a commitment to help her go through such terrible episodes. \"I have a bunch of new toothbrushes. I will treat you with a large portion of scrambled egg, with lightly smoked salmon and fresh green herb for breakfast tomorrow morning. I just cooked three huge bottles of rhubarb and strawberry lemonade, with my grandmother's fabulous Swedish recipe, also homemade rye bread.\" She puts her hands upon his upper arms. Sam smiles back and asks with a teasing voice: \"If I say no, would you write a new article on Chicago Sun Time's special edition and propose a slumber party in the same stadium next week? I can bring my super fancy Spider man PJ to impress the audience, also my soft Super Mario towel, if you want to, my fancy gingerbread lady.\" He pulls a strand of her hair behind her ear with his fingers softly. Josie looks down shyly and replies: \"Then I will need to buy a huge amount of eggs. I am not sure my storage room is sufficiently big.\" She looks at him and wonders how he has just transformed herself from a panicked luniac to a composed person. On top of this, she has just invited him to spend his first night with her in her bed. The bed, which she has been sleeping upon since she was ten years old. Their first night together does not occur as a conventional romantic fairytale. There is no candle light, romantic pop songs in the background or red roses scattered everywhere. What she has is her Sam, who lies beside her in his old College team T-shirt and a pair of grey cotton boxershorts, looking at her with his dazzlingly gorgeous eyes. She is too shy to touch his beefy legs or arms, but she loves the sensation of being so close to him. She puts her hand on his hand and gives him a kiss on his lips, whilst continuing picturing what could have happened in Audrey's life. \"Sam, it is so horrible to think that Audrey is locked behind the bars now, with a group of drunken and eerie criminals.\" \"Oh, my beguiling honeysuckle rose, please try to get some sleep. I will use all my secret tools which I have stored in my brain, helping you finding out who Audrey is, probably also how Kian is tomorrow.\" He gives her a kiss on her forehead och holds her waist with his hand.[Chapter 12] Lying next to his beautiful virgin in her cotton pyjama and listening to her concern about Audrey in an agitated voice, is by all means a painful experience. Sam wants to scream the brain out of himself here and now, because this narrative brings back the memories from him darkest moment, when being confronted by his pretty cheerleader girlfriend, Philippa Morries in college. After being the perfect couple for around a year, Sam met an exchange student, Sansitta, from Singapore, who has an Asian mother and an Indian father, in his Australian literature class. It was a small class. After a few weeks, everyone talked with each other like old friends, including their professor, Mr Doyle. At the end of the course, he and Sansitta were paired up, writing their final essay together, regarding how the foreign authors' described the unique landscape of the Australian inner core in their travel writings. Sam was pleased. Sansitta was a feisty girl, who enjoyed dancing and hiking. Academically, she was one of the most hardworking people he had met, who often contributing exceptionally original thoughts in each seminar. Already at that moment, Sam had experienced how a smart girl could spellbind his undivided attention with their fantastic analyses of any mundane object and also eccentric thoughts upon the big issues, ranging from the latest President election to the idea of piety in modern time. When discussing various narratives of Alice Spring, Sansitta showed a strong engagement, which was both extremely intimidating and inspiring. Every time he came up with a good idea, Sansitta could often contra him with a much more outstanding thought a few seconds later. One afternoon, when they read through their script together in the library, he gave her a kiss on her soft lips. She enjoyed being kissed by him and gave him a bright smile afterwards. Seconds after, he saw two angry eyes from a distance, staring at him as if he were the common enemy of the entire nation. It was Philippa. She saw it all. With a fast pace, she walked away. He saw clearly how she sobbed. When coming back to his apartment, Philippa was waiting for him outside. With an angry voice she delivered the most resentful speech he ever listened. \"Why Sansitta? Why her? Are you in love with her? How could you do that to me, in front of everyone, who knows me? I can never standing in the middle of the stadium, cheering the teams up again. Now, I am just a joke for everyone, including myself. Neither the title as a prom queen or victory from any beauty pageant competition can erase the shame I felt today. Why her? She is just an insignificant loser from the other side of the planet. I hate you!\" Sam did not know how to reply. Pippa was one the prettiest girls in his university, a girl, whom many guys would love to have a date with. Was he in love her. He thought he was. When admiring her dazzling brown eyes and sexy body, he often felt that he was on top of the world. Pippa was a very smart and independent girl, who studied software engineering and applied maths. Everyone he met talked about what a lucky guy he was. What was missing in that relationship? Why did he kiss Sansitta? He hated himself for doing that. Less than two days ago, Phillippa gave him a patchwork quilt, which she made by herself, as his birthday present. With a sad voice he said: \"Listen, Pippa. I am sorry. I have no idea what happened to me. I know I hurt you. I know our relationship is ending at this moment. But please believe me, I am really, really sorry.\" \" How can I? Are you in love with her, that brilliant Asian talent?\" Phillippa asks in a peachy voice. \"Have you been in bed with her?\" \" Pippa, I am so sorry. I really am very sorry for every mistake I made. Would you like to come in for a minute? I think we need to talk.\" Sam opened the door, whilst Phillippa screamed vehemently and gave him a bag of his personal things: \"Forget about it. I do not want to see you ever again. The stinky odour of your body in that apartment only reminds me what a great charlatan you are. I wish I have the legendary Celtic sorcery which you often talk about, to hurt you the same way you hurt me today in the library. Good eye, Samuel Coulson and thank you for being the most horrible ghost in my life. I hate you! And I always will hate you!\" She left, without looking back a single time. When opening that bag, there is a broken frame, with a passage of a romantic poem by EE Cummings, which he gave her as her valentine's day present. He knew that she would never come back again, ever. With a soothing voice Sam says:\"My sensationally stunning black tulip, everyone makes mistake, including Kian or me. I know you are eager to know what hides behind the close curtains, however we do not even know where Audrey or Kian are now.\" Josie nodes reluctantly. He wraps his hand around her body gently, whilst thinking how lucky he is. Her eagerness spurs him to redefine the meaning of his life; her adventurous nature gives him a new reason to dream, to revisit what he conjured up what a fantastic life should be in his childhood; her tenacity influences him to finding new, bold goals of life. Soon he falls into a deep sleep, feeling happy, until flash of the toalett waked him up, around one o'clock. Josie's laptop is wide open, showing the website of forum of Josie's meeting for the unhappy adopting moms. Audrey's profile shows that her name is Audrey Washington, not McShea; her occupation is a business owner. Josie asks: \"Did I wake you up, Sam?\" \"Not really. It is just so cold in bed, when you are not here with me, my innocent edelweise.\" Sam smiles back. \"Can't you sleep, Josie - Cosy? Did I take too much space in bed?\" \"No, I cannot stop thinking about Audrey. She is a mysterious woman. According to her profile, she has two adoptive children, a Romanian girl and a korean boy. They reside in a nice wooden house outside Madison. When I try to search for her information in the internet, there are a number of Audrey Washington, nevertheless only five Audrey McShea in Madison.\" What a fantastic work ethic Josie has always displayed. He loves the fact that she shows such a fantastic dedication to her current assignment and a great hunger for new experience of life. Her approach is not confined by the best selling popular themes, for instance, the irresponsible deeds behind each infidelity story, or the wilde desire that drives a decent person to commit the most horrible crime, rather the complex and capricious nature of the human society, the group pressure that heats up the vulnerable inner child, thereafter encouraging a responsible adult to violate against their own convictions in the most inadequate way. Her Gordie Howe helmet is her innocent nature, her uncorrupted heart. When she reaches out to the world, with her childlike curiosity, she often finds how a number of insignificant details are interconnected together, forming a tangible pattern, which drives a certain group of people to act in the way they do, as if she were a very experienced anthropologist. He holds her shoulders in his hands, hoping that he would calm her nerves down and liberate herself from thinking that she is responsible for Audrey's unfortunate experience. Sam speaks with an enthusiastic voice, whilst walking towards Josie's desk: \"My marvelous bride! I see you cannot sleep. Let us work together! We can probably find more clues, by exchanging ideas with each other! I never thought working could be such a fun experience! You are amazing, Josie-Cosy.\" \"I would love doing that! Thank you for being the best guy in the entire universe, Sam! I am really happy that you stayed with me this evening.\" She gives him a kiss. \"Thank you for showing such a massive understanding.\" \"Oh, my sweet peach bloom, it was a long time ago, since someone have displayed such a massive commitment for any task, leisure or professional.\" He smiles back. \"If you continue working like this, I think I need to buy a bulletproof jacket and a good helmet, when you will work as a correspondence reporter in Iraq or Balkan in the near future.\" \"Do you really believe in me that much, my Samuel Nicholas?\" She asks with tears rolling in her eyes again. \"You are such a wonderful partner!\" \"I love the fact that you call me your Samuel Nicholas! You have everything it takes to be the most fantastic journalist in the world, my valiant Martha Gellhorn. Nevertheless, I will never treat you as terrible as Hemingway did to Martha, I would rather like to be your Ferdinand, your most loyal companion. I am extremely infatuated in you, my sweet princess of Castile.\" The internet search engine is a fantastic tool. To commence with, Sam types in four names together, Kian, Audrey, McShea and Washington, hoping they would find a piece of information which includes all of them. There are altogether five hundred thousand results, from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Australia, United States, Canada and many more, including a number of pornographic sites. When moving over to the advanced search, by pointing down Madison, Wisconsin, the number of result drops down to two hundred. Thereafter, Sam remembers that Kian is an ancient Gaelic name, which appears in many mythologies, nevertheless the first letter is a C, instead of a K. During their next attempt, the four names are Cian, Audrey, McShea and Washington, so on and so forth. When the first morning light arrives outside their window, it is clear that they have boxed in a likely result in Madison. According to a registration website, there is a popular Irish pub in a small town outside Madison. Three groups of Irish musicians often play in this pub during the weekend. One of which is a cover band. Their repertoire is very impressive, from the old Beatle and Carpenters songs to modern boyband music. Their lead singer is a good looking redhead in his early thirties and his name is Kian McShea. He plays piano and sings. There is an Audrey, who uses Washington as her surname on the same website, under the column, 'Contact Information'. Sam is happy that they have found so much information after a few hours of searching, it also gives him one good reason to propose a nice sleep over in Wisconsin. Although they both know that Josie is not ready for the wild jungle monkey dance yet, nevertheless to be close to her, inhaling the scent of her body and feeling the warmth of her body through her cute cotton pyjama, all night long, is the best reward he could wish for at this moment. \"My brilliant Kitty Morland, would you like to spend next weekend with me in Milwaukee? We could drive to Madison, visiting this pub, as a couple. I can help you to disguise yourself, probably in a dazzling medieval dress, just like Rosaline.\" Sam asks. \"It would be nice to have a meal with you in that pub. I have always enjoyed eating the Irish sausage sandwich. Of course I will never say no to a cold KilKenny.\" \"Oh, Mr Tilney, my handsome Henry. I will be happy to have a meal with you! Are you really ready to show me your secret room in your castle. You know how curious I always have been. I think I want to know every unproud past of your life and your family history.\" \"All my secret are in your possession, my fair lady.\" Sam replies with an elegant old fashioned British accent.[Chapter 13] Josie is tired, especially after staring at the screen for so many hours and searching for Audrey's personal information, nevertheless she is more happy than ever. Sam has just asked her for a sleepover date in his apartment next weekend, just like a movie scene, nevertheless she is the heroine. When they are lying in her bed again, she murmurs: \"I love the feeling of being so close to you, my Prince charming! What do you think we will do, ten years from now? Do you think the possibility is big that we will still cherish our dreams, the goal that defines who we are?\" He caresses her face with both hands and replies with the softest voice: \"You will, without any doubt, my cute koala bear! By the way, I love being your Prince charming! I hope I still will be your Prince Charming, holding your hands every evening and kissing your soft lips good night, my adorable apple tart.\" \"Sam, you are really a champion, regarding creating the cute nicknames. Do you always come up with such adorable nicknames, when dating a lady in the past?\" Josie asks. \"How many do you have in your mental storage room at this moment?\" \"Oh, my flamboyant Persian Princess! I hate to say that you are the first one, whom I often addressing with the cute nicknames, but it is the truth. By some strange reason it does not feel right to call you with your beautiful name, my pretty Summer rainbow, it reminds me too much about the days in South Glen, when I had to push down all the feelings I had for you.\" Sam kisses her arm affectionately. \"You are amazing, my Celtic warrior queen! I am so scared that one day you will find out how many eloquent, handsome gentlemen would compete for your affection, by citing the most marvelous poems or giving you beautiful flowers.\" Josie gives him a kiss on his lips. 'Sam, I love you too.' Josie repeats the same sentence in her heart over and over again. She is too shy to express such an explicit feeling to Sam, despite her entire body is screaming with desire. When she finally slumbers in his arms, despite the strong morning sun shine, she has a bright smile in her lips. When she wakes up again, she is all by herself in her bed. The room is quiet. Her mobile telephone is in the flight mode, showing that she has to charge it soon. Sam's bag is gone. Upon the desk, there is her laptop and a piece of paper, which she used the previous night, when making notes. There are both her own and Sam's writings. Sam has written a number of reflections on the margin, through the evening, which she did not noticed before. In her kitchen, all the dishes are neatly placed in the dishwasher. The black kitchen clock shows that it is eleven o'clock already. \"Sam, where are you?\" She screams with a worrisome voice: \"Are you here?\" There is no reply. Her own voice bounces back towards herself from the surrounding walls. A second later, she realises that Sam's shoes are gone as well. When she looks down from her window, Sam's automobile has vanished from the parking lot. She goes back to her bed anxiously, the scent of the pillows confirms that Sam was here a while ago. Where is he? It cannot be a sweet dream! If it is, she would like to go back to sleep again. She picks up her telephone and dials his number. After one signal, it goes straight to his voice mail. However there is a new text message from Audrey. \"Josie! I am home again, I would like to talk with you.\" She calls her back at once. Audrey answers, whilst walking in a busy street. \" Hi, Josie, thank you for calling me. Officer Huntington told me that you have called me.\" \"Audrey! I, I would like to know who you really are. Are you Audrey Washington or Audrey Moscow? I am not sure I would like to be your friend, if you are constantly lying to me. I was so worried, after talking with that police officer.\" Josie utters in a slightly irritated voice: \"What did you do to be locked behind the bars yesterday?\" Audrey replies calmly: \"Washington is my maiden name, which I still use, when running my restaurant, my father's proud legacy. Last night was really messy. I was never behind the bars, but I was in the police station, answering their questions regarding my regular guests. One of them is a petite drug dealer.\" After a short pause, she continues: \"They thought my place is such kind of regular connection point. I am really scared myself.\" \"Oh, I see. I hope you are alright.\" Josie is shocked. \"I did not know how to think, when talking with the police officer. Did you hear anything from Kian? Is he alright?\" \"Kian has, has passed away.\" The sobbing voice, together with the sound of siren from the other end makes Josie feel dizzy. She has to sit down, because she has lost her body balance instantly. A few seconds later, the telephone signal from Audrey also vanishes by itself. What has just happened? When looking up on the ceiling, the white surface keeps rotating around as if the entire building were floating in the air. The hopeless loneliness besieges her mental world with an imaginative fortress. Suddenly the doorbell rings. Josie answers in a frighten voice: \"Yes, this is Josie! \" \"Good morning, my orange rising morning sun!\" Sam answers with his bright voice! He has come back again, from the eternal oblivion! \"Do you want some freshly baked bread for your brunch? I have also collect a few piece of my favorite lightly smoke Polish ham and chicken paté from Prus' food factory.\" \"Oh, Sam, I thought you have vanished away!\" Josie replies. \"But, what happened, my brave Ulster queen, I just wanted to drive to the other end of the town, to buy the really good stuff from the Polish shops. We have talked so much about the Polish flavour, last night. I just wanted to treat you with the authentic Polish cold cuts and some delicious pickled gherkin with a subtle taste of lightly roasted caraway seeds, which Nico once loved.\" Sam answered with an assuring voice. \"I have a small present for you too! Can I come up to you, sweet daffodil?\" \"Please come up to me, darling Sam! I need you more than ever!\" Josie pushes the button with her shaking fingers. She goes towards the window, to check if Sam's car is in the parking lot, to make sure she does not make everything up in her head. She would like to embrace Sam, as if she has never been hugged by anyone in her life ever before.[Chapter 14] Unlike a school day, Sam wears a lose, amber coloured hoodie, featuring a bold geometric shape, as if he wants to celebrate Piet Mondrian's legacy. When entering Josie's apartment, he takes out a small brown paper box from his front pocket. \"Josie, my sweet blueberry cupcake, this is for you!\", says he with a quiet, tender voice, whilst giving her a quick kiss on her lips. Inside, there is a beautiful, personalised leather bookmark, with a long, soft tassel. She recognizes the quote instantly: \" I see mysteries and complications wherever I look, and I have never met a steadily logical person.\" As a young girl, she has spent countless of hours, reading Gellhorn's Face of War, dreaming about a future career as a reporter and giving Americans at home a sense of the complexities of the battlefields, various natural calamities or the geopolitical turmoils. Her most prominent incentive of having a career as a journalist is to depict the obvious paradoxes and contradictions, which motivate some people to praise one specific president candidate and lampoon all the others with the most derogatory phrases they could invent; at the same time, the same stories also encourage others to explore ideas, which would eventually replaces the current social conventions, changing the paradigm of moral consensus radically. When looking at this sentence with her tearful eyes, which she has been countless times in her life, she cannot find a single phrase, express her current feelings. Slowly, she looks up again and murmures:\"Darling Sam, how?\" She walks towards her book shelf and takes out her oldest copy of Gellhorn's book, showing him the precise page, upon which, Gellhorn put her sentence.\" Do you have any idea, how often I reread her narratives, when I thought my childhood dreams keeps fading away as time passses by?\" \"Josie-Cosy!\" Sam pats her head with his hand and kisses her forehead gently. \"I have indeed experienced my share of lost, a key to my apartment, in the middle of the coldest month, a favourite book with lots of notes on the margin, a close friend, who turned to my worst rival, most of all my self-confidence, when I needed it the most.\" He sighs discreetly. \" Want to know a secret, I believe the rudeness and the vulgarity are just as important as the most monumental transcendental ideas, which pushed this nation forward. And you, Josie-Cosy, you are the most fantastic person I have ever encountered! Believe me, I have more faith in you, than in myself!\" \"I love you, Samuel Nicholas!\" It comes so naturally, as if she has been saying the same phrase to him her entire life! \"I love you too, sweetheart!\" He replays with a trembling voice. \"I love you, Josie! \" ","Summary":" As Josie and Sam are kissing each other for the first time, in the middle of a fully packed stadium"},{"Movie":"Never Been Kissed","Title":"Snowbound","Author":"RocknVaughn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2683974","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Snowbound, Part 1 By RocknVaughn - - - \"Josie?\" Anita said as she stuck her headnthrough the doorway of Josie's office. \"Huh?\" Her concentration broken, Josienlooked up from her computer screen to find Anita lounging against thendoorjamb. \"Gus wants to see you in his office,\" Anitancontinued. Josie looked back down at the monitor for a moment tonsave her work onto disk and shut down her writing program. \"Didnhe say what for?\" Anita rolled her eyes. \"Yeah. Something aboutnsome wild goose chase story he wants to send you on.\" Josie just shook her head. Anita usually exaggeratednquite a bit when it came to Gus. Theirs had been an on-again,noff-again romantic attachment that was currently in an off phase.n\"Oh, Anita… Surely, it can't be that bad…\" Shensmiled slightly at her friend as she passed her in the doorway andnthen turned and walked toward Gus' office. Lost in thought, Anita stood watching her friendnenter Gus' office and close the door. But Anita was not thinkingnabout Gus at that moment; she was thinking about Josie. Josie had indeed officially earned the title ofn\"reporter\" after the success of her \"Never BeennKissed\" article, which had followed her disastrous undercovernassignment at South Glen South. She was now a contributing Featuresnwriter…and moving quickly up through the ranks. Working on Featuresninstead of hard news/expose type articles allowed her to search outnthe feel-good human-interest stories that she was so talented atnwriting. Yes, Josie Geller had certainly arrived when it camento being a reporter. But sadly, that was the only success that hadncome from her very public bid to win back the affection of SamnCoulson. Josie had put her pride and heart on the line tonstand out on that baseball field, hoping beyond hope that love wouldnprevail and bring him back to her. Only in this case…it hadn't,nbecause Sam never showed up (a fact that made Anita want to kill himnbecause Josie was, in her mind at least, the best thing thatnwould ever happen to that worthless excuse for a man…). Andnalthough Josie put on a brave face for the crowd, Anita knew it hadnemotionally crippled her to be publicly shunned by her \"mysterynteacher.\" For a while, Josie had held out hope that maybe Samnhadn't seen her article, that he'd gone away, or even thatnmaybe he'd gone off to be with his ex- girlfriend Lara… anything but believe that he'd turn her away, even after knowing how she felt.nBut Josie was grasping at straws, and she knew it. The story had beennin newspapers and on television programs throughout the country; itnwas a pretty slim bet that he hadn't heard of the story and read thenarticle. And a few well-placed phone calls quickly determined thatnSam was still living in Chicago…and still teaching at South GlennSouth as if nothing had ever happened…as if Josie had never even existed for him. Once the realization had hit Josie that Sam hadnsimply not loved her or not forgiven her—or both—she hadnretreated back into her shell. Oh, she had kept up the outwardnappearance of beauty that she had learned while at South Glen South,nbut she let no man affect her. Lots of men at the office…and lotsnof men outside the office, for that matter…had asked her out, butnshe politely refused them all. As far as Josie was concerned, she'dngambled on true love, and she'd lost. If she couldn't have that, shenwasn't going to settle for less. Anita wished there was something…anything…shencould do to get her best friend to believe in love—in life—again.nEven Anita knew that Josie needed to put Sam Coulson behind her andnmove on. But seven months after that fateful Prom night whereneverything in Josie's world had fallen apart, that still hadn'tnhappened…and Anita was beginning to think that maybe it nevernwould. Sighing heavily, Anita pushed away from the wall andnheaded back to the stack of classified ads on her desk that shenneeded to finish before five. - - - Josie closed the door to Gus' office and sat down innthe chair before his desk. \"Anita said you needed to see me?\"nshe began. \"Geller…\" Gus jumped right in with hisnno-nonsense style. \"I got a story I want you to work on.\" Josie leaned forward, \"Yes…what is it?\" Gus leaned back in his chair, balancing a pen betweennhis two index fingers. \"I need you to go to Green Bay.\" \"As in Green Bay, Wisconsin ?\" Josienasked incredulously. \"What's in Green Bay that's so important tonour readers here in Chicago?\" \"In Green Bay, so I'm told, a group of agingnparents of mentally handicapped adults have banded together to createna group home for their children.\" Josie waved her hands as if she wanted Gus toncontinue. \"And…? I don't get it…\" \"Look, Geller, this housing system for thenmentally handicapped is in bad shape. There are many more individualsnthat need to be placed in homes than there are places for them. Andnunfortunately for those parents who decided to keep their children atnhome instead of sending them away all those years ago, the people who were institutionalized are given first preference fornavailable housing. The spots available for handicapped children thatnlive at home, therefore, are very slim.\" \" These were people who were sick ofnhaving their children on an endless wait list for non-existentnhousing and decided to do something about it. Instead ofnlobbying for more homes, they took all the steps necessary to createna privately initiated group home that would be approved by the Officenof Housing and Urban Development. And mind you, that is no easy task,neven for state agencies that do it all the time. Each proposal isnlooked at on a case-by-case basis and the only the best are awardednwith grants. It's the first privately created, publicly subsidizedngroup home in the Midwest.\" Josie's attention was instantly whetted, just as Gusnhad known it would be. This kind of story was the kind she craved…tonsee the \"little people\" prevail against great odds. \"Really? That sounds fascinating! When do younwant me to go?\" \"Tomorrow morning,\" Gus answered, notnblinking. \"Tomorrow?\" Josie repeated. \"ThenWednesday before Christmas? Gus, I don't know…\" \"Well, you don't have any choice,\" henreturned, \"because your appointment to meet with them has beennset for noon tomorrow.\" \"Gus…\" \"Geller, it's the perfect story for Christmas.nPeople are feeling more charitable, 'Good will toward men…' and allnthat stuff. Good time to remind people that others are stillnstruggling. Also gives other people in their situation some hope.nThat's the kind of stuff that sells papers,\" Gus explained. Josie rebutted, \"Wait a minute… I thought yountold me that sex scandals, suicides, and bribery sells papers?\" \"For news stories, yes. But for the features …it's the sappy, heartstring stuff,\" henclarified. Josie sighed, and shook her head at him. Gus saw this and smiled, knowing he'd won. \"Thennon Thursday morning, you have a meeting with the local rep for HUD,nwho you can ask about the details of what needed to be done, etc.\" \"Uh, huh…\" \"So I'll want you back in the office on Thursdaynafternoon so that you can push out the story for the Christmas Evenedition. If it's good, it could mean section cover spot for you,\"nGus offered. Josie was impressed, although she knew it wouldnrequire a lot of work…and a lot of driving. \"I assume there'snno budget for a flight there and back?\" \"Not this time a year, there isn't,\" Gusnanswered. \"I don't have much to work with this late in thenfiscal year, so we have to make do. If you drive, I'll pay for thenmileage…and of course, for your accommodations overnight in GreennBay.\" \"Okay, Gus. I'll do it. I admit, I'm notnthrilled you dumped this on me so close to the holidays…but, it does sound like a pretty amazing story…\" Josie got upnfrom her chair. \"I guess I need to go put my finishing touchesnon the update piece about the family burned out of their home twonweeks ago. They received so much help from the first article thatnthey now have at least twice the presents for the kids they startednwith. And that's not including all the replacement clothing, etc…\" \"Fine. Finish it up and get it in here so I cannget it proofed before five…\" Gus intoned, looking back down tonthe piles of paperwork on his desk. Josie rolled her eyes and standing in the doorway,nteased, \"Since when have you had to proofread my stories?\" Gus knew Josie had a point, but he wasn't going admitnit to her. \"Geller?… Out.\" Josie shook her head and smiled, heading back to hernoffice. She had an article to finish. - - - Sam looked at his watch as he stuffed his last pairnof sweatpants into his large black hockey equipment bag (which fornnow was doubling as a suitcase…). It said 2:21pm. School had letnout for the Christmas break at noon and he was raring to get on thenroad. Since it was only Wednesday, he was hoping to beat the majoritynof holiday travelers. Zipping up the bag, he turned his head as thentelephone started to ring. Crossing the room, he picked up thenhandset from the bedside table. \"Hello?\" he answered. \"Sam, honey…It's Mom.\" Sam sighed, rolling his eyes. \"Hi, Mom…again.\" \"I'm sorry, dear, but…are you really sure you don't want to spend Christmas with us here? I just don'tnlike the idea of you being all alone up at that cabin like this…\"nSarah Coulson asked worriedly. \"Mom…thank you, but I'm sure. I'm…just notnin the mood for celebrating this year. I'd rather be alone, if that'snokay.\" Sarah sighed deeply. She knew that her middle son wasnhurting… In fact, he had been hurting ever since that past May,nwhen he found out that the woman he'd been falling in love with hadnbeen using him, lying to him. Granted, there were some extenuatingncircumstances involved, but she understood her son's pain andnfeelings of betrayal. However, she had never agreed with his decisionnnot to allow Josie Geller back into his life. It was obvious that henstill pined for her; at least it was obvious to Sarah. She supposednhe probably hid it better from the rest of the world than he did hisnown mother. But no one who knew him before Josie Geller camenalong could deny that Sam was a changed man after that experience.nLuckily, he'd seen the light before he ran headlong off to New Yorknto be with Lara. Sarah knew that Lara just was not right for her sonnand that rebounding back to her would have been disastrous for themnboth. She also had a sneaking suspicion that maybe JosienGeller was the right woman for Sam: and it was that fact thatnshe believed ate away at her son so much. Sam, it seemed, had given up on love. He apparentlynhad no interest in dating, and according to Abby, he hadn't breathedna word of even one date since that fateful spring night…and he toldnAbby everything. Sarah knew that going to the cabin to be alone wasnSam's attempt at running from his emotions. But she knew that nonmatter how much he tried to avoid dealing with his feelings fornJosie, sooner or later they would catch up with him anyway. \"All right,\" Sarah finally acquiesced. \"Inunderstand. But bring your cell phone, okay? That place really is twonright turns from nowhere, and I don't like the idea of you up therenwith no way to contact anyone in an emergency.\" Shaking his head and smiling, Sam agreed, \"Okay,nMom…if you're really that concerned, I promise to bring itnwith me, all right?\" \"Thanks,\" she said, the smile in her voice,n\"for humoring your old mother.\" Sam chuckled. \"You will stop by on your way home,nthough, won't you? It won't be the same without you.\" \"Yes, I'll stop there on my way back to thencity, Mom. I promise. And…thanks for understanding,\" henfinished hesitantly. \"Sure.\" \"Give my love to Dad and the guys, will you? Andnwhen you speak to her, tell Abby I'll give her a call myself soon.\" \"Okay, will do. And this time I promise to leavenyou alone. No more phone calls…\" Sarah vowed. \"Oh, andnSam?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I love you,\" she replied. Sam smiled softly. \"I love you too, Mom. Talk tonyou soon. Merry Christmas.\" \"Merry Christmas to you, too, Sam. Bye,\"nSarah said, and then hung up. - - - Later that evening, after he had settled in at thencabin, Sam used an iron poker to rearrange the logs in the fireplacenand then sat back on the floor in front of it, leaning his backnagainst the sofa. A light lake effect snow was falling outside,ncovering the trees and ground with a glistening blanket of white. Sam picked up a copy of Jane Eyre and tried tonconcentrate on the story, but it wasn't long before he began tonenvision himself as the stoic Mr. Rochester and Josie as the soft,nshy Jane falling in love against all odds. Putting the open book face down on the floor, Samnstared at the mesmerizing dance of the flames for a few long minutes.nHe tried like hell to not think about it: to not think about her …butnit wasn't working. He had hoped that getting away from Chicago, awaynfrom his job, away from his well-meaning family and friends, wouldnallow him to rest from the constant barrage of thoughts and feelingsnabout Josie Geller. Instead, the quiet and solitude of hisnsurroundings only made all of it come closer to the surface. About seven months had passed since that terriblenevening at the South Glen 1999 Senior Prom, but in his mind, it wasnas clear as if it had happened that day. Everything about Josienseemed etched in his mind whether he liked it or not: the way shenwould blush at anything resembling a compliment, the way her wholenface lit up when she smiled, her love of knowledge and literature,nthey way she could passionately argue the finer points of any work henhimself had read, her incredible talent as a writer. But most of all,nit was her beautifully expressive green eyes that seemed to nevernleave him. Anytime he closed his eyes, he could see them: firstnhappy, then sad…afraid and then pained…and oh, the love that henwas sure he'd seen in them, many times but most especially on thatnfateful night. His dreams were filled with those eyes, haunted bynthem. He'd tried so hard to move on, to push anything to donwith Josie Geller out of his life for good, and yet it seemed that hencould not forget her. He'd been so angry, so hurt that night. He had beennso vulnerable… Indeed, he had been \"in the very wrath of love\"nas the Bard would have put it: about to put everything else in hisnlife on the line to finally admit to the feelings for Josie that hadngrown beyond all containment. And just moments later, his whole worldnhad crumbled around him. No, that wasn't right, he admitted. Thenworld hadn't crumbled…just his heart: his heart, and maybe hisnfaith in love. How could she have done that to him? How could shenhave made him believe in her…made him love her, just so that shencould ruin his life? And how could she have possibly been anything henthought she had been if she could do that? The obvious answer at the time had been that she couldn't have been anything like the person he'd fallen innlove with. The story she was working on had been about him; the blacknman he'd caught Josie speaking to outside the country club had saidnit. He'd had two bitter days and nights to think about it before hernarticle appeared in the newspaper, asking for his forgiveness. A partnof him did want to forgive her. But on the other hand, he wasnafraid that her \"story\" had only been a last ditch effortnto salvage her career, and it was that sentiment that won out in thenend. Now…well, he wasn't so sure. Thinking back again to that night at the prom, henremembered the events leading up to Josie's revelation in almostnperfect detail. Josie had said she had something to tell him…andnshe looked awfully nervous about it. At the time, he had thought itnwas simply that she was going to reveal her feelings for him. Butnlooking back at it now, maybe it had been more than that. Becausenthen she had removed her hand from his long enough to remove thensmall pin she always wore, dropping it purposely to the floor andnstepping on it. He remembered hearing it crunch beneath her heel. Whynwould she have done that? Was it possible this was some sort of bugnor wire? That would make sense as to how they would know of hernprogress… And if it had been a bug…why would she haventaken it off? That didn't make any sense if she were indeed trying tonwrite a story about his \"inappropriate\" feelings for her. Also, there was the reason she'd been distracted fromnhis moment of revelation. The popular kids were about to play anterrible prank on Aldys Wells…the girl who had first befriendednJosie at South Glen. As part of the \"popular crowd\", shenhad no obligation to do anything to help Aldys, but yet she had beennpropelled into action, almost as if driven by her own internalndemons. She had blown everything: her cover, her story, and hernchance of a potential relationship with him, just to save the girlnfrom humiliation. She'd put Aldys before herself, and that did notnjive with the image of the self-serving liar he'd made Josie out tonbe in his mind. And then…there was that article. Sam reached up behind him and pulled a scrapbook fromnthe seat of the sofa, placing it in his lap. Opening to the firstnpage, the headline \"Never Been Kissed\" stared back atnhim…along with three pictures, all of Josie. Sighing heavily, henbegan to read the article for what was probably the thousandth time.nHe had read it so much, he could probably have recited it verbatim,nbut still, it seemed that some different aspect of her story—ofnher—jumped out at him each time. Her writing was so sweet, sonunassumingly shy, and so full of hope: so much like the Josie he hadnloved. And as much as he hated to admit it, it was pretty obviousnfrom the evening news and the papers next day that she had beenndevastated when he didn't show up at her little media circus. Flipping the page, he looked at another articlenwritten by Josie: a story about a woman who chosen to give upnchemotherapy in favor of trying to carry her pregnancy to term. Itnwas so poignant and expertly written that the emotions just pourednoff the page. It was the same, story after story. Each time, Josienhad found a small, quiet, overlooked corner of everyday life andnchose to shine her light upon it, making it glow for all to see. Andnhe should know…his scrapbook contained every one of her articles. Was it possible…that he had been wrong? This wasnthe thought that tormented him night after night, forcing him to seenher in his dreams and in every petite blonde that walked by him onnthe streets, hearing her in just about any song on the radio…callingnout to him, taunting him. What if… she were the right one— hisnpenguin in Josie-speak—and he had thrown it all away? Pushing off the floor, he headed to the kitchen,nopened the fridge door, and pulled out a beer. Twisting off the cap,nhe took a long swig. This going around in mental circles was gettingnhim nowhere…because the fact remained that Josie Geller was now innhis past…and that was where she was going to stay, whether he likednit or not. - - - Josie dragged herself into her hotel room in GreennBay, closing the door by leaning heavily against it. Limply droppingnher bags in the entryway, she crossed the room to collapse across thenbed. Although quite satisfying, the day had turned out to be annincredibly busy one. Her meeting with the parents of the clients innthe new group home then became a tour of the facility, which thennbecame an interview with the clients and staff. After a celebratoryndinner, she spent three hours sitting in a deserted Starbucks coffeenbar, putting her notes together in the computer and drafting annoutline for her article. Tomorrow, she still needed to meet with theirnrepresentative at HUD and get the details of the myriad of codes andnregulations the parents had had to meet in order to be able to applynfor government backing. But all in all, she couldn't wait to put thisnstory on paper, so to speak. But with her mental and physical reserves so low, shenwasn't able to stop the flood of thoughts about Sam from overwhelmingnher. That always seemed to happen when she was alone. It was as ifnhis memory was just waiting in the wings, waiting for its cue to takencenter stage in her mind. As tears welled in her eyes, she remembered so manynthings about him: the ride on the Ferris Wheel at Navy Pier and hownhe had been so frightened, yet had jumped to help her; the day theynhad painted the prom backdrop together, getting into a paint fight innthe process; the many times their eyes had locked and neither onencould look away; the way he looked at the prom in his tuxedo, sonhandsome, so sweet; the way his eyes traveled her face and his voicenshook when he told her he wanted to tell her something; the pain,nanger, and betrayal in his face and eyes just before he turned hisnback on her and walked out of her life. Tears fell in earnest as she hugged herself, rockingnback and forth on the bed as she let the misery overtake her. 'Whynhadn't he come?' her soul begged to know. How could he forget her andnmove on as if nothing had ever happened? Was it possible that she hadnsimply imagined the attraction between them? No, she knew at least that was true. She feltnthat unalienable truth deep within her: Sam Coulson was her soulnmate, and he'd felt it, too. And if she couldn't have him, then shenwould have no one. She would not settle for less. \"So what does that leave you?\" hernsubconscious asked. \"Endless lonely nights alone with coldnmemories and dreams of what might have been?\" Shoving off her shoes and climbing underneath thencovers fully clad, she huddled up into a ball, hugging the extranpillow against her chest. \"For now…yes,\" she whisperednaloud. Then she buried her face into the pillow, allowing the softncotton to soak up her tears and muffle her sobs as she cried herselfnto sleep. - - - As Sam finished up the last dregs of his beer, henplaced the glass bottle along the side of the sink. He walked throughnthe one bedroom in the cabin and into the bathroom, shivering anlittle at the chill. He brushed his teeth and washed with the mostlyncold water from the tap and then headed back out to the bedroom tonchange into some sweats and crawl into bed. But once he had changed and went to pull down thencovers on the queen-sized bed, he knew he couldn't sleep in it…notntonight anyway. Not while all those thoughts of Josie Geller werenswirling around in his head. It would only serve as a reminder that,nif he had only decided to forgive her all those months ago, she couldnhave been in his arms to share that big bed instead of lying in itnall alone. He went over to the long bench seat along the livingnroom wall and lifted up one section, revealing an extensive array ofncamping supplies beneath. Dragging out the first sleeping bag henfound, he flattened it out on the floor a safe distance from thenfire. Then he crawled inside, turning his back to the flames, andnprayed that tonight at least, he could have a dreamless sleep. - - -[Chapter 2] Snowbound, Part 2 By RocknVaughn - - - Sam awoke in a cold sweat just after dawn on Thursdaynmorning. Sitting up and rubbing his eyes, it took him a minute tonremember where he was…and why. Looking over toward the fireplace,nhe shivered a little and rubbed his arms. There was little more thanna few glowing embers in the hearth now and it had grown chilly…butnit was nowhere as chilled in the room as he felt on the inside. He wished he could say that he didn't dream of Josienthe night before, but he'd be lying to himself if he did. She hadnbeen there, just as she always seemed to be, on the other side of hisneyelids. But this dream seemed to be different from the others. Itnwas closer to a nightmare, actually. Josie was calling out to him…shenneeded him. But he was lost…he couldn't find her. All around himnwas a thick white cloud, and he couldn't see. Somehow he could sensenthat if he didn't find her, something terrible would happen, but itnseemed that, for all his desperate searching, he was getting farthernand farther away from her. He could feel the panic rising in hisnthroat, while he could hear her voice whispering, echoing all aroundnhim, full of despair, 'Why? Why didn't you come?' Shivering at the memory, he shimmied out of thensleeping bag and knelt before the fireplace, placing new logs in itnand getting the fire restarted. Once the kindling had caught fire, henstood up, brushed ash from his knees and hands, and then ambled intonthe kitchen to make a pot of coffee. Placing the coffee groundsninside the percolator basket, he bent down and put a couple of logsnin the wood stove and lit them. Carrying the empty coffee pot, henwalked over to the sink and poured cold water from the tap into it,nset the percolator basket inside it, and then put it on top of thencooking stove. Trying to keep his mind off of his troubling dream,nhe pulled out the battery- powered radio, and turned it on to a newsnstation. Settling down at the table, he played with the antenna untilnthe station came in clear. \"And now, for weather on the fives…\"nthe announcer said. \"Batten down the hatches, because winter hasnofficially arrived…in spades.\" Sam sat up straighter and turned up the volume as thenvoice of the meteorologist took over. \"That's right folks,nBlizzard '99 is on its way, and it's bearing down fast. Looks as ifncentral Minnesota and Wisconsin will be hardest hit, with thenpotential for snow measuring in feet , not inches. Snow willnstart falling in earnest in the Green Bay area by nightfall, and willncontinue at least through Friday. Make sure to take extra precautionsnand stock up, because with the high winds in some areas, there is angreat potential for lots of downed power lines and impassable roads.nI need to stress that this is not a false alarm. Snow is definitely on its way, and it looks like Santa is going to benthe only one who will be able to get around for a while…\" Sam turned off the radio and poured his coffee into antravel mug. Placing the rest of the percolated pot on the counternnear the stove, he reached into the fridge for the milk, pouring itninto the mug along with a spoonful of sugar before stirring it andnplacing the cover on top. Plopping the carton into the fridge, hentook inventory of what was in the house for food. Making a mental list of what he would need, Samngrabbed his coat and hat and headed out to the old Chevy Blazer thatnhis family kept at the cabin for the more rugged travel conditions.nIt was heavy, and had four wheel drive, which was a boon for his dadnand older brother, who liked to ice fish up there during the winternmonths. Driving into town to buy the additional things henwould need, he took a sip of his coffee before placing the mug in thendrink holder in the console. He wasn't that worried about gettingnsnowed in…because the cabin had a generator instead of standardnelectric power. However, the generator was only used for heat andnpower in the most basic sense: keeping the water pipes from freezingnand for a few electrical lights and appliances. But if he wasn'tngoing to be able to get to the generator to refill it with gas, henwas going to have to seriously conserve. But again, he'd done plenty of camping; he knew hownto rough it when necessary. Pulling into the local supermarket, itnseemed that he wasn't the only one that had heard the weather report.nEven at 8 o'clock in the morning, the parking lot was already packed.nSighing, he climbed out of the Blazer and shut the door. He justnhoped he could get the items he needed before the frenzy started innearnest. - - - By 8:20 am, Josie had been up for over three hours.nAfter a fitful night of not much sleeping and a lot of crying, shenhad given up on rest at about 5:15, and instead decided to make usenof the time by working on her story. She had worked furiously,nthrowing herself wholeheartedly into her work, putting together ansolid rough draft of her story, leaving room at the end for thenadditional info she would receive from her appointment that morning.nFinally satisfied with her article thus far, she took a moment tonconnect up to the internet and sent the story and the rest of hernnotes to her work email account for safekeeping. Checking her watch, Josie powered down her laptop andnpacked it in its protective case. She went over to the mirror,ndouble-checking her attire and makeup. At least, Josie thought, shendidn't have any outward appearance of being miserable. Packing up her toiletries, she packed the rest of hernitems into her overnight bag and put her long, black woolen coat onnover her black pantsuit. She put the handles of her purse and thenovernight bag over her shoulder and picked up the computer case, andnthen exited the hotel room, closing the door behind her. Dropping thenkeys in the drop box, she headed out to her car. She was relativelynclose to downtown, so she figured it wouldn't take her more than tennminutes to reach the government building where Jen Tierney's HUDnoffice was located. Parking her car on the street, Josie stood looking upnat the twelve-story building, and then marveled at the bustle ofnpeople on the street. All of them seemed hurried, rushed…but thennit was the height of Christmas shopping season, she mused.nWalking up to the main entrance to the building, Josie was more thanna little surprised when she found the doors locked. She shielded herneyes and peered in through the glass doors, but the building lookedndeserted. Confused, she backed up a few paces, pulled out her notepadnfrom her purse and double-checked the address against her notes. Yep,nthis was definitely the place. It was then she noticed a small sign posted on thendoor. Walking up to read it, it said: \"Due to inclement weather,nall government offices will be closed until Monday, December 27th.nSorry for the inconvenience.\" Josie looked up at the sky and then around. The skynwas overcast, sure, but there was no precipitation. The roads werenclear and dry. Shaking her head in bewilderment, she finally shruggednher shoulders and headed back to her car. - - - It was nearly noon before Sam had checked out of bothnthe grocery store and the hardware store, securing the items he wouldnneed to ride out the storm. Actually he had more than enough. Hencould ride out a storm for three weeks with the amount of food he hadnbought. But he figured he'd be better off with too much than notnenough. Loading the cans of kerosene for lanterns in the back of thenBlazer, he shut the back with a satisfying thud. Climbing into thenfront, he was not surprised to hear his cell phone ringing. Picking it up and pushing the 'talk' button, he said,n\"Hi, Mom…\" \"Gosh, Sam!\" Sarah Coulson exclaimed. \"Inwas starting to get really worried about you! I've been calling younall morning and you haven't answered!\" \"I was out getting supplies and I left it in thencar,\" he explained. \"Oh. Okay…that's a relief. But…are you surenyou don't want to come home now? We're supposed to miss the brunt ofnthe storm here in Racine, while it seems that your area is going tonbe one of the hardest hit. I'm sure you could make it if you leftnright now…\" \"Mom, I'm not coming home. I told you I wantednto be alone. Alone in a snowstorm is fine, too,\" Sam said. \"But… It could be days before they cannget you out of there, Sam…\" \"I don't have to be back to work until after thenNew Year. I'm sure they'll have me out by then. It's not like I havenanywhere I need to go,\" he reasoned. \"But what if you…?\" Sarah began, but Samninterrupted her. \"Mom…I am not changing my mind aboutnthis. I'm staying.\" Sarah sighed, but said nothing. \"And don't be surprised if you don't hear fromnme for a while, either,\" Sam continued. \"It's likely Inwon't be able to call out, even with a cell phone, for a number ofndays if the lines go down.\" \"At least let Sheriff Parker know you're inntown, so they'll know to look for you.\" \"Already took care of it, Mom, but thanks fornthe suggestion.\" Sam paused for a moment and then saidnsoothingly, \"Mom, I'll be okay…I'm a big boy. I can take carenof myself.\" Sarah thought that, at least emotionally, that wasndebatable. \"I know, honey,\" she said. \"Just bencareful, and I'll talk to you when it's all over, okay?\" \"All right, Mom,\" he agreed. \"I'llntalk to you soon. Love you.\" \"I love you too, Sam. Be careful!\" \"I will. Bye.\" \"Bye, Sam.\" Sam clicked off the talk button and then plugged hisnphone back into the cigarette lighter to recharge the battery. Henfigured that he should keep the phone charged to maximum power sonthat he would have it in case he did need to call someone fornan emergency. Fighting the unusual traffic, he turned east andndrove toward Lake Michigan…toward the outskirts of town where thencabin was. - - - After grabbing breakfast at a local diner, Josie satnin her car, studying her map. Since she was leaving Green Bay a fewnhours ahead of schedule, she decided that she wanted to take then\"scenic route\" home to Chicago. Instead of takingnInterstate 43, Josie decided to go east on Route 29 out to the coast,nfiguring she could pick up the highway again in Sheboygan and onlynhave lost an hour or two of time. She wanted to make it back homenbefore nightfall so she could put the finishing touches on hernarticle and have it ready for Gus first thing in the morning. Once Josie had reached the end of Route 29, shenturned south and followed the local roads, as glimpses of the greatnLake Michigan fell in and out of view with the rolling hills. Thenarea was mostly forested, with an occasional house or general storento break the monotony of the trees. She turned on the radio, flicking the auto searchnbutton until she landed on a soft rock music channel. The first songnshe heard was \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" by Cher, followednby \"How Do I Live?\" by LeAnn Rimes. Sighing, she justnrolled her eyes. By now, she was used all the songs on the radionreminding her of Sam. Sam. Josie's eyes watered, and she had to dash thentears away so that she could see the road. She missed him so much.nLast night she'd dreamt of being held in his arms, snuggled togetherncomfortably in a big brass bed. The comfort and love that emanatednfrom him, just from his arm innocently around her waist was enough tonmake her weep now in daylight, far, far away from the fantasy ofndreamland. As Josie drove along, snow started to fall in small,nsoft flakes. - - - Sam looked at his watch as snow started to fall. Itnwas only 12:30, and much too early for the storm to have rolled in.nMore likely it was just a lake-effect snow squall. No matter, henthought. He was only a few minutes from the cabin now, so it couldnsnow as much as it wanted. - - - Five minutes later, Sam was wishing he'd nevernthought the snow squall didn't matter. It had quickly picked up innintensity and he was now driving at a snail's pace in practicallynwhiteout conditions. He couldn't see more than 50 feet in front ofnhim. But being from Wisconsin, and having grown up dealing with snow,nhe knew that if there was no shoulder to pull over onto (and on thisntwo lane road, there wasn't), he needed to keep moving in order tonprevent other cars behind him from hitting him because they wouldn'tnsee him stopped. Hunching over the wheel, Sam concentrated heavily onnthe road and the surroundings. He was lucky that he was familiar withnthe area…otherwise he didn't know how he'd manage to keep thenBlazer on the road. - - - The windshield wipers on Josie's Buick steadilynswished back and forth as the snow began to fall more heavily. Shentried to keep herself loose and unworried, knowing that in anothernhour or so, she'd be back to the highway. The deejay said, over thenend of another love song, \"At the top of the hour, we'llnhighlight the weather conditions, but first, a special request song…\" Josie perked up, hearing that they were about tondiscuss the weather, but then her heart constricted painfully whennshe heard the request song start to play: \" Good times, for a change… To see thenluck I've had could make a good man turn bad…\" With a sob, Josie reached out and violently turnednthe knob to the radio, shutting the music off…but she could notnturn off the thoughts the song evoked: Sam, so handsome, dressed innhis tuxedo at the Senior Prom, Sam crowning her Prom Queen, Samnasking her to dance, Sam dancing close to her, holding her as theyndanced to that song…while Morrissey's voice crooned \"Please,nplease, please, let me, let me, let me, let me get what I want thisntime…\" Tears coursed down her face as she tried to hold backnthe rest of the images, but they wouldn't be denied: Sam's softnvulnerability as he told her he had something he had to tell her…nSam's shocked look as she revealed her true identity, the waves ofnbetrayal that emanated from him after he'd overheard George ask ifnshe had the story on him, the pain, and anger, and mistrust when henturned and left her standing in the country club garden…and leftnher standing on the ball field. Josie could barely see the road for her tears.nAngrily, she brushed them away with her hand, only to have her visionnappear to get worse. It took her a minute to realize that it was thenblowing, swirling snow that hampered her view, not her tears. She hadnsuddenly driven into a tempest, or so it seemed. Trying to swallow her panic, she spoke to herself outnloud, \"Okay, Josie, you can do this…you've driven through thisnbefore…just keep moving…\" She slowed down, and struggled tonsee more than a half a car-length ahead of her. She kept looking fornsomeplace to pull over and wait out the worst of the blowing snow,nbut this road did not appear to have a breakdown lane. It was justnone line of traffic in either direction with ground that sloped downninto the woods from the road's edge. \"Damn it…why didn't I just let the damn songnplay so I could have heard the weather?\" she cursed herselfnaloud. She shied away from the edge of the road, afraid that shenwould be too close to it and drive right off the road. Ahead of her,nthere was only white…she could see nothing. Josie's eyes were glued to the near edge of the road,nso it wasn't until the very last minute that she saw the headlightsnof an oncoming vehicle clear in her path. Confused into thinking thatnmaybe the vehicle was in her lane, she swerved to the left,nthinking to go around it on its side of the road. It wasn't until herncar started to lose control and slide off the far side of the streetnthat she realized it had been she who had crossed the middlenline. Trying valiantly to steer away from the edge, she only managednto turn her car 180 degrees before sliding off the road and down thenembankment. - - - From the barely visible landmarks that Sam was ablento pick out, he was very close to the turnoff for the cabin. Awaynfrom the open road, he reasoned, the blowing and drifting of the snownshould not be as bad, because he knew that roads such as the one henwas on acted like a wind tunnel when the snow started to fly, makingna regular snowfall appear much worse. Watching the near side of thenroad for his turnoff, he didn't notice until the last moment that ancar was mostly in his lane, and almost right in front of him. Before he even had a chance to react, he watched innhorror as the car in front of him swerved violently to his right andnthen the back wheels lost traction and spun the car around 180ndegrees…then it slid down the embankment and out of his view. Moments later, he heard the ghastly sound of glassnbreaking and metal crunching over the howl of the wind. - - - Josie felt the car as it slipped off the side of thenroad, tilting at a funny angle as it slid down the snow-covered hillnlike a toboggan. She could see the line of trees fast approaching andnshe prayed for a miracle as her life flashed before her eyes… And then she felt the sudden jolt and crunch of thencar's sudden stop as the front right of her car smashed into a tree.nThe seat belt tightened across her and the rough power of the airbagnshoved her back and away from the windshield. But because she was sonpetite, the force from the sudden expansion of the airbag pushed hernhead back away from the direction of the crash harder than normal,nand the left side of her head connected with the window on thendriver's side door. The impact knocked Josie unconscious. - - - Heedless of the danger he was putting himself in, henpulled the Blazer as close to the side of the road as he could,nturned on the hazard lights and jumped out, racing to the edge tonlook down into the gully. A huge slash of snow had been swept away bynthe car as it had skated down the slope. The gray Buick sedan nownrested at the bottom of the hill, where its front end had collidednhard with a huge oak tree. Sam waded through the knee-deep snow down the hill,ndesperate to get to the car to see if anyone was seriously hurtninside. He knew that this strip of road was rarely traveled and itncould be minutes or hours before anyone else came along. It was up tonhim to help whoever was inside that car. Reaching the driver's sidenof the Buick, he tried to swipe away the collecting snow and mud onnthe window and look inside, but the windows were too steamed up tonsee in. He knocked against the window hard, hoping to hear someonencall out, but no one did. Frantically, he reached for the door handle, forcingnthe door open on hinges that no longer worked the way they should.nInside, he could see a huge mound of material, presumably thendeflated airbag, and a woman. A lone woman with her head turned awaynfrom him, and she seemed to be unconscious. Fearing the worst, he putna finger to her throat, and was relieved to feel a pulse beatingnstrongly. The woman moaned a little in protest against his coldnfingers and the blast of the snow blowing at her. Hearing her moan, Sam leaned in, trying to shield thenwoman as much as he could from the wind howling around them. Placingna hand on the woman's shoulder, he said, \"Hey, are you okay?\" Sam watched as the woman groggily shook her head asnif to clear it, and then drift back into unconsciousness. But as shendid, she turned her head so that she was now facing him. Sam felt as if he'd been punched in the stomach. Hisnhead spun and he had to grasp the top of the open door to keep fromnfalling over. 'No! It couldn't be! It can't be!' his mind rebelled. But it was. There was nonmistaking that the unconscious woman in the car was Josie Geller.[Chapter 3] Snowbound, Part 3 By RocknVaughn Author's Note: Thanks for your reviews! I have had this story in the back of my mind for a long timernand have finally decided to complete it. (Heidiree...is that you: ) ) - - - For a long moment, Sam was overwhelmed by shock. He couldn't feelrnanything: not the wind howling around him, not the wet snow pelting his back,rnnor even his own beating heart. It was if he'd suddenly fallen into a black hole,rnand the only thing he could see, the only thing he could concentrate on, was JosiernGeller's face. But then, just as quickly, his senses returned in a rush so that he felt thatrnthere were too many thoughts flooding his head. How? Why? And why here?rnNow? Putting a finger to her throat again to reassure himself that she was indeedrnbreathing and her heart was beating, Sam let out a breath he hadn't known hernwas holding. A surge of…relief…flooded him, but it was soon buried by a tidalrnwave of anger. In fact, he was suddenly furious with Josie…for her deceptionrnmonths before, for the pain and frustration it had caused, and, most of all, for thernlove that she'd made him feel for her; the love he still felt for her. Andrndamn her for being here to remind him of his utter failure to forget her! Shaking his head clear, he realized that now was not the time to dredgernup and examine all the emotions and feelings caused by seeing her again. Hernwould have to deal with the backlash of that later. Right now, Josie was hurt andrnneeded help, and he was the only person around to give it. Leaning back into the car, Sam slowly felt his way down her arms, herrnhips, her legs, her ankles, checking for any sign of broken bones. Finding none,rnhe reached across Josie's lap and unbuckled her seat belt. Untangling her from it,rnhe carefully slid one arm underneath her knees and the other behind her neck tornlift her out of the car. She obviously had some injury, since she was unconscious,rnand the sooner he could get her to the warmth of his Blazer and call for help, thernbetter off she would be. Cradling Josie's limp body in his arms, Sam turned and struggled againstrnthe wind and snow to climb his way up the embankment, taking care to stay inrnthe swath that her car had carved out of the snow on the hill. Reaching the road at last, Sam lifted Josie higher into his arms so that herncould reach up and open the passenger side door. Awkwardly, he tried to turnrnher in his arms and place her inside the vehicle. When he finally was able to layrnher body along the bench of the seat, he ran around the front side of the Blazer,rnopened his door and climbed in, quickly shutting it behind him. He shook hisrnhead to clear the layer of snow that had built up from being outside, and thenrnslicked his wet hair back with his fingers nervously. Sam then sat Josie's body inrnan upright position, leaning it against the corner of the seat and the passengerrndoor. From the floor of the back seat, he retrieved a woolen blanket, which herncovered her with, and then he reached for his telephone, dialing 911. Looking up through the windshield, Sam realized that the squall wasrnstarting to die down. Already he could see at least twice as far down the road,rnand the wind did not sound as if it were howling quite as fiercely. Then hisrnthoughts were interrupted by the gruff voice on the end of the telephone line,rn\"Oswego Police, Sheriff Parker speaking.\" \"Will, this is Sam Coulson again,\" Sam answered. Will Parker was arnchildhood playmate of Sam's from when he had visited in the summers. They'drnkept in touch on and off ever since. \"Sam! Long time no talk…but this is the emergency line; is somethingrnwrong?\" \"Unfortunately so, Will. I'm out here on Lake Drive, about…\" Sam pausedrnas he tried to gauge his exact location, \"…a third of a mile from the turnoff to myrnfamily's cabin. There's been an accident.\" Will knew the stretch of road Sam spoke of, and knew it wasn't exactly thernmost friendly to travelers during snowy weather. \"Is anyone hurt? Were yourninvolved?\" Sam replied, \"No, I wasn't really involved. A car from the other side of thernroad spun out in front of me and ended up sliding off my side of the road downrnthe embankment, hitting a tree. There was just one person inside the car. She'srnunconscious, but other than that, there are no apparent injuries, no broken bones.rnHer car had an airbag and she was wearing a seatbelt.\" Will blew out a grateful breath. \"Whew! Well, I'm glad to hear that. She'llrnprobably be sore tomorrow, but those things might well have saved her life.rnWhere is she now?\" \"Right here next to me in the Blazer. I thought I should keep her warm,rnplus there's no telling if her car is even safe to be around right now,\" Samrnanswered. \"Okay,\" Will Parker replied. \"I'll call for a tow and an ambulance to meetrnme at the scene. I should be there in ten, or maybe even five; the squall seems tornbe letting up.\" \"Thanks, Will.\" Sam hung up the phone as he heard the click of Will hanging up as well.rnPlacing the cell phone back into the charger, he turned back towards his charge:rnJosie Geller, in the flesh and in his car. - - - Josie felt as if she was surfacing from a deep, black lake. As she got closerrnand closer to the surface, light started to shimmer around her, as well as thernechoing sound of a voice above her. Trying to concentrate on the sound, her headrnthrobbed from the effort. Again, the voice echoed, as if from far away, \"Josie… Josie, wake up…\" Itrnsounded like…Sam! Assuming it was yet another dream, she started to sliprndeeper back down into the comforting blackness. But then, there was a hand thatrnslid into her hair, and, incredibly, she could smell Sam Coulson's aftershave allrnaround her. The fingers that were buried in her hair were moving, searching forrnsomething…and then suddenly there was an explosion of pain that lurched herrnupright and pulled a strangled moan from her lips. - - - Sam sat and stared at Josie's pale face for several long moments beforerndeciding that maybe he should try to determine if she had hit her head duringrnthe crash. After all, that would be the most likely reason why she wasrnunconscious. Sliding closer to her on the seat, he called to her softly, hoping for arnresponse. When he didn't get one, he slowly pushed his right hand into thernsilkiness of her hair. Sam sucked in a breath and had to stop momentarily. Itrnwasn't fair that her hair was even more silky and soft than he hadrndreamed! Forcing his wayward thoughts aside and getting back on track with hisrntask, Sam slid his fingers forward and back methodically, looking for some signrnof injury. Then suddenly as he discovered a lump on the top left side of her head,rnshe whimpered pitifully and jolted forward. Surprised, Sam slid his left armrnaround her back to steady her and stop her from possibly falling back andrninjuring herself further. - - - \"Whoa, whoa,\" the voice soothed. \"It's okay, Josie. C'mon, wake up…rnYou can do it…\" And again, the voice sounded like Sam. And now his arms werernaround her, holding her close to him. This was starting to feel too real to be just arndream; if she were going to dream about Sam, it wouldn't be with this poundingrnpain in her skull, she tried to reason. Finally, Josie cracked one eye open, trying to adjust to the suddenrnexplosion of light that caused her head to hurt even more. Then as she openedrnthe other, she forced herself to try to focus on the face in front of her. Her eyesrnmet greenish hazel ones, concerned, yet swarming with a full range of emotionsrnunderneath the surface…Sam's eyes. And then suddenly it was as if all herrnsenses were working overtime: she felt the warmth of his arms surrounding her,rncould smell the wonderful aftershave that he always wore, and with widenedrneyes she took in every nuance of Sam's face. The reality of Sam Coulson's actual presence frightened and confusedrnJosie. Pulling herself free from his protective grasp, she pressed herself backrnagainst the passenger door and asked, \"S…Sam? Wh…what happened? What arernyou doing here?\" Wild-eyed with panic, she looked around. When she realizedrnshe was no longer in her car, she asked, \"Where am I?\" Sam sighed and pushed away the fleeting but painful feeling of rejectionrnand tried to reason that Josie had every right to be confused and scared at thatrnmoment. Placing a soothing hand on either shoulder, he prompted, \"Josie, yournwere in an accident…Do you remember?\" Josie closed her eyes and remembered the white blur, the sickening fearrnwhen she saw the headlights of that car and then lost control of hers. Shernremembered sliding down the side of the hill, that huge tree looming up beforernher… Opening her eyes abruptly to stop the vision, she said simply, \"Yes, Irnremember. But what are you doing here ? This is pretty darn farrnaway from Chicago...\" Sam shrugged a shoulder before answering, \"I'm from Wisconsinrnoriginally, and my family owns a cabin not far from here. I was on my way therernwhen I saw your car careen into the ditch. I was in the car you almost hit. But Irncould ask you the same question: What are you doing driving throughrnOswego? It's not exactly on the beaten path.\" Sam's tone was almost accusatory, and it tore at Josie's heart. Softly shernexplained, \"I was in Green Bay working on a story for the paper.\" Sam flinchedrnat her use of the word 'story', but Josie didn't notice. \"I finished up earlier thanrnexpected, so I thought I would take the scenic route home.\" Sam was about to ask her what kind of insane person would take thern'scenic route home' with a blizzard on the way but was interrupted by a series ofrnhard raps on the driver's side window. Looking up, Sam saw Will Parkerrnstanding there, motioning toward the squad car and the tow truck that was justrnarriving. With a wave and nod, Sam turned back to Josie and said, \"I'll be rightrnback, okay?\" Mute, Josie nodded and then watched as Sam opened the driver's siderndoor and climbed out, shutting the door behind him. Relieved at the chance torncollect her thoughts, Josie laid her head back on the headrest and then wincedrnwhen she made contact with the bump on her head. All of this was too bizarre to be believed…She hadn't seen Sam Coulson inrnwhat? Six? Seven months? And then suddenly he appears out of nowhere in thernmiddle of rural Wisconsin hundreds of miles from home? And to pull her out ofrnher wrecked car no less? Closing her eyes, Josie could again see Sam's eyes as she first awoke.rnOther than the concern for human life that seemed forefront on his mind, Sam'srneyes spoke volumes about pain, suffering, and anger. If he still carried aroundrnthat much emotional baggage about her, even after all these months, it was nornwonder he had never shown up at the ball field, she thought. She wonderedrnbriefly whether he had gone through the same hell that she had that first weekrnafter her disguise had been revealed, and then realized she would probablyrnnever know. Lifting her head and really looking around at her surroundings for thernfirst time, it seemed that the snowstorm has almost entirely dissipated. Nowrnthere was only a light snowfall…hard to believe that this idyllic picture had beenrna whiteout blizzard just minutes before. Without even realizing it, her eyesrnfollowed Sam as he walked toward the squad car with the police officer. He stillrnhad that same innate grace when he moved; and it still had the power tornmesmerize her. Catching herself staring, she laid her head back against the headrest morerncarefully and closed her eyes. Her heart constricted painfully at the realizationrnthat Sam was no closer to forgiving her than he had been that warm night inrnMay. The only man she had ever loved…and it was clear that even now, hernwould never be willing to love her back. Despite her resolve not to cry in front ofrnhim, silent tears of despair slipped from the corners of her eyes and trailed downrnher face. - - - Sam followed Will back toward the squad car several yards away from thernBlazer. Leaning against the driver's side door, Will asked, \"So how is she doing?rnIs she conscious now?\" \"Yeah, she woke up just a few moments ago,\" Sam said flatly. Will frowned at Sam's tone. \"But…? What's wrong?\" Sam shook his head as if clearing it. \"Nothing's wrong. Other than arnpretty good bump on the back of her head, she seems fine. At least, she didn'trncomplain of any other ailments.\" Will nodded, satisfied. \"Good. Now, why don't you show me where thatrncar is so that Horace can get down there and start winching it back onto thernroad? I already called Rusty in for backup so he can direct what little traffic mayrncome along.\" Patting Sam's back, he put a hand out before him in a silent requestrnfor Sam to lead the way. Sam walked back to just about ten feet in front of the Blazer and thenrnpointed down toward the gray Buick with the crushed front end. \"There it is. AsrnI said, she had crossed the middle line during the whiteout and then it seemsrnwhen she saw my headlights, she tried to overcorrect and the back wheels justrnlost traction.\" Will looked down at the wrecked car for a moment and then waved forrnHorace in the tow truck to come over. As Horace started to move the truckrncloser, Will took a minute to look over his shoulder into Sam's Blazer. The prettyrnyoung woman was staring back at them, but quickly turned her head when shernnoticed that Will was looking at her. Turning back to Sam, he asked, \"Do you think her head is okay? Did sherntell you who she was or where she's fr...?\" \"Her name's Josie Geller and she's from Chicago,\" Sam answered withoutrneven letting Will finish his sentence. Startled, Will looked at Sam, but Sam was just staring blankly at the carrndown in the ditch as if morbidly fascinated with it. Will studied Sam for a longrnmoment and then said softly, more a statement than a question, \"You know her.\" Without looking up or otherwise acknowledging Will's presence, Samrnsaid, \"Yeah, I do.\" Sam's uncharacteristic reticence, as well as the myriad of emotionsrncrossing his face, told Will this woman was not just an acquaintance. Samrndefinitely had a 'history' with her, and apparently whatever it was between themrnhad gone unresolved. Deciding not to push the issue further at the time being, Will said, \"Well, Irnprobably should go talk to her. I need to get a statement from her for the report.rnWill you excuse me?\" Sam, still staring down at the car, watching as Horace tracked his wayrndown the hill to attach the winch to the rear axle, simply nodded. Crossing over to the driver's side of Sam's Blazer, Will opened the doorrnand climbed inside. Josie turned to look at him as he entered and then smiled in arntentative greeting, and he smiled back. \"Hello,\" Will said. \"How are you feeling?rnHow is your head?\" \"I…It…Well, it hurts,\" she answered honestly, \"but other than arnheadache, I don't seem to be the worse for wear.\" \"Is your vision blurred at all? Seeing double?\" 'Other than my tears blurring my vision, you mean?' she thought, but shernanswered. \"No, I can see fine, thanks.\" \"Sam told me your name is Josie and you're from Chicago?\" Will pressedrngently. Josie nodded, glancing out the windshield at a motionless Sam, who wasrnstaring down the embankment, apparently watching the effort to recover her car.rnShe paused to swallow the lump of emotion in her throat before she continued,rn\"Yes. My name is Josie Geller. I work for the Chicago Sun-Times. I was on myrnway back from Green Bay, where I was working on a story.\" A bell of recognition went off in Will's head when she mentioned both herrnname and the newspaper for which she worked…almost as if he'd heard itrnsomewhere before. Glancing briefly at Sam, he knew he hadn't heard it fromrnhim, but yet, she obviously had something to do with him. He could see it in thisrnwoman's eyes, and the way her eyes kept straying back to Sam. He wonderedrnagain about the connection between her and Sam, but didn't dare ask. Instead hernasked, \"Can you tell me what happened? Do you remember the events leadingrnup to the accident?\" Josie closed her eyes, letting the picture form in her mind. \"Well, I wasrndriving south on this road when suddenly it seemed that the wind and snowrncame up suddenly, it was like driving into a cloud. I could barely see past thernend of the car. I knew there was no place to pull over, so I tried to keep moving.rnThen suddenly I saw headlights coming at me, not more than a car length or twornin front of me. At first I thought that it had crossed into my lane, so I swervedrntoward that side of the road, thinking to go around it. But then I realized it hadrnbeen me and I tried to recover, but I must have turned the wheel too sharply,rnbecause the back end of the car slid out and then I was sliding down thernembankment toward that tree…\" Josie shuddered at the memory. Will placed a sympathetic hand on hers and said, \"That's okay, Irnunderstand. You don't have to go on. But when you awoke you were here? Yourndon't remember anything else?\" \"No. I woke up and I was here…In Sam's…car,\" Josie finishedrnawkwardly. Will nodded and then looked up when he noticed the ambulance hadrnarrived. He said, gesturing toward the ambulance, \"Well, why don't we havernthem look you over and make sure you're okay, all right?\" Josie nodded. \"All right.\" She started to open the passenger door, but Willrnput a staying hand on her arm. \"Hold on, I want to come around and help you out of there.\" Nodding, Josie pulled the door closed again and waited. - - - Sam stood watching as they slowly pulled Josie's car up from the bottomrnof the embankment. His eyes were on the car, but his mind was elsewhere. Hernstill didn't understand why this was happening to him now…now when he wasrnfinally starting to get a handle on his emotions for Josie? Hell, this whole trip had been about him putting her out of his mind for good. He had to laugh at that. Yeah, like he would have been able to just put her out ofrnhis mind, he thought sarcastically. The flood of emotions that even nowrnthreatened to engulf him was proof enough of the impossibility of that task. JosiernGeller was branded onto his soul; he knew that now. And he didn't have anyrnidea how to change that. Anger rose to the top of his emotions again. Why? Whyrndid she have to be here ? Why did he have to be the one to findrnher? Why couldn't Fate have left it well enough alone? He knew that Will had climbed into the Blazer to talk to Josie. He refusedrnto look, because inside he knew it would bother him and he didn't want to havernto admit that to himself as well. So instead, he ignored it. He didn't want tornadmit to even himself how deep his feelings for Josie still ran. It was as if he'drnsimply put them on hold instead of actually having gotten over them. Sam heard the Blazer's door slam and looked over in the direction. Butrninstead of walking toward him, Will crossed over to the passenger side to letrnJosie out, placing a polite hand on either side of her waist to let her down slowlyrnwithout any jarring. Sam's jaw tightened and his eyes glittered with barelyrnquashed jealousy as Will helped Josie over to the ambulance that Sam had onlyrnjust now noticed. Then the second police officer, Rusty, along with the EMT allrnhelped Josie up into the back of the ambulance so they could run some tests. Damn it, but Sam was jealous of every man who laid a hand on Josie. He grittedrnhis teeth against the feeling, but it wouldn't go away. Looking down, he kickedrnat a piece of icy snow on the side of the road and then sighed. Well, I might asrnwell go over and find out how she is, he tried to reason as his feet startedrnwandering toward the open back of the ambulance. - - - Josie sat patiently while the EMT checked her pupils, her blood pressure,rnher limbs for anything broken or bruised and finally the bump on her head,rnwhich he gave her a cold pack to press against it. As she turned back to look toward the outside, she noticed Sam wasrnapproaching…and he had an inscrutable look on his face. What was he thinking?rnWhat did he want? Sam came to stand at the foot of the ambulance, watching, but not sayingrna word. He wasn't sure if he could. Part of him was afraid that something couldrnbe wrong with her, and part of him was angry that he even cared. Will noticed Sam's presence and informed him, \"Just a bump on the head,rnSam, possibly a concussion, nothing more. She's quite lucky, actually.\" Sam nodded and looked up to make eye contact with Josie once more.rnUnnerved by his stare, Josie looked up and beyond him to notice that her car wasrnfinally at street level, and from the angle it sat, it didn't look too bad. Maybe sherncould just end up getting in her car and getting out of here and just try to pretendrnany of this had ever happened. \"Um…\" she began, sliding off the stretcher to a stand, and handing thernEMT his cold compress back. \"I think my car is ready. Maybe I can be on my wayrnnow.\" \"Whoa,\" the EMT said, frowning. \"We're not even sure yet if you have arnconcussion; I'm not sure I feel that comfortable letting you drive.\" Will concurred. \"Yes, Josie. Just because you feel okay right now doesn'trnmean that bump can't cause problems for you later. Besides, I'm not all that surernyour car will be drivable.\" Still, Josie pushed herself forward, stepping down the step and thenrnhopping to the ground, landing next to Sam. She wobbled for a moment, andrnwithout even thinking, Sam put out his hand to steady her. Pulling back fromrnhim as if his hand burned her, she stuttered, \"I'm sure everything will be just finernas long as I…\" She trailed off as Horace walked toward the group, his face grim. Having overheard the last bit of the conversation, he said, \"I'm sorry,rnMiss, but I'm afraid your car won't be going anywhere…not for a while at least.rnFront axle cracked from the impact with that tree.\" Josie felt tears of frustration welling up in her eyes, and she brushed themrnaway angrily. All she wanted was to get away from here…and mostly Sam…asrnsoon as possible, and it seemed that everything was working against her. \"But surely that's easy to fix, right?\" she asked, hopefully. \"No, ma'am. That'll require quite a bit of work, I'm afraid. I'm not sure if Irneven have the right part in stock, so I'd have to order it from Green Bay. Andrnwith the storm coming, I don't think I could get it fixed much before Wednesdayrnnext week.\" Dragging in a deep breath, she tried to keep from crying in earnest. Thenrnall of his statement registered and she asked, confused, \"What storm?\" All the men surrounding her looked at Josie in disbelief, including Sam.rnFinally it was Will who spoke. \"What storm? Ms. Geller, there is a blizzard onrnthe way…one of possibly monstrous proportions. You can't mean yourndidn't know?\" Shocked, she looked up at Sam's face for confirmation and found it there.rnTurning to look at the Sheriff, tears spilling over her lower lashes in silentrnanguish. Finally, she choked out, \"No, I didn't know.\" Irrationally angry at Josie for being so careless, Sam began, \"How couldrnyou…?\" but a look from Will silenced him. Josie straightened her shoulders defiantly. She'd be damned if SamrnCoulson was going to ridicule her! Ignoring him and talking directly to Will, shernsaid, \"Well, then I guess I'll have to make the best of it. Maybe you can drop mernoff at the nearest motel.\" Will looked at Rusty and Horace and then shuffled his feet. \"Well, ma'am,rnI could do that, but it's at least twenty miles from here...\" An uneasy silence fell with that revelation. As Sam looked at Josie's demoralized expression, something resurfaced inrnhis mind…his dream from last night: Josie calling out to him for help, and herncouldn't find her because of a thick white cloud surrounding them…the blizzardrnperhaps? And the same panicked feeling he'd had in that dream bubbled uprninside him. It was as if his memory of the dream was forcing the air from his lungs and herncouldn't breathe, as if there was a large brick sitting on his chest, making himrnreally fear that dream…and that something might actually happen to Josie tornmake that dream become a reality. After all, it seemed too damn coincidental thatrnhe would have that dream and then she suddenly appeared. Sam didn't think hernwould be able to live with himself if he didn't at least try to prevent thatrndream from happening, even if, for now, it was just that... a dream. What if it had it been a sign of some sort? That if he didn't watch over herrnsomething terrible would happen? Something that would make him lose herrnforever? His heart constricted at the thought of anything more happening tornJosie. No matter how angry, furious, frustrated, hurt he was at her, a part of himrncould not let her go…not now, not like this…not with that big white cloud of arnstorm coming. A huge sense of foreboding washed over him…as if his next words would be ofrnmonumental importance in his life. Although the angry part of him was screaming that he was insane, tellingrnhim not to do it, he couldn't stop his mouth from saying, barely above a whisper,rn\"She could stay with me...\" Both Will and Josie turned to Sam, incredulous. \"Wh…what did you say?\"rnJosie choked out with shock. It was too late to take the offer back, and Sam knew it. Clearing his throat,rnhe looked directly at Josie and with a challenging, defiant tone repeated, \"Yourncould stay with me.\" Josie was shaking her head even before she said,rn\"No…no…I… couldn't ...\" Sighing his impatience, Sam got right to the point. \"You and I both knowrnthere's no other logical solution. You don't have anywhere else to go.\" Will thought to himself that he would have been willing to take her homernand have he and his wife Meredith put her up through the storm, but decidedrninstead to see how this scene would play itself out and stayed quiet. Sam continued, \"And when the car is ready, I'll drive you into town andrnyou can be on your way.\" He wished he felt as reasonable and cool as hernsounded. So there it was. Sam was being polite, but in reality, he couldn't wait tornsee her gone. Tears pricked Josie's eyes again, but she refused to let them fall andrnblinked them back. She wasn't going to give Sam the satisfaction of seeing herrnhurt more than he already had. Turning on her heel, Josie walked over to her mangled car, shoved openrnthe creaking driver's side door and yanked her keys from the ignition. Sherngrabbed her purse from the floor of the car and started shoving all herrnbelongings back into it, sighing when she saw the smashed cellular phone inrnpieces. Climbing back out, she walked to the back of the sedan and unlocked therntrunk, grabbing her overnight bag and the padded laptop case. Slamming therntrunk, she walked back over to the group of men with her head held high. Shernheld out the key ring to Horace, who relieved her of it. Finally, she turned backrnto face Sam. He was right; she didn't have anywhere else to go, and they bothrnknew it. There really wasn't a question of whether she would accept hisrnoffer…she had to. She knew that no matter his feelings for her, he would be arngentleman. 'Nothing to worry about there,' she snickered to herself. 'I'll be luckyrnif he says three words to me the entire time!' And if he could be so cold andrncalculating about it, then darn it, so could she. With a monotonic voice, she said,rn\"Fine. If we're going, let's go.\" Nodding in farewell to the other men, she turnedrnand started walking toward the Blazer. Almost in a daze, Sam shook hands with Will and said goodbye to thernothers. Will extracted a promise from Sam that he would call if Josie showed anyrnsigns of worsening. Then Sam turned and started to follow Josie back to his car. Suddenly he stopped short, watching Josie's body swaying with arnwomanly gait as she carried her load toward his vehicle. Panicked, the onlyrnthought to cross his mind was, Oh my God…what have I done? - - -[Chapter 4] Snowbound,rnPart 4 ByrnRocknVaughn - - - Evenrnthough it was bitterly cold, Sam felt his palms start to sweat.rnWithout even realizing it, he stared off in Josie's direction asrnhis thoughts took over. He wasn't quite sure now how it hadrnhappened, but the safe haven he'd created for himself had, in thernblink of an eye, become his prison. Instead of days of quiet solitudernthat he'd planned to use to purge all traces of Josie Geller fromrnhis heart, now he'd be spending every waking moment in thernforeseeable future trapped in a tiny three-room cabin with her. So much for working her out of my system , he thought. SomehowrnSam knew that after these next few days, there would be no way herncould ever forget her. As Josie reached the passenger side of the Blazer, she suddenly feltrnSam's eyes burning a hole into her back. Turning, Josie noticedrnthat instead of looking at her, he seemed to be looking rightrnthrough her. He appeared trapped in his thoughts, and by the look onrnhis face; they weren't happy ones. In fact, he looked like a manrnwho had just been given a death sentence. Hurt and annoyed by his obvious revulsion to their predicament, Josiernglared at Sam and hissed, \"Sam!\" Sam didn't respond. \"Sam!\" she snapped again, a little louder this time. The urgent irritation bubbling in Josie's voice broke through Sam'srnreverie. Shaking his head as though waking from a dream, his eyesrnconnected with hers, a bit dazed. \"Huh?\" Josie glanced behind Sam and noticed the sheriff watching theirrnexchange with barely concealed interest. Embarrassed at the scenernthey were making, she said waspishly, a blush reddening her cheeks,rn\"Are you coming?\" The moment seemed almost surreal to Sam, but he recovered enough tornsilently nod his head and spur his legs into action. Satisfied, Josie nodded once in response and then opened thernpassenger side door, pushing her belongings along the bench seat andrnclimbing in. Turning, she struggled to pull the creaky door shut.rnOnce inside, Josie knelt on the seat and placed her computer bag andrnovernight suitcase on the floor behind her seat. As Sam approached the car, he looked up through the windshield. Hisrnmouth dropped open a little and he just stared at the enticing viewrnof Josie's behind swaying as she leaned her petite body over thernback of the bench seat. Clapping his mouth shut abruptly, Sam closedrnhis eyes, scolding himself mentally, Get a grip, Sam! Just…stayrnangry with her and you'll be fine. Samrndidn't even want to consider what might happen to both his heartrnand his psyche if he wasn't successful at keeping that mentalrnbarrier between himself and Josie in place. Josie was just settling back down into a sitting position when Samrnyanked open his door, using more force than was necessary, makingrnJosie look up at him in surprise. Sam barely acknowledged herrnpresence before turning the key, which was still in the ignition. Herngunned the engine with impatient aggression, earning him anotherrnquestioning look from Josie. She made a show of retightening herrnseatbelt and clutching her purse closer to her chest, but she didn'trnsay a word. Hell, with the scowl that Sam knew must be on his face, she probablyrndidn't dare, and that was all right with him. The less they said torneach other, the better off they would be, in his opinion. Putting the Blazer into gear, Sam maneuvered slowly around all thernvehicles blocking the road, waving a hand in farewell to Will Parkerrnas they passed. Will raised a hand in return and started down the street, watchingrnthe Blazer growing smaller and smaller as the seconds ticked by.rnThere was something about Josie Geller that made him wonder. Evenrnthough she was from Chicago, and apparently had never been in Oswegornbefore in her life, he had the feeling he'd seen her someplacernbefore. And he knew that he hadn't heard about her from Sam… Sam. From his strange reaction to the situation as a whole, Will knewrnthere was unfinished business between Sam and Josie and wondered whatrnit might be. He'd never seen Sam so agitated; usually Sam wasrnincredibly laid back and friendly…but not with this woman. WithrnJosie, he'd been uptight…even borderline hostile at times. Butrnyet, he'd come over to the ambulance to see if she was all rightrnand then made the mind-boggling offer to put her up at his cabinrnthrough the storm. Will smiled at that memory, because it seemed thatrnSam was as surprised that he'd made the offer as he and Josie hadrnbeen at hearing it. Will was not the type that normally meddled into others' affairsrnwithout cause, but he had to admit, his curiosity was piqued. Headingrnback toward the squad car, Will climbed in and fastened his seatrnbelt. While it seemed that the report on this accident could bernconsidered a formality in this case, he knew that he had the means ofrnfinding out a bit more about the puzzling Josie. And in thisrnsituation, he figured he could use every detail he could get. Thernrelationship between Sam and Josie was certainly a mystery, but thenrnsolving mysteries was what he liked to do best; the minute he gotrnback to the office, he would start working on finding out the answer. - - - The silence in the car was deafening. Josie sat stiffly in her seat, nervously clutching her purse to herrnchest so hard that her fingertips were white. The back of her headrnwas still sore and her temples throbbed in pain. She stared out thernpassenger side window at the endless row of pine trees, theirrnbranches all weighed down with snow. Under other circumstances, Josiernwould have thought it beautiful; like a living Christmas card, but atrnthe moment she was way too tense to notice. Glancing over at Sam, she could tell by his clenched jaw andrnunwavering attention on the road that he was still upset. Trying to break the ice a little, Josie cleared her throat, earningrnher an icy glare from Sam for her trouble. So she waited. But finally, Josie couldn't take the pressurernbuilding up in the thick quiet between them. She gathered up enoughrncourage to begin, \"Sam, I…\" But Sam cut her off before she could get two words into what she wasrnabout to say. \" Don't ,\" he said scathingly, while wavesrnof hatred emanated from him. Josie nearly jumped from his brutal tone, and turned to study hisrnprofile. Sam's eyes glittered dangerously, and his jaw was set in arnstubborn line. Still, she dared ask, \"Don't what?\" \"Don't bother apologizing,\" Sam spat, not even bothering tornspare a glance at Josie. \"The time for that is way past, andrntruthfully, I'm not interested in what you have to say anymore, sorndon't waste your breath.\" Sam's rough words cut Josie deeply and she found herself blinkingrnback tears. After all, this was the man she loved, and it was quiternclear he couldn't bear even the sight of her in return. She took arnfew deep breaths in order to keep from sobbing…but then Josie'srneyes began to narrow in anger from his abrupt attack. Frankly, she was getting sick of Sam's treatment of her. While itrnmight be true that she had hurt him in the past, she had certainlyrndone nothing today to deserve this kind of reaction. And Josie wasrnnot the hesitant mouse that she used to be. Dealing with the long,rnlonely months after Sam had walked out of her life had forced her tornbecome strong; to be her own advocate, since it was clear she wouldrnnever have someone to do it for her. Even though she still missed Samrnterribly, she was strong: stronger than she'd ever imagined being,rnand she wanted him to know it. Refusing to show Sam even an inkling that he may have hurt her, shernsat up ramrod straight in the seat, lifting her head proudly. Thenrnshe turned to him, her voice dripping with disdain, and repliedrncoolly, \"For your information, that was not what I was goingrnto say. Now, if you'll kindly refrain from being an ignorant assrnfor a moment, I'll tell you what I was going to say…\" Sam turned to look at Josie briefly, waiting…and even a bitrnsurprised at her composed and dignified response. This was not thernreaction he'd been expecting. With a big sigh, Josie said, \"I was simply going to say thank you…\" \"For what?\" Sam asked, surprised. \"For taking me in…for putting me up when it's clearly obviousrnthat you can't stand the idea of even being in the same state with me, let alone stuck in a cabin through a snowstorm together…\"rnJosie explained, pain and scorn coloring her voice, even through herrnbravado. Sam felt instantly abashed. Josie had swallowed her pride in thankingrnhim, even after he'd just verbally attacked her. He could at leastrndo the same. \"Josie…uh…Look, I'm sorry about jumping all over you likernthat. It's just that…well, this isn't exactly the idealrnsituation…for either of us,\" Sam began, glancing at her beforernturning back to the road. \"We're going to have to make the bestrnof things for the next few days…and it would be much easier, in myrnopinion, if we could leave the past in the past and just deal withrnnow.\" Josie considered Sam's request for a long moment. As much as shernreally wanted to know the reasons for Sam's behavior so many monthsrnago, Josie realized that Sam's suggestion probably made more sensernin their current circumstances. If they were going to be stuck withrneach other for a while, they might as well make things as pleasant asrnpossible. Finally, she looked up and connected with Sam's eyes and nodded.rn\"Okay…if you think it's best, we…we can just pretend the pastrndoesn't exist.\" Relieved, Sam agreed. \"Yeah, I think that's best.\" The rest of the ride back to the cabin was quiet, both of themrnretreating into their own thoughts. - - - Will Parker sighed as he pulled his squad car into its parking spacernin front of Oswego's combination Sheriff/Fire Department building.rnIt was shaping up to be a long day and night for him…maybe even arnlong week. Even though he got off duty at four, as Sheriff, he wouldrnstill have to be involved in all major decisions during the blizzard.rnThat could make for some very long nights. Once more, his friend Sam came to mind…that and the bizarrerninteraction between him and Josie Geller. Again as he thought her, hernfelt somehow as if he should know that name. Reaching across the seat, he grabbed his clipboard with the paperworkrnfrom the accident on it and popped open his door. Slamming it shutrnbehind him, he strode up the front steps and entered the brickrnbuilding. \"Hey, Cap…how'd it go with that accident? Anyone hurt?\" askedrnMary, the station's dispatcher. \"Everyone's pretty much fine, Mar, thanks. The woman bumped herrnhead pretty good, but other than that, she was damn lucky.\" Mary nodded her encouragement, hinting with her twinkling brown eyesrnthat she'd like more details. But Will wasn't in the mood to oblige her. \"Sorry, Mar…norngossip today. I want to get this paperwork done so I can get home tornMeredith and the kids before the storm hits.\" Mary stared after Will, who was deep in thought as he headed down thernhallway toward his office. She was good at picking up on undertonesrnand right now, her antennae were beeping full force. Will preoccupiedrnby something, that was for sure…she just wished she knew what itrnwas. - - - As the Blazer crested the last rise in the road, Josie looked up fromrnher hands that were twisting nervously together in her lap. Beforernher the driveway curled to end before a small, quaint log cabin withrnSam's little black Jetta parked out in front. Behind it, she couldrnsee an inlet of Lake Michigan through a clearing between thernsnow-covered evergreens. As Sam pulled the car to a stop, Josierncontinued to stare off in the distance, out toward the lake. Withoutrneven realizing she was speaking aloud, Josie murmured, \"It's sornpeaceful here. I can see why you would like it.\" Sam turned to stare in surprise at the unknowing Josie. Her reactionrnwas so different from when he had brought Lara here. Ha! he laughed to himself. That trip had been a disaster. Samrnhad planned a romantic getaway for he and Lara last summer, thinkingrnthat the time away would help them recapture some of their previousrnaffection for each other. The magic of that weekend had lastedrnprecisely three seconds: just long enough for Lara to get dirt on herrn$300 Gucci shoes. Once she'd found out the cabin didn't even haverna telephone, she'd insisted on turning around and going right backrnto \"civilization.\" However, Sam had always loved the rustic beauty of the cabin and itsrnsurroundings and it was plain to see that Josie did, too. The wonderrnon her face brought back memories of Josie standing in front of hisrnsenior English Lit class, reading her paper on Rosalind and Orlando.rnHe had been transfixed then, just as he felt now. Forcing himself back to the moment, he said to Josie, breaking herrnreverie, \"Well, we should probably get inside.\" Josie turned to look at Sam blankly for a moment before nodding inrnagreement. She unfastened her seat belt and then turned to reachrnbehind the seat to recover her bags. Sam's hand on her arm stoppedrnher. Josie looked up at him in question. \"I'll get those,\" Sam said, gently pulling her hand back,rnbefore reaching over the bench seat for the bags himself. \"No, really, I can…\" Josie started, speaking to his back as hernretrieved her computer case and overnight bag. \" No ,\" Sam said firmly, turning back around with bags inrnhand, \"Josie, you were in an accident today, and you did bump your head. For all we know, you could have a concussion. I'mrnnot letting you carry anything you don't need to.\" Sam's sense of chivalry (albeit belated, since she'd carried herrnbags to the car just fine…) made Josie smile just a bit.rnMaybe not everything about him had changed… Jokingly shernsaid, \"Yes, doctor.\" \"Josie…\" Sam began, unaware that he was slipping into 'teacherrnmode'. He just wanted to make sure she realized how important itrnwas for her to take it easy after such an injury. \"I'm serious.rnYou really should…\" \"Sam,\" Josie interrupted. \"Relax. I was kidding.\" Then shernopened her door and slid down gently to the ground to minimize thernjarring of her head. Sam followed her lead. Josie carefully negotiated her way along thernsnow-covered path to the door of the cabin. When she reached therndoor, she looked back at Sam in question. \"Go ahead,\" he responded to her unspoken request. Nodding, Josie opened the door and stepped a few feet inside. Lookingrnaround, she saw a rather large living room, just the kind she wouldrnhave imagined: a large double window on the same wall the door wasrnon, a long wooden bench whose seat lifted to stow things beneathrnlined most of the area below the window. Wide, wooden planks coveredrnthe floor and thick, exposed beams crossed above her head. Off to herrnleft, a huge old, oak bookcase filled to the brim with books stoodrnalong the back wall, and an overstuffed sofa and a side table betweenrntwo chairs filled the area in front of the huge stone hearth. In thernspace on the floor between the sofa and chairs lay a large, thickrnsheepskin rug. Beyond the sofa were two open doorways along the wallrnfacing her. The left doorway led to a homey kitchen with the cabinetsrnand a counter that took up the whole back wall, a small table in therncenter and an old cast iron cooking stove off to the left side of thernroom. The right doorway led into what seemed to be, from Josie'srnperspective, a bedroom. She could see a large dresser along the wallrnof the room that adjoined the kitchen, but from her angle, that wasrnit. Josie turned to find Sam watching her intently. A twinge of blush touched Josie's cheeks when she realized she'drninadvertently left Sam standing in the doorway, unable to enter thernroom far enough to even shut the door. \"Sorry,\" she apologized,rnmoving aside so that Sam could skirt around her. \"I wasrnjust…looking around. It's…nice. Cozy,\" she said. Sam gave Josie a short nod and then placed her bags on the bench nearrnthe door. Turning to go back outside, he said stiffly, \"Well, makernyourself comfortable…I've got some supplies to get out of thernback of the Blazer.\" Josie took another step into the room, but then stopped short as shernsuddenly remembered something. Facing Sam's retreating back, sherncalled, \"Sam?\" With a sigh, he turned back around. He'd been hoping to get backrnoutside and put his thoughts in order. Right now, he felt oddlyrnoff-kilter…and he didn't like the feeling. \"Yes?\" \"Um…May I use the phone? I need to let someone know where I amrnand give the paper a status report of my story…\" Josie stammeredrnon as Sam's expression quickly darkened, \"I…I wouldn't askrnexcept…my cell phone was badly damaged in the accident. It'srnunusable.\" \"The cabin doesn't have a phone,\" Sam coldly informedrnher before turning on his heel and stalking off. Josie stared after him in wounded confusion. Trying to keep up withrnSam's quicksilver emotions was starting to make her head spin. Now what had she done? Sam stomped off toward the Blazer, mentally fuming. Damned if shernisn't just like Lara after all , he thought heatedly. Her andrnthat damned job of hers. Nothing else mattered to Josie but herrnprecious newspaper! It was no wonder that she had been able to justrnblithely use him for her own purposes. Her emotional attachment to him, if it had even been real, was purelyrnan accidental side-effect. He was sure of that. Sam walked around to the back of the vehicle, tossing open the backrndoor viciously, letting it bang against the side roughly. Packing hisrnarms as full as he could with supplies, he marched back to the cabin,rnshoved open the door roughly with his foot and unceremoniously dumpedrnhis handful onto the bench next to Josie's things. Sam went back out and retrieved the remainder of the items from thernback, slamming the back door of the Blazer shut with his right elbow.rnEntering the cabin again and kicking the door closed with his foot,rnhe put the rest of the supplies on the floor and turned to face Josiernagain. Other than backing up another step or two into the room, Josiernseemed glued to the spot, watching him with a touch of fear in herrneyes. Sam looked Josie up and down. She was dressed very much like Lararnused to dress: black business suit with black heels…and it wasrnutterly useless in this weather. \"Well? Are you going to change?rnYou aren't really planning on keeping warm in that outfitrnthe next few days, are you?\" Josie looked down at herself in stunned silence for a moment beforernreplying, \"I…I don't have anything else…just this andrnanother suit.\" Again, this was reminiscent of something Lara would have said andrndone; but coming from Josie, for some reason it annoyed him ten timesrnmore. Walking up to her, Sam put his hands on his hips and gloweredrndown at her. \"What kind of complete idiot doesn't havernenough common sense to pack any warm clothes in the middle ofrnwinter?\" Sam pointed at Josie's feet, deriding, \"A fat lot ofrngood those heels will do you in three feet of snow!\" Hackles raised, Josie also put her hands on her hips and leaned inrntoward Sam, barking, \"Well, if I'd known I was going to be stuckrnin a storm , of course I would have packed warm clothes!rnHowever, this was supposed to be just a simple overnight businessrntrip, not survivalist training camp!\" The two of them stood for a long moment, each glaring at the other,rnchests heaving from angry exertion. Finally, Sam took a step back andrnturned to go into the bedroom. Over his shoulder, he said to Josie inrna sullen manner, \"I'll be right back…\" Moments later, he returned, carrying a pair of snow boots, heavy bluernjeans and an oversized sweater. Holding them out to Josie, he said inrna more neutral tone, \"Here, you can wear these.\" Josie took themrnfrom Sam as he continued, \"The boots and pants are my sisterrnAbby's. She's about your size, so maybe they'll fit. She andrnher husband live in San Francisco now; they don't get up to therncabin much anymore. Besides, under the circumstances, I don't thinkrnshe'd mind if you used them. I couldn't find anything with herrnthings that resembled a warm shirt, though, so the sweater is mine.\" Josie looked down at the pile of clothing in her hand, and then backrnup to Sam again. He was making no sense at all today. One minute hernwas looking at her coldly and calling her an idiot, and the next he'srnproducing clothes for her to wear to keep her warm. Assuming this was Sam's attempt at some sort of apology, Josie saidrnquietly, \"Thank you.\" Clearing his throat self-consciously, Sam said, \"You're welcome.rnUm…you can change in there.\" Sam pointed toward the bedroom. Nodding, Josie replied, \"Okay,\" and headed off in that direction.rnWatching her feet as she carefully stepped across the raisedrnthreshold, she glanced up and stopped dead in her tracks. Then sherngasped and her arms went slack, the clothes and boots falling fromrnher hands to the floor with a dull thud. Sam, hearing the noise and fearing the worst, raced into the bedroomrnto find Josie standing stock-still, staring at the bed, the clothingrnshe was carrying now piled at her feet on the floor. Worried thatrnsomething was wrong, that maybe a concussion was starting to set in,rnhe asked softly, \"Josie? Are you okay?\" Josie didn't hear Sam's approach, nor did she hear him speak. Sherncould only hear her own blood rushing in her ears. The bed…it wasrnthe bed from her dream; the dream from last night: the one thatrnfinally made her give up on sleep and get up early. Everything aboutrnit was the same: the brass headboard, the handmade quilt…everything.rnAn eerie sense of déjà vu settled over her and she feltrnsuddenly lightheaded. To Sam's distress, Josie didn't answer, and now she actuallyrnseemed to wobble as if she were about to fall over. Without arnsecond's hesitation, Sam scooped Josie up in his arms, carried herrnto the bed, set her carefully on it, and then sat down next to herrnand put his arm around her to steady her. \"Josie? Are you allrnright? Is your head hurting you?\" Josie turned toward the sound of Sam's voice in a daze. For arnmoment, it was as if the dream and the reality had merged into one.rnBut then, she came to herself, focusing on Sam's troubled face.rn\"I…Yeah…yeah, I'm fine now.\" Unconvinced, he said, \"Maybe we really should get you to thernhospital.\" Josie sat bolt upright, protesting, \"No! No…I mean, really, I'mrnfine. I was just…thinking of something, that's all. I didn'trnhear you.\" Sam found Josie's excuse highly suspect, but didn't push thernissue further. It was obvious that she wasn't the slightest bitrninterested in going to the hospital. Instead he nodded, appearing tornaccept her explanation, and stood up. \"Well, then, let me give yournsome privacy so you can change…\" He crossed the room and closedrnthe door behind him, leaving Josie alone. OncernSam was outside the room and had safely closed the door, he saggedrnback against the wall limply. Sam turned back and stared at thernclosed bedroom door for several seconds, laying his hand across hisrnbeating heart. It was still racing and his breath was still notrnsteady. When he'd heard that loud thump, he'd thought that Josiernhad fainted or even lost consciousness, that maybe she was hurt morernseriously than the EMTs thought. And it had scared the hell out ofrnhim. Even now, he wasn't feeling overly confident that she wasrnreally all right. He thought back once again at his crazy, spur of the moment offer tornstay with him through the storm, and the fear of his dream that hadrnmotivated it. For someone who supposedly no longer meant anything tornhim, he sure had a lot of reaction to the possibility of losing her.rnAs much as he'd hoped otherwise, Josie Geller still had the powerrnto affect him in a big way…and he hated her for it. - - -[Chapter 5] Snowbound,rnPart 5 ByrnRocknVaughn - - - After Samrnhad once again left her alone in the bedroom, Josie heaved a hugernsigh of relief and hugged herself. Slowly she looked again around thernroom. She tried to convince herself that it was only her imagination;rnthat it wasn't possible that this was the same room she'd dreamedrnabout. After all, she'd never, ever been here before and it wasrnonly a dream. But she couldn't shake the feeling. Closingrnher eyes, she could see the room of her dream as clearly as if itrnwere right in front of her. It had the same rough-hewn wooden walls,rnthe same oil lamp on the bedside table, the same print of a GeorgiarnO'Keefe flower on the wall over the bed. Behind her was the samerndoorway (which led to the bathroom) and at the foot of the bedrnagainst the wall facing it was the same tall walnut dresser withrnmatching oval mirror above it. And yes,rnit was the exact same quilt on the bed. It was what some would call arn\"Crazy Quilt\": just patches of off white and pastel print piecesrnsewn together in no apparent pattern. Every so often there was arnlittle tuft of tied off-white yarn holding the batting in place. But it wasrnthe content of her dream that really had her head spinning, if onlyrnjust for its apparent impossibility, even, and actually especially because of her current circumstances… In herrndream, she had been only half awake; the bright sun shone through thernwindow, trying to rouse her. Trying to ignore the call of morning,rnshe snuggled more deeply into the comfort of the quilt…and foundrnthat it was not the blanket that made her feel so snuggly warm. Itrnwas the male form spooned in behind her, pressed up closely fromrnshoulder to ankle. His arm was protectively around her and itrninstinctively tightened to pull her even closer to him as shernstirred. She could feel his breath whispering across her ear as herndrifted back to sleep and she felt wonderful, content. And there wasrnabsolutely no question that the man from her dream had been Sam. Sighingrnsadly at the hopelessness of that dream ever coming true, she gotrnback to the task of changing into warmer clothes. Stripping off herrnwork suit, she tried on the pants first. They felt slightly tight onrnher, but knew that in a couple of minutes of her wearing them, theyrnwould fit fine; they were just a bit stiff from lack of use. Then sherntried on the boots; they also fit closely enough to get by with.rnStaring at Sam's sweater spread across the bed, she tried tornremember if she'd ever seen him wear it, but then realized it wouldrnhave been out of season for such a heavy sweater by the time she'drnentered his class in March. She picked it up and held it to her face,rnbreathing in deeply. Oh yes, it smelled like him…there was even arnhint of his aftershave on the collar. Climbing inside of it, Josiernfound the sweater was made of a soft, brushed cotton on therninside…and with Sam's scent surrounding her she felt almost ifrnhis arms were around her. Standingrnup, the sweater fell ¾ of the way to her knees and well pastrnher hands. Shoving the sleeves back, she rolled them a few timesrnuntil her hands emerged again. Looking down at herself, she did have to admit that this was infinitely warmer and more sensible forrnthe impending weather. Josiernthought about Sam and his strange behavior again. It was as if…rnhe'd fall back into the habit of caring about her and then he'drncatch himself doing it…and be angry with himself for caring at all.rnAnd so far, he'd done it several times today. By now,rnJosie was so confused as to Sam's real feelings for her, she wasrnafraid to assume anything at all. After all, it could just be that hernwas doing for her what he would have done for anyone in her position,rnshe told herself silently as she studied her image in the mirror overrnthe dresser. Her reflection told her it was still the same old Josie,rnexcept now she had a surge of conflicting emotions swimming in therndepths of her eyes, and Josie knew for sure it was because of seeingrnSam again. Straightening her shoulders and watching her reflection dornthe same; she nodded once in encouragement and then opened the door. - - - Trying torntake his mind off of the mental picture of Josie undressing just feetrnaway behind that closed bedroom door, he got to work cleaning the ashrnfrom the bottom of the hearth, laying in new wood and kindling, andrntrying to light a new fire. Kneeling beside the open area, Samrnpressed both hands to the floor and leaned forward to softly blow atrnthe smoldering kindling, trying to get it to light. After a moment,rnthe spark flared and dribbled along the length of the kindling,rnstarting the fire in earnest. Pushing off his hands, he brushed thernthin layer of ash from them and pushed up to one knee just as hernheard the bedroom door creak open. Almostrnagainst his will, Sam turned his head to stare at Josie. His sister'srnjeans seemed to hug her every curve as if they'd been painted onrnher. He'd never seen her in anything so form fitting, even thernCapri pants she used to wear at school. And he couldn't even seernher backside, which was covered by the sweater. He felt his mouthrnwater just at the prospect of what that must look like… Hisrneyes traveled higher, thinking that her in his bulky sweater wouldrnseem less appealing than the jeans. He wasrnwrong. Something about the way it dwarfed her, the way it hung almostrnto her knees and how she'd had to roll up the sleeves to make itrnfit made her seem small and vulnerable. It brought out all thernprotective instincts in him. For just a moment, Sam fought the urgernto cross the room and enfold her into his arms and tell her thatrneverything would be all right. Coming to his senses, his eyesrncontinued upward, over the swell of her breasts, softly accentuatedrneven under the thick cotton knit. Continuing up to her face, Josie'srneyes seemed huge in the gentle ambient light being cast from therngrowing fire behind him; her skin seemed to glow. And her hair wasrnnow softer around her face and slightly tousled from pulling thernsweater on over her head. Unbidden,rnSam's mind conjured up images of being the one to remove thatrnsweater, to see if the rest of her skin was as creamy and as kissablernsoft as her face seemed to be…for her hair to be tousled because ofrnhis fingers running through its silkiness, for her eyes to seem hugernand glowing from his touch and for no other reason. Raw desire grewrnin the pit of his stomach and surprised Sam with its sudden ferocity. Standingrnabruptly, he brushed the ash from his knees and turned his back tornher swiftly. He knew it was only a matter of time before the feelingrnin the pit of his stomach moved lower, and the knowledge of that madernhim feel more vulnerable. Clearingrnhis throat, he prayed his voice wouldn't give away his feelingsrnwhen he said, \"Hi…ahem…glad to see everything fits okay.\" Josiernstared at Sam's back for a moment, watching as he puttered aroundrnthe living room area straightening rugs and plumping pillows. Hernseemed alight with nervous energy all of a sudden and pondered overrnthe reason for it. At least his greeting seemed non-aggressive, evenrnif his prolonged stare was unsettling. Shernresponded softly, \"Yes, it all seems to…thanks.\" Sam'srnhead bobbed in acknowledgement of her statement, but he still did notrnturn around. Instead, he walked over to the huge bookcase along thernback wall, pretending to study the titles of the books, when inrnreality he was trying to get a handle on his wayward thoughts. Josiernfollowed Sam over to the bookcase, standing next to him, perusing therntitles and was not at all surprised to find the bookcase filled tornoverflowing with classic works of all sorts. \"Wow…this is quite arncollection,\" she said, carefully pulling a hardcover copy of ThernCatcher in the Rye off the shelf and leafing through it. Sam lookedrndown at Josie for a moment in response to her comment, which was arnbig mistake. With her standing right next to him, he smell the fruityrnshampoo she always used, along with a soft, sweet scent of peachrnblossoms that used to drive him insane whenever she'd stand overrnhim at his desk at South Glen. Quickly moving his line of sight backrnto the bookshelf, he explained, \"My father has been collectingrnbooks for ages. This is just his overflow…you should see thernbookshelves he has back home.\" \"Really?\"rnJosie exclaimed, interested. \"That must be some collection…\"rnFlipping the book closed, she was about to slide it back on the shelfrnwhen she noticed the photo of the author J.D. Salinger on the backrncover of the book. Gasping, she opened the book again, carefullyrnchecking the front inside flap of the dust jacket and the copyrightrnpage of the book. HearingrnJosie's gasp, Sam asked, \"What's the matter?\" Looking uprnto Sam in awe, she said, \"Sam, is your father aware that this is arnfirst edition of this book?\" \"What?rnHow do you know?\" Sam looked down at the book cradled in Josie'srnhands. \"Well, Irnhad a suspicion when I saw Salinger's picture on the back cover.rnOnly the very earliest printings of this book have it. The story goesrnthat he hated it so much, he insisted it be removed from all furtherrnprintings. And this dust jacket,\" she said, flipping to the frontrnend flap, \"has the $3.00 price on it, which means it isn't a bookrnclub edition, because they didn't list a price. But the kicker isrnthis,\" she said, opening the book back up to the copyright page andrnpointing with her finger. \"It says right here that it's a firstrnedition…see?\" Sam'srneyes widened as he saw the words \"First Edition\" just abovernJosie's finger on the page. \"Wow! No, I very much doubt he hasrnany idea… He collects books simply because he's an avid reader,rnnot for investment purposes. I'm sure he probably bought that atrnsomeone's yard sale years ago or something.\" Looking down atrnJosie again, he said, \"How do you know so much about this stuff?\" Josiernblushed a little with embarrassment. \"Well, for fun one semester inrncollege, I took a class on how to identify rare books and to graderntheir condition. It was really fascinating. This one is in beautifulrnshape, especially considering how frail the dust jacket on thisrnparticular title is rumored to be. Apparently being here at the cabinrnhas been good for it.\" Sherngingerly handed the book to Sam and for a moment their fingers grazedrneach other's. A jolt of electricity shot between them and theyrnstared at each other for a long moment before they both turned awayrnabruptly. Josie nervously backed off and went over to the bench seatrnto collect her bags. \"Um…where should I put my things?\" Sam,rncaught up in the wonder of holding such a rare book in his hands andrnalso in the swirling feelings cast over him by Josie, took a longrnmoment to answer. \"You can just take them into the bedroom if yournwant. You'll be staying in there.\" \"Butrnthen…where will you sleep?\" Josie really hadn't meant to askrnthe question aloud. She was simply thinking to herself about he mustrnhave meant to sleep in there, since his things were in there, and nowrnwhere would he go? Would he still want to sleep in there…with her?rnHer heart pounded dangerously at the idea of that, especially inrnlight of last night's dream. She tried to reason that was probablyrnnot his intention, but if not…and that's when her mouth took overrnand spoke the question that occupied her brain. Thernsincere confusion in Josie's voice told Sam this was not some sortrnof coy invitation…the kind that Lara might have offered in herrnposition. Trying once again to force the very appealing vision ofrnsleeping with Josie from his mind, he answered, \"I brought arnsleeping bag with me…I can just crash in front of the hearth on thernsheepskin.\" Aghast,rnJosie sputtered, \"But…but…it's your house…I'm justrnthe interloper… I should be the one to…\" Finally,rnSam turned and made eye contact with Josie. His darkened, intenserngaze silenced her mid-sentence. \"Sorry, Josie. This isrnnon-negotiable. My mother taught me to have good manners, and theyrndictate that when there's only one bed, the guest sleeps in it.rnBesides, I slept out here last night and it was perfectlyrncomfortable.\" Sam internally winced at that half-truth. \"Irnwouldn't exactly call myself a guest …\" Josie muttered. \"Josie…\"rnSam said with his \"teacher's warning\" tone. \"It's settled.rnBesides, you're hurt. I'm not going to let you sleep on a hardrnfloor with that egg on the back of your head.\" Then he placed thernbook in his hand carefully back into its place on the shelf andrnwalked over to her, relieving her of her baggage. \"And besides, Irnthought I told you that you weren't allowed to carry this stuff?\"rnThen he walked off toward the bedroom, leaving Josie to trail behindrnhim. FollowingrnSam, she continued to protest, \"Sam…come on. They probably weighrnten pounds total. I'm not dying…I just bumped my head. Really.\" \"Well,rnI'm not taking any chances, and neither should you. The last thingrneither of us needs is an emergency trip to the hospital at the heightrnof the storm. I highly doubt it'd be much fun spending Christmasrnlaid up in bed in a strange place like that.\" Josiernpaled and stopped in her tracks in the doorway of the bedroom. In thernmeantime, Sam carefully laid her bags onto the bed and turned aroundrnto find a dejected-looking Josie slumped against the doorframe.rn\"What?\" he asked. Looking uprnto see Sam watching her, she tried to cover her misery. \"Oh,rnnothing.\" Sam simplyrnraised an eyebrow at her and continued to stare. Sighingrnsadly, Josie admitted, \"Your mention of Christmas just made mernrealize that there are a lot of people who are going to be veryrnworried about me…and I don't have any way of letting them knowrnI'm okay. I…feel bad that they will be so worried when I'mrnreally all right.\" Sam put arnhand on her shoulder and said, \"I'm sorry. I didn't even thinkrnof that when you asked about the phone earlier. I…I have a cellrnphone in the Blazer. You can use that to let people know where yournare. I'll go get it.\" As Samrnwent to retrieve his cellular phone from the car, his mind was awhirlrnwith emotions. As much as he'd tried to hold onto his anger, asrnsoon as he'd seen Josie standing there in his sweater and thosernpainted-on blue jeans, the thought had vanished from his mind. It wasrnhard to stay mad at someone who wouldn't give you any reasons to bernthat way. Other than standing up to him when he had been yelling atrnher, Josie hadn't said or done one thing that he could honestlyrnfind fault with. And whatrnwas more, the longer he was around her, the more he seemed to see thern\"old Josie\" in her…the one he had once thought her to be. Shernstill blushed prettily whenever he noticed her, and she was stillrnjust as excited and animated about anything having to do withrnliterature, as evidenced by her reaction to his father's bookshelfrnand in finding that first edition book. So, Samrnwondered as he reached inside the Blazer and pulled the phone fromrnits charging cradle, what did this mean? Did it mean that Josiernreally was the person he'd once believed her to be? Or didrnit simply mean he hadn't learned a thing from the heartache he'drnsuffered all this time and he was just as gullible and vulnerable tornher charms? It was an answer he wasn't sure he wanted to know. - - - Josiernstared after Sam as he walked out the door of the cabin toward thernBlazer. There he went, being all nice and considerate to her again,rnand she didn't know what she was supposed to think. She smiledrnsoftly as she thought back to a few minutes before when they'd beenrnin front of the bookcase. For those few moments, things had been likernthey once were: camaraderie, friendship, and love of a commonrninterest. And there had been more, oh yes. Something they used tornhave even when they hadn't wanted it to be there: chemistry. Shernfelt it every time he looked at her, every time he touched her, andrnfrom his reaction when their fingers had touched when she'd passedrnthe book to him, he'd felt it too. Gosh,rnshe'd been standing so close to him that she could feel his bodyrnheat warming her. And why was it that when he smiled down at her, thernrest of the world seemed to dim? 'Oh,rnJosie,' she warned herself, 'don't set yourself up for a fallrnagain. You're reading things that aren't there into hisrnreactions… The reaction you should be paying attention tornwas his near revulsion of you in the car, his snapping at her whenrnshe'd asked for the phone. Those were his real emotions…thernrest is just \"manners\", as he had called them.' Remembering thernicy look in his eyes when he'd told her, \"Don't botherrnapologizing,\" made her shiver involuntarily. Idly, she ran herrnhands up and down her arms, trying to rub the coldness from her. - - - As Samrnsprinted back in from the car, he could feel the easterly windrnstarting to pick up and turned up his coat collar against it. Itrnwouldn't be longer than an hour or two before the snow would startrnup again. A heavy weight slid onto his shoulders as he realized thernfull magnitude of what he had done. He had wanted to erase all tracesrnof Josie from his life on this trip, but there was no way it couldrnhappen now. Not with her under his very nose for who knew how long.rnEven now, he could feel the protective shell of anger starting tornslip away from him. And he knew what that meant…he'd bernvulnerable to her again… too vulnerable. A part ofrnhis heart had always held out hope: hope that one day Josie wouldrncome to him and beg his forgiveness in person, try to convince himrnthat her love for him had been real, and most of all, anrnexplanation…one that he could put his trust in and believe. Andrnnow…well now he understood the adage, \"Be careful what you wishrnfor, you just might get it…\" because it was happening to him. Itrnwas his dream coming true…and also his worst nightmare. Becausernthe bigger part of him was afraid…afraid and hurt. Josie'srnbetrayal and lies had hurt him beyond belief. Finally, he'd startedrnto believe in the sort of love that Shakespeare wrote about. He'drnfinally started to think that kind of magic could happen tornhim. And he thought he'd even felt it, felt it flowing between themrnlike some unspoken language only they could understand. Josie'srnabrupt revelation about her identity and the subsequent discussionrnhe'd overheard the evening of the prom had decimated those hopes inrnone swift blow…and he'd been left with nothing: he'd been anrnempty shell of a man, and it had taken him months to get to the pointrnwhere he could at least appear normal to others, but the woundrnwas far from healed. Oh, ifrnthere were only some way to know? If there were only some way to knowrnthe absolute truth in advance…so he wouldn't have to put hisrnheart at risk again… With thatrnthought echoing in his head, he entered the open doorway of the cabinrnto see Josie staring off into space, idly rubbing her hands slowly uprnand down her arms. She appeared to be deep in thought, and hernwondered if her thoughts included him. His eyes honed in on her handsrnas they drifted over the knit of his sweater and unbidden thernyearning for her to touch him that way awoke. Closingrnhis eyes against the sight, Sam forced those desires back into thernrealm of his subconscious. He knew he had to put a stop to suchrnthings before it was too late. His voice still a bit gruff fromrnstruggling with his own thoughts, Sam said stiffly, \"Here.\" Hernheld the phone out at arm's length, as if afraid of getting closerrnto her. Josie camernto at the sound of Sam's voice. She looked up and it seemedrneverything about him confirmed her negative thoughts: his face seemedrnvery closed and cool, and he held the telephone out to her as if hernwere afraid to even touch her, as if she were infected somehow.rnSlowly, she reached out a heavy hand toward him and Sam dropped thernphone into her palm. Josie stared at the thing for a long moment andrnthen raised her eyes to his once more. Thernsaddened look in Josie's eyes slammed into Sam's consciousnessrnand plucked at his heartstrings. The misery emanating from her seemedrnto permeate his being and seep into his soul. It almost felt as if he understood her…what the look meant in all its conflictingrnglory…and the realization of that shook Sam to the core. He didn't want to understand…he didn't want to feel her pain.rnRight now, he had enough of his own to deal with. Withoutrnrealizing he did it, Sam took a step backward, and then another.rn\"Listen, I'll give you some privacy to make your calls. I need torngo outside and chop some more wood. We may be stuck inside for arnwhile…I want to stock up.\" He stopped at the doorway to tuck arnfur-lined hat onto his head, and slipped his hands into sheepskinrnlined work gloves. He looked back at Josie for just a moment beforernclosing the door behind him. It hadrnbeen a big mistake. Her sorrow became instantly branded onto thernbacks of his eyelids and refused to go away. He knew without a doubtrnthat it was going to be a long next few days…and the sinkingrnfeeling in the pit of his stomach told him that it would be a miraclernif either of them survived intact. - - - Josiernstared at the closed door to the cabin for a long time before shernflipped the case to Sam's cell phone open and began to dial. At thernsound of her phone ringing, Anita swallowed a quick bite from herrnclub sandwich and washed it down with a sip from her can of DietrnPepsi. Because of the holidays, there were more Classifieds to dealrnwith than normal. That meant only one thing to Anita: lots of workingrnlunches. Gus was not at all forgiving about missing deadlines, evenrnunder such circumstances. And while she delighted in annoying Gus,rnshe took tremendous pride in her work. Picking uprnthe receiver, Anita answered, \"Classifieds, Anita Brandt.\" \"Anita,rnit's Josie.\" \"Hey,rnJosie! How's things up in the Great White North?\" Anita chuckledrnat her own humor. \"Seen any polar bears lately?\" Shakingrnher head slowly at Anita's antics, Josie replied, \"Not recently,rnno. Anita, its just Wisconsin, not the Arctic…\" \"Well,rnwith the weather report I heard, you could have fooled me.rnIt's a good thing you're on your way out of there, becausernotherwise I'd have to send a sled dog team for you!\" Anita joked. \"Actually…\"rnJosie hesitated, \"That's what I'm calling you about. There'srnbeen a little…change of plans…\" Anita satrnup straighter in her seat at the tone of Josie's voice. Somethingrnwas not right; she could feel it. \"What kind of change ofrnplans?\" \"Well,rnAnita…I'm going to need you to access my e-mail. I sent myselfrnthe draft of my article. Print it out and give it to Gus, okay? He'llrnneed someone else to finish it up for tomorrow's insertion.\" Anita satrnsilently for a moment, stunned. Josie never let anyone look atrnher stories until they were complete. \"All right Jos, spill it.rnSomething is definitely up, and I want to know what it is.\" Josiernlooked for a long moment out the window, watching Sam as he heftedrnthe axe above his head and purposefully swung it downward, splittingrna log cleanly in two. It was amazing how graceful he seemed inrneverything he did… \"Josie?rnWhat is going on?\" Startledrnby Anita's raised voice, Josie actually dropped the phone. Itrnclattered noisily on the hardwood floor. Reaching for it hastily,rnJosie said, \"Sorry, Nita, I dropped the phone.\" She paused for arnlong moment, sighing as her eyes strayed once again to Sam'srnathletic form. When he bent over to retrieve another piece of wood tornsplit, she had a perfect view of the way his jeans seemed molded tornhim. Finally, Josie said, \"I…Well…there's been an accident…\" Anita'srneyes widened. \"What kind of accident? Oh, God, are you okay?rnWhere are you?\" \"Slowrndown, slow down… I got into a little accident with my car a littlernwhile ago…\" Josie raised her voice when Anita was going torninterrupt, \"but I'm okay, just a little bump to the head, but I'mrnfine. My car, however, is not fine, so it appears that I'llrnbe stuck here for a while. As in until after the storm.\" \"Wherernare you?\" Anita asked again. \"Are you still in Green Bay?\" \"No, I'mrnin a small town on the coast named Oswego.\" \"Josie…whatrnare you doing way out there? Why didn't you just take the highwayrnhome?\" Anita asked, quite confused now. \"I…Irndon't know. I just didn't. Anyway, I'm stuck here, so you'llrnhave to get that stuff to Gus for me, okay?\" \"Allrnright, but…why can't you finish it up and send it off yourselfrntonight?\" Josiernfidgeted. She didn't really want to tell Anita this part, but shernknew there was no way around it. \"Because where I'm stayingrndoesn't have a phone.\" Anita nowrnsounded amused. \"Uh huh, and so you called me using what? A tin canrnand a string? Oh, wait, you've got your cell phone, right?\" \"Actually,rnno, I don't. Mine was damaged in the accident. This is Sam'srnphone, and I…\" Inrncomplete and total shock, Anita's voice actually squeaked when shernasked in disbelief, \"Wait… What did you just say?\" Josiernclosed her eyes and took a deep breath. Here it was, the moment shernwas dreading. In a rush, she forged lamely ahead, \"I said it'srnSam's cell phone. His family has a cabin here and…I'll bernstaying there with him to ride out the storm.\" - - -[Chapter 6] Snowbound, Part 6 By RocknVaughn - - - A long, thick silence met Josie'srnear. Finally, Anita's incredulous voice asked, \"Sam? As inrn'Sam-the-slimy-bastard-who-left-you-standing-on-the-ballfield-and-broke-your-heart-into-a-million-little-pieces'rnCoulson?\" Her voice had started softly but rose in volume as sherngot more and more upset. Josie glanced out the window once more, focusingrnher eyes on the subject of their conversation. \"Yes,\" she saidrnsoftly, the pain of those memories turning her voice bittersweet.rn\"That's the one.\" She looked down at her feet that werernsheathed in Sam's sister's boots and sighed. A million questions spun around inrnAnita's mind, but the one that popped out of her mouth first was,rn\"Josie…are you completely and totally insane ?\" Ruefully, Josie admitted, \"Well, I am starting to wonder…\" Anita looked up to realize thatrnseveral of her co-workers were staring at her after her lastrnoutburst. Sheepishly, she shrunk down a tad in her seat and quietedrnher voice. \"Okay, back the truck up. Would you like to explain tornme just how you ended up in the company of that horse'srnass?\" No, not really, Josie thoughtrnto herself. Sighing, she hedged, \"Anita, I wish you wouldn't callrnhim that. We've been through this before…Sam had every right tornbe angry with me for what I did. I'd been lying to him for weeks,rnand after overhearing what George said…\" Anita cut her off abruptly. \"Jos,rnI'm sorry, but the man's a jerk; plain and simple. Any guy whornsupposedly cared for you and read that article of yours – the wayrnyou poured your very heart out on that page – and could still walkrnaway from you is either spineless or heartless…or both!\" Weakly, Josie added, \"We don'trnknow for sure that he read it…\" Rolling her eyes from Josie'srngrasping at straws, she said plainly, \"Oh come on…of course he read it. Every living, breathing human being in Chicago read it. It was picked up and published by every major newspaper inrnthe country. You were all over the TV. There is no way he couldrnpossibly have missed it. You know that.\" Josie's only response was a sigh,rnmore longing and pitiful than the last. Anita pressed, \"You never did tellrnme how you ended up there with him …\" \"Well, a snow squall pretty muchrnsprung up out of nowhere, and suddenly I couldn't even see threernfeet beyond the hood of the car. But there was no shoulder on thernroad, so I had to keep driving. I guess I must've driven over therncenter line without knowing it, because suddenly there werernheadlights in my view and I swerved to get out of the way and endedrnup driving down an embankment and into a tree.\" \"Uh huh…but that still doesn'trnexplain where he comes into the picture.\" Josie half-smiled and said, almostrnnot believing the coincidence herself, \"Sam was the one driving thernother car…the one I almost hit.\" Anita sat bolt upright and the hairsrnon the back of her neck stood up on end. The odds of something likernthat happening in Chicago—let alone on a deserted street severalrnhundred miles from where they both lived—was astronomical, andrnAnita knew it. She breathed, \"Josie…that's bizarre.\" \" Tell me about it,\" Josiernagreed. \"The last thing I remember was that tree looming up beforernme and the next thing I know I'm waking up in a strange car withrnSam hovering over me.\" \"Uh huh. And then how did you endrnup at his cabin? Did he kidnap you or something?\" Anita askedrncrossly. Josie actually giggled a bit at thernoutlandish idea of Sam Coulson spiriting her away to his privaterncabin in the woods. \"Come on, Anita…if he'd kidnapped me, dornyou think he'd have let me use his cell phone? No, it wasn't likernthat at all. He called 911 and the police came and all that. Quiternnormal, I assure you. It was only after we found out that my car wasrntoo damaged to drive and that there wasn't a hotel within 30 milesrnof here that he made the offer. At the time, I assure you, he didn'trnseem too thrilled about it.\" Anita listened to Josie'srnexplanation, but something just didn't seem to add up. \"No, no,rnJosie,\" she said finally. \"Something's not right here.rnSupposedly the guy hates your guts, right?\" \"Right,\" Josie agreed. \"So then, why would someone whornhated your guts care if you had no place to stay? Wouldn'trnhe get some kind of sick satisfaction out of seeing you suffer?\" Josie didn't have an answer tornthat. In fact, she'd been wondering the same thing all afternoon.rnAnd judging by the way that Sam was now attacking that woodpile as ifrntormented by a host of inner demons, she'd guess even the manrnhimself couldn't tell her. Finally she said to Anita, \"I don'trnknow. The way he's been acting today hasn't made any sense atrnall…\" Her curiosity instantly piqued, Anitarnleaned forward in her chair and asked, \"What do you mean? How hasrnhe been acting?\" Josie struggled to put her intuitivernsuspicions into words. \"Well, sometimes he's really cold, yournknow? And at others…well, its almost as if…\" Sighing shernpaused, and then said, \"It's almost as if maybe he does still care a little. But when he catches himself doing it, he getsrnmad at himself…and at me. Oh, Anita…I just don't know what to think!\" Anita's protective instincts camernout full force as she said, \"Josie, I'm telling you; you need tornget out of there. Go someplace… anyplace else, hon. Because Irncan hear it already: he's starting to get to you. I have no idearnwhy he's doing this, but I think it can't be good. At best, yourntwo have a lot of pain and hostility between you; at worst…well,rnwho knows what kind of revenge he may want to take while you are atrnhis mercy…\" \"Anita, Sam is not going tornhurt me. He's not that kind of guy, no matter what you say.\" \"Josie, I didn't mean he wouldrntry and hurt you physically …I just meant like mind games,rnyou know? Maybe try and hurt you the way he felt he was hurt?\" Josie's heart stopped for a splitrnsecond as the icy cold possibility slid down her spine. What if Sam was trying to mess with her mind? Could she survive that kindrnof pain a second time? Anita's next statement mirroredrnJosie's thoughts. \"Josie…I don't know if you could make itrnthrough that again. And I don't want him to have that chance to.rnPlease, for me…get out of there.\" Josie's eyes strayed to Sam again.rnHe had the axe head rested on the cutting block and had placed arnforearm on the butt end of the handle to rest while he wiped sweatrnfrom his brow with the sleeve of his jacket. He lifted his chin andrnseemed to stare off into space, deep in thought. Even from thisrndistance, Josie could sense that he was intensely troubled. And then slowly he turned his headrnand stared right at her, as if he could actually feel her gaze on himrnand had been compelled to acknowledge it. Josie sucked in a breathrnand held it, not able to pull her eyes from his. They were full ofrnemotion, and as unguarded as she'd seen them thus far. Plainly hernwas angry… or was trying to be. And for the first time, Josiernrealized that the anger was only a front, a barrier Sam had erectedrnfor self-protection. But in that moment, the anger seemed to bernfading, and other, truer emotions were showing through: pain,rnconfusion, and caution. But it was the emotion from his deepest levelrnthat shook her: hope. Just a faint, fragile glimmer of hope remainedrnunderneath the rest. It was there on his face for a moment before hernreigned in his thoughts and the mental barrier slid back into place. That one look was all it took forrnJosie's own smoldering hope to spring back to life. If there wasrnany hope whatsoever that she could repair the damage and mend thernrift between her and Sam, she knew she would have to try. \"I…Irncan't, 'Nita. I mean, I understand where you're coming from,rnand I appreciate your concern, but this is just something that I havernto do.\" \"But—\" \"No buts, Anita. Call me crazy, butrnI'm staying, and that's final.\" Anita let out a heavy sigh, but knewrnbetter than to try to argue with Josie once she'd made up her mind. \"Oh, and 'Nita?\" Sighing again, she said, \"Yes?\" \"Can…can you please call myrnparents and let them know what's up? I don't want to tie up Sam'srnphone too long and use up the battery time. Who knows if we may needrnto use it later, you know?\" \"You've got to be kidding!rnYou want me to call your dad and tell him you'rernspending Christmas with his idea of the devil incarnate? Nuh-uh, nornthanks. If ever a messenger was gonna get shot for delivering arnmessage, that would be the one message I would get shot for!\" \"Anita…please! I know it'srnasking a lot, but… Well, frankly I'm just not ready to answer thernkind of questions we both know my parents will ask… \" Josiernbegged. \"Anita, you're my best friend! I'm counting onrnyou…please?\" \"Aww, man! I hate when yournpull out the 'best friend' stuff!\" Anita complained. Josie smiled because she knew Anitarnwas about to cave in. \"Okay, okay…I'll do it,\"rnAnita huffed sulkily. Then she brightened and said, \"Well, at leastrnif there's an up side to this, it would be that if that man harmsrneven one hair on your head…and you know what I mean…your dadrnreally will kill him this time. And I'll want front rowrnseats…\" Rolling her eyes, Josie said, \"I'mrnsure that won't be necessary. Everything will be just fine; you'llrnsee.\" Anita didn't sound convinced,rn\"Yeah, right, sure…whatever you say, Jos. Just…be careful, allrnright?\" \"I will,\" Josie vowed. \"Andrndon't forget to get that draft to Gus, all right? I'll get backrnin touch as soon as the storm is over. And if my parents or anyonernwants to check this stuff out, tell them to call Sheriff Will Parkerrnin Oswego. He was the one that came out to the accident scene and canrnverify my story.\" \"Oooh, a man in uniform…\" Anitarngushed. \"Was he cute?\" Josie shook her head. Anita was stillrnincorrigible when it came to men. \"Yeah, he was kind of cute, Irnguess…but cute and married if the wedding ring on his fingerrnmeant anything…\" \"Damn…\" Anita said forlornly. Josie giggled, \"Honestly!\" Then,rn\"I'll talk to you soon, 'Nita. Have a good Christmas, okay?\" Anita returned, \"Yeah, I will.rnWell, I know what you want in your stocking Christmas morning…rnAnd honestly…if he's really what you want then I hope it worksrnout. Just take care of yourself, okay? Don't let him hurt you.\" \"I won't; I promise. Bye, Anita.\" \"Bye, Jos,\" came the reply beforernthe line clicked into silence. Josie looked out the window at Samrnfor a moment and then back down to his phone in her hand. Suddenlyrnshe realized that there was no way she could actually follow throughrnon her promise to Anita not to get hurt. She was already in way toorndeep. - - - Sam shut the cabin door behind him,rnwalking purposefully toward the cutting block, where he'd left thernaxe wedged into its wide face earlier that day. Brushing the snow offrnthe handle, he grabbed it with both hands and yanked it out. Restingrnit against a nearby tree, he then reached down and brushed a layer ofrnsnow off the large, round, low stump he was using for a cuttingrnblock. Then, grabbing a hunk of wood, he set it onto the block andrngrabbed the axe, swinging it above his head and back down, severingrnthe piece of wood into two. Sam relished the familiar stinging inrnhis hands and arms from the axe head's contact with the wood. Herncould use something to take his mind off of his dilemma…and hisrnattraction to Josie. The biting cold air did seem to take the edgernoff that aspect, but instead, he felt it being replaced by anger andrnfrustration. Sam picked up another log and set it on end and thenrndissected that piece with a swing of the axe as well. How dare sherncome along and ruin any chance of resolution he'd hoped to attainrnon this trip? How dare she make him feel these things about her? Howrndare she…? As Sam got deeper and deeper into hisrnthoughts of all the things he wanted to blame Josie for, he got morernand more agitated. Without realizing it, he was now cutting wood at arnfrightening pace. His chest was heaving from the exertion and sweatrndotted his brow, but all he could think of was Josie. Finally, he'd reached a breakingrnpoint physically; he had to stop and rest. Wearily resting thernaxe head onto the cutting block, he leaned his weight heavily ontornthe upturned handle end. Now that he had stopped his frenzied pace,rnhe could feel the beads of sweat cooling quickly on his forehead andrndripping down his face. Shivering a little, he used the sleeve fromrnhis coat to wipe it off. And now that he could hear himselfrnthink over the furious beating of his heart, he also realized thatrnhis anger was basically unfounded. He realized that the person hernreally should be angry with was himself. After all, Josie wasn't trying to attract him. And it certainly wasn't her faultrnthat he couldn't seem to keep his mind from thinking about what itrnwould be like to be to make love with her, to kiss her…hell, justrnto hold her in his arms… In truth, Josie had done nothing atrnall today to incite any of the conflicting emotions that were nowrntorturing him. All she had been was what he had always known her tornbe, but even that disturbed him, because a part of him didn't wantrnto believe that he'd been wrong about her using him for a story.rnBecause if he had been wrong those months ago, then he'd thrownrnaway something wonderful and precious simply for the sake of hisrnpride, and he didn't want to face that. And then suddenly, the hair on thernback of Sam's neck stood on end, and he knew that Josie wasrnstaring at him. It was as if he could feel the heat of her gazernburning right through him. He could not stop himself from turning tornlook at her, and as soon as he did, he felt as if he were a deerrncaught in a pair of headlights: even though destruction could bernimminent, he just couldn't break contact. Josie was still on the telephone, butrnit seemed that as soon as he made eye contact with her, she forgot tornspeak. She seemed just as caught by his gaze as he was by hers. Herrnexpressive eyes infused him with knowledge, and he could almost feelrnthe conflict raging within her. She was wary, and afraid,rnand…hopeful? Did he really see the pain of unrequited love hoveringrnthere just beyond his reach? For a split second, he felt his heartrnexpanding. The hope that was no more than a faint glimmer in a deeprnhidden place started to glow. For just a split second, he allowedrnhimself to think, \"What if…?\" And then catching himself, hernrealized that yet again, he'd begun to fall under her spell. He wasrngoing to have to try a heck of a lot harder if he was going tornsurvive being with Josie for the next two or three days… He forced himself to look away fromrnher and then picked up his axe and prepared to chop some more wood. - - - Wanting to take her mind off of thernlook she'd shared with Sam and its potential meaning, she turnedrnaway from the window and walked toward the couch, dropping Sam'srncell phone on the side table as she passed it. Settling down on therncouch she watched the flames in the hearth dancing for severalrnminutes before breaking from her reverie and looking around a bit.rnNext to her, on the table where she'd dropped the cell phone, was arnhardcover book. She picked it up and turned it over to read \"JanernEyre\" on the cover. Smiling slightly, she settled intornthe couch and began to read. She had loved this book from a youngrnage, easily being able to identify with Jane's plainness andrninability to fit in. And just as Jane did, she had always hoped therernwould be that one man that could see beneath her plain exterior andrnfind a beautiful woman within. Being a very quick reader, it did notrntake her long to reach the part where Jane first meets her employerrnMr. Rochester. And even though the description of him was completelyrnat odds with Sam; that was the picture that surfaced in her mind asrnshe read. She couldn't help it; it just seemed that the hauntedrntortured eyes of Rochester must have looked just like Sam's… Josie jumped as the door to the cabinrnsuddenly flung open, slamming hard against the side wall from thernforce of the whipping wind outside. Dropping the book from herrnshaking hands, she slowly stood and turned toward the door. Blowingrnsnow swirled around Sam's feet as he carried his first armful ofrnfirewood inside. Smiling slightly in apology, Samrnsaid, \"Sorry about the door, the wind caught it and my hands werernfull.\" He grunted as he dropped the wood into a small pile alongrnthe bench by the window. \"Th…that's okay,\" Josiernreplied, still a bit shaken from the scare as well as from the depthrnof emotion she was feeling at that moment. Pushing those feelingsrnaside she asked, \"Would you like me to help you with that?\" A flicker of concern crossed Sam'srnface before he replied, \"No, thank you. You're not supposed to berndoing anything but resting, remember? I'll get it.\" Nodding a bit, Josie settled uneasilyrnback into her spot on the couch and tried to resume reading, but soonrnshe discovered it was impossible. Every time Sam would enter thernroom, burdened by yet another load of wood, she couldn't help butrnglance up from the book to watch him. Yet, she didn't want him tornrealize she was really watching him, so she kept the book to serve asrna cover. Finally, after several trips, Samrnwalked through the doorway and kicked the door shut with his footrnbefore depositing his latest armful on the impressive stack he'drnmade against the wall. Brushing wood chips off his gloves, he removedrnthem and his hat, tucking them onto the coat tree before shruggingrnout of his woolen coat and placing it over them on the tree as well. He turned to walk toward where Josiernwas sitting and for a split second it seemed that Josie had beenrnwatching him, but he shook his head, telling himself he must simplyrnhave imagined it. After all, she was reading, and she usually wasrncompletely engrossed when she read… He walked around and plopped on thernfar end of the couch, away from where Josie was curled up. He leanedrndown and started to untie his bootlaces and said, \"The wind isrnreally starting to kick up out there. I'd bet we'll see the snowrnstart anytime now…\" When Josie didn't respond, hernlooked up for a moment from his boot, taking in the title of thernbook. Sucking in a breath, he realized she was reading the same bookrnhe'd been reading just that last evening. He wondered briefly ifrnshe also felt the connection between the book and their situation,rnbut didn't dare ask. Finally he found his voice and asked, \"JanernEyre? You like that book, too?\" Josie's startled eyes met Sam'srnover the top of the book. Sam had said the word \"too\" as if itrnwere also a favorite… \"Y..yes, I like it very much. One of myrnfavorites, actually.\" Sam nodded, his eyes not leavingrnJosie's as he finished untying the knot on his left boot and usedrnhis right to push the boot off his foot. \"Mine, too,\" hernresponded. \"The Bronte sisters certainly had a way with words. Irnliked Wuthering Heights quite a bit as well. But, well…I likernJane's character better than Cathy's.\" Josie smiled. This was her opinion asrnwell. It did make her curious as to Sam's reasoning, though. \"Whyrndo you think that?\" she asked softly, using her finger to hold herrnplace in the book and then setting it down in her lap. Sam looked down for a moment tornstruggle with a knot in the lace of his right boot and then back tornJosie's eager face with a grin. \"Well,\" he admitted, \"whilernboth Jane and Cathy fell in love with men they believed they couldn'trnhave, at least Jane was honest about it. She didn't deny thernfeelings the way Cathy did. Cathy turned her back on the truth andrnthereby caused the ruin of both herself and Heathcliff.\" Once the words were out of his mouth,rnSam wished he'd never spoken them, because it brought to light hisrnfeelings for Josie, and he felt exposed. He'd thought that Josiernwas like Jane, when in reality she was more like Cathy, only usingrnhim to get what she wanted only to bring about his ruin with herrncowardice. Josie knew the exact moment when Samrnmade the connection with what he'd just said and their situationrnbecause he abruptly looked back down at his remaining boot and shovedrnit off fiercely with his other foot…with anger orrnself-recrimination she wasn't sure. Without another glance at her,rnSam bent over, picked up his boots with his left hand, stood up andrndeposited them in front of the fire before turning and heading towardrnthe kitchen. \"I think I'm going to put some water on for hotrnchocolate. I'm feeling a bit chilled,\" he intoned dully, his backrnstill to her. Josie stared after Sam for many longrnmoments, trying to decide whether to leave him alone with hisrnthoughts or to try and start making amends. Finally, she laid thernbook aside and followed Sam into the kitchen. Sam had just relit the wood insidernthe stove and set the white-flecked camping kettle on it when he feltrnJosie's presence behind him. He stiffened involuntarily and had tornforce himself to relax again. \"Yes?\" he asked without turning tornher. \"I…I thought that maybe you'drnput on enough water for us both to have hot chocolate,\" Josiernhedged. Sam nodded, crossing the room tornadjust a few food cans sitting on the far counter. \"I can bring itrnin to you when it's ready, if you'd like.\" Josie hesitated but then steeled herrnnerves and crossed the room as well, stopping a hairsbreadth behindrnSam. \"Sam,\" she said softly, placing a hand on his shoulder, \"ifrnwe're going to be stuck in this cabin together for a while, thenrnwe've got to stop avoiding each other so much.\" The heat from Josie's hand shotrnthrough Sam's system, a feeling he couldn't deny, as much as hernwanted to. He heard the validity of Josie's words, but yet hernfeared for his sanity. While he agreed that it would be exceedinglyrndifficult for them if they continued avoiding whatever this wasrnbetween them, if just the touch of her hand could make him feel thisrnout of control… Finally, he turned his head andrnlooked into Josie's eyes, unable to completely hide the spark hernfelt from her touch. Suddenly, Josie felt as if her handrnwere burning, but instead of removing it, her fingers tightened justrnslightly, as if unwilling to let go of the tenuous grasp they had onrnhim. Caught in Sam's gaze, Josie couldn't move. The power and force he felt inrnJosie's look actually caused him to sway toward her just slightly.rnA wave of longing washed over him and all he could think of was howrnbadly he wanted to feel Josie's lips upon his, wanted to wrap hisrnarms around her… His eyes started to close…but thenrnhe came to his senses abruptly and pulled away from Josie's grasp,rnstepping backward to break the connection. Josie, still a bit dazed from whatrnhad almost happened, watched Sam's Adam's apple bob up and downrnas he swallowed nervously before responding hoarsely, \"I'm notrnsure that's such a good idea…\" - - -[Chapter 7] Snowbound, Part 7 By RocknVaughn - - - For a long moment, both were silent,rnnot sure what to say or do next, but then Josie said, \"Sam, wernreally do need to talk, don't you think?\" Sam, who was staring down at hisrnsocks, sighed wearily. \"I suppose we do need to make some peacernwith the past. But I just don't think I'm up to it right now,rnokay?\" He paused and then admitted, \"Seeing you again has beenrnsort of a shock and I think I need more time to get used to the idearnfirst.\" Josie nodded in understanding. She,rntoo, felt off balance by the sudden reappearance of Sam Coulson inrnher life. Maybe he was right and they needed some space before theyrncould handle dealing with each other. \"Okay…well, then… I guessrnI'll just go back out to the living room and maybe you can bring mernsome hot chocolate when the water's ready?\" Sam glanced up at Josie briefly andrnthen over toward the stove. \"Fine. Thanks.\" Sam watched as Josie retreated intornthe living room and folded her petite body back into the corner ofrnthe couch and retrieved the book she'd been reading. Satisfied that she was giving him thernspace and privacy he'd asked for, he plopped himself wearily into arnchair in front of the kitchen table, his back toward the living room.rnLeaning heavily on his elbows, he let his hands slide up deep intornhis hair. At least that way, he wouldn't have to think about howrnbadly they were shaking. My God, he'd almost kissed her. Howrnthe hell was he going to survive the next few days trapped insidernthis three-room cabin with Josie Geller if even now he couldn'trncontrol his actions around her? And why? All because she'd touchedrnhim: a harmless, innocent touch. Damn, hadn't she touched himrnthousands of times in the past? Why would this time be so different?rnWhy would this affect him so much now? Because , his inner voicernanswered, before she was a seventeen-year-old girl to you. Now yournknow she's a twenty-six year old woman, and that makes all therndifference in the world. Yes , he thought back angrily, but now I also know that she is a lying, conniving twenty-six yearrnold reporter…Shouldn't that make a difference? The answer came quickly. No, you don't know that, and it's precisely because you don'trnknow it that you're having problems… Sighing, Sam admitted that truth. Asrnmuch as he wanted to place all the blame at Josie's feet, he wasrnfinding it more and more difficult to do so. Of course, it certainlyrndidn't help that being around her was becoming more and morerndistracting. How was he supposed to figure this dilemma out if herncouldn't even think straight in her presence? This situation wasrnbecoming more difficult by the moment. The sound of the whistling waterrnkettle broke into Sam's thoughts and pulled him up from his seat tornanswer its call. Hauling it off the stove, he placed the kettle onrnthe hot plate in the center of the kitchen table and then rummaged inrnthe cabinets for the sugared cocoa, some marshmallows, and two tallrncoffee mugs. A moment later, a better-composed Samrnwas carrying the two steaming mugs into the living room, settingrnJosie's on a coaster on the side table by her left elbow. \"Herernyou go,\" he said with a slight smile. \"Hot cocoa the way myrnmother used to make it when I was a boy.\" He saw Josie turn fromrnstaring at the fire to make eye contact with him for a long moment,rnas if she had been in thoughts of her own and needed time to registerrnwhat he'd said. Then she followed his glance to the coffee mug. She stared at it for a moment andrnthen it seemed almost as if tears were gathering in the corners ofrnher eyes, even against what seemed to be her iron will. A bit alarmed, Sam rushed out, \"What?rnDo you not like it with marshmallows? I mean…I didn't even stoprnto think…I just…\" Josie broke with a tiny grin beforernshaking her head the tiniest bit and saying thickly, \"No…it'srnfine, really. It's just so…sweet of you. Thanks.\" Despite himself, a pleased smile grewrnon Sam's face as he sat in the chair opposite Josie. \"You'rernwelcome,\" he replied before blowing across the top of his mug andrntaking a small, slurping sip. A sudden gust of wind rattled thernwindows and made both of them jump at the unnaturally loud sound. Arnmoment later the sound of fat, wet snowflakes tapped against the roofrnand walls. \"Sounds like the storm has started,\" Sam commentedrnidly. \"I guess so,\" Josie said a touchrnwistfully before staring off into the fire. Again Sam was reminded that althoughrnhe had chosen this setting in which to spend his Christmas, Josie hadrnnot. She had family and friends back in Chicago who had beenrnexpecting her. Instead, she was effectively trapped there with him.rnAnd so far, he hadn't been a very hospitable host. Pangs of guiltrnassaulted him as he watched her melancholy expression as the lightrnand shadow of the fire played across her face. She had been right when she said theyrncouldn't go on this way, at each other's throats, but yet, if herndidn't maintain his shield of anger, what other protection did hernhave? Sam glanced over at Josie again justrnin time to watch her licking the thin white line of marshmallow foamrnfrom her top lip with the tip of her tongue. His eyes homed in onrnthat pink tip and his jaw actually went slack watching her, thernvisions brought to mind by that innocent action sparking a flash firernof desire within him. - - - As the snow started to fall, Josiernturned to stare into the fire. Well, that was it. Her fate wasrnsealed. Now, whether she liked it or not, she would be stuck therernwith Sam until the blizzard wore itself out. As her hands massagedrnthe outside of the coffee mug she cradled in her palms, she thoughtrnagain about Anita's warning. Was it indeed possible that Sam wasrnsimply trying to mess with her head? Could it be that his seeminglyrnincongruous behavior actually had a purpose? What if he was justrndoing all this to hurt her? She idly took a sip of her drink and thenrnlicked the line of melted marshmallow from her lips. No matter how hard she tried, shernjust couldn't picture Sam as the type of man who would take revengernon her in that way. Maybe it was her own naïveté or evenrnher own misplaced hopes talking, but the Sam Coulson she loved wouldrnnot do such an awful thing. Suddenly, she became aware of hisrneyes on her, and she turned to catch Sam gaping at her, a strangernexpression of almost…pain on his face. Concerned, she asked, \"Sam?rnWhat's the matter?\" Heat flushed Sam's face from bothrnthe direction of his thoughts and the realization he'd just beenrncaught staring. He stammered, \"Uh, nothing. I was just…thinking,rnthat's all.\" He set his cup aside and stood abruptly. \"Excusernme,\" he said before walking off into the bedroom and shutting therndoor behind him. Dumbfounded as to what brought on thisrnnew bout of strange behavior, Josie shook her head, thinking tornherself, I just don't understand what's going on with him. Notrnat all. - - - In the bedroom, Sam stood for a longrnmoment staring at his reflection in the mirror over the dresser.rnDesire and longing still surged through his body and he cursedrnhimself for it. Come on, Sam! he scolded himself, Get arngrip! Try to remember, at least for a minute, what it was she did tornyou! For God's sake, she was going to ruin your life for the sakernof a story…don't let her get to you like this! But even as he was reminding himselfrnof that fact, a part of him couldn't help but imagine the images ofrnthe two of them in the bed reflected behind him…and they weren'trnsleeping. The thought disturbed him. Rounding the edge of the bed, hernsank forlornly onto the soft mattress, staring at the rough-hewnrnbeams of the roof above him as if trying to find his answers writtenrnon them. - - - Sam awoke, surprised that he'drnslept at all. But then, it did make sense, considering the disturbingrndream he'd had the night before, not to mention all the physicalrnlabor he'd performed in cutting and moving all that firewood… Sitting up, he noticed a distinctrnchill in the air and realized he'd shut off this room from the heatrnof the living room fire by closing the door. Standing and stretchingrnthe sleep from his limbs, he rubbed his eyes and then opened the doorrnleading to the living room. There before him lay Josie, curledrninto a little ball on the couch, sound asleep – just as he had beenrnjust a few minutes ago. Looking toward the fire, he could see it wasrnlittle more than glowing embers now. Looking at his watch, hernrealized he'd actually been asleep for a couple of hours. It wasrnafter 5 o'clock and with the storm raging outside, it might as wellrnhave been midnight, it was so dark. Taking a closer look at Josie'srnhuddled form, he noticed that she was shivering. He turned and wentrnback into the bedroom, grabbed a blanket from the stack piled on thernfloor and returned to Josie's side to gently tuck it around her andrnunder her chin. He paused for a moment in the dim light to study her.rnShe looked so peaceful in sleep. He reached out and brushed the backsrnof his fingers along the silky expanse of her cheek. She stirredrnslightly at his touch and then snuggled deeper into the warmth of thernblanket with a sigh. That sigh did funny things to Sam'srninsides; things he didn't want to ponder at that moment. Instead,rnhe turned and started rebuilding the fire and restoring the heat tornthe little cabin. Josie awoke to the smell of pipingrnhot food and felt her stomach growl in protest. She hadn't eaten arnthing since breakfast and suddenly realized she was starving.rnCracking an eye open, it took her a moment to remember where shernwas…and why. As her eyes adjusted to the dimmer light of evening,rnshe saw there was again a roaring fire in the hearth past her feet.rnAlso, she was now covered with a blanket. Funny, she thought,rnlittle more than half awake, I was sure I fell asleep without one… Looking around a bit, she noticedrnthat her empty cocoa mug was gone, along with the nearly full one Samrnhad abandoned earlier. Lifting her head slightly, she peered over thernchair facing her and looked into the kitchen. By the light of a largernhurricane lamp, she could see Sam, his back mostly toward her,rnwhistling merrily to himself as he stirred a pot boiling on thernstove. Everything around her seemed so calm and serene in the face ofrnthe howling wind outside. Josie felt a pair of hot tears rollrndown her face as the bitter sting of regret ate at her. This isrnhow it should have been… she thought, before hastily wiping thernwetness from her cheeks with the heel of her right hand. Gingerly,rnshe sat up, shoving the blanket aside and trying to ignore herrnsuddenly protesting muscles. Pushing up to a stand, she wobbledrnfor a moment before she padded softly over to the kitchen doorway.rnThe table was set with two bowls, two spoons and two steaming mugsrnwith a tea bag tag hanging out of each. Looking over toward the sink,rnshe saw their mugs from earlier upturned in the drip strainer.rnBemused, Josie noticed that Sam still had the dishtowel draped overrnhis left shoulder. Leaning against the doorway, she cleared herrnthroat and said, \"Anything I can do?\" Sam spun around abruptly at the soundrnof her voice, accidentally brushing his right hand along the front ofrnthe hot iron stove. \"No…ouch!\" Josie rushed forward, grabbing thernhand that Sam was waving rapidly in the air, mimicking the motion ofrnshaking down the mercury in a thermometer. \"Whoa, whoa…let me seernit. Are you okay?\" Carefully, she cradled his hand between hers andrnturned it over to see a pink streak along the outside of Sam'srnhand. Sam stared down at his hand betweenrnJosie's two petite ones, and suddenly the pain seemed to vanish.rnAll he could seem to focus on was her thumbs soothing their wayrnacross his palm. \"Uh…yeah, yeah; it's fine.\" He pulled hisrnhand away, turning back to the stove so as not to show Josie how muchrnher concern and touch had affected him. Choosing to ignore his strangernreaction, Josie peered around him toward the stove. \"So…what arernyou making?\" Sam took that as a cue to stir thernpot again. \"Beef stew.\" Josie smiled. \"Your mother'srnrecipe again?\" she teased. Sam smiled back. \"As a matter ofrnfact…\" Josie giggled and then commented morernseriously, \"I didn't know you could cook.\" With a smirk, Sam replied, \"I'm arnman of many talents.\" Sam's bantering answer stunnedrnJosie. Speechless, her mouth hung open in shock for a moment beforernshe abruptly closed it. In truth, Sam was a bit surprisedrnhimself. He couldn't believe he'd just teased Josie the way hernused to when they were teacher and student. It had felt so good; sornnatural. They used to have such an incredible rapport and it seemedrnwhenever he wasn't consciously thinking about the way things werernsupposed to be now, he slipped back into the old habits. Except nowrnthey were both adults – and the stakes had changed. Frowning to himself, Sam wrapped therndishtowel around the front of the pot, grabbed the pot handlesrnthrough the terrycloth and turned to carry the tureen to the table.rnJosie backed away in order to make room for him, still shocked fromrntheir last encounter. Once he'd set the pot on the hotrnplate, he tossed the towel in the direction of the sink and thenrnpulled the chair in front of him away from the table, waiting. Josie, not catching this gesture,rnstarted toward the other side of the table when she caught Sam'srnlook. He looked at her pointedly, and then raised one eyebrow as ifrnto say, Uh, hello? Chair? Blushing in embarrassment (and withrnpleasure at Sam's gallant gesture), Josie sat in the profferedrnchair and waited while he helped her push the chair toward the table. Sam walked around the table and sat,rngrabbing the handle of the ladle with one hand and her bowl with thernother. Starting to serve, he looked at her over the bowl and said,rn\"Say when.\" Josie watched the grace of hisrnmovements, a bit dazed, until she realized he'd already ladledrnthree scoops into the bowl. \"Uh…when,\" she stammered, her eyesrnonly making skittering contact with his before looking back down tornher lap. Oh , she thought with distress, my cheeks must bernbright red by now! Sam reached across the table and setrnthe bowl before her, taking the opportunity to study Josie's face.rnEven in the flickering light of the hurricane lamp, Sam could see therntinge of pink covering her cheeks, and he watched, rapt. He'drnalways loved how pretty Josie looked when she blushed, and… Stop it! Sam mentally scoldedrnhimself yet again, trying to focus on ladling stew into his own bowl. You are no longer her teacher, she is no longer your student, andrnyou are no longer in love with her! - - - The first five minutes of the mealrnwas taken in complete silence. Neither one spoke or even looked atrnthe other. But soon, the quiet made Sam curious and he found himselfrnpeeking up at Josie whenever he'd bend his head to take anotherrnspoonful of stew into his mouth. She looked pensive and sad, neverrnlooking up higher than her lap, until finally she felt his eyes onrnher and met his gaze. Quietly, she complimented, \"The food is veryrngood. Thank you.\" Sam simply nodded his reply andrnlooked back down to his soup bowl. Josie took that as a hint that herndidn't want to talk and resumed the silence. The air was thick withrntension and it was driving her crazy. She almost wished he'd gornback to ranting, raving, cursing…anything but this horrible,rnstrained silence. - - - Finally, Josie finished her meal andrngingerly leaned against the seat back with a groan. She wasn't surernwhy, but her muscles felt like one big knot and they were very sore. Sam looked up from his second helpingrnof stew at the sound. After studying Josie for a second, his eyebrowsrnfurrowed and he asked, \"Are you all right?\" \"I…\" Josie was about to lie andrnsay she was fine, but thought better of it. \"Well, not really,\"rnshe admitted. She reached back to massage her neck with her rightrnhand. \"For some reason, every muscle in my body is suddenly aching.rnI feel like I got run over by a Mack truck.\" \"That's not too far from wrong,\"rnSam commented, narrowing his eyes and leaning back in his chair tornstudy Josie more closely. \"That accident you had was more than justrna 'fender bender', Josie. You could have been seriously hurt.\" \"But I wasn't,\" Josie replied.rn\"I don't understand… Why am I so sore? I wasn't before…\" Sam leaned his elbows on the tablernand leaned his chin a little on his threaded fingers. \"Actually, itrnmakes sense. It's a delayed reaction. Right after an accident, yournhave lots of adrenaline running through your system. It isn't untilrnafter that wears off that you feel the full effects.\" Josie's eyes widened warily as thernlegs of Sam's chair scraped the floor as he pushed it back andrnwalked around the table toward her. When he was standing next to her, hernleaned down and braced his hands on his knees so that he was at eyernlevel with Josie. \"How's the head? Is that worse, too? Any doublernvision? Dizziness?\" he asked as if he were her attending physician. In truth, Josie did feel a bitrndizzy, but that was only due to Sam's proximity. \"Uh…no,\" shernstuttered, feeling her face flush. \"That doesn't seem to be anyrnworse.\" Pushing himself up to a stand, Samrnnodded, satisfied that, at least for the time being, Josie's conditionrnhadn't worsened more. \"Well, we better take care of that musclernsoreness now before it gets much worse. If you don't, tomorrowrnyou'll be twice as sore. Take it from me…I've had many arnpainful muscle from my years of hockey and I learned this lesson thernhard way.\" He turned and strode behind her and into the walk-inrnpantry and out of sight. After a few sounds of rummaging andrnrearranging, Sam emerged, carrying an old-fashioned metal washtub. Josie's eyes grew as wide asrnsaucers. The implications starting to emerge in her mind made herrnspeechless. \"Wh…what's that for?\" Josiernfinally stammered, finding her voice at last as Sam set the tub downrnin the middle of the kitchen floor. \"You need to soak those muscles,\" he replied,rnnot able to look at her for fear that his façade of cautiousrnneutrality would slip. Letting out a long sigh, Sam continued,rn\"There's no help for it, Josie.\" He opened his arms andrngestured around himself. \"It may not exactly be the idealrnsurroundings for this, but…like it or not…you need to take arnbath.\" - - -[Chapter 8] Snowbound, Part 8 By RocknVaughn - - - Yes, to anyone who has read this story before, herein starts the new chapters. I'll be taking a little more time between posts so that I can stay at least one chapter ahead with my writing. I sincerely hope the continuation of this story will meet your expectations. I'm certainly enjoying visiting with Sam and Josie again (especially when there's plenty of UST involved!). Please, especially with the new chapters, I'd really appreciate any comments or feedback you can provide. Thank you! - - - Josie paled and thenrnblushed fiercely. She stuttered, \"But…but…\" \"No buts, Josie,\"rnSam replied matter-of-factly. \"Listen, I understand this isn'trnexactly ideal, but we need to conserve as much hotrnwater in the water heater as possible. There's no telling how muchrnlonger we'll have power in a storm like this.\" Sam stopped for arnmoment and listened to the howling of the wind outside. \"Besides, justrnstanding in the shower isn't going to work. You need to soak the muscles. And seeing as the bathroom here doesn't have arnbathtub, this \" –Sam shoved the tub just slightly with hisrntoe for emphasis—\"is going to have to do.\" Josie stared at thernlarge metal tub for several seconds before finally nodding her headrnin agreement, unable to meet Sam's eyes. \"I…I guess I'll gornget my stuff together,\" she said finally, pushing herself to arnstand and groaning when her muscles protested. Sam nodded in responsernand as Josie left the room he started rooting through cabinets. Hernpulled out several large pots, setting them on the counter next tornthe sink. Then he opened the access door to the cast iron stove andrnreached into a small box next to it, pulling out smaller logs andrntossing them onto the dying fire. After spending severalrnmoments rearranging the wood with an iron poker, he set it aside,rnbrushed off his hands as if satisfied, and stood, closing the accessrndoor. Walking back across the kitchen to the sink, he began fillingrnthe pots with water. Suddenly, a fiercernhowling wind rattled the windows to the cabin. The electric lightsrnwent out and the humming motor from the refrigerator died. \"Shit,\" Sam sworernto himself. \"I didn't think we'd lose it this soon.\" Then he heard Josierncalling out to him, her voice slightly edged with panic, \"Sam?\" Hurriedly setting thernhalf-full pot back into the sink and turning off the water, Samrngrabbed the lit hurricane lamp and hurried out into the living room,rndimly lit only by the fireplace. \"Josie? Where are you?\" \"I'm in thernbedroom,\" came the slightly muffled reply. Rounding the corner andrnopening the bedroom door, Sam found a wide-eyed Josie standing stockrnstill between the bed and the dresser, holding a fluffy, pinkrnterrycloth robe to her chest. Sam barely noticed. \"Hold on a sec,\"rnhe said, setting his lamp onto the bedside table closest to the door.rnGrabbing the unlit hurricane lamp, he walked past Josie until hernstood in front of the dresser across from the bed. He then fishedrnaround in his front left pocket, retrieving a small box of woodenrnmatches. Pulling the lamp closer to him, he lit one of the matchesrnand then bent down a little. \"I'll have this lit for you in justrna moment,\" he said, half to Josie and half to himself. Carefullyrnsliding the match into the lighting hole, he touched the match headrnto cotton wick and pulled the matchstick out, waving it quicklyrnthrough the air to extinguish it. The lamp began to glow and Samrnfidgeted with the wick height knob, trying to get just the rightrnamount of light. After a moment, Samrnraised his head and looked at Josie behind him in the mirror. \"Therernyou go…\" Sam said, and then suddenly he couldn't remember whatrnhe was going to say next. Instead he stared at the reflection ofrnJosie's bare shoulders, just visible over the robe she wasrnclutching tightly to her chest. Momentarily glancing behind her, herncould see a small pile of clothing at the edge of the bed, and hernquickly realized that a lot more than Josie's shoulders was barernbehind that screen of terrycloth. Forgetting to breathe,rnSam was spellbound by the way the soft light made her skin almostrnglow. It looked silky smooth and his fingers itched with wanting torntouch it. A million thoughts raced through Sam's mind, each morernerotic than the last…but every one of them started with his turningrntoward Josie and slowly lowering that robe… Suddenly realizing thernvery dangerous turn of his thoughts, Sam turned from the enticingrnview in the mirror, gathered up his lamp from the bedside table, andrnturned to leave. Josie's soft voicernstopped him in his tracks. \"Thank you,\" she said, barely above arnwhisper. Not daring to turnrnaround, Sam replied awkwardly, \"It's… No problem. I'llrnjust…go finish getting the water ready.\" Then he softly closedrnthe door behind him. - - - After the bedroom doorrnclicked shut, Josie let out a huge nervous sigh before turning herrnrobe around in front of her and hastily slipping her arms into thernsleeves. She reached for the belt and cinched it tightly at her waistrnwith shaking fingers. Afraid her wobbly knees might give way, Josiernplopped down on the edge of the bed, placing a hand over her poundingrnheart. She had been in thernmidst of changing when that wind shook the cabin and then everythingrnsuddenly went black. In her fear, she had called out for Sam,rnforgetting for a second her state of undress. It wasn't until shernheard his hand turning the doorknob that she came to and hastilyrngrabbed for her robe on the end of the bed. She hadn't even had therntime to put in on, so she ended up just holding to her instead. By his nonchalantrnbehavior when he'd entered the room, Josie had started to thinkrnthat Sam wasn't even going to notice her predicament. But thenrnsuddenly his eyes widened with realization as he stared at her, hisrneyes alive and blazing with something she could not name. And she hadrnfelt helpless to do anything besides stare back. Taking a deep,rnsteadying breath, Josie muttered to herself, \"Lord, I don't knowrnif I can do this…\" - - - Back in the kitchen,rnSam was just as shaken by what he had experienced in the bedroomrnmoments before. Placing the lamp back onto the kitchen table, hernstomped over to the sink and turned the hot water knob violently,rncausing water to splash all over his front when the stream ricochetedrnoff the side of the pot still sitting in the sink. Turning the faucetrnarm so that the water was pouring into the pot, he stood back andrnshook the water from him, muttering a string of curses under hisrnbreath. Damn it, he didn't want to feel this overpowering attraction to Josie. Sam triedrnto work up his anger again, but found it was no longer insulating himrnfrom his other emotions. Sighing, he ran a damp hand through his hairrnand then hoisted the water-laden pot out of the sink and carried itrnover to the stove. Steam hissed from the evaporating droplets thatrnclung to the outside of the container as it touched the hot stovetop. In those few minutesrnwhile Sam covered the cast iron stove with pots of assorted shapesrnand sizes, he tried desperately to think about something else…rnanything besides Josie. He tried listening to the shrieking wind andrnthe furious drumming of snow against the sides of the cabin. Nothingrnseemed to work. Every time he closed his eyes, he could imaginernJosie's eyes meeting his in the mirror of the bedroom. It had takenrnevery shred of willpower he'd possessed then not to pull her intornhis arms and kiss her until they were both senseless. \"What the hell is thernmatter with me?\" he asked himself as he slumped into a chair at thernend of the table, facing the door. He'd thought he was over Josie.rnHe'd thought that over time, she'd have lost the power to affectrnhim. He'd thought that he could forget about her, put the wholernsordid affair behind him and move on with his life. Granted, he stillrnsearched the Sun Times daily to see if she'd written a new article…rnbut that was just curiosity, he'd told himself. Sure, he hadn'trnwanted to date anyone since her, and he was still mad as hell withrnher…but surely he was over her. Or so he'd thought until arnfew hours ago. From the moment he realized the injured woman in therncar was Josie, his world had been completely turned upside down. Everything he'drnbelieved he felt about Josie Geller before now seemed woefullyrninaccurate. - - - \"Okay, Josie, snaprnout of it,\" she coached herself. \"It's just a simple bath. Nornbig deal.\" The vision of Sam's face as he stared at her in thernmirror flashed before her and in her heart she knew that nothingrnhaving to do with Sam Coulson could ever be simple. \"Come on, Jos,\" shernsaid aloud, trying to calm her accelerated pulse. \"Don't getrncarried away here. The only reason he suggested the bath was becausernof your sore muscles. You're his burden until the storm lets up andrnhe doesn't want to have to deal with the consequences if you getrnworse, that's all.\" Nodding, she slippedrnher feet into her fuzzy slippers and stood. Yes, that was it. Sam wasrnjust trying to do the right thing. That didn't mean there were anyrnemotions attached to it. And his look… Well, she just must havernmisunderstood it. He must have suddenly realized she was not dressedrnand been embarrassed. After all, Sam had made it quite clear thus farrnthat he had no use for her. He didn't even want to be in the samernroom with her more than had been completely necessary, and shernguessed she couldn't blame him. Still, she couldn't help but wishrnthat there were some way to break through to him, to get him to givernher another chance. \"Forget it, Jos,\"rnshe muttered, pulling the knot around her waist tighter and openingrnthe bedroom door. \"That's just wishful thinking.\" She rounded the cornerrnand walked into the kitchen to find Sam pouring heated water from thernpots on the stove into the metal tub. Without looking up, hernexplained, \"One more set of these pots and there should be enoughrnfor your bath.\" He carried the now empty pot to the sink andrnrefilled it with water. Josie watched the hazernof steam rise from the tub and then smiled hesitantly as Sam turnedrnto carry the refilled pot to the stove. \"Thanks,\" she saidrnhesitantly. Sam shrugged, stillrnfacing the stove. He didn't want to look at her right now. Herndidn't know if he could handle it. Josie looked from Sam'srnbroad back to the open doorway of the kitchen, staring at the flamesrnin the living room fireplace flutter from drafts coming down thernchimney. Suddenly, a thought occurred to her and felt her cheeks burnrnbright red. Nervously, she twisted her hands in front of her and thenrnplayed with the ends of her bathrobe belt, staring at the space onrnthe floor between her fuzzy slippers. \"Uh…Sam?\" At the note of hesitantrnquestion in Josie's voice, Sam turned. Tilting his head down arnlittle, he tried to see her face and realized she was blushing badlyrnand she was fidgeting. Trying not to think about how endearing thatrnquirk of hers was, he asked in a neutral tone, \"What?\" Scuffing one of herrnslippers back and forth across the floor, her eyes remained glued tornit. \"Uh…well…there's no…um, door to the kitchen.\" Glancing at the doorwayrnfor a moment, he lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \"And?\" In response, Josiernblushed even more. \"Sam…\" she barely spoke, embarrassed. \"I…Irncan't do this.\" \"Can't do what?\"rnSam asked. \"If you're having second thoughts about being herernwith me, I'm afraid it's too late for that.\" \"No…\" Josiernglanced up for a split second before quickly lowering her head again.rn\"How can I bathe in here if I can't…. if you can…?\"rnMortified at how inane she must sound, Josie just stopped talkingrnaltogether, gesturing slightly to the doorway. Finally, Sam graspedrnJosie's meaning. \"Josie, I wouldn't intrude on your privacy.rnCome on,\" he said in reply. \"I thought you knew me better thanrnthat.\" Josie's beseechingrneyes connected with Sam's, begging him to understand. \"I didn'trnthink you would… It's just that…\" She let out a huge sighrnbefore whispering, \"I can't .\" Unbidden, a memoryrnsurfaced… A conversation he'd had with Josie in the early days ofrnher undercover assignment. Class had justrnended. As the students filed out, he called out, \"Josie? Can I seernyou a moment?\" Shyly, she'drnnodded and moved to stand before him. He'd waited until the roomrnhad emptied and then said, \"Josie, I'd like you to read yourrnpaper for the class on Monday.\" Instantly, shernblushed and stared at her sneakers. \"N..no, I can't,\" shernstammered. He had bent his headrnlower, trying to get Josie to look at him. \"Why can't you?\" hernasked softly. \" You wouldn'trnunderstand,\" she said miserably. Gently, he reachedrnout and tilted her head so that she had to meet his eyes. Then herncrossed his arms across his chest and leaned back against the frontrnof his desk, crossing his legs at the ankles. \"Try me.\" She'd closed herrneyes for a moment, as if to gather her courage and then admitted,rn\"They might laugh at me.\" His heart had gonernout to her in that moment. How could such a smart, beautiful youngrnwoman like Josie have such self-doubt? Even then, he could see sherncould be so much more than she envisioned for herself. \"Josie, nornone will laugh at you. Your paper was wonderful.\" Josie just shook herrnhead, embarrassed with his praise. \" Yes, Josie… itrnwas. You are very talented. I'd really like the class to hear it.\"rnHe'd smiled at her then and he thought that maybe she wasrnweakening. \" I can't …\"rnshe insisted softly. Placing a hand onrnher shoulder, he felt…something…pass between them. Shrugging thernfeeling off for the moment, he locked his gaze with hers and urged,rn\"You can .\" When she started to protest, he didn't letrnher. \"Yes, you can. Just pretend they aren't there. Pretendrnyou're just reading it to me. Surely, I'm not that scary?\"rnhe'd joked. His reward had beenrna glorious smile that reached her eyes even as a blush colored herrncheeks again. \"No,\" she admitted softly. \"You're not scary.\" Encouraged, hernrubbed her shoulder slightly saying, \"Good, I'm glad to hearrnthat.\" Then he said, \"Josie, I promise it won't be as bad asrnyou think. And I'll be there with you the whole time. Nothing tornworry about, okay?\" She'd nodded.rn\"Okay.\" After thatrnconversation, Sam remembered sitting at his desk through most of thernnext period under the guise of grading papers, but he didn't getrnmuch done as his thoughts kept straying back to Josie. Even then,rnthere had been something about her… And now, almost ninernmonths later, long after there was any need for Josie to pretendrnanything, she was still shy and embarrassed. He had always consideredrnher innocence an act, but now he wasn't so sure. What could herrnmotive possibly be to act that way now? Sam didn't want to admitrnit, but her sweet shyness was affecting him now the same way now asrnit had then: it made him want to protect her. Kindly, he smiledrnslightly and said, \"Hold on a second. I'll be right back.\" Confused, Josie watchedrnSam as he left the kitchen and crossed the living room. He kneltrnbefore the bench along the far side of the room, lifted up the seat,rnand moved things around, obviously searching for something. Taking a step or twornforward until she was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, shernasked, \"Sam, what are you doing?\" But Sam acted as if herndidn't hear her and kept on rummaging. After another moment hernexclaimed, \"Aha, I knew it was in here…\" before pushingrnitems hastily into place and shutting the top of the storage bench.rnThen, grasping a small bag in his left hand, he sprinted to thernbedroom, muttering something unintelligible. A moment later, Samrnemerged again, a bed sheet flung hastily over his shoulder. Herncrossed the threshold of the kitchen, barely brushing Josie as hernpassed. Baffled and slightlyrnshaken from the jolt of Sam's touch, Josie stepped back into thernkitchen again and looked beyond Sam to the package and sheet he'drndeposited on the table in favor of pouring more hot water from thernpots into the tub. It read 'Four-Ply Waterproof Nylon Cording,rnGeneral Use'. \"Huh?\" Josie said, not realizing she'd said itrnaloud. Sam turned and lookedrnover his shoulder at Josie. The obvious confusion on her face was sorncomical he almost laughed. Instead, he deposited the pot he held intornthe sink, disappeared around the corner into the pantry for a second,rnand emerged with a handful of wooden clothespins. Depositing them on therntable as well, he literally had to walk around the dumbstruck Josiernto get to the package of nylon cord. As he stood with his back to herrnand opened the package, Josie finally found her voice. With a touchrnof nervous apprehension, she asked, \"What are you going to do withrnthat rope?\" An amused smile tuggedrnat the corners of Sam's mouth again. \"What do you think I'm going to do with it?\" Josie was afraid tornguess. \"I…\" Finally, Sam gave in tornhis mirth and chuckled out loud. Shaking his head, he decided to put Josie outrnof her misery. \"Josie… I'm setting up a makeshift screen forrnyou… across the doorway. You know, so that you can… and I can't …?\" As Josie's mouthrnformed a perfect O of surprise, Sam chuckled again and then turnedrntoward the doorway to begin his task. Removing a copper-bottomed panrnfrom a hook on the wall, he tied one end of his cord to the eyehookrnand then crossed the doorway to connect the other end to a coat hookrnthat was screwed into the wall at about shoulder height. A long tailrnof extra rope hung down from the hook and pooled in a little pile onrnthe floor by the doorjamb. Josie backed up to bernout of Sam's way as he turned and grabbed the sheet andrnclothespins. He efficiently worked from one end of the cord to thernother, securing the sheet he was holding to the cord with the woodenrnfasteners. Turning around, he gestured toward his handiwork, \"Voila!rnHow's that? Better?\" Josie blinked backrntears and nodded. Slightly self-consciousrnabout Josie's emotional response, he lowered his eyes and thenrnsaid, \"Oh! You need some towels. Hold on a sec.\" Pushing thernsheet aside, Sam ducked under it, emerging a minute later with arncouple of fluffy towels and Josie's toiletries bag. He explained,rn\"It was on the bathroom counter when I was getting the towels so…rnWell, here,\" he finished abruptly, handing it to her. He put therntowels on the table, grabbing the dinner dishes and hastily dumpingrnthem in the sink. \"I'll do those later,\" he said more tornhimself than to Josie. He busied himself putting more wood inside thernstove and then grunted as he bent over to pull the metal tub closerrnto it. The water sloshed back and forth inside, bringing to Sam'srnmind thoughts of what it would mean the next time he heard thosernsounds. \"There,\" he said,rntrying to regain some equilibrium. Standing up he gestured to therntub. \"You should be nice and warm there by the stove.\" Hernnervously backed up a step. \"Feel free to take as long as yournwant,\" he stammered. \"Besides, the longer you soak those muscles,rnthe better.\" Josie nodded, suddenlyrnfull of nervous tension. She couldn't seem to look away from Sam'srngaze. \"Okay,\" she agreed lamely. \"I will.\" Then softly shernadded, \"Thank you, Sam.\" \"Sure,\" he replied,rnpushing the sheet up and walking under it once again. Then standingrnon tiptoe to see over the sheet, he added, \"If you need anything,rncall me. I'll be right here in the living room, all right?\" \"Okay,\" Josie saidrnagain, and watched as he lowered himself so that all she could seernwas Sam's hair sticking up over the top edge of the sheet. A sadrnsmile crossed her features at its endearing unruliness. She waitedrnuntil he moved away from the door and she heard him start poking atrnthe living room fire before she began to undress. - - -[Chapter 9] Snowbound,rnPart 9 ByrnRocknVaughn - - - I thoroughly enjoyed writing this chapter; I hope you enjoy it as well. Thanks again for taking the time to review. They mean the world to me and keep me inspired. Thanks! - - - Gingerly,rnJosie undid the tie at her waist and shrugged the thick terryclothrnoff her shoulders, moaning with pain from the movement. Even knowingrnthat Sam was a gentleman and would never take advantage of theirrnsituation, Josie couldn't stop herself from crossing her armsrnprotectively across her front. Her hands rubbed briskly up and downrnfrom shoulder to elbow partly from nervousness and partly in anrneffort to keep warm. Hesitantly,rnJosie raised her gaze and stared intently at the makeshift screenrnthat Sam had concocted. Once convinced that she couldn't seernthrough it (and therefore, neither could Sam), she relaxed her holdrnand let her arms slide back to their sides. Still in her fuzzyrnslippers, Josie scuffed back toward the table and bent over it tornunzip her toiletries bag. Rummaging through it for a moment, shernlocated a hair clip from the bottom and placed it between her teethrnas she used both hands to sweep her golden hair from her neck to pilernit into a haphazard bun. Then, holding it in place with one hand, shernretrieved the clip and held her hair in place. As arnparticularly fierce wind whistled down the chimney and around thernlittle cabin, a chill ran down Josie's back, making her shiver forrna moment before she edged herself closer to the steaming tub. Josierngave one last glance toward the bed sheet blocking the doorway andrnthen slipped off one slipper and stepped gracefully over the side ofrnthe metal tub. Arnhiss of half-pain, half-pleasure slid between Josie's teeth inrnreaction to the near-scalding water that encased her leg up to herrncalf. After taking a moment to acclimate herself to the waterrntemperature, she slid the other slipper off and stood fully insidernthe metal tub. Placing both hands at the small of her back, Josiernbowed backward, trying to stretch the kinks out of her stiff spinernand neck before slowly lowering herself into the hot water. Gradually,rncarefully, Josie slid her body into the water, leaning back againstrnthe side and arranging her limbs so that she was surrounded by heatrnto just under her neck. As she leaned her head back against the sidernof the tub, a sigh of pure bliss bubbled from her lips. Ah… Josie thought drowsily as her eyes slid closed, Now this isrnheaven! - - - Afterrnslipping under the sheet to escape to the living room, Sam crossedrnthe room and immediately began to tend to the dying fire. It tookrnonly a moment to rearrange the wood in the rack and to add new piecesrnto get the flames to leap back to life. With a satisfied nod, Sam putrnthe poker back in its holder next to the hearth and settled back downrnon the sofa with his long-forgotten tome of Jane Eyre . Samrnwas barely two paragraphs into the chapter when he heard a painedrngroan issuing from the direction of the kitchen. Despite hisrndetermination to remain aloof and detached from the situation,rndeep-seated worry drew his eyes like a magnet in Josie's direction.rnInstantly, his eyes locked on the makeshift screen blocking Josiernfrom his sight and then he cursed under his breath. InrnSam's haste to put space between he and Josie (not to mention stoprnthinking about the fact that Josie was about to be naked only feetrnaway from him), he didn't consider the placement of the lanternrnproviding light to the kitchen. He'd left the lantern on thernkitchen table…and Josie's tub was positioned between it and thernsheet. So,rnwhile he'd put up the sheet in order to provide Josie more privacy,rnit had, in effect, become the screen upon which Josie's perfectrnsilhouette was cast by the light behind her. AlthoughrnSam knew the polite thing to do would be to avert his eyes, his bodyrnwas just not cooperating with what his mind told it to do. Instead,rnhe gaped stupidly, held rapt by the sensuousness of Josie'srninnocent movements behind the curtain. He watched as she slowlyrnlifted both arms to pin her hair up, and his mind filled in all thernmissing details: the flush in Josie's cheeks from the warm steamrnwafting upward from the tub, how her soft, pale skin would glow inrnthe lamplight, how soft tendrils would escape the clip atop her headrnto gently caress the sides of her face and neck… Sam'srnstomach muscles clenched and he felt the beginnings of a smoky desirernbuilding within him; watching Josie's motions in real life was morernerotic than any dream he'd had of her months ago. Disgusted withrnhis own lack of self-control, Sam rolled violently onto his side andrnforced himself back to the written words on the pages in his hand. Thatrnbudding concentration was broken seconds later when he heard anotherrnhiss of reaction from behind the curtain. As if beyond his control,rnSam's eyes slid back upward in time to watch Josie's silhouetternlift her other foot over the side of the tub. His mouth dropped openrnas he watched her turn to the side so that her entire profile showedrnin glorious detail, and when Josie stretched backward, catlike,rnshowcasing her rather ample bosom, the book Sam had been holding fellrnto the floor with a soft thump from his slack hand. Thankfully,rnJosie's figure turned and slowly sank from view as he heard waterrnsloshing around the tub, displaced by her movement. Sam closed hisrneyes as if to block it out, but that only brought his own internalrnvision of Josie to the backdrop of his eyelids. Sam turned abruptlyrnto lie on his back and opened his eyes to stare at the innocuousrnceiling, trying to rein in his wayward mind…not that it helped.rnBecause the moment Josie's soft, contented sigh issued from herrnlips, Sam's pulse jumped to double-time and the front of his jeansrnsuddenly felt two sizes two small. Springingrnup from the couch as if he were on fire, Sam propelled himself to thernfar side of the room to stand in front of the bookcase…the onlyrnpart of the room from which he could not see the kitchenrndoorway. He rested his forehead against the cool wood of a partitionrnin the bookcase, closed his eyes, and tried to regulate his breathingrnby shutting out his rather sudden reaction. After a moment, hernthought to himself, Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! in time tornhitting his head softly against the bookcase, hoping to knock somernsense back into himself. Turningrnaround and slumping his body against the wall of books, Sam thought, Oh God…I think I'm in hell. - - - Afterrna few minutes, Sam was able to get reasonable control over himselfrnand he returned to the couch under the guise of doing more reading.rnHowever, after reading the same passage seven times in a row and still not comprehending it, it became evident that reading wasrna lost cause. Nornmatter how hard Sam tried, he could not tune out the sounds of waterrnsloshing about in the tub and the occasional soft moan or sigh, andrnthat was proving to be very hazardous to his mental health. Makingrna decision, Sam crossed the room, put on his coat and grabbed his hatrnand gloves. Then he walked over to stand in the kitchen doorway,rntaking care to keep his eyes averted on the off chance he mightrnactually be able to see through the sheet. Softly, Sam cleared hisrnthroat. \"Uh, Josie?\" Therernwas a second's pause, as if perhaps Sam had caught Josie dozing.rnHer voice was thick with relaxed bliss when she answered, \"Yes?\" Thernhusky quality of Josie's voice made Sam's stomach flip-flop. Itrnimmediately brought to mind visions of lazy mornings after laternnights, tousled hair and flushed cheeks, and… Samrnshook his head as if to clear it and continued, \"You doing okay inrnthere?\" Anotherrnlong pause confirmed Sam's suspicions that Josie might be fallingrnasleep in the tub. When she finally answered, it was little more thanrna murmur. \"Mmmmhmmm….\" Again,rnunbidden pictures of golden hair splayed across his pillow and herrnwarm body curled up next to his popped into Sam's mind, forcing himrnto take deep steadying breaths and start mentally naming the currentrnMets team roster…in reverse alphabetical order. \"Look…\" hernreplied once he'd regained control again, \"I'm going to go outrnand shovel a path to the wood pile and check on the generator, okay?\" Thisrntime, Sam heard the water in the tub slosh, as if perhaps Josie hadrnsat up, and her reply was clearer, stronger. \"Okay.\" Samrnstuffed the fur-lined hat on his head to cover his ears and pulledrnthe collar up on his coat before slipping his hands into his glovesrnand heading outside into the relative safety of the blizzard. - - - AsrnSam stepped over the threshold into the outside, a biting westerlyrnwind slapped across his face and sandblasted snowflakes against hisrnskin. He almost relished the stinging onslaught because it finallyrngave him something to think about besides Josie naked in the tub (orrnanywhere else he'd been imagining her). Samrnleaned his forearm on the shovel handle and surveyed hisrnsurroundings. Already there were several inches of snow on thernground, and with many hours of the storm to go, not to mention thernstrength of the winds blowing off the lake, Sam wondered if trying tornshovel now was an exercise in futility. Still, he knew that he'drnneed to bring in more wood from the pile if he and Josie had anyrnintention of keeping warm for longer than the next 12 hours. (He hadrnto force his mind not to contemplate other ways in which hernand Josie might keep each other warm…) Shakingrnhis head ruefully, he placed his hands on the handle of the shovelrnand pushed aside his first shovel full. If nothing else, Samrnreasoned, the physical exertion would help cure his ills. Hisrnills… Pausing in his shoveling long enough to take a glancernbackward through the window into the warm of the cabin, Sam snortedrnat the huge understatement. Josie.rnHis continued reaction to her puzzled him. He just couldn't seem tornstop thinking about her in ways he shouldn't. Yet, if Sam'srnvehement reactions to even Josie's most innocent moments could havernbeen explained away as a simple case of lust, he would have beenrnsatisfied. After all, Josie Geller was a beautiful woman…rnAdd to that being trapped together for several days in a tinyrnthree-room cabin and that explanation would make sense. However, (andrnthe pace of Sam's shoveling increased as he admitted this truth tornhimself) deep down, he knew that his attraction had seeds in emotionsrnhe refused to name. And it was that fact that haunted him. Samrnwanted desperately to be impervious to Josie's sweet, sexy-but-shyrnallure. Yet, just as it had been months before, it was still hisrnAchilles heel. Her manner woke every possessive, protective urge inrnhim, worming its way under any shell or defense he tried to musterrnup. Even his shroud of irrational anger had provided little defensernagainst Josie's charms today. And this was only the beginning. Itrnwas quite possible that he and Josie would be trapped alone here forrnseveral more days. Thernlack of willpower he'd shown thus far in his dealings with Josiernonly served to infuriate him. Damn it, he'd thought he'd learnedrnmore from his last experience with her than this! What Josie wasrndoing to him at present—invoking that same shy innocence—had beenrnhis undoing when she was at South Glen South. JosiernGeller had used his feelings for her as a tool to gain status at herrnjob. That's all he had been to her: a means to an end. And when shernhadn't gotten the story she had planned, she'd used him anyway byrnwriting the kind of feel good, underdog-trying-to-succeed story (withrnhim at the center of it) that never failed to win over people'srnhearts. Everyone'srnexcept his , that was. At least he'd been able to hold outrnthat much and not make a complete lovesick fool out ofrnhimself. AsrnSam's shovel clanked against the bottom of the woodpile at last, hernwondered again about Josie's behavior. After all, what did she havernto gain by trying to entice him now? Her story about him had come andrngone and she'd obviously gotten the promotion she'd wanted.rnShaking his head as he cleared snow off the top of the pile, Samrnstopped trying to make sense of her actions. Obviously, she must have some agenda, even if he didn't yet know what it was. Well,rnwhatever it is, Sam told himself, determined, it's not goingrnto work. I won't be played for a fool twice. - - - Withrnan armful of wood and a new determination in place, Sam pushed openrnthe door to the cabin and placed the snow-dusted wood in a holderrnnear the hearth, where they could safely defrost and dry. Withoutrneven bothering to shut the door between trips, Sam made quick work ofrnfilling the holder with logs. He pulled the shovel back inside,rnknocked the snow off his boots and then quietly shut the door. Pullingrnoff his gloves and hat and placing them on the hearthstone before thernfire, Sam pulled back his coat sleeve and was surprised to discoverrnthat almost two hours had passed. Glancingrnaround, he half expected to see Josie curled up under a blanket onrnthe sofa reading a book. But she wasn't. Nor was she in thernbedroom, as Sam discovered by toeing the bedroom door ajar. That onlyrnleft… Quietly,rnSam approached the kitchen and called out softly, \"Josie?\" Therernwas no answer. Sam tried again, a little bit louder this time.rn\"Josie?\" Butrnthere was still no answer. While realistically, Sam knew that most likelyrnJosie had simply fallen asleep in the tub, a sliver of irrationalrnworry laced through his veins. After all, he'd been warned aboutrnthe possibility of a concussion, and with the other aches and painsrnthat had come on so suddenly, it was possible she could have had anrnadverse reaction while he was outside. It was this concern thatrnfinally won out as he carefully pushed the sheet aside and steppedrnunder it into the kitchen. - - - Samrncould not possibly have prepared himself for the sight that greetedrnhim. Josie lay shoulder-deep in the water, her head softly restingrnupon the side of the metal tub rim. Indeed, as Sam had imaginedrnearlier, soft tendrils of golden hair had slipped from the comb atoprnher head to damply curl around her cheeks, framing her face, whichrnwas beatific in slumber. Miniscule beads of perspiration slickedrnJosie's shoulders, neck, and face, giving her skin an ethereal glowrnin the dying lamplight. Thernonly saving grace was that, from the angle at which Sam viewed thernscene, he could see little more than scant traces of what lay beneathrnthe water. Instead, the golden light from the lantern dappled thernsurface that rippled slightly with each breath Josie took. She couldrnnot have appeared more innocently sensual at that moment if she hadrntried. Sam'srnbreath caught in his throat. He wanted to escape, wanted reclaim hisrnsenses, but he couldn't move; he couldn't wrench his eyes fromrnthe scene before him. Josie was like a golden water goddess justrnemerged from the deep, her siren song reaching deep into his soul,rnpulling him toward her against his will. Heedingrnher call, Sam took one step closer, then another. He just couldn'trnhelp himself. In his mind, he could already feel the silk of Josie'srnskin against his palms, the warmth of her kiss against his lips.rnBefore he'd even realized it, Sam was kneeling beside Josie, gentlyrntucking the unruly strands of hair on the left side of her facernbehind her ear before whispering a ghost of a kiss along thernsensitive skin of her jaw line. As arnsoft sigh slipped past Josie's lips, Sam reached upward with onernhand to pull her head closer to him, to finally give in to the achingrnneed to kiss her properly that had plagued him for months… Arnsudden awareness of what he was doing doused Sam in icy waves, as hernfroze in mid-motion, horrified. Rocking himself backward onto thernballs of his feet, he put some much-needed space between himself andrnJosie, letting his breath leave him in a rush. Had he not just vowedrnto himself moments before that he would not fall prey to JosiernGeller's plans, whatever they were? Had he not promised to remainrnimpervious to her \"innocent\" charms? Pushingrnhimself back up to a stand, Sam suddenly recognized the trap he'drnalmost fallen into. He could now clearly see how Josie had planned tornuse this scenario to her advantage, using his concern for her welfarernto wile him into giving in to his desires for her. Well,rnit's not going to work, Josie… Sam thought wryly. Thisrntime I've got you figured out. Pushingrnaside the strung-up sheet, Sam exited the kitchen and crossed thernliving room. If you want to toy with me, Josie Geller, then gornahead and do your worst. I'm ready. Let the games begin. Andrnon that thought, Sam wrenched open the front door to the cabin,rnpulling it as far back as it would go on its hinges…and thenrnslammed it with all of his might. Thernalmighty bang echoed around the walls of the tiny cabin. As Sam heardrnthe telltale sounds of sudden splashing coming from the direction ofrnthe kitchen, he knew his plan had worked; Josie was now mostrndefinitely awake. Smilingrnwith relish, Sam chuckled under his breath as he thought to himself: Sam Coulson – 1, Josie Geller – 0. - - -[Chapter 10] Snowbound,rnPart 10 ByrnRocknVaughn -rn- - Author'srnNote : I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the nicernreviews, and also to comment on a few of them. Seeing that this storyrnis primarily about the UST between Sam and Josie, in my opinion, arnquick resolution to that tension would kill the story. Also, I didn'trnfeel it would be realistic for Sam to just sit down and talk to Josiernabout his feelings. He's still very much in love with Josie, andrnhates that he is. In fact, he doesn't even want to admit that to himself , never mind Josie. He's still very hurt by what hernperceives she's done to him and isn't ready to give up his anger.rnAnd he certainly is too afraid to trust anything Josie has to say forrnfear that she'll use him again. So, while Sam in the deepestrnrecesses of his heart really wants the Josie he fell in love with tornbe real, he's not going to acknowledge that fact to her, nor take significant risks to determine if his Josie may actually exist. OnrnJosie's side, she's still hurt and insecure about Sam'srnintentions and feelings for her and isn't going to want to open uprnto him so he can stomp on her heart for a 2nd time. Whilernshe's more honest with herself about her feelings, she doesn'trntrust herself or Sam with them. Thatrnbeing said, the story's not going to be just a \"he thinks, shernthinks\" situation, either. There will be interactions andrnconfrontations between the two; I just think they won't get intornanything too heavy until the cabin fever starts to kick in…andrnthen, watch the sparks fly! Okay, without further ado...here's the next part. Thanks again for reading and reviewing! - - - Josiernwas having the most wonderful dream. She felt as if she werernfloating, as if a gentle summer breeze were carrying her along like arnfluffy, white cloud. Wrapped in delicious warmth, a permeatingrnfeeling of safety and contentment surrounded her. Then,rnas if her senses were tuned only to him, she could feel Sam movingrncloser to her. She could not see him, but she could hear the rustlernof his movement, smell a hint of his cologne, and feel his eyesrnburning her. Yet,rninstead of making her nervous or embarrassed, it intensified thernfeeling of warmth and protection. She felt, rather than heard hisrnapproach. Soon, she felt his presence hovering like an angel besidernher. The unique smell of him wafted on the breeze all around her. Herrnlips parted in anticipation as she felt, finally, the touch of Sam'srnfingers as they tenderly brushed away hair that tickled her neck,rntucking it safely behind her ear. Josie'srnheart skipped a beat and her breath caught in her chest as she feltrnSam's heavenly lips caressing her jaw. A blissful sigh slid fromrnher lips. She felt his warm breath upon her throat; he was movingrncloser, closer…he would surely kiss her, at last, at last … Asrnif clouds suddenly obscured the sun, Josie felt chilled, bereft. Forrnsome inexplicable reason, Sam had disappeared. His hands, his lips,rnhis breath were gone, leaving behind only an aching need. She wantedrnto reach out to Sam, to beckon him back, but it was as if he werernmade of smoke. There was nothing to grasp onto; he'd simplyrnvanished. Herrnmind cried out for him, Wait! Come back! before a loud crashrnbrought her abruptly to consciousness. -rn- - Asrnthe loud banging noise shook the kitchen, Josie literally startledrnawake, moving the now tepid water in the tub so violently that somernof it sloshed over the side onto the floor. Placingrna shaky hand over her pounding heart, Josie called out unsteadily,rn\"Sam? Sam, is that you?\" Josiernheard his footfalls drawing nearer and then stop just outside therndoorway. \"Yeah, it's me,\" Sam replied. \"Sorry about therndoor…the wind caught it when I was coming in. Hope I didn't wakernyou.\" Therernwas something slightly off about Sam's voice that nagged at Josie,rnbut she couldn't put her finger on what it was. Wrapping her armsrnaround herself to stave off the sudden cold sinking into her from therncool water and even cooler air, her teeth chattered slightly as shernstammered in reply, \"Uh….no, no. I'm fine.\" She paused forrnanother moment, but when she didn't hear Sam retreat, she added,rn\"Uh, I think…I'm done in here, so if you wouldn't mind…\"rnJosie trailed off into embarrassed silence. She didn't want tornvoice how shy she felt, knowing she was naked mere feet from him. Luckily,rnit appeared that Sam got the hint. \"Okay. I'm gonna go stoke thernfire. There's a bit of a chill in here.\" Josiernbreathed a sigh of relief as she heard Sam retreat into the livingrnroom. Grabbing either side of the tub with each hand, she carefullyrnpushed herself up to a stand. Gingerly, she twisted this way andrnthat, testing her muscles, and was pleasantly surprised to discoverrnthat the worst of her aches had vanished. Quickly,rnshe stepped out of the tub and into her fuzzy slippers, unfolding thernlarge bath towel to dry herself off. -rn- - Walkingrnaway from the kitchen doorway, Sam felt a sliver of guilt creep intornhis self-satisfied demeanor. Josie sounded rattled (and cold), and hernknew he was responsible for that. Trying to focus less on hisrntroubled conscience and more on what she had been trying to dornto him with her innocent little \"falling asleep in thernbathtub\" trick, he picked up a couple of new logs and stoked thernfire. Hernheard the cascade of water as it slid off Josie's body and closedrnhis eyes firmly against the temptation to look in her direction. He'drnalready caused himself enough trouble responding to her little peeprnshow as she'd gotten into the tub; he wasn't going to fallrnfor it again as she got out. Still,rneven over the hissing of the damp wood on the fire, Sam could hearrnthe towel flick open, could hear the sound the cotton made as itrnrubbed against Josie's body. Josie's naked body…his mindrncorrected before Sam reined in his rogue thoughts once more. Rubbingrna hand over his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose inrnfrustration, Sam decided that the sooner Josie Geller was fullyrndressed, the better off he'd be. -rn- - Josiernslipped her arms into the thick terrycloth robe and wrapped thernlapels across her, tying the sash tightly across her waist to keep itrnclosed. Sighing at the warmth it provided, she tried to keep her mindrnfrom her dream as she bent over to clean up the water puddle she'drnmade. Oncernshe was sure she'd cleaned up the mess, she laid the towel acrossrnthe back of one of the kitchen chairs, scooting it over with a scrapernacross the floor toward the stove so the towel could dry. Then,rnsquaring her shoulders and pulling the bathrobe sash even tighter,rnshe pushed aside the sheet and stepped out into the living room. Samrnwas still on his knees before the fire, leaning forward on his handsrnto blow softly upon the kindling, coaxing it to light. Josie couldn'trnhelp but admire how his wonderful jeans molded themselves to hisrntoned thighs and bottom. Asrnif sensing her eyes on him, Sam turned his head to look at her; arntouch of an amused smile graced the corners of his mouth. \"Everythingrnall right?\" he asked as his eyes assessed Josie from head to toe. Josierncould feel the heat rising in her cheeks both from Sam's visualrnassessment of her and that he had caught her staring at him. Shernstammered, \"Oh, um, yeah…fine.\" Mentally rolling her eyes atrnhow stupid she'd just sounded, she added more calmly, \"The bathrnwas a big help. Thank you.\" \"Good,\"rnSam murmured, suddenly lost in Josie's green eyes. Theirrneyes remained locked as moments ticked by, unnoticed by either ofrnthem. Finally, Josie's eyes darted away from Sam's face, lookingrnat everything but him. \"I…uh, I'm gonna go get changed,rnif you don't mind,\" she said, staring at the rough hewn rocks ofrnthe hearth just over Sam's head. Withrna nod, Sam pushed himself into a squat and then stood, brushing hisrnhands together to remove dust and ash from them. \"Okay,\" hernreplied, \"then I'll just go and take care of that tub while yourndo that.\" Josiernnodded shyly, and entered the bedroom, closing the door safely behindrnher before letting out a long breath she didn't realize she'drnbeen holding. Sam seemed more irresistibly attractive to her withrnevery passing moment. It was getting difficult just to be in the samernroom with the man without staring at him, or worse, wish things couldrnbe different between them. Sam had made it painfully clear that wouldrnnever happen. Josie almost hoped Sam would get angry with her again,rnif only to bring her back to reality for a while. Morernand more, Josie thought that perhaps Anita had been right…there wasrnno way she could be around Sam without getting her heartrnbroken…again. Unfortunately, with the blizzard now in full force,rnit was too late to do anything about it. Both she and her heart werernnow trapped; Josie could only hope that when it was all over, she'drnfind a way to put Sam Coulson behind her. -rn- - Samrnstared for a long moment at the closed bedroom door. Even afterrnvowing to hold out against Josie's charms, he was finding it morernand more difficult to do so. Letting out a long, weary sigh, hernheaded toward the kitchen to clean things up. Samrnpushed aside the sheet across the doorway to let himself through andrnthen turned to systematically remove the clips holding it in placernbefore folding the sheet and putting it aside. Then he busied himselfrnwith stoking the fire inside the stove and refilling the gutteringrnlantern with kerosene until it blazed brightly again, casting hisrnenlarged shadow upon the wall behind him like a specter. Standingrnwith his hands on his hips, Sam pondered the best way to dispose ofrnthe water in the tub. Unheeded, the vision of Josie sleeping neckrndeep in the water reemerged, causing Sam to curse under his breath.rnBending over, he tried to expend his excess energy on heaving the tubrnbackward toward the sink, but it wouldn't budge. Instead, Sam hadrnto bail out several potfuls before he could move the metal tub. Finally,rnSam was able to lift it and carry it to the double sink, where hernpoured the remaining water out in a rushing cascade. That done, herntucked the tub back into the alcove where he'd found it and wearilyrnplopped himself backward into the chair that Josie had pulled closernto the stove, leaning both elbows on the back while he rested hisrnchin in his hands. Samrnstared idly out the window over the sink, watching as the windrnwhipped snowflakes against its surface, listening to the tappingrnsound they made against the glass. He wondered how long the stormrnwould last. He hoped that when he woke up in the morning, the worstrnof it would be over, but somehow Sam knew in the pit of his stomachrnthat wouldn't be the case. Faternobviously had other plans…and it seemed they were at cross-purposesrnto his. All he'd wanted from his trip to the cabin was a chance to forget Josie, to finally put her behind him so he could movernon with his life. Instead, she was here in the flesh right under hisrnnose, and there was little doubt that, after this, he would never be able to get her from under his skin. Asrnif to prove his point, the steam from the drying towel blasted Sam'srnsenses, leaving behind just a trace of Josie's perfume in hisrnnostrils. Immediately, his body responded: his heart skipped a beatrnand then began to drum against his ribcage in anticipation. Damnrnit! he thought angrily, yanking the offending cotton material offrnthe back of the chair and whipping it across the room away from him. -rn- - OncernJosie's heart stopped hammering and she caught a few calmingrnbreaths, she sat down on the bed, picking her wristwatch up off thernbedside table. She was surprised to discover it was ten past nine,rnand that she'd been in the tub for about two hours. Shruggingrnslightly, Josie attached the watch to her wrist and then dug into herrnovernight bag to retrieve her pajamas. Nuzzling her nose into thernsoft flannel of the button down top, she sighed. At least she'd hadrnthe foresight to pack warm (and non-revealing!) nightwear. This way,rnshe could at least be seen outside the bedroom without blushing rightrnto her roots. Notrnthat it mattered , she thought. It was obvious that Sam wantedrnnothing more than to be free of her as soon as possible. And,rnconsidering how much trouble she was having controlling her emotionsrnaround him, Josie was starting to feel that way, too. -rn- - Soon,rnJosie was covered head to foot in pink flannel, sitting cross-leggedrnon the bed as she chewed thoughtfully on the end of her pen cap.rnSpread-eagled before her was her trusty journal; the one place wherernshe felt she could truly be honest about herself, her feelings, andrnanything else of note in her life. Itrnhad been a Christmas present from Anita last year…a gift to helprnJosie, then a reporter-wanna-be, hone her writing skills. Of course,rnthat was before…before her big break… Before my bigrnheartbreak… Josie amended mentally. Whilernshe had used her journal in the months prior to her assignment atrnSouth Glen South, from the moment she'd walked through the doors ofrnthat school, the book had become an essential part of her day.rnLooking back through its pages now with the 20/20 vision ofrnhindsight, it was obvious to Josie that she had been falling for SamrnCoulson from the very first day she'd met him. The pages werernlittered with anecdotes he'd used in class, things he'd told her,rncomments he'd written on her papers, how he'd made her feel. Whenrnshe couldn't admit her feelings to anyone else, even to herself,rnshe could pour her heart out to these pages; safe in the knowledgernthat whatever she wrote there would remain her secret. Tornher journal, she'd confessed her attraction to Sam and lamented hisrnhaving a girlfriend (not that he'd ever be attracted to her—JosiernGrossie—anyway…). To her journal she confided how excited she'drnfelt when Sam had rescued her on the Ferris wheel, when he'drnconfided to her his fears about commitment to his girlfriend, and hadrncomplimented Josie in a way that had apparently even surprised him.rnAnd oh, the look they'd shared high above Chicago! It had beenrnenough to make her breath catch and her heart beat double-time. Thatrnhad been the beginning , she knew, brushing aside a tear as shernflipped through the pages, reminiscing. That moment changedrneverything. Asrninexperienced as Josie was in the ways of men, and as incredible asrnit seemed, somehow she knew in that moment that her feelingsrnfor Sam weren't altogether unrequited. The weeks that followedrnemphasized that fact over and over again. However, she could neverrndetermine if Sam just cared for her as a favorite student, or ifrnthere was something more going on. Itrnhadn't been until Prom night, until their dance together, thatrnshe'd known , known that what Sam felt for her went wayrnbeyond the boundaries of teacher and student. That knowledge bothrnthrilled and terrified her: She was thrilled that her feelings werernbeing returned by such an incredible man, yet she was terrifiedrnbecause Gus had indeed been right about Sam's feelings. Gus wantedrnJosie to betray Sam at the very moment he was at his mostrnvulnerable—when he'd finally laid his heart out on the line forrnher—not that she had had any intention of doing so; she just hadn'trndecided how she would go about protecting him yet. But,rnfirst things first: She needed to tell Sam the truth, to let him knowrnthat all was not as it seemed, and tell him she felt the same forrnhim. Then she had to pray he'd understand. From the earnest,rnheartfelt look in Sam's eyes, Josie honestly believed he would understand, would forgive her for the necessary disguise that hadrnplaced an invisible barrier between them for the last two months. Butrnthen, her future and her past had collided. Her selfless act ofrnsaving Aldys from humiliation by the popular kids had been morerninstinct than conscious choice. Josie had seen herself in the girlrnand had been determined not to let history repeat itself. She'drnsucceeded in saving Aldys from Josie's own fate, but paid arnterrible price in the process. Just when Josie thought she'drnfinally found happiness, fate's wheel had spun cruelly, wrenchingrnSam from her forever. Josiernlet out a deep sigh, flipping forward to the first blank page andrnwiping her damp eyes against her sleeve. No good could come fromrnwanting what she couldn't have; that was one lesson she'd learnedrnwell enough. Her pining for Sam Coulson was pointless, and the soonerrnshe accepted that fact, the better off she'd be. -rn- - Wearyrnfrom a long afternoon and evening, not to mention a treacherous trekrnhome in the middle of a blizzard, Will Parker let out a grateful sighrnas he pulled open the back door to his cozy home in downtown Oswego.rnShoving the door closed against the storm, Will stood in thernentryway, shrugged off his heavy slicker and stomped the snow off hisrnheavy-duty boots. Fromrnaround the corner, his wife Meredith called, \"Will? Is that you,rnhoney?\" Arnmischievous smile touched the corners of his mouth as he hung up hisrnslicker and sat on the bench next to the door to remove his boots.rn\"No, it's the milkman,\" he replied playfully. Anrnauburn-haired beauty rounded the corner and met Will lips first as hernstood with arms open to receive her greeting. Ruffling her fingersrnthrough his wavy hair, still wet with melting snow, she confided inrnlittle more than a whisper, \"Well, in that case, you should get outrnof here…my husband will be home soon.\" An impish grin grewrnagainst Will's lips. Afterrnpulling his wife closer and kissing her properly, Will responded, \"Irnthink I'll chance it.\" He linked his arm around her back as theyrnambled into the living room. \"Where are the kids?\" Will askedrnlightly. \"Justrntucked them into bed,\" Meredith replied. \"They're probablyrnstill awake if you want to say good night…\" Willrndetached himself from his wife's embrace long enough to enter hisrndaughters' room and give an affectionate kiss and hug to each ofrnhis half-asleep 6 year old twins. Oncernhe'd returned to the living room, Meredith asked him, \"Are yournhungry? Did you eat?\" Willrnplopped himself wearily into his favorite overstuffed armchair andrnmotioned for his wife to come sit by him on the arm. \"No, I grabbedrna sandwich at the office.\" As his wife's fingers slid through hisrnhair softly, Will found his mind straying back to the accidentrnearlier that day, and the strange behavior of his friend. Pressingrna kiss to her husband's temple, Meredith asked, \"Where are you?\" Shakingrnhis head lightly as if to clear it, Will pulled Meredith's handrndown to his lips and pressed them against her palm. \"Oh, I was justrnthinking…\" \"Uh,rnhuh…\" Meredith coaxed, \"And?\" \"Well,rnthere was an accident out on Lake Drive this afternoon.\" \"Wasrnanyone hurt?\" \"Well,rnyes, but not seriously hurt. Actually, the woman was quiternlucky…drove right over the embankment and hit a tree. Blindedrnduring that snow squall.\" \"But…\"rnWill's wife motioned with her hand for him to continue, knowingrninstinctively that there was more to the story. \"Well,rnit was the weirdest thing. You remember my friend Sam Coulson?\" \"Thernone from Chicago? His parents have a place down by the lake, right?\" \"Yeah,rnthat's him. Well, he was there when it happened, pulled the youngrnwoman from her car.\" \"Andrnthat's strange?\" \"No,rnwhat's strange is that he knew her…knew her from Chicago.\" \"Wasrnshe up visiting him or something?\" \"No,rnthat's what was so strange…she just happened to be drivingrnback from Green Bay and drove off the road right in front of him.\" \"Okay…\"rnMeredith said, nodding her head. \"I'll admit that's a littlernweird.\" \"Yeah.rnBut what was even more puzzling was their reaction to eachrnother. There was this undercurrent of, oh, I don't know…I guessrnI'd call it tension between them.\" \"Andrnold girlfriend, perhaps?\" Meredith offered. Willrnshrugged. \"I don't know. Her name sounded familiar to me, yet Irncan't remember Sam ever mentioning her.\" As almost anrnafterthought, he mentioned, \"She's a reporter for the Sun Times…Irnthought maybe you'd have heard of her…Josie Geller?\" Meredithrnsat up straighter on the arm of the chair, her motion arrested.rn\"Wait…did you say Josie Geller?\" Willrngave his wife a curious glance. \"Yes, I did…why?\" Arnknowing spark glimmered in Meredith's bright blue eyes. \"Petite,rnblonde, and cute?\" \"Yeah…How'drnyou know?\" \"Holdrnon a second…I'll be right back.\" Meredith hurried from thernliving room to their bedroom and returned a moment later carrying arnfolded up newspaper. Unfolding the page and holding it before Will'srnface, she asked, \"Is this her?\" Awernand disbelief colored Will's face as he stared at a black and whiternversion of Josie. \"Yes! But…\" AnsweringrnWill's unfinished question, Meredith replied, \"My sister Janice loves her! She sends me her articles all the time. But I'mrnsurprised you don't remember her, too.\" Will'srnpuzzled look spoke for itself. \"Don'trnyou remember about, oh…six or seven months ago? About thernundercover reporter from Chicago who fell in love with a teacherrnwhile she was on an assignment at a high school? She waited on arnbaseball field for him to show up and forgive her for something she'drndone, but he never came?\" Nowrnthat Meredith had mentioned it, Will vaguely remembered seeing thernstory on the news. \"Yes, now I do.\" \"Thatrnwas her !\" Meredith enthused, pointing at Josie's picturernagain. She quickly scanned the article, rereading what Josie had saidrnabout her mystery man. Then her eyes narrowed shrewdly. \"Will?rnIsn't Sam Coulson a teacher?\" \"Yeah…\"rnhe replied, confused, clearly not following his wife's train ofrnthought. \" Atrna high school in Chicago? \" she asked pointedly. \"Uh,rnhuh…\" said Will, still not getting understanding what she wasrngetting at. Laugherrnbubbled from Meredith's lips at the perplexed look on Will'srnface. \"Don't you get it? Sam's the teacher !\" Immediatelyrnthe denial sprang to Will's lips, because the idea seemed sornoutlandish, yet, he couldn't deny that it seemed to put Sam'srnstrange behavior in an understandable perspective. Finally, hernadmitted, \"Maybe.\" \"Maybernnothing!\" Meredith crowed. \"So, what happened after thernaccident?\" Willrncouldn't meet her eyes as he admitted, \"Um, well…Sam sortrnof…offered to put her up at his place while her car was gettingrnfixed, but…\" Meredithrngiggled and hugged Will around the neck. \"You see? He still lovesrnher. It's definitely him.\" \"… But …\"rnWill cut in, trying to put a damper on her excitement. \"He didn'trnseem at all thrilled about the prospect.\" \"Yeah,rnbut he still offered ,\" Meredith rebutted. \"Did shernaccept?\" \"Yes,rnshe did.\" Meredithrnhugged the newspaper to her chest and let out a most girlish squeal.rn\"Oooh, it's gonna happen…I feel it!\" \"What'srngoing to happen?\" \"He'srngoing to forgive her.\" \"Who?rnSam?\" Meredithrnnodded gleefully. Willrnthought back to that afternoon and reassessed Josie and Sam'srnbehavior around each other. His voice laced with doubt, Will said, \"Irndon't know…\" before finally amending, \"Well, maybe… if they don't kill each other first.\" -rn- -[Chapter 11] Snowbound,rnPart 11 ByrnRocknVaughn - - - Torntake his mind off of all things Josie, Sam finished straightening uprnthe kitchen and put the kettle on the stove. Maybe some tea wouldrnhelp settle his jangled nerves, he thought. Walking over to thernkitchen table, Sam fiddled with the lamp wick, the flame inside thernglobe leaping higher as the added light brightened the dark cornersrnof the room. Then he reached over and turned on the radio, hoping tornhear a weather report, silently praying the news would be good. Muchrnto his chagrin, what Sam heard was quite the opposite: And now,rnyour WNFL Weather-on-the-Threes… The strong weather system movingrnthrough our area is now forecast to stall out over Lake Michigan laternthis evening, lashing most of Kewaunee and Mantiowoc counties withrnhigh winds and heavy snow, creating near blizzard conditions for uprnto the next 24 hours. Additional lake effect snow could leave somerncoastal communities buried under two to three feet of snow byrnChristmas morning. Governor Jim Doyle has already declared a State ofrnEmergency for the affected areas and has the National Guard onrnstandby for what could be a record-breaking storm. Great,rnjust great, Sam thought irritably, switching off the radio withrnmore force than necessary. As if things weren't bad enoughrnalready…now the storm's going to last for another whole day…atrnleast. That prospect did nothing to raise Sam's spirits. Everyrnmoment spent in Josie's presence just made him more and morernconfused. Logically,rnSam knew that the innocent act Josie used was most likely just that:rnan act used to elicit certain emotions from him. She'd used it tornperfection last spring, and perhaps felt she had something more torngain by playing that hand again. However,rnhe still hadn't determined a viable purpose for Josie to continuernthat charade. And moreover, a small part of him (granted it was thernsappy, completely illogical, believing-in-miracles part) hopedrnagainst hope that he'd been wrong about her and that maybe, justrnmaybe, Josie really was what she seemed. Butrnthen, if that was the case, then his leaving her standingrnalone on that ball field was reprehensible. And Sam just couldn'trnbring himself to believe he could have been that wrong about herrntwice. Samrnrubbed at the wrinkles etched into his forehead. This going aroundrnand around in circles was getting him nowhere. Perhaps Josie wasrnright: maybe just putting the past completely behind them and justrnacting like courteous strangers was the best way to minimize thernimpact of being together. Atrnthis point, he was desperate enough to try anything. -rn- - Atrnfirst, it was difficult for Josie to get the words to come. Forrnseveral minutes, she sat staring at the blank pages before her, notrnknowing what she could possibly write that would encompass all thatrnshe was feeling. Finally,rnJosie simply gave up on trying to be eloquent and allowed herrnstream-of-consciousness to take over. Decemberrn23, 1999 Todayrnstarted out like any other day. This morning my life was normal,rnboring, albeit a bit lonely. But I'm used to that now. You'drnthink that, after my assignment at South Glen, I'd be accustomed tornsick twists of fate; after all, who would have ever guessed I'drnfind my true self in the midst of being undercover? Who would havernever imagined I'd finally find my soul mate? Who would have guessedrnthat I could have won him and lost him in the space of a minute? So,rnhow could I have guessed in the midst of my very average morning thatrnthe events of today would change my life? Less than twelve hoursrnlater, my life is in what I could only call chaos…the kind ofrnemotional chaos that only Sam Coulson could bring. Sevenrnmonths after Sam walked out of my life, seemingly forever, faterndeposited him back in it…if only for a while. Here, on a back roadrnin rural Wisconsin, hundreds of miles away from our respective homes,rnour lives collided again…almost literally. Losing control of my car during arnwhiteout of snow, I almost hit his car. He was the only witness tornthe accident and pulled me to safety. That could have been the end ofrnthe encounter, but, for some reason that I still have yet to fathom,rninstead Sam opened his home to me in the form of a small cabin hisrnfamily has in this quiet, sleepy town of Oswego so I could waitrnlocally while my car is being repaired. Oh,rnand did I mention we're now snowed in together during a blizzard? Andrnadd to that his mystifying behavior. One minute he's biting my headrnoff, and then next he's doing something so sweet and thoughtfulrnthat it makes me want to cry. It's confusing and exhilarating andrnexasperating and painful to be around him again, because I know thatrnwhen it's all over, he'll vanish from my life once more, leavingrna gaping hole where my heart once was. Yeah,rnlike I said, complete and total chaos. -rn- - Thernwhistling kettle broke Sam from his reverie. Pulling the kettle offrnthe stove and setting it aside, he stuck his head into the pantry andrnretrieved a glass canister nearly full of teabags of differentrnflavors. Tucking it under his arm, he walked across the room to therndrip strainer next to the sink and plucked his favorite mug from therntray. Depositing both items on the table, Sam turned to grab thernhandle of the kettle and was about to pour the steaming water when hernrealized suddenly that he hadn't heard nor seen Josie in quite somerntime. Settingrnthe kettle down on the table abruptly, he made a beeline for thernbedroom door, which was tightly shut. Battling against the internalrnstruggle over how prudent it was for him to be concerned about Josie,rnhe raised a fist and rapped on the door with his knuckles. Tryingrnto keep the worry he felt from his voice, Sam said, \"Josie? You allrnright in there?\" -rn- - Thernjarring sound of knocking on the bedroom door literally caused Josiernto jump. After hearing nothing but the whistling wind for manyrnminutes, the noise seemed out of place somehow. Placing one hand overrnher pounding heart, Josie deposited her pen into middle of herrnjournal and flipped the cover shut over it. Takingrna shuddering, calming breath, Josie replied, \"Yes, I'm fine.\" Therernwas a long pause before Sam's reply. \"Can I come in for arnminute?\" Josiernpeered down at herself. In her flannel pajamas, fuzzy slippers andrnfluffy bathrobe, she was about as covered as she could possibly be,rnand didn't see the harm in letting Sam see her. \"Sure.\" Samrnpushed open the door to stand just inside the jamb. \"I know yournwere probably changing in here, but I wanted to remind you that rightrnnow, the only heat we have is from the hearth in the living room. Yournleave this room shut up and it'll get cold in here awfully fast.\" Arnshiver shook Josie's shoulders as if she'd only just noticed thernchill because Sam had mentioned it. \"Sorry,\" she replied, \"Irndidn't even think of it.\" Samrnshrugged one shoulder noncommittally. \"Hey, it's okay, I justrnwanted to remind you.\" After a moment, he found himself asking, \"Irnwas about to make myself some tea to warm me up. Would you like some,rntoo?\" Josiernstared at Sam for a long moment, blinking back a sudden shimmery hazernof tears. There he went, being all sweet again; she didn't know howrnto react when he was like this. Softly, she replied, \"That would bernlovely, thank you.\" Notrntrusting his own voice when Josie looked at him this way, he noddedrnand lowered his eyes. When the speechless moment passed, Samrnanswered, \"We have several different kinds…why don't you comernout and choose one?\" Swallowingrna lump in her throat, Josie murmured, \"Okay.\" AsrnSam vacated the room, Josie quickly stored her journal back into herrnovernight bag, straightened the lapels of her bathrobe, and thenrnfollowed him out to the kitchen. Asrnshe entered the room, Sam was just pouring boiling water into twornmugs perched on the table. Looking up with a smile, Sam nodded towardrnthe glass jar closest to her. \"Feel free to look through there. Myrnmom stocks several different kinds.\" Gingerlyrnpopping the lid open, Josie sifted through the tea bags, turning therntags once in a while to read their contents. After a moment, shernhappened across a specialty flavor that caught her eye: MichiganrnBlack Cherry. Letting out a tiny squeal of delight, she removed thernbag from the canister and placed it into her cup of steaming water,rnsmiling as the smell of cherries wafted around her. Sam'srninterest was piqued by Josie's reaction and couldn't help butrnask, \"So, what kind did you decide upon?\" Josiernlifted the mug between both hands and took a deep sniff and sighedrnagain. \"Black cherry,\" she answered with a contented smile. \"IrnIlove/I cherries…\" she confided. \"Really?\"rnSam replied, and then said without thinking, \"Then you should tasternmy Mom's cherry pies; they're to die for.\" Asrnsoon as they'd left his mouth, Sam wished he could have snatchedrnthe words back, because they inferred a familiarity with Josie thatrnhe didn't want to encourage. Josiernsaw the look of immediate regret cross Sam's face and it stabbed atrnher heart. Every time she thought things were getting just a littlernbit better, she got another reminder that things would never be thernsame between them. With a wistful smile, she responded, \"I'll betrnthey're wonderful.\" Arntense silence stretched out between them and Josie started to babblernnervously. \"I've always loved cherries…a real fiend for them.rnOne summer, my parents took Rob and I to the National Cherry Festivalrnup in Traverse City, Michigan. There were so many pies, and cobblers,rnand cakes that we couldn't decide what to buy. And we got to tourrnan orchard and pick fresh cherries right off the trees…NowrnIthat/I was heaven. They were so plump and sweet that the juicernwould run right down your chin! Did you know that Michigan grows 70rnpercent of all the cherries grown in the United States?\" Josie'srncheeks turned as red as the cherries she had spoken of when shernrealized how stupid she must sound. Staring down into her mug, sherndipped the tea bag up and down a few times and wished the darn floorrnwould open up and swallow her whole. Despiternhimself, Sam found himself smiling. He'd always found Josie'srntendency toward nervous chatter endearing. Trying to ease herrndiscomfort he responded with interest, \"Really? I didn't knowrnthat.\" AtrnSam's comforting tone of voice, Josie peeked a look at him throughrnher lashes. With a tiny, embarrassed smile, she said, \"Yeah…butrnI'm sure you didn't really need to know that.\" \"It'srnall right,\" Sam assured her. Withrna shrug, Josie felt sure that Sam was just humoring her. Shernconcentrated on spooning sugar into her tea and swirling it around.rnOnce she'd completed that, and Sam had spoken nothing further,rnJosie took that as her hint that he didn't really want her around.rnCarefully removing and disposing of her teabag, she picked up her mugrnwith both hands and wandered toward the kitchen door. \"Well,\" shernhedged, shifting her weight from foot to foot, \"I guess if yourndon't mind, I'm going to take this back into the bedroom and getrnready for bed.\" Josiernturned to go, but stopped short when she felt Sam's hand on herrnarm. \"Wait.\" Josierntook a deep, calming breath, schooled her features into somethingrnresembling calm (because, with Sam's hand on her arm, she feltrnanything but) and turned around. \"Yes?\" \"Josie,rnI'd like to talk to you for a moment…if you don't mind.\" Josiernraised her eyes to Sam's and immediately wished she hadn't,rnbecause it was happening again…that thing that always seemed tornhappen when their eyes met…that feeling of vertigo, ofrnunsteadiness, of being slightly off-balance. \"O..okay,\" Josiernstammered, trying to look away from Sam's gorgeous green eyes, andrnfinding herself unable to. Samrnblinked several times and tried to compose himself. Still, the greenrnof Josie's marvelous eyes were hard to ignore, especially when theyrnheld such questions in their depths. Finally, he forced himself tornlook away, toward the direction in which he wanted Josie to take.rn\"Why don't we sit down at the table?\" Still,rnSam hadn't removed his hand from her and Josie felt her arm tinglernand her heart pound in response. Not trusting herself to speak, shernnodded and walked back toward the table, pulled out a chair and sat. Samrncrossed to the opposite end of the table and sat down as well, takingrna moment to sip at his tea to soothe his jangling nerves. Earlier,rnhe'd thought that offering the olive branch to settle thingsrnbetween them temporarily was a good idea; now he wasn't so sure.rnWhile putting their past aside made sense logically, Sam sensed thernimpossibility of it before he even voiced it. Every time he looked atrnJosie, all he could see, hear, and feel were the memories. How thernheck was he supposed to put that aside when it was all he had? Yournjust need to stay focused , his logical mind encouraged. Yournwere able to hold out eight months ago; you can do it again now. Beforernhe could change his mind, Sam plunged forward, \"I've beenrnthinking about what you said earlier…about us trying to getrnalong…and I think you're right. We should try harder tornget along. Holding grudges isn't helping the situation. Whatrnhappened back in May is water under the bridge now, and we shouldrnboth just let it go. We're both adults; surely we can get along forrna couple days. When this is all over, you'll go your way; I'll gornmine, and we can forget any of this ever happened, all right?\" Josierndidn't know if she wanted to laugh or cry. When she'd told Samrnshe thought they needed to talk, she'd meant that they should talkrnthings out; discuss each other's side of things to make more sensernof what had happened between them. Samrnwanted to smooth things over, but he also wanted to pretend that whatrnthey'd shared had never existed. The pain that she felt squeezingrnher heart made it hard to breathe. She didn't know what was worse:rnthe knowledge that he could just put her out of his mind as if she'drnnever meant anything to him, or the knowledge that in a few days'rntime, he'd be gone from her life again anyway. Still,rnif he could be this casual about it, then darn it, so would she…evenrnif it killed her. Forcing her lips into a courteous smile, Josiernresponded, \"Sure, if you think that's best.\" Thernsting of polite rejection Sam felt at her words surprised him. Whyrnshould it matter to him that it appeared so easy for Josie to put himrnaside when it was practically killing him to do so? He should havernseen it coming. But irrationally, Sam had hoped that Josie would showrnmore emotion, that maybe she'd crack and tell him how she really felt about him. Apparently, this was her answer. Bitternessrnmade his words clipped, short. \"Yes. I think that's best.\" Josie'srneyebrows scrunched together as she studied the sudden tension inrnSam's face. His mercurial mood changes at breakneck speed werernenough to give her whiplash. He'd said he wanted to put the pastrnbehind them, but when she agreed, he didn't seem happy with that. Unsurernof herself, yet unable to just let things lie, Josie askedrntentatively, \"Sam, I gave you what you wanted…why are you upsetrnwith me again?\" \"I'mrnnot upset,\" Sam immediately denied. Josiernsat back in her chair, crossed her arms across her body, and gave Samrna droll look. \"Yeah, and I'm Queen Latifah,\" she challenged.rn\"Would you please tell me what this is really all about?\" \"Nothing.\" Shakingrnher head, Josie stated the obvious, \"Look Sam, I don't think thisrnis getting us anywhere. Ignoring the situation won't make it gornaway. I think we need to actually talk about what happened,rnwork through it…not brush it under the rug.\" Samrnstood up abruptly, his chair skittering backward away from him. Ifrnshe'd really had feelings for him, she'd had her chance tornmake things right… many times, in fact, in the time he'drnknown her at South Glen and in the 8 months since. But she never had.rnAnd now she wanted to talk about it? Josiernstood also, and put out a pleading hand toward him across the table.rn\"Sam, I told you…I can explain. I can explain everything if you'drnjust listen to me.\" \"Why?rnWhy should I listen? So you can fill my head with more lies? I'vernhad enough of your lies to last two lifetimes.\" Fat tears hovered on thernedges of Josie's lashes, but she blinked them away angrily. She'drnbe damned if she'd let Sam see that he'd made her cry. \"Whatrncan I do to convince you? What can I say to make you understand?\" Samrnstalked to the kitchen doorway, giving her a derisive look over hisrnshoulder. \"Nothing. Not one damn thing.\" After a moment'srnpause, he declared. \"I've had enough. I'm going to bed.\" Josiernstared at Sam's retreating back as he stomped across the livingrnroom to the bench seat, shoved it open, and yanked out a rolled uprnsleeping bag. Quickly, she straightened her head before Sam couldrnturn around and catch her gawking. Placing both hands on the table tornsteady her, Josie quietly allowed the tears she'd been holding backrnto fall. -rn- -[Chapter 12] Snowbound,rnPart 12 ByrnRocknVaughn A/N :rnSorry it's been so long since I've updated! Between real life issuesrntaking over and my temporary obsession with American Idol 5 (SoulrnPatrol!), I haven't had much of any free time to write. However, thisrnstory has been on my mind and I am continuing to work on it...even ifrnsometimes it's only in my head. I'll certainly try to update more oftenrnthan say, every 5 months! (grin) Thanks to you all for sticking withrnthis story. It means a lot! - - - Sornmuch for a truce … Sam mentally fumed as he yanked the sleepingrnbag out from under the bench seat and stormed toward the hearthrug atrnthe foot of the stone fireplace. How dare she? How dare she actrnas if I were the one to wrong her ? She was the one whornlied to me! Samrnunrolled the bag and flicked it open so hard that thernsound— snap! —echoed around the walls of the small cabin. Asrnhe lay the bag down facing toward the hearth, Sam could swear he could feel Josie's eyes burning a hole through his back, butrnjust as he was about to turn as ask her what the hell herrnproblem was…the feeling subsided. Letting a long breath hissing outrnfrom between clenched teeth, he bent down, grabbed the metal poker onrnthe hearthside and began stoking the fire with a vengeance he had nornother outlet for. -rn- - Josierngrasped onto the edge of the rough-hewn table as if it were arnlifeline while she allowed her misery to silently drip off her cheeksrnand nose, plinking in tiny splashes against the wooden surface. Sherncould hear Sam's furious movements from behind her, could feel thernwaves of his anger and resentment rippling toward her, echoingrnthrough her. Josiernknew she'd been foolish to even hope that she and Sam could berncivil to each other under such forced circumstances. It was blatantlyrnobvious that at that moment, Sam Coulson wanted nothing more than tornbe rid of his unexpected houseguest. But, her mind insisted, if he didn't want you here, why then did herninvite you? Manners or not, there had been absolutely no obligation for Sam to house her during this storm. Indeed, the morernshe thought about his invitation, the more it puzzled her. Thernthought brought her back to her conversation with Anita. Was itrnpossible that she was right? Could Sam be deliberately playingrnwith her emotions to get back at her for what she'd done to him? Closingrnher eyes, her memory easily conjured up the look on Sam's face asrnhis eyes connected with hers through the window. His look was so…raw,rnso…unguarded that she found that theory hard to swallow. SamrnCoulson would have to be some kind of acting savant to pull that lookrnoff without meaning it. Especially considering how quickly he hidrnthose emotions once he realized she could see them. Indeed,rnevery time Josie thought she'd seen a hint of a kinder emotion onrnSam's face, he'd gone out of his way to hide it behind a mask ofrnanger or impatience, which led Josie to believe that those emotionsrnwere real. Yet,rnevery attempt Josie had made at getting to those fleeting emotionsrnhad been met with resistance and rejection: rejection that caused herrna little more pain each time. Already her heart was heavy and achingrnfrom the blows it had sustained in the past few hours…and it wasrnpossible she could be in Sam's company for several more days. Josiernshook her head sadly and wiped the wetness from her face with thernsleeve of her thick terrycloth robe. While she still felt that thernfight for Sam's heart was worth undertaking, she didn't know howrnmuch more pain she could endure before it became too much to bear. Shernstared at the full mug of tea in front of her for several moments,rnwatching the steam rise from it in swirling tendrils. Her appetiternfor her favorite tea now dissipated in the wake of Sam's anger, shernturned on her slippered heel and padded from the kitchen, leaving therncup on the table, untouched. -rn- - Meanwhile,rnSam had yanked the zipper of the sleeping bag down so quickly, itrnsounded like a swarm of angry bees. He threw himself between thernpadded covers, grabbed a pillow from the closest armchair and punchedrnit more ferociously than necessary to soften the material inside forrnhis head to rest upon. Shoving the battered square under his head, hernflopped roughly onto his side so that his broad back now faced thernkitchen doorway. He had no interest in seeing or hearing Josie forrnthe rest of the night…indeed, for the rest of his life! Still,rnhis senses instantly picked up on Josie's movement behind him, evenrnthough the slippers on her feet made her footsteps nearly silent.rnSam's entire body tensed and his heart pounded as the footstepsrnstopped for a long moment. He could feel her gaze burning a holernthrough his back, but he steadfastly refused to acknowledge herrnpresence. Finally, the feeling of being watched left him and he heardrnJosie's padded feet shuffle off into the bedroom. Hernlet out a long breath and rolled over onto his back, staring at therncrossbeams on the ceiling without really seeing them. Without Josiernpresent as a target, his anger gave way to pain, which gave way tornpainful memory. -rn- - Thernfirst month after Josie's revelation had been torture for Sam,rnbecause there were still four weeks of school left to teach. Justrnwalking the same halls and teaching in the same classrooms that hadrnonce had Josie in them was like one, long unending nightmare. Itrnseemed as if a memory of her was lurking around every corner. Thererndidn't seem to be anywhere in the school that didn't, in somernway, remind him of her. Itrnwas the worst, of course, in his senior Lit class; the one that Josiernhad once been a part of. It was hard staring at the empty seat in thernfront row and not think of her. But moreover, it appeared that Aldys,rnat least, had realized that he was the teacher that Josie had writtenrnabout, because whenever he made eye contact with her during class,rnthere was always a hint of reproach in her eyes. Forrna while, he'd thought he'd been imagining Aldys' reaction, butrnafter their last day of class, there could be no doubt. -rn- - Asrnthe bell rang to signal the end of the last class for his seniors, hernwished them all good luck as they began to whoop and file noisily outrnof the room. However, Aldys Wells took her time gathering up herrnthings. As the room fell silent, she finally swung her huge backpackrnonto her shoulder, but instead of heading toward the door, she made arnbeeline for his desk. He looked up at her expectantly. \" Yes,rnAldys? Can I help you with something? Was the reference I gave yournall right?\" Arnlook of momentary surprise flitted across Aldys' face before herrninscrutable look returned. \"Oh…yes, it was fine, thanks.\" Shernpaused momentarily and then plunged ahead, \"Actually…I havernsomething I wanted to give you.\" He'drncocked an eyebrow in surprise as he smiled. \"Really? That's nice,rnAldys…but I assure you it's not necessary…\" \" Actually,rnI think it is. You see, I think you've made a terrible mistake.\" Sam'srnheart began to pound, but his voice remained steady. After all, itrnwas quite possible this had nothing at all to do with Josie. \"Whatrndo you mean?\" Aldysrnleaned in closer, and her voice dropped to almost a whisper. \"Irnthink you know what I mean, Mr. Coulson.\" Hisrnsmile faded as her topic of discussion became crystal clear. \"Aldys…Irnknow she was a friend of yours, but I'm afraid there are somernthings you just don't know about her.\" \" Respectfullyrnsir, it's you who doesn't know what they need to knowrnabout Josie. Did you even read her article?\" Arnpanicky, cornered feeling pressed against Sam's chest, making itrnhard to breathe. Putting on his sternest teacher façade, hernbegan, \"I really don't think that's any of your…\" ButrnAldys' steely voice cut him off mid-sentence. \"So, you did then.\"rnShe shook her head sadly, almost as if she pitied him. After arnmoment, she continued, \"You know, Mr. Coulson…I always looked uprnto you. You made learning fun, really interesting. But more thanrnthat, you seemed to be someone who knew things, who understoodrnlife…and love. That knowledge seemed to infuse all that you taught.rnBut if you could willingly throw away the great love of your lifernwithout even giving it a chance…then it seems I misjudged you.\" Samrnstared at Aldys for a long moment, speechless. The phrase \"greatrnlove of your life\" kept replaying over and over inside his head.rnFinally, he sputtered, \"But…wait a minute…I didn't…\" Aldys didn't bother waiting for hisrnreply. She just waved a hand to stop his protest and said firmly,rn\"Goodbye, Mr. Coulson,\" before dropping a sealed envelope on hisrndesk, turning on her heel, and walking out without looking back. Onrnthe envelope was simply written \"Sam\"…in Josie's handwriting.rnDumbfounded, he sat for several moments holding it between bothrnhands, debating as to whether he should open it…but then his nextrnclass started filing in, and he quickly stowed the incriminatingrnletter in the bottom drawer of his desk. And that's where itrnstayed…unopened in the bottom of the drawer. -rn- - Thatrnmoment had undoubtedly been one of the worst, but things gotrnsignificantly better once school had let out for the summer. Insteadrnof being surrounded by memories of Josie, he was able to hang outrnwith friends and family and try to put her out of his mind. Soon,rnhe found himself enjoying poker nights and softball games with thernguys…and they all tried to set him up with their sisters, cousins,rnand female friends. Sam found this part tedious, but he knew hisrnfriends were only trying to help. After all, they didn't even knowrnabout Josie…they just thought he was pining after his breakup withrnLara. Herndid meet a few women…even enjoyed being around a couple of them.rnBut still, as nice as the women were, he was never inspired to callrnfor a date. Truthrnbe told, in the middle of the night, when he'd lie awake thinkingrnabout it, he realized that subconsciously he'd been comparing thernwomen to Josie (the Josie he'd fallen in love with, not the one herrnnow knew her to be)…and none of them had compared. Hisrnfamily had also been very supportive. It helped that they knew aboutrnJosie, because it gave him an outlet when he needed to talk. Usuallyrnhis outlet was his sister Abby, but occasionally he'd share a cuprnof tea with his mom and discuss it with her. Byrnthe first week of the new school year, Sam felt that he'd gotten arnhandle on his emotions and had begun to put Josie behind him. Thernsting he once felt walking through the halls of South Glen had fadedrnto an occasional dull ache, and even his classroom felt morerncomfortable now that the Senior class she'd been a part of hadrngraduated. Lifernhad pretty much gotten back to normal…except for his almost nightlyrndreams about Josie…and his irrational daily search of the Sun-Timesrnfor her articles and clipping out every one for his scrapbook. Andrnnow, a full seven months after his last encounter with Josie, Sam hadrnreally thought that, after his solitary Christmas, he'd truly bernable to put his feelings for Josie to rest and move on with his life. Nowrnthat seemed not only impossible, but the mere thought laughable. Afterrnonly a few hours of being in Josie's company, it was painfullyrnclear that Sam wasn't nearly as close to putting their past behindrnhim as he'd once thought. -rn- - AsrnJosie crossed the threshold of the kitchen into the living room, sherncouldn't help but look in Sam's direction. Sam was already deeplyrnburied in his sleeping bag, back to the room. Again, she feltrnbuffeted by waves of anger emanating from him; so strong theyrnactually made her shiver. In her mind, she pleaded for Sam to rollrnover, to acknowledge her in some way, to give her some opening to tryrnto make amends. But it was if he knew what she wanted and wasrndetermined not to give in. Wearily,rnJosie sighed, dropping her gaze to her twisting hands, and roundedrnthe corner into the bedroom. All she wanted was to flop onto the bedrnbury her face in the pillows and cry herself to sleep, but with Samrnjust in the other room and her not able to close the door to separaternthem, she couldn't. She refused to show him just how much hisrnrejection hurt her. Instead,rnshe grabbed her only solace—her journal—and pushed herself backrnagainst the headboard of the bed so that she couldn't see thernliving room. Shrugging her shoulders out of the robe, she balancedrnher book against her bent-up knees and began to write. Decemberrn23rd, 1999 (continued) Thisrnday insists on going from bad to worse. The storm howls around us inrnearnest; we lost power here several hours ago. AsrnI sit here alone in this huge bed, I still can feel his presence fromrnthe next room…Sam's, I mean. It's as if I have some sort ofrntuner that never loses his signal. Yet, tonight, even though he liesrnmere feet from where I am, he's never felt so far away, sornunattainable. Sornmany times this evening, Sam's mercurial moods flew from one end ofrnthe spectrum to the other at the speed of light. I should have justrngiven up trying to follow in his wake, but I guess I haven'trnlearned very much from my heartaches to date. I can never seem tornstop when it comes to Sam Coulson. Myrnsoul needs him like my lungs need air. A part of me has been missing,rnand has been ever since that warm May evening when Sam walked out ofrnmy life. Yet, for months I've been unaware of its absence, tried tornignore its existence. It took being near him again for me to realizernit. It'srnfragile, bent, bruised…unalterably ruined. But even having backrnthis broken, damaged part of me is better than not having it at all. Atrnleast twice tonight, I tried to get Sam to talk to me, really talk to me, to talk about what happened between us and try to makernpeace with it. But both times ended badly. It's as if Sam is afraidrnto open up to me even the tiniest amount, afraid to place any trustrnin me at all. I know that is my fault that he doesn't dare trust:rnseven months ago he gave me his trust, and I hurt him with it. But ifrnI could only get him to listen …then perhaps he might justrnunderstand the impossible situation I'd been in. Maybe he'd knowrnthat I wasn't trying to hurt him, to use him…but instead wasrntrying to protect him from what Gus wanted me to do. Oh,rnI don't know why I keep wishing for things that can never comerntrue! Sam will never open up to me again, let alone love me…I thinkrnhis behavior tonight has been proof of that. Any time he showed anyrnvulnerability at all, he was quick to pull back behind a shell ofrnanger. Instead of wishing he would return myrnlove, I should be wishing for a little sanity…and the ability tornhold what's left of myself together until we can be free of eachrnother once more. Thernonly problem is: when he goes, he'll take that piece of me with himrnagain…and I'll never get it back. Once he's gone…I'll neverrnbe whole again. -rn- - Brushingrnaside a tear that trickled down her cheek, Josie set her journal andrnpen on the bedside table and leaned over to blow on the wick of thernhurricane lamp, plunging herself into darkness. Sliding down the bedrnto rest her head on the pillows, she tucked the covers under her chinrnand stared at the black. Oncernher eyes adjusted to the lack of light, she could see the faintrnflicker of light dancing across the wood of the open bedroom door,rnreflecting the fireplace on its smooth surface. Straining her ears,rnshe could just about make out the soft crackling of the burning logsrnin the next room. And every once in a while, she'd hear Sam'srnsleeping bag rustle as he turned or rolled over. He'srnprobably already dead to the world, Josie thought wryly, yet,rneven though I should be exhausted, I can't sleep. Afterrnseveral more restless minutes, Josie huffed a sigh of impatience andrnsat up once more. Throwing aside the covers, she stood, removing thernremainder of her bathrobe, laying it along the bottom of the bed outrnof the way. Then she grabbed one of the pillows and plumped it,rnlaying it long ways next to her before climbing under the blanketsrnonce more. Asrnshe lie there, trying desperately to relax enough to sleep, herrnsubconscious continued to nag her, Come on…you know you want to… while Josie steadfastly refused to give in. No, I won't…Irndon't need it. I won't do it, she thought back, fullyrnrealizing the foolishness of arguing with oneself. Manyrnmore silent, tense minutes passed, and Josie finally relented.rnPushing aside the covers again, she felt along the floor for thernclothes she'd discarded earlier. Closing her hand upon soft,rnbrushed cotton, she brought the sweater to her lap before holding itrnto her face and inhaling deeply as Sam's scent swirled around her.rnBlinking back tears and scolding herself for her own foolishness, shernlaid the sweater over the lengthwise pillow, laid her head upon it,rnand closed her eyes, hoping sleep would claim her at last.[Chapter 13] Snowbound Chapter 13 - Longrnafter the crackling flames dwindled to glowing embers, Sam laid withrnhis hands beneath his head staring into the hearth. He'd resignedlyrngiven up on sleeping hours ago. Nornmatter how many times he'd tried to drift off, the tension he feltrnwould not subside. Perhaps it was because he'd see Josie on therninside of his eyelids every time he closed them, or perhaps it wasrnthe knowledge that the real Josie lay just feet from him in thernbedroom…he wasn't sure which. All he knew was that tonightrnslumber would not be a refuge from the reality of the moment: that hernwas trapped in a three room cabin during the middle of a hugernblizzard with the one person he'd hoped he'd never see again. Abovernthe howling of the wind and the tapping of icy flakes against thernwindows, Sam caught himself several times holding his breath, just tornsee if he could hear Josie breathing. Shakingrnhis head in self-disgust, he shoved himself up on his elbows. Withoutrnthe warmth of his sleeping bag to protect it, his skin registered therncool drafts wafting about the living room. So, with a sigh and arnshiver, Sam extracted himself from his cocoon and grabbed a few logsrnto toss onto the embers before they were too cool to catch the newrnwood on fire. Arnglance at his watch told him it was almost quarter to four. With arnweary sigh, Sam cast an eye toward the bedroom doorway, imagining thernsoft pillows and a comfortable mattress piled with warm down blanketsrnthat he had planned to be sleeping under tonight. Instead, Josie hadrngotten that privilege while he spent the night on the cold, draftyrnfloor. Mutteringrnan expletive under his breath, he nodded grimly as the logs he'drnadded to the hearth caught fire at last. The sudden increase in heatrnblasted him, prompting Sam to push himself back a few more feet tornsit on top of his sleeping bag. Samrntried hard to remain reasonable. After all, Josie was injured. Itrnonly made sense that she took the bed and he the floor. Still, lackrnof sleep fueled his resentment. Rolling his eyes, he muttered tornhimself, \"Sam, you're a chump.\" He stood, meaning to straightenrnout his sleeping bag before getting back in it, but once he had hisrnlegs under him, he realized that the call of nature was beckoning…andrnit needed to be taken care of soon. Lettingrnout an audible sigh, he walked over to the table between the chairsrnand picked up the box of matches, using one to relight the kerosenernlamp he'd blown out several hours ago. Lowering the lantern wick sornthat there was just enough light to see by, he padded barefoot fromrnthe living room to the bedroom, needing to cross through to get tornthe bathroom. Samrnkept the lantern in his left hand, as far away from where Josie layrnas possible so as to not wake her with its light. There was also thatrnpesky irrational temptation to watch Josie sleep to deal with, butrnSam refused to give in to that urge. After all, it wasn't as if hisrnimagination didn't cause enough trouble without giving it morernammunition… Steppingrninto the bathroom, he half closed the door (to shield him fromrnJosie's view should she actually wake), set the lantern down on toprnof the toilet tank, lifted up the seat, and relieved himself. Once hernwas finished and fully clothed once more, he flushed the toilet,rnbreathing a sigh of relief when it worked properly; this meant that,rnfor now at least, the generator was still working, providing justrnenough heat to the pipes to keep them from freezing. AsrnSam rinsed his hands in the sink under ice-cold water, he couldn'trnkeep his teeth from chattering. Turning the taps off, he turned tornpull the towel he'd used that morning off the rack to dry hisrnhands…and immediately came face to face with two matching pair ofrnbra and underwear, drip drying over the shower rod. Sam felt hisrnmouth drop open before shutting it abruptly. Inrnthe dim light, it was hard to tell what color they were, but theyrnwere pale, pretty, and tasteful…. and really not what Irnneed to be looking at right now, he reminded himself as hernspeed-dried his hands, stuffed the towel back onto the rod hastilyrnand turned his back on the sight. Pickingrnup the lamp, he closed his eyes briefly to block out the image, butrninstead, his mind simply imagined Josie in the said articles,rnwhich certainly wasn't helping matters. Damn, damn, damn, Sam thought, now I have another picture I'll never getrnout of my head! Samrntook a moment and composed himself. Just on the off chance that Josiernwoke, he didn't want to give away how flustered he was. Once hernfelt he was back on an even keel, he pulled the door opened andrnstepped back into the bedroom. Arnfloorboard creaked beneath Sam's bare toes, the sound unnaturallyrnloud in a momentary lull in the howling wind. He scrunched his eyesrnshut and held his breath, as if this would somehow keep the soundrnfrom being heard. Nextrnto him, he heard Josie shift her weight on the mattress, but when hernheard nothing more, he heaved a silent sigh of relief. He opened hisrneyes and started to shift his weight to his forward foot when hernheard it—a soft, sweet rush of air that whispered past Josie'srnlips. Againstrnhis will, his eyes were drawn to the direction of the sound, and thernsight that met Sam's eyes took his breath away. In the flickeringrnlamplight, her skin glowed and her hair reflected glints of gold…shernlooked angelic and peaceful in her slumber. Without being aware herndid so, Sam turned toward the bed and raised the lantern higher,rnstudying the way the blanket covering her to her neck rose and fellrnin time with her breathing, memorizing how impossibly long herrneyelashes were against her cheeks, freezing this moment in time inrnhis mind. Again,rnJosie sighed blissfully and snuggled deeper into a pillow she'drncuddled up to. Sam felt a warm rush shiver through him as he imaginedrnhimself in the pillow's place: Josie's body curved up andrnpressed against his side, her head gently resting over his heart, arnhand curled trustingly into the material of his… Breakingrnfrom his reverie with a start, Sam peered closer at Josie's pillowrnin confusion. The covering of it was unlike any he remembered seeingrnat the cabin. Pushing the lantern closer to Josie, he studied thernmaterial closely in the soft, golden circle cast down by thernflickering flame. SuddenlyrnSam's heart turned over in his chest and then thumped wildlyrnagainst his ribcage. He sucked in a sudden gulp of breath, trying tornstave off the sudden wave of lightheadedness he felt as he recognizedrnthe foreign material to be his sweater. The sweater he'd givenrnJosie to wear was now laid carefully over the pillow she was snuggledrnup to. Therernwas something so sweet…so endearing about it, about the idea of hisrnsweater serving as his substitute. It made him want to pull her intornhis arms and hold her protectively…but it also made him want torncrawl into the bed, seduce her, make passionate love to her, and makernher fall desperately in love with him. Samrnhad to take a deep breath to steady himself. Closing his eyes, hernthought, You really are going insane, Sam. You don't want Josiernto fall in love with you…you want her to go away ! You wantrnher out of your life…remember? Evenrnto himself, he didn't sound very convincing. Frustrated and angeredrnat his own weakness, Sam forced himself to turn away from thernenticing sight of Josie in the bed and rush from the room. Inrnhis haste, Sam stubbed his big toe against the raised threshold ofrnthe doorway and he hopped about just outside the bedroom door,rnhissing in painful breaths and thinking long strings of expletives.rnHe hobbled around the sofa to collapse upon his sleeping bag, rubbingrnhis sore toe and cursing the day he'd ever met Josie Geller. - Samrnrose slowly from the depths of sleep. In his groggy state, he feltrnwarm and cozy. Rested, refreshed, and more satisfied than he'd feltrnin a long time, he pushed both arms upward to stretch. It was thenrnthat he noticed that he was not alone. Cockingrnone eye open, he slid his gaze down his bare chest and smiled lazilyrnwhen he saw Josie curled against him in slumber. Carefully, so as notrnto wake her, he slid his hand across her bare back to her goldenrnhair, threading his fingers through the fine mane as if to tame itsrndishevelment. Inrnresponse, Josie sighed and snuggled even closer, her hand sliding uprnto rest over his heart. Sam's heart flip-flopped and he grinnedrnwidely; Josie often did that in her sleep and he thought it wasrnadorable. Slidingrnhis hand from her hair, he drew abstract circles on Josie's back asrnhe whispered a kiss against her forehead. He knew he would never growrntired of waking up like this, with her next to him. Arndeep inhale signaled Josie's waking. Squeezing her gently, Samrnleaned down and murmured, \"Morning, beautiful.\" Stretchingrnher body against his like a lithe little cat, she half-breathed,rnhalf-groaned, \"Mornin'…\" Her eyes blinked open and she gracedrnSam with a brilliant smile. Immediately,rnSam felt his body stir in response, but he was content to ignore itrnfor the moment. He gently tucked the hair on the right side of herrnface behind her ear and asked, \"Did you sleep well?\" Josiernslid her arm up, leaning her elbow against Sam's chest and restingrnher chin in her palm. \"Yes...\" she answered softly. Mischiefrntwinkled in her eyes as she continued, \"… eventually …\" Arnchuckle rumbled through Sam's chest, shaking them both. \"Well, Irncan't help it,\" he said, grasping Josie by both elbows and gentlyrntugging her over to rest on top of him. \"You're irresistible.\" Immediately,rnJosie's cheeks flushed pink and she cast her eyes down to his chestrndemurely, embarrassed but pleased. She looked up and countered, \"Butrnyou're biased…\" Samrnrolled over so that now Josie was pinned beneath him and he grinnedrncheekily. \"Darn right I am. Got a problem with that?\" \"No…\"rnThe word trailed off into a sigh as Sam buried his face in Josie'srnneck to smother it in kisses. \"Oh, Sam…\" she breathed, herrnhands sliding along his shoulders as she unknowingly pressed her barernchest against his in response to what he was doing to her. Again,rnSam felt the desire in him rise, but again, he held it in check. Theyrnhad all the time in the world for that. Resting his head in his hand,rnhe trailed the fingers of his other hand down Josie's cheek.rn\"So…what do you want to do today?\" he asked her tenderly. \"Besides this you mean?\" Josie pressed her hips upward against Sam'srnsaucily. Samrnshook his head and smiled in amusement at Josie's brazen behavior.rn\"Yes, Miss Temptress…besides that.\" Josie'srnshell-pink lips puckered into a pout. \"That's Mrs. Temptress tornyou.\" Samrngrasped her left hand in his right and brought it to his lips,rnwhispering a kiss against her left ring finger and the two rings thatrnwere nestled there. \"So it is,\" he responded gently. They staredrninto each other's eyes for a long moment before Sam prompted, \"Butrnyou still didn't tell me what you want to do…\" \"Rightrnnow?\" Samrnnodded bemusedly. \"Well…\"rnThe mischievous glint was back. \"I'm simply ravenous …\"rnJosie said as she stretched her arms over her head in such a way torncall obvious attention to her bare chest. Samrnknew Josie was just teasing him, but his eyes were still drawn rightrnto where she wanted them to go. He simply couldn't help it. He feltrnhis resolve to hold off until later start to slip. \"Uh, huh…\"rnhe breathed, his mouth going dry. Josierndeftly slid her legs out from beneath Sam's to the edge of the bed.rnGrinning impishly, she sat up and said, \"For breakfast, that is…\"rnShe flung off the covers and pushed herself upward, intent on boltingrnfor the bathroom, but she didn't even make it one step before Samrnhad clasped his arms around her waist and rolled her over him ontornher back on the bed next to him. Josierngiggled delightedly at having been caught. \"You'rernabsolutely incorrigible,\" Sam accused with a smile. \"Yep,\"rnJosie said proudly, leaning forward to peck a kiss to Sam's nose.rnThen, she trailed her hands languidly down his chest to his waist. Sucking in a breath in response to her touch, Sam mock-lamented, \"Irnthink I've created a monster…\" Josie'srnhands traveled lower, with only the bunched up sheets between herrnfingers and his sensitive skin. \"Yes, I think you have.\" Findingrnher target, she squeezed lightly, making him gasp. \"Got a problemrnwith that?\" she asked, mimicking Sam's response to her fromrnearlier. Rollingrnback on top of her, Sam pulled Josie's hands away from him to pinrnthem at either side of her head. \"Not. At. All.\" He respondedrnsuccinctly, punctuating each word with a kiss on each of her eyes andrnthen the tip of her nose. \"However, we're going to miss breakfastrnif we don't go downstairs soon…\" Josie's stomach took thatrnopportune time to rumble loudly, setting them both to giggling. Josiernslid her arms out from Sam's grasp and linked them around his neck.rn\"I know; you're right.\" Suddenly, a shadow crossed her featuresrnand the smile slid away. Instantly,rnSam's brows drew together with worry. \"What? What is it?\" Josie'srneyes slid away from his, as if her thoughts ashamed her. \"I wasrnjust thinking…\" \"Uhrnhuh…about what?\" Sam softly pushed a stray hair from Josie'srncheek and waited. \"About…whatrnwould have happened if you hadn't shown up that day…\" Josiernblinked her eyes rapidly as if trying to hold back tears. Instantly,rnSam knew what she meant. \"Aw, Josie…\" He slipped both his armsrnaround Josie's back and held her to him gently. \"Shhh…\" hernsoothed as he heard a suspicious sniff in his ear. \"Don't worryrnabout that now…It didn't happen now, did it?\" Sam leaned backrnand lightly chucked Josie under her chin. \"Right?\" Josiernnodded and sniffled. \"I know, I know…But it could have,rnSam…\" Samrnsat up and pulled Josie into his lap, holding her. \"But it didn't,\"rnhe repeated soothingly. \"I'm right here.\" Josiernturned and wrapped her arms around his shoulders as if holding on forrndear life. \"I can't even imagine what life would have been likernwithout you.\" Sam'srnheart clenched in his chest and he felt as if he couldn't breathe.rn\"I know…\" he choked out past a lump in his throat. Inrna strange sense of deja-vu, it was if Sam was looking at himself inrnthe mirror, except it was a different him…the Sam that had chosen differently. Suddenly, he could imagine what it wouldrnhave been like without Josie…and it was a miserable, lonelyrnexistence. Hernsqueezed Josie closer to him, trying to gain strength from the warmthrnof her body…but it was if she wasn't even there. Nothing couldrntouch him. Instead, Sam was cold, inside and out…and still, all herncould see was himself, the self without Josie. The image grew largerrnand larger, as if he were falling into it. Sam reached outward,rnbackward, trying to latch onto Josie, to have her pull him back fromrnthis nightmare…but there was only air where she should have been. Desperately,rnSam clenched his left fist, and for a moment, he felt the weight ofrnthe gold band Josie had given him just yesterday pressed against hisrnpalm. But it seemed to melt before his eyes, smoke rising up and awayrnfrom him, carrying it into the ether. \"No!\"rnhe gasped. And still he was falling…falling away from Josie…awayrnfrom the life he knew and loved… - Samrnjerked awake, gasping and shaking, Josie's name on his lips in arntormented whisper. He was drenched in sweat, even in the chilledrnnight air. Placing a trembling hand over his pounding heart, Samrnflopped limply back against the sleeping bag. He'drnhad many, many dreams about Josie in the last seven months, but nonernhad ever felt as real as this one. In these first moments afterrnwaking, it was as if he could still see through the looking glass tornthe other side…at what his life could have been had he chosen tornforgive…to believe. The hollow where their love had been ached andrngnawed at his insides. Inrnhis weaker moments over the past months, he'd caught himselfrnwondering what might have been, but had never quite been able tornimagine it. Now…he no longer had to wonder. Of course, that's ifrnJosie had actually told the truth in her article…and that was arnvery big if. Hisrnmind slipped back to that day when Aldys had given him Josie'srnletter. A pang of regret washed over him as he thought of that sadrnlittle envelope still sitting in his desk drawer at South Glen South.rnRight now, he wished to God he'd read it. Maybe it wouldn't havernchanged his mind about Josie…but maybe it would have. Allrnhe could think was that, if he'd been wrong about Josie…then he'drnabandoned his true love, not once…but twice ; and the thoughtrnwas almost more than he could bear. Sam,rnyou're being ridiculous …he tried to reason against the tidernof emotion. You're wishing for something that could never havernbeen. That dream was about the Josie you loved, not the real Josie. You've got to stop torturing yourself and move on! Logically,rnhe knew he was right. He was torturing himself, and for what? For arnwoman who'd made him fall in love with her just so she could ruinrnhis life…for the sake of her precious career. \"Okay,rnthat's enough…\" Sam said aloud to himself. He shimmied out ofrnthe sleeping bag without unzipping it and hastily rolled and tied it,rnsetting it out of the way in the corner. He piled a couple of logsrnonto the dying fire and sat down to tug on his snow boots. While hernwas relieved that the generator was still working, he knew that thernfuel must begetting low. It would need to shovel a path to it just tornrefill it…and there was no better time to get started than thernpresent. Samrnshrugged on his coat, tucked his hat on his head and stuffed hisrnhands into his gloves before stepping into the blustery dawn. Herngrunted as he dug into the deep snow and shoved it aside. He hopedrnthe physical labor would get his mind off his problems. Yet, even asrnhe worked, still the dream would not let loose of his soul. It stuckrnin the recesses of his mind, refusing to go away. Leaningrnheavily on the handle of the shovel, he wiped snow away from his eyesrnas he squinted back toward the cabin. Like it or not, he could notrnforget how it had felt to hold Josie in his arms and know in hisrnheart and soul that she loved him as much as he loved her. And evenrnthough he still thought he was crazy for even thinking it, Samrncouldn't help but seriously wonder for the first time since he'drnwalked out of her life: What if? What if I was wrong?[Chapter 14] Snowbound,nPart 14 Samnstepped inside the cabin, closing the door against the swirl of snownthat threatened to follow. Still troubled, he sighed as he peeled offnhis wet hat and gloves and shrugged off his coat. That dream of hisnhad shaken him up but good and he just couldn't seem to push it outnof his mind. As naïve and stupid as it seemed, a small part ofnhim still desperately wanted to believe that Josie had never meant tonhurt him, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Sam fearednthat her prolonged proximity was undermining his common sense. Henfelt dangerously off kilter and out of control; like Alice walkingnthrough the Looking Glass. Suddenly, everything looked and felt justna little bit different, even though he could not put his finger onnwhat had changed. Shaking his head as if to clear the image, Samnheaded to the kitchen to rustle up some breakfast. - In thendark, Josie awoke to the smell of frying bacon. She closed her eyesnand took a deep sniff, just able to hear the popping and crackling ofnthe cooking meat over the howl of the still whipping wind. Shencracked one eye open and found that the day appeared as snowy asnever, which meant at least one more day in Sam's company. Afterntheir confrontation last night, Josie wasn't sure if she couldnhandle it. Sam's presence was definitely getting to her; her heartnached just at the thought of him. Josienwondered for a moment whether Sam was making a breakfast for one orntwo. Well, there's only one good way to find out… Sighingnloudly, Josie pushed aside the covers and sat up. In such a smallncabin, she couldn't possibly avoid Sam forever. Might as wellnget it over with , she thought grimly, reaching for her bathrobe. - Sam'snmind was elsewhere as he turned bacon strips and flipped pancakes. Nonmatter how hard he tried, he could not seem to keep his mind fromnstraying back to the contents of his dream…and from the pain he'dnseen in Josie's eyes last night during their argument. An achensettled in behind his ribs to the point where he began to stretch hisnback, thinking he'd pulled a muscle from shoveling. But, to hisndismay, he realized the pain was not muscular. Instead, it smacked ofna guilty conscience. Regardlessnof what had happened between he and Josie in the past, Sam knew hisnmother would be mortified if she could have seen how he'd beenntreating Josie. He'd been brought up to treat women with respect,nand—up until now—had never failed to do so. But in the past 24nhours, he had let his emotions get the better of him, and had takennout his frustrations on Josie. Sam feltnout of place within his own skin. Never before had he needed tonremind himself to be polite…even with Lara, who had certainlynearned more shoddy treatment than she received over the years. Nevernbefore had he lashed out the way he had with Josie yesterday. Allnthat he thought he knew about himself seemed to be different withnJosie around. Again, itnmade Sam feel a bit like Alice in Wonderland, which brought LewisnCarroll's words to mind. Mostly to himself, he recited: Twas brillig, and the slithyntoves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe… But beforenSam could continue, a soft voice behind him cut in and completed thenfamous stanza: …All mimsy were thenborogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. Sam turnednto find Josie in the doorway, her eyes downcast, her hands twistingntogether nervously. With a mental vow that he would endeavor to benpolite and respectful today no matter what, he greeted her with ancordial, \"Good morning.\" \"Morning…\"nJosie mumbled in return. Stepping across the threshold, she askednSam, \"Would you like some help? Or perhaps…this was a privatenbreakfast?\" Samnfrowned and his eyebrows drew together in confusion. \"What? Of course you're invited, Josie… In fact, I'm just aboutndone if you'd like to sit down…\" \"Are…arenyou sure?\" Josie hesitated, not wanting to intrude. \"I wouldn'tnwant to…\" \"It'snfine, Josie…\" Sam interrupted. \"Really.\" Solemnly,nJosie nodded, still not meeting Sam's eyes. She slid out the chairnclosest to her noiselessly and sat down, meekly keeping her eyes onnthe table. Sam slidnthe last of the bacon onto a paper towel-lined plate and poured thenremainder of the liquid fat into an old metal coffee can on thenstove's upper shelf. As he placed the breakfast pans into the sink,nSam stared out the window and let out a long sigh as the swirlingnsnow completely blocked his view. Okay, Sam…you can do this ,nhe coached himself. No more outbursts…just calm, cool,ncollected. Squaringnhis shoulders, he grabbed the plates and utensils and brought them tonthe table, placing one set in front of his spot and one in front ofnJosie. Then he turned and grabbed a couple of potholders so he couldnsafely transport the hot plates holding the bacon and pancakes to thentable. \"Here we go…\" Sam said, setting them down in the middlenof the table so they could both reach. Sam slidnout his chair, prepared to sit, when he realized the table was stillnmissing one thing. \"Oops, hold on a second…\" he said, evennthough it was more to himself than to Josie. He disappeared into thenpantry for a moment before returning carrying a glass bottle. Setting itndown next to the pancakes, Sam settled into his chair, sliding itnforward into place. Peeking at Josie through his lashes, he noticednher eyes were still studying the wood grain of the table. Again, henfelt that pang beating against his ribcage. Trying tonsound pleasantly neutral, Sam offered, \"Feel free to help yourself.nThere's plenty, trust me…\" Josie gavenSam a brief look of acknowledgement and quickly lowered her eyesnagain. She was determined not to give Sam any reason to snap at herntoday. Her already battered heart couldn't take it. Sam begannfilling his plate with breakfast items, yet Josie made no move tonfill hers. Shrugging one shoulder, Sam buttered his pancakes andnpoured on the syrup. Assuming Josie's reluctance to share in thenfood was because she had quite a bit to say to him about his outburstnlast evening, he tucked into the food, waiting for the other shoe tondrop. But itndidn't come. Longer and longer the silence in the room stretchednon, smothering Sam until he couldn't take it anymore. Softly, hensaid, \"Josie…\" \"Yes?\"nshe mumbled, not meeting his eyes. In fact, she was sitting so stillnthat Sam could scarcely believe her lips had even moved. Sam leanednforward, leaning against his elbows. \"Josie…\" he repeated, morenurgently now, \"Josie, please look at me.\" He watchednJosie as her chest heaved and she let out a long sigh. Her shouldersnslumped forward as if in defeat, and then she slowly raised her eyesnto his. \"Is…\"nSam paused, swallowing past the nervous lump in his throat as hentried not to tense up, \"Is there something you wanted to say tonme?\" Josie'sneyes crinkled in confusion. What did he want from her? What did henwant her to say? Was he looking for some sort of apology? Asndesperate as she was to maintain peace between them, she was notngoing to apologize for something she didn't do…and she couldn'tnthink of anything she'd done wrong. He was the one who had snappednat her, after all. \"N..no,\" she stammered finally. Sam letnthat sink in for a moment. Apparently Josie had no intention ofncalling him out on the carpet for his rudeness, even though, if henwere honest with himself, he deserved it. After anmoment's pause, Sam began tentatively, \"Well, I have something tonsay to you.\" Henhesitated and felt his conscience sting as he watched Josie almostnphysically flinch. \"I'm sorry.\" Josie wasnso stunned; she thought she must not have heard Sam correctly.n\"W…What?\" A hint ofna smile played at the corners of Sam's mouth due to Josie'snobvious confusion, but he bit it back, wanting to remain serious fornthe moment. \"I'm sorry for the way I've been treating you.\" Samnlowered his eyes, afraid to read reproach in Josie's face…andnalso to gather his thoughts. \"I…\" Sam trailed off, not sure hownto start. After a moment, he tried again. \"Regardless of whatnhappened between us in the past, I haven't been treating younfairly.\" \"I…It'snbeen hard…seeing you again,\" Sam admitted softly, staring off atnnothing, immersed in his own thoughts. \"More difficult than Inanticipated, I think. But that doesn't excuse how boorish I'venbeen to you. I've been treating you like an interloper, when innreality I invited you here.\" Tearsnstung at Josie's eyes. She couldn't believe it; Sam was actuallynapologizing. When Sam finally raised his eyes to hers, she could tellnthat he truly meant it, too. Sam sawnthe unshed tears glittering on Josie's lashes and took that as anpositive sign. With a soft smile, he continued, \"I assure you thatnmy mother raised me with more manners than I've been displaying innthe last 24 hours. I shall endeavor to prove that for the remaindernof your stay. I promise.\" It took anmoment before Josie could find her voice. \"Thank you,\" shenwhispered hoarsely. Sam noddednself-consciously. He felt a bit awkward having admitted to somethingnso close to the vest, but accepted it as punishment for his behavior.nChanging the subject, he asked, \"So, how is your head thisnmorning?\" Josienturned her neck this way and that, tentatively checking for aches andnpains. \"Seems all right,\" she admitted, shyly reaching toward thenplate of pancakes at last to fill her plate. \"And thenmuscle stiffness? Is that better, too?\" Sam pressed, stabbing at anbite-sized stack of pancakes on his plate. Josie feltnher cheeks flame with embarrassment at the thought of having been sonexposed in close proximity to Sam. \"Uh…fine.\" Although it wasntrue, Josie gladly would have lied through her teeth about it just tonprevent another experience like that. Sam chewednand swallowed before replying. \"Good.\" He paused for a momentnbefore continuing, \"So, I was listening to the weather lastnnight…and it sounds as if it could be a while yet before the stormnbreaks.\" Josienlooked up from pouring syrup on her pancakes and had to forcibly holdnback a sigh. Figures , she thought. That's just my luck… \"Really?\" \"Yeah. Inwas already out this morning shoveling a path to the generator andnrefilled that, so at least the pipes won't freeze anytime soon, butnwe might need to bring in more firewood before it's all over.\" \"Anynidea how much snow we've gotten so far?\" Josie asked. Sam'snfork stopped halfway to his mouth. \"Hard to tell with the windnblowing as hard as it is. The drifts are everywhere. But if I were tonhazard a guess, I'd say around 14 to 16 inches so far.\" He bitnoff the end of a strip of bacon attached to his fork. \"God,nit'll take us a week to get out of here…\" Josie moaned innfrustration. Sam shooknhis head as he swallowed and then said reassuringly, \"No it won't.nThe Blazer's got 4-wheel drive. Besides, Will knows we're here…\" Josie'sneyebrows scrunched up in confusion. \"Will? Who's Will?\" \"Oh,nsorry. Will Parker…the sheriff you met at the accident?\" Josiennodded her understanding. \"He'sna friend of mine… and he's got a plow. Once the storm isnover, he'll probably be by. After all, I'd think he'd want toncheck in on you to see how you're doing…\" \"Oh,\"nJosie said meekly, dropping her eyes back to her plate. Even thoughnSam seemed optimistic, she couldn't help but see the time theynspent together as a problem. While Sam had apologized for hisnbehavior from the day before—and had truly seemed to mean it—itnmade her wonder; wonder just how long Sam's \"good manners\"ncould last before the frustration of cabin fever set in again. Theynfinished the rest of their meal in silence that was both comfortablenand stifling to Josie. There didn't seem to be any hostility in thenair, but being left alone with her own thoughts only made Josie feelnsad. After all, while Sam had expressed regret for his rude treatmentnof her, he'd made no attempts to revisit what they'd been arguingnabout; namely, discussing the past and letting her explain hernactions. And as the moments ticked by, she felt as if somethingnprecious were slipping through her fingers. - - As Samndrained the last dregs of coffee from his metal cup, he stood,ngathering both his and Josie's dishes and carrying them off to thensink. Grabbing the dishtowel laying across the drip-dry rack, henwrapped it around the front of a pot of near-boiling water he'dnleft heating on the stove and picked it up by the handles. Over hisnshoulder, he said, \"I'm just gonna do up these dishes…\" Josie'snchair legs scuffed against the linoleum floor as she stood up. Shenwalked over to stand next to Sam, where he was filling the sink basinnwith the hot water. \"Please let me help.\" Sam'sneyes flicked toward Josie, taking in the thick pink terrycloth robenwith the over-long sleeves before replying, \"It's all right,nJosie; I've got it. Why don't you go rest in the living room forna bit?\" Josie putnboth hands on her hips and huffed her impatience at him. \"Look,nit's not all right,\" she said plainly. \"Not with me. Younhaven't let me do one thing since I got here. I'm not an invalid,nyou know. I know how to do dishes…\" Sam tooknone look at Josie's stubborn expression and had to bite the insidenof his cheek to keep from smiling. She just looked so darn… adorable glaring up at him like that! He put the hot pot aside and put up hisnhands in a signal of surrender. \"All right, if you really want tonhelp…\" \"Yeah, Indo…\" she cut in, still looking petulant. \"Fine,\"nSam said, turning his eyes away from her and slinging the towel overnhis shoulder. \"You wash and I'll dry.\" Mentally,nSam could have kicked himself for saying it. He already didn't likenthe way his heart was pounding because of his proximity to her. Andnhis reaction certainly didn't improve when she untied the sash tonher robe and let it slide off her arms, catching the terrycloth innher hands and tossing it onto the nearest chair back. Pushingnthe sleeves of her flannel pajama top up over her elbows, Josie sanknher hands in the almost scalding, sudsy water. The warmth surroundingnher hands made the rest of her shiver from the temperaturendifference. Then she grabbed the sponge and started to rinse off anplate. Standingnbeside and slightly behind Josie, Sam couldn't keep his eyes offnher. That strange feeling of being off-kilter had returned. Thenmoment felt so mundanely domestic; something that couples wouldnnormally do together without giving it another thought, but yet itnfelt so… right that it scared him. Hencouldn't help but notice that, even though Josie was covered headnto foot in flannel, the soft material still clung to her andnflattered her figure in all the right places, making him think ofnthings he shouldn't. Sam thought back to his dream and wonderednidly if the real Josie could ever be as mischievous as the dream onenwas… A poke innthe ribs from Josie's elbow pulled Sam from his reverie.n\"Hey…you're getting a little behind, there…\" Josie saidnwith a hint of teasing in her voice. Sam looked at the drip strainernand found a stack of clean, wet dishes waiting for him. \"Sorry…\"nSam mumbled, fumbling with the wet cast iron pan on top beforenyanking the towel from his shoulder to dry it. Dang it, but shenshouldn't be affecting him like this! \"Nonproblem,\" Josie replied before returning to her washing, hummingnsoftly to herself as she worked. Sam letnout a sigh of relief as he realized that Josie hadn't realizednanything was amiss with his behavior, but his preoccupation disturbednhim. As he'd feared, without his shell of anger to protect him, Samnfound himself in a very precarious situation emotionally. Settingnthe pan aside, Sam reached for the next item just as Josie wasnsetting a clean coffee cup in the strainer and their fingers brushed.nHeat blistered up his arm and settled in the pit of his stomach as henaccepted the cup and Josie's hand went back to the sink. Twistingnthe terrycloth material inside the metal mug, Sam closed his eyes,ntrying to force his mind to behave. Yet, itnwas hard to tune out the way that Josie's breath had caught whenntheir hands had touched, hard to forget the way her eyes closed fromnthe momentary shock and reaction. Whether she wanted to admit it ornnot, Sam knew he wasn't the only one being affected by theirnnearness…and that thought scared the hell out of him. The nextnten minutes was pure torture for Sam. Whether it was due to somensubconscious desire, or perhaps some previously undiscoverednmasochistic tendency he had, his and Josie's hands had brushed morentimes than he could count. And every single time it happened, henexperienced a jolt of awareness that was as if he'd been struck bynlightning. By the time the last dish was dry, Sam's heart wasnpounding so hard, he felt lightheaded. He pullednout his chair at the table and flopped into it wearily, the internalnstruggle of fighting off his feelings for Josie having temporarilynsapped his strength. Josienturned and looked at Sam as her brow furrowed thoughtfully. She driednher hands on the towel Sam had left in the drip tray and placed anhand on his shoulder. \"Sam…are you all right? You look kindnof…peaked.\" Sam closednhis eyes for a long moment, trying to block out the sensation ofnJosie's soft, warm hand on his shoulder. Then he said, not lookingnat her, \"I'm fine…I just didn't sleep that well last night, Inguess.\" \"Well,nthat won't do…\" Josie said, leaning down to grasp Sam's uppernarm and tugging him to a stand. Then, still holding on to his arm,nshe started dragging him out of the room. Flusterednboth by her touch and her actions, Sam stuttered, \"Josie…what…whatnare you doing?\" \"Comenon,\" Josie insisted, pulling him out of the kitchen and around thencorner into the bedroom. Sam didn'tnknow what to make of this newer, more assertive Josie; he had seen sonlittle of this side of her last spring. But he certainly didn'tnlike where his mind (all right, his hormones) thought this wasnleading to… Once she'dnsucceeded in yanking Sam into the bedroom, Josie let go of his armnand turned toward the bed, trying to hide an enormous blush thatnsuddenly covered both cheeks. Being alone in a bedroom with SamnCoulson was doing funny things to her insides and her legs suddenlynfelt like rubber. Stay on task , Josie cautioned herself. Don'tnthink about how you can still feel the warmth emanating from him, or … Josienbroke off her own train of thought as she stared at the bed innhorror. Sam's sweater was still boldly draped across the pillownshe'd slept with last night. Quickly, she yanked the offendingnarticle of clothing off the bed and tried to surreptitiously drop itnonto the floor at her feet as she yanked the covers down. Sam feltnas if he were in some sort of trance. The only thing that moved wasnhis gaze, and it was firmly affixed on and followed Josie. He watchednher hastily remove the sweater from her pillow and try to hide itnfrom his view, which (in his mind, at least) only verified that shenhad slept with it on purpose. It was asnif pieces of a puzzle had slid into place. Heat spread through himnlike wildfire at the sudden revelation: no matter what the truth wasnabout what Josie had been doing last spring, it could no longer bendenied…whether she admitted it to herself or not, whether she wasneven aware of it, at least some part of her yearned for him,nperhaps even wanted him. Sam closed his eyes, trying to force thenirrational urge to pull Josie down on that bed with him and make lovento her out of his head. Feelingnthe heat in her cheeks subsiding somewhat, Josie finally felt it wasnsafe enough to turn around. Sam was still standing right where she'dnleft him, an odd pained expression on his face. Concern for hisnwelfare pushing to the forefront of Josie's mind, she softlyngrasped his hand and pulled him down into a sitting position on thenbed. The suddennchange in position brought Sam back to the present. Staring up atnJosie standing over him, Sam asked, his voice tight and hoarse, \"Whatnare you doing to me?\" Josie'sneyes shot up to meet Sam's for a moment, wondering if his questionnwas some sort of Freudian slip before shaking her head to push thenthought aside. \"Tucking you in,\" she said, pushing against Sam'snshoulders to coax him to lie down. Sam'sneyebrows crinkled in confusion even as he felt his body shiver withnawareness. Josie still had her hands on his shoulders and was leaningnover him. It would be so simple to just slide his hand up her arm,ntuck his fingers into those gorgeous golden curls and pull her downnto him… But thenmoment was gone as fast as it had arrived. Josie stood back up,nturning and tugging at the blankets so that they covered Sam up tonhis chest. Then she reached forward, as if to brush his hair off hisnforehead gently, but caught her motion midstream and lowered her handnback to her side. Softly, she repeated, \"I'm tucking you in. Younlook worn out; you need some rest.\" Leaning upnon his elbows and shaking his head as if to clear it, for the firstntime Sam realized exactly what was going on. \"But, wait…whatnabout the fire…and the…\" And nownJosie sat down next to Sam, smoothing at the blankets on his chest inna motherly fashion, \"Don't worry about it; I'll watch thenfire.\" \"No,\"nhe protested, \"I don't want you lifting…\" Cuttingnhim off, Josie argued, \"…what? A three-pound piece of wood?\"nShe patted his arm as if humoring him. \"I'm a big girl, Sam…Inthink I can handle it.\" \"Butnwhat if…\" Sam trailed off as Josie gave him a quelling look. \"Nonbuts,\" she insisted. \"I'm fine; nothing's going to happen tonme while you're resting. I promise. Now, would you please get some rest?\" As if Incould actually sleep with the scent of her on the sheets surroundingnme , Sam thought, feeling his stomach muscles tense in reaction.nBut by the look on Josie's face, it was clear she wasn't going tontake no for an answer. Sighing in defeat, he replied, \"All right.nI'll try.\" Josiennodded in approval. \"Good.\" She stepped backward and half-shutnthe door. \"Sleep well.\" Then she turned and walked out of Sam'snline of sight. Sam letnout a long, painful sigh. God, it was pure agony lying in that soft,nwarm bed with Josie's peach blossom scent wafting around him! Sam'snlimbs all felt so heavy and warm that he closed his eyes against thensensation. Distantly, he thought to himself that there was no way innthese circumstances that he could, would ever possibly … He wasnasleep.

I won't be around forever. It wasn't as if I wanted to be King myself. Or master that - devilish device. But that's what duty is.[Chapter 2] Summoned \"The Archbishop has told me the most extraordinary tale, David,\" the King began. \"Is there any truth to the reports that you are involved with a divorced woman?\" His eldest son nodded. \"You do realize,\" the King continued, \"what a burden this places on your younger brother, who will have to assume more of your responsibilities.\" David snickered. His father ignored him. \"Now Bertie may not be the most accomplished public speaker, but it wouldn't hurt you to acquire more of his sense of duty.\" An old tactic. He knew it well. Which didn't make it sting any less.[Chapter 3] A Bad Day The Archbishop of Canterbury was having a bad day. The Duke had showed up at the pre-coronation preparation with an unfamiliar man. He'd already heard the gossip but waited patiently until the Duke saw fit to introduce him to his new speech therapist. An Australian! Without any credentials! And the Duke had done this without consulting him. And he wanted the man to sit in the family box. That whim could be indulged, but he really must go and engage a proper therapist at once. A real doctor. As if he didn't already have enough to do.[Chapter 4] The Pot and the Kettle \"Bastard!\" David exploded. Wallis looked up. \"I gather it didn't go well with your father.\" \"He always makes me feel like a five-year-old who's spilled jam all over the carpet.\" \"So what happened?\" \"He lectured me on duty. As usual. Why doesn't he just say it to my face that he thinks Bertie'll make a better king?\" \"Well, despite his questionable taste in women, your brother is a nice man, but he'll never be king. You might as well enjoy yourself while you can.\" Wallis , David reflected, was very wise. He would do just that.[Chapter 5] Sticks and Stones Bertie hadn't meant to say those things to Lionel. At least not like that. He knew too well what it was like to be on the receiving end of an explosion peppered with insults that stung for hours afterwards. Like father, like son. He couldn't recall his father ever apologizing. Only children apologized. But Lionel was different. They were supposed to be equals. At first it had grated, but somehow, without him realizing, it had ceased to. Until an hour ago. Shaping the words, thanks to his mentor, would not be a challenge. But saying them would.[Chapter 6] Remorse \"You're quiet tonight,\" Myrtle said. \"Something on your mind?\" \"It's Bertie. I told him that he'd make a better king than his brother.\" \"But that's treason.\" \"That's what he said.\" She laughed. \"Perhaps he doesn't want to be king. Personally, I don't blame him.\" But he's the best man for the job. An idiot could see that. \"Or perhaps that's the first time anyone's ever suggested that to him. Did you consider that?\" No, Lionel hadn't. \"I hope you're not going to let this come between you.\" She's right. As always. I'm the idiot. \"I'll go tomorrow. To apologize.\"[Chapter 7] To Return or Not to Return That bloody Australian had tricked him. But - it had worked. That was his voice on the recording. He couldn't deny that. Not a choke, click or hesitation. Well, the man's methods were a tad - what was the word Elizabeth had used - unorthodox - and he didn't believe Lionel about the smoking, how could it possibly do him harm? But he'd swallow his pride and return. Act as if nothing had happened. A little awkward yes, but it wasn't as if Lionel could refuse to treat the Duke of York. He hoped.[Chapter 8] Going Home \"David knows,\" Bertie said on the ride home from the party. \"I thought I could trust Logue to at least be discreet. But I guess he can't help boasting about his famous patient.\" \"Bertie, be fair. You don't know that for certain. David could have found out anyway,\" Elizabeth chided. Perhaps someone heard me shouting vowels out the window. \"My brother also accused me of trying to usurp him.\" \"Perhaps Mrs. Simpson put that in his head. Anything else?\" He couldn't tell her the rest. David was drunk. I should forget about it. \"No,\" he said. \"That's all.\"[Chapter 9] The Wrong Time \"You were one of the few people who ever brought up the subject of Johnnie,\" Bertie said. \"No one mentioned him during his life, so when he died, it wasn't much different.\" \"Often people would rather risk saying nothing than saying the wrong thing.\" \"The doctors tried everything to cure him. Nothing worked.\" \"Doctors aren't too keen on admitting ignorance,\" Lionel said. \"Must be why I'm not too keen on them myself. Present company excepted. \"Of course,\" Lionel agreed. He tried not to smile. One day, he'd tell Bertie the truth. But now was the wrong time.[Chapter 10] Yet To Come \" Tell me the truth. The real truth,\" Bertie insisted. \"I already did. Your speech was wonderful. Though I did have a few moments where I wasn't sure you'd be all right.\" \"I wasn't so sure of that myself. \" \"What happened to all that confidence I saw an hour ago?\" Elizabeth teased gently. \"I'm ready to do my part, I'm just not sure it will be enough.\" \"Bertie, you know that Lionel and I will be there whenever you need us. As long as you need us.\" He did. But it didn't hurt to hear it again. ","Summary":" Much Ado About Nothing He hadn't meant to lose his temper. He really hadn't.

He'd heard the announcer gargling and making other bizarre preparations. To Bertie, that was like tuning up a Rolls Royce; regardless of what you did or didn't do beforehand, it was a sure bet that it would see you safely to your destination. I don't think anything short of a miracle would guarantee I'm not going to make an ass out of myself. \"Sir? We're ready for you now.\" Bertie approached the microphone Before him, the audience blurred into an imperturbable mass. He opened his mouth. As if on cue, rain began to fall.[Chapter 2] Witness Though Lionel was sitting rather far away, he could tell as the Duke of the York approached the microphone at Wembley that he was terrified. \"Mummy?\" a little girl said, \"When is the Duke going to speak?\" \"Soon, dear.\" Into the silence, Lionel heard a whisper. \"…..such a lovely speech his brother gave last year.\" It must be brutal to have to fail on such a global stage, Lionel thought. Particularly when his other family members are such gifted orators. \"Papa?\" his son asked, after it was over. \"Can you help that poor man?\" Yes. I think I can.[Chapter 3] For the Birds \"A short-tailed albatross?\" Lionel repeated. \"A bedtime story I tell the girls. Don't you do the same with your kids?\" \"Yes, but when most people finish a tale like that, they've changed back into the prince. Or at least into a human.\" \"It's just a story,\" Bertie protested. \"Humor me. Why do you think you stay a bird? Why can't the spell be broken?\" \"I've never thought about it,\" his patient retorted. \"Fortunately, my daughters are much easier to please than you.\" Psychological mumbo jumbo , Bertie thought. How utterly ridiculous. Fascinating , Lionel thought. Must come back to this later.[Chapter 4] Regarding Mr. Johnson \"Dad, I've been thinking…\" His son, according to Lionel, did entirely too much thinking, but he didn't say that. \"What is it, Valentine?\" \"You know that new patient of yours? The one who was swearing the other day? I think I know who he really is.\" \"Who would that be?\" \"The Duke of York. Only he's using a pseudonym so no one will know.\" Lionel tried to sound stern. \"Well, you're not to tell anyone.\" \"Even Mum?\" \"Even Mum.\" \"But eventually, people will notice. If he's here every day.\" \"For now, don't say anything. To anyone. Please .\"[Chapter 5] A Bad Idea Elizabeth watched her husband trail after his brother, as he left the party. She suspected this wouldn't end well. David's malicious streak turned into downright cruelty when he was drunk. His viper of a wife was holding court on the other side of the room. Elizabeth looked out the window, at the unfamiliar gaps in the garden. Trees - servants - both disposable.. She doubted that David would be any more willing to accept advice from his younger brother than he had his father. Even if Bertie could speak flawlessly. She'd just have to wait and see.[Chapter 6] Escape \"Were you picking the grapes? Or did you get lost down there?\" Wallis chided when David finally returned with the bottle of wine. \"My brother wanted to lecture me on my kingly duties. He can be as persistent as Father. And he wonders why I've been avoiding him.\" \"Did you ask him about the rumor?\" \"Apparently, he is taking elocution lessons. Not that they seem to be having m-m-much effect.\" \"Don't be mean, David.\" But Wallis was laughing. Suddenly, she noticed Bertie entering the room, ashen-faced. \"He looks like he could use a drink. That will cheer him up.\"[Chapter 7] Fog Let's take a walk , Lionel had suggested. So here they were wading through the fog. Another bad idea, Bertie thought . What if someone sees us ? Lionel was nattering on about David again. His favorite subject. What is it about this man that keeps me perpetually off balance? \"…what are you so afraid of?\" Lionel was saying. Afraid? Afraid. Bertie wasn't afraid. For once, the words came without hesitation. It felt good to tell Lionel off. I should have done this a long time ago. Bertie couldn't help but glance back, though. But he could no longer see his teacher.[Chapter 8] Awkward Myrtle barely waited until her husband was through the door. \"How was the rehearsal, dear?\" she asked. \"Er…..it went well.\" \"Did you plan on telling me sometime, or were you hoping I'd remain oblivious?\" \"It was….awkward,\" Lionel said feebly. \"Awkward, is it? Well, how awkward do you think it was for me to come home from shopping and see the King and Queen in my home?\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Heavens knows what I would have fed them had they stayed.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Any other famous patients you want to tell me about?\" \"No, that's all.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Quite sure.\"[Chapter 9] Not Today The moment had arrived. Well, almost. It was the waiting before a speech, the anticipation that was even worse than the actual event. Don't think about Wembley. Or your father. Or David. Forget them , Lionel had told him. Sa y it to me. As a friend. A line from a childhood game popped into his mind. Here comes a chopper to chop off your head . No. Not this time. Bertie watched the light blink off, indicating that it was time. Now it was up to him. He took a deep breath. He looked at Lionel. He began his speech.[Chapter 10] In a Dream His Majesty of England woke suddenly and nudged his wife. \"Elizabeth? Are you awake?\" \"I am now.\" \"I just had a dream. I was giving the speech again, but this time my father was there. He said, I'm proud of you .\" \"Really?\" Elizabeth said. \"No. But he seemed pleased.\" That's progress , Elizabeth thought. Usually, King George V only appears in Bertie's nightmares. \"I'm sure Lionel would know what it meant. Did I ever thank you for engaging him?\" No, but that doesn't matter . \"Why don't we talk about this tomorrow.\" He took the hint and said goodnight. ","Summary":" Futility It looked like rain.

But three years ago he felt whole for weeks. He had someone to make him feel complete, someone to press his buttons, someone to make him laugh, and someone who he loved more than his self. That someone was Rachel Morron. Frank thought about her every day. He could remember the way she smiled, laughed, smelled, soft cocoa skin and how smooth her lips were. To him she was an angel, black angel. Rachel was the only reason for living. It took a lot of thought to come to terms that he loved her. \"Hi Frank, that woman across the bar sent you a martini,\" the bartender said putting a glass in in front of him. He looked to his right to see a leggy blonde woman staring at him. He turned back to the bartender and said, \"Tell her I'm not interested.\" The bartender stood there and sighed, \"Oh Frank,\" she walked over to the woman and sent the message. The woman pouted and said something. The bartender walked back over to him and said, \"She said you will regret it, and I think she's right.\" 'Not this again' he thought. \"You have been coming here for two years and I have been sending drinks back to women who are in to you more than a hundred times, honey what's up you gay or something?\" she asked. Frank shook his head. \"Then what's wrong?\" He didn't answer all he did was smiled. \"Oh my God, there is someone you're saving yourself for, who is she?\" she asked. He pulled out a ten dollar bill of his pocket and said, \"No one you know personally.\" He walked out of the bar and saw a crowd of people around a white limo. She got out with that smile he loved so much. He was almost to his car when he accidently looked. Rachel was looking straight at him. It took everything in him not to go back across the street. She was staring at him ignoring everybody around her. She couldn't believe her eyes; Sy was pushing her in the same bar Frank was just in. Even walking she was still staring straight into his eyes. When she was finally inside the bar, Frank got in his car and drove off. \"Rachel what were you staring at, you look like you just seen a ghost,\" Sy said. She sighed, \"Trust me your close.\" After signing a few autographs she sat down and guzzled down at least two shots. \"Sonya I have a question for you,\" Rachel said. \"Go for it.\" She inhaled and asked, \"Who was that guy who was in her about ten minutes ago?\" Sonya thought for a minute and asked, \"Tall, brown hair pouty but sexy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Oh that just Frank he's a regular but all he does is sit in that stool over there and drinks orange juice, but don't waste your time, he told me, sort of, that he's saving his self for someone else. Turned down about a hundred women over the last two years,\" Sonya said. Rachel was pleased he didn't have someone in his life. \"And he forgot his coat so he should be here in Three, Two, One,\" she pointed at the door and Frank came flying in and quickly grabbed his coat. \"You're lucky I didn't steal it,\" Sonya said. \"Like you would risk not getting a tip,\" he said. Rachel had to think quick and decided to run to the bathroom. But as she got up they bumped into each other. Something they both were trying to avoid. They were afraid to say anything. Just staring into each other's eyes was just enough. After God knows how long a squeal and a thud broke their gaze. Apparently Sonya caught up to what was going out because she temporarily fainted. She popped back up and said, \"I'm okay, I'm okay, um, I need a drink.\" They both laughed until they notice they were still in each other's presence. \"Um, hi,\" Rachel said. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Wow is it hot in here or is it just me,\" Sonya said, \"So you two know each other or something?\" They looked back at each and smiled. \"I was her bodyguard three years ago,\" Frank said. Sonya's eyes widened; she had heard the story before: Flashback: After drinking away her, what she called, Frank guilt, Rachel wanted to let some demons go. \"Sonya, I was in love once,\" she said. Sonya sighed, she knew Rachel was wasted and that wasn't going to be pretty. \"I know, if you weren't in love once you wouldn't have Fletcher,\" Sonya said. \"No, I mean recently I fell in love,\" she said. Sonya had no idea what she was talking but wanted to know more. \"Ok who?\" \"My ex bodyguard/lover/ enemy/rock/I don't have what we are anymore. He took a bullet for me and I kissed him. We love to push each other over the edge, I don't know why but he won't stay out of my head. He is what you call my everything, next to Fletcher.\" Sonya was surprised she talked about guys before but she never talked about being in love. \"You are very drunk right now so it's hard to believe that this man isn't a drunken fantasy Rach,\" Sonya said. \"I think I need to throw up,\" Rachel said before running inside the bathroom. Sonya was laughing at herself for almost believing her. Present Time: When she snapped out of her trance they were talking. \"Do want a ride home?\" Rachel asked. Frank thought about it and said, \"Okay.\"[Chapter 2] The Bodyguard: my sequel The longer the car ride was the closer Rachel scooted to Frank. She didn't think Frank noticed but he did. Every time she moved he hoped it would be her last; one cute little move by her, WILL lose his self-control. \"Can I ask you a question?\" Rachel asked. \"You just did,\" he say, \"I'm just kidding what.\" \"Why don't you have somebody? I mean Sonya told me you don't have a girlfriend why?\" For a few moments he was silent. \"Um, I don't know I haven't found anybody yet,\" he said. Rachel couldn't breathe for a few seconds. Just when she was just about to say something her temp driver said, \"I have to take a lunch break; you guys sit tight for about an hour.\" When he got out the car they both froze. \"So, uh, when do you plan on finding the right gal?\" Rachel asked. \"I don't know, maybe two months from now or even two years, I'm not the one planned my life,\" he said. \"Good answer but why don't you try and put some of your ideas in it?\" \"You are very nosey do you know that; do you have to know every detail of everything?\" She laughed. \"Yes I do I thought you knew that all ready now answer my question.\" \"If I had my life the way I planned it I would be the happiest man in the world,\" he said with a chuckle. \"What does make you happy Frank Farmer?\" she said. He shrugged his shoulders. \"Does money make you happy?\" He shook his head. \"Does food make you happy?\" He laughed at that one and shook his head again. \"Okay I just burned through the two main keys to a man's happiness now,\" Rachel moved at least two centimeters from Frank's face, \"Tell me what makes you happy?\" 'Hold onto your control Frank it's just a question if you kiss her, things will never be the same' \"I'm waiting,\" she said breathy and licked her lips. Now that was the last straw. He literally tackled her down to the limousine floor. When his lips touched hers he had no control over his self. She, on the other hand, planned, well actually, fantasized about this. She flipped him over making her on top of him. \"Wait Rachel, what are we doing?\" She rose up half way and said, \"I don't know about you but,\" she slipped her shirt off, \"I'm making up for the last three years.\" \"Good answer.\" He pulled her back to his lips and flipped her to her back letting his hand go where ever they wanted to go. After about thirty minutes they decided to keep the screaming at a minimal. Then after five minutes they realized they were exhausted and stopped. Rachel knew that the grin on her face will stay there for the rest of the day. Frank was chuckling a little too hard. \"What's so funny?\" Rachel asked still in a daze. \"If you wanted to seduce me, you could have done it at my house, at least there's a bed,\" he answered. \"Well I didn't hear you complaining thirty minutes ago and you could've driven yourself home. I saw your car,\" she said. \"Maybe we should get dressed before your driver gets back,\" Frank suggested. \"Or we could stay like this for another five minutes then we can get dressed.\" They laid there until Frank looked at his watch and saw it was six thirty and told Rachel they needed to get up. It took Rachel a little more time to get dress. She was sore but in all the right places. After her driver came back they dropped Frank off at his house. When he gave her a good bye kiss she held on for dear mercy. It took more than ten minutes for him to exit the car. \"Want to meet me at the bar tomorrow?\" she asked. \"Okay.\" He went unlocked his door and waved good bye. \"Where to boss?\" her driver asked. She let out a long sigh and said, \"Back to the bar I guess.\" When they pulled up to the bar Sonya was outside smoking a cigarette. \"What's with that grin on your face?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"You that 'I just got laid' look on your face. Oh my God, you just got laid,\" Sonya said. \"I don't even know what that look is.\" \"It's relaxed but overexcited and satisfied but would go for more all explained by one big smile, now what's with the look?\" Rachel blushed. \"I have nothing to say,\" she said. Sonya was not giving up so easy. She put out her cigarette and followed Rachel into the bar. \"Rachel, where the hell have you been?\" Sy yelled from a cross the bar. Sonya stepped back into the bar trying to eavesdrop. \"I just gave a friend a ride home,\" she said. Sonya couldn't help but laugh. \"And who was this 'friend' of yours?\" \"Sonya I need a drink and make it strong,\" Rachel said. \"Uh, Rachel, you didn't answer my question and why are you smiling so hard?\" Rachel's eyes widen; she bit her lip in an attempt to hide her smile. Sonya dropped her drink and mouthed, \"I told you so.\" \"I can't answer that and I want to go home, my buzz is kicking in,\" Rachel said after downing her whole drink in one gulp. She got up and walked out the door still sore. \"It's going to be hell getting up in the morning,\" she said to herself. Sy had no clue to what was going on but he didn't feel like debating. Sonya came out and yelled, \"Can I get a ride!\" \"You do not want to get inside this limo, trust me,\" Rachel warned. Sonya laughed her way back to her into the bar. Rachel was so glad when she realized Fletcher was at a sleepover. She slipped into bed without eating dinner. She was so exhausted from the event that happen in the back of her limo. Just thinking about it made her smile. When she finally fell asleep she thought about the last time. Then she panicked. 'What if it ends up like last time, what if he leaves me and doesn't want anything? What will I do then?' she thought. She picked up her phone and dialed a number she knew by heart. \"Hello,\" said a grumbly voice. \"Frank?\" she said. \"Rachel it's two in the morning what's wrong?\" he asked. \"Do you love me?\" she said out of the blue. That woke him up. \"What?\" \"Do. You. Love. Me.\" He took a big exhale before answering, \"Why are you asking me this question at two in the morning?\" \"Because I refuse to go to sleep without knowing and if Rachel doesn't get sleep then Rachel won't get her rest time and if Rachel doesn't get her rest time then Frank won't get any Rachel time. Do you get what I'm saying?\" \"I get it,\" he said. \"So?\" she said dragging the 'o'. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes, what?\" she said. \"Yes I love you Rachel Morron,\" he said. \"And I love you Frank Farmer,\" she said. He laughed and said, \"I know.\" \"How?\" \"Because you kept yelling it earlier in the limo.\" \"Ugh, good night Frank,\" she said. \"Good night Rachel.\" \"Love you,\" Rachel said. \"Love you too now let me go to sleep,\" he yelled. She laughed and said, \"Bye.\" She hung up and fell right back asleep not worrying about anything at all anymore.[Chapter 3] The Bodyguard: my sequel \"Okay why are 'you' so happy?\" Sonya asked Frank the next day. \"What is wrong with being happy it's a nice day today,\" he said, \"And why did you use air quotes when you said you?\" Sonya laughed, \"Because yesterday when Rachel dropped you off, I wondered why you didn't take you own car but then I thought it was none of my business until Rachel came back with that same look on her face.\" Frank chuckled. When Sonya went to go to another customer Frank felt a tap on his shoulder. When he turned around it was the blondie from the day before. \"Can I help you?\" Frank asked. \"Why aren't you interested in me?\" she asked. \"I'm sorry what?\" \"I mean I been trying to talk to you for a month and for some reason you are the only guy I've met who won't accept my offering. I'm probably the sexiest woman you ever seen, I have a wad of cash and I'm willing to do anything to get and keep a man. So I ask you again why aren't you interested in me?\" Frank didn't answer he let the only sexiest woman he's ever seen answer that question. \"Well maybe because he's interested in me and is tired of you trying get at him,\" a voice said approaching her from behind. Blondie turned around and saw Rachel standing there with her ready to kill look in her eyes. She had been standing there from the start. The girl was speechless. \"You look like a girl with common sense so why don't you walk away and don't look back,\" Rachel said. And that's exactly what she did. Once blondie was out of sight Rachel looked at Frank who was trying to keep from laughing. \"I can't leave you alone for less than 24 hour without some trick hitting on you,\" Rachel said. He grabbed and held Rachel by her waist and said, \"I guess not.\" Rachel leaned in for a kiss. After a few minutes Sonya got worried that they were losing air. When she cleared her throat the two jumped apart a little embarrassed. \"Now I see why you two were so happy.\" They both laughed very softly. \"Aren't you supposed to be working or something?\" Frank asked. Sonya walked away laughing. \"Um, Rachel?\" \"Yeah?\" \"We should talk,\" Frank said. Rachel sighed, \"Uh oh.\" \"I going to admit this now, I hate show-biz but I love you. Now you hate that I hate show-biz but you love me so what if we not reveal us so we both could be happy.\" \"Now how are we not happy Frank?\" she felt a little offended. \"Well if you don't want press following us everywhere we go we should hide us.\" \"I don't understand. You don't want to be seen with me?\" she asked. \"No, no, no I do but I don't like the spotlight and you can't live without the spotlight so this is the only compromise I can think of. You can go to all the parties and get-togethers that famous people go to and I will wait for you to come back. Oh yeah I promise to go to every concert and award show you are be included,\" he explained. \"When did you figure all this out?\" Rachel asked. \"Last night after you called me in the middle of the night.\" The compromise sounded good to Rachel, she can be Rachel Marron in public but just Rachel when she was with Frank. \"Okay, that sound reasonable,\" she said. Frank's eyes widened at her response. \"Good now Ms. Marron, can I buy you a drink?\" Frank said jokingly. From that day on they were the happiest couple in the world. They spend most of their time at Frank's house. They had to be very careful because Sy was breathing down her neck. Sy was always asking her where she would be at night and she would say out, he would show up at Frank's house for small talk ever since he saw Rachel and Frank talking into each other's ear one day. Sometimes Rachel would be hiding in Frank's bedroom when Frank and Sy were in the living room. After interviews Rachel would stay at Frank's home just to tell him all about it. One night while they were in the shower they heard the doorbell. \"Should I get it?\" Frank asked. Rachel nodded while she rinsed the shampoo out her hair. Frank got out the shower and wrapped a towel around his bottom half. When he answered the door it was Sy. \"Um what are you doing here?\" Frank asked. \"Did I interrupt something?\" \"No not really we, I mean, I was just taking a shower, what brings you here?\" Sy thought about it for a minute. \"What's going on with you and Rachel?\" Sy asked. Frank's heart started to race. \"I don't follow.\" \"Where ever you are, Rachel wants to be. Every time we see you at the bar Rachel forgets that I'm with her and goes straight to you and you guys are always whispering into each other's ears and laughing,\" Sy explained. \"We can't talk?\" Frank asked trying not to look nervous. \"I'm not saying that but if something is going I need to,\" he stopped in mid-sentence. Frank followed his eyes and saw Rachel's favorite scarf. \"Is, is she here?\" Sy asked. \"Frank. Who was at the door?\" Rachel asked coming out the bathroom in a fully dressed. When she saw Sy she froze. \"Rachel. What are you doing here?\" \"I, um, taking a shower,\" she said trying to lighten the vibe. \"You know what I mean,\" Sy said. He was irritated. \"Um, I going to get dressed while you two talk,\" Frank said. When Frank left the room Sy said, \"How long have this been going on?\" \"About two months,\" Rachel said. \"And you didn't even think about letting me, your good friend, know.\" \"It wasn't my idea. Frank came up with a great compromise that we've been happy with.\" \"What is that?\" Sy asked. \"I can be famous in public but not famous when I'm with him. That way he can stay out of the spotlight,\" she answered. Sy couldn't believe what he was hearing. \"So he's asking you to give up your fame for a couple hours?\" \"No, not really,\" she answered. \"Rach, you need to end this affair now sweetheart unless the press will have a field day,\" Sy said. \"I can't, and I don't want to,\" she said in her diva voice. \"Why?\" \"Because I'm in love and since you never been in love before I'll tell you it rocks and he may not act like it in public but Frank is very romantic I'm-\" \"Rachel if you love something you have to let it go,\" Sy said. \"I'm pregnant.\" Frank popped his head back into the room. \"What?\" Okay I had to do that I'm not one to miss an opportunity but if you don't like it let me know before next week kk -Tiffany[Chapter 4] The Bodyguard: My Sequel Flashback: two weeks earlier \"Welcome back Henry,\" Rachel said. \"Good to be back and you are being extra nice today so where do I need to take you.\" \"Um I was going to work my way up to asking you but since you brought it up can you take me to a doctor's appointment?\" \"Okay just give me a minute to get settled in.\" When he went into the house she followed. She was very hungry but whatever she ate she threw back up, and she couldn't stay awake for more than three hours. There was only one solution for all this but she didn't want to believe it. \"Okay boss I'm ready,\" Henry said coming down stairs. That ride to the doctor's office was going to determine the rest of her life. Two weeks later: 'Did I just say that out loud?' Rachel thought to herself. \"You're what?\" Sy asked. \"I'm pregnant as in I'm having a kid as in it's his,\" Rachel said pointing to Frank, who apparently forgot how to breathe. \"Rachel, when did you find this out?\" Sy asked. \"About two weeks ago when Henry got back from his vacation. \"Wait you knew for two weeks and you didn't tell?\" Frank said. Rachel nodded. \"Wh- Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I was waiting for the right time but, Mr. I-can't-mind-my-own-business here ruined it.\" \"Hey I'm your publicist, you are my business,\" Sy said slightly louder, \"Wait a minute, you guys actually, well you know, 'did it'?\" \"By 'did it' you mean had sex then yeah, a lot, hence, the baby,\" Rachel said pointing at her belly. \"Really? This guy?\" Sy asked. \"Ah yeah this guy,\" Rachel walked over to Frank putting her hand on his back. \"Rachel, why didn't you tell me that you thought you were pregnant?\" Frank said very confused. \"Yeah why not?\" Sy said. \"How did I become the bad guy?\" she said. \"You are not the bad guy Rachel but just think about the public ' Rachel Marron pregnant by former bodyguard,\" Sy said. \"I DON'T care about the public, let them talk the world needs a little excitement anyway,\" she said. \"So is this what it is to you, excitement?\" Frank asked with a very angry voice. \"No, no, no.\" \"Did you think my deal was just a fun time?\" \"No I agreed to your deal because I want to be with you.\" \"This is why I don't let people in, I only get hurt and I thought you loved me.\" \"I do love you,\" she started to feel tears come down her face. \"Can you just leave me alone,\" he said walking out of the living room. \"Frank,\" she whispered. \"Come on Rachel, let's go,\" Sy said taking her by her arm. She didn't want to go but she didn't stop. She didn't know that he can hold a grudge for so long. She hadn't seen Frank in three weeks. \"Rachel we are late for your interview,\" Sy said. Sy had pretended that day didn't happen. She hadn't mentioned her pregnancy since that day and wanted it to stay that way. She wanted to laugh so she agreed to appear on 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien'. He was very funny. \"I'm ready,\" she said. \"We have a very special guest, she is a singer, she is the most beautiful woman in the world, she is Rachel Marron!\" Rachel came out and felt the thrill of her life. She was laughing at everything until one topic came up that shut the hold program down. \"So the word on the Hollywood street is that you are pregnant with your second child.\" She gasped, \"I am?\" Everybody started laughing. \"Is that a no?\" \"No.\" \"So it's a yes?\" \"No, you tell me.\" \"Well I guess we'll find out nine months from now won't we?\" Rachel shrugged, \"I guess we will then.\" \"And that's Rachel Marron everybody,\" her screen time was over. And that was good because a soon as she got off stage she had to throw up. \"You really want to kill mommy don't you?\" she said to her unborn child. When she got home, Rachel started to think about Frank. So she sort of started crying. About five minutes into it she felt a tap on her shoulders. \"Mom, are you okay?\" Fletcher asked. \"Yeah, I'm okay?\" she said wiping the tears from her face, \"Fletcher can I asked you a question?\" Fletcher nodded. \"How would you feel about a baby around the house?\" \"That would be cool.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, that would be cool.\" \"All right you can leave now.\" Fletcher walked out of not thinking anything of the conversation. That night she had a dream-less sleep. Something soft that wasn't her pillow woke her up around twelve pm. She turned around to see a teddy bear in front of Frank's face. \"Hi, I'm Frank's apology bear, and I'm here to pass on an apology from Frank,\" the teddy (aka Frank in a high-pitched voice) said. \"I'm listening,\" Rachel said. \"Frank says he's sorry for accusing you, he was just scared and he wants you to know that he loves you very much. Is he forgiven?\" Rachel laughed and nodded. \"I'm sorry,\" he said in his regular voice. \"It's alright,\" she said. \"How are you feeling?\" \"I feel like I'm ten weeks pregnant,\" she said looking at her abdomen. Frank's face fell. It never really dawn on him that she was carrying his kid. \"Well you are, so it's natural you feel that way.\" \"I guess I am,\" she said with a smile. \"So what are we going to do?\" \"Well, I'm going to have a kid, what about you?\" she sat up. \"I'm going to stay beside you forever,\" he said. \"Or at least until the baby is emancipated then want nothing to do with our drama,\" she jokingly said. Frank shook his head and reached in his pocket and pulled out a small velvet box. \"Then I won't be needed this then,\" he opened it and revealed a small, but beautiful, engagement ring. The only thing Rachel could say was, \"Oh my.\" Frank got on one knee and said, \"When I first met you, I thought I was in for the worst, and then I started to get to know you and realized, that's just what I got. But, for some strange reason, I fell deeply in love with you and finding out that you were pregnant just made me fall more in love with you. I love you and I will put up the spotlight if it means I can have you forever so, Rachel Marron, will you do me the honor of marrying me.\" Rachel mouth dropped to the floor. Her mind was screaming yes but she couldn't get it out. \"Just nod if you saying yes,\" Frank said. Rapidly, she nodded her head and Frank slipped the ring onto her finger. He sat on the bed, kissed her lips and said, \"You can breathe now.\" She started gasping for air. \"Are you okay,\" he asked. Instead of answering she wrapped her arms around his neck and hugged him very tightly. \"I love you, I love you, I love you,\" she said. \"I love you too.\" They stayed like that for a few minutes.[Chapter 5] The Bodyguard: My sequel \"YOU GUYS ARE WHAT?\" Sy yelled. \"We're engaged to be married,\" Rachel said showing him her ring. \"Okay, okay, okay, less than a month ago you told me you were pregnant by him, now you are engaged. What's next, you're moving in with him.\" Frank and Rachel smiled and looked at each. \"You want to?\" Rachel asked. \"Maybe. What about you?\" \"No, no, no, you are not going to move into his house. Honey, you are a mega star you can't live in a small, shabby house.\" \"He's right-\" Rachel said. \"Oh, thank god someone is making sense,\" Sy said, letting out a sigh of relief. \"We should find our own home,\" Rachel said. \"That's a great idea we could a not too big but not too small home with a big a backyard.\" \"Yeah with a pool.\" \"And a tree house.\" \"Are you guys serious?\" Sy asked. They both nodded. Sy let a large breath, \"Okay I guess I can work something out with you guys' real estate people, and try to hold the press off you for a while,\" he said. His cell phone started ringing and he said, \"Are we done here?\" \"Yeah,\" Frank said. Sy answered his phone and walked. The first thing he said to the person on the other line was, \"They don't pay me enough for this.\" Rachel laughed when she heard that. \"Can we do this?\" Frank asked. \"Of course, I got you; you got me that's all we need.\" Instead of agreeing with her, he kissed her. \"Love you,\" she said. \"Love you too.\" Three months and two weeks later: Frank and Rachel walked into the private doctor's office hand and hand with the paparazzi following them. Her belly was a little more than noticeable. \"And you wonder why I hate show-biz?\" Frank whispered into her ear. She smiled and bumped him with her shoulder. The doctor squeezed the ultra sound gel on Rachel's stomach. \"Do you hear the heartbeat,\" the doctor said. \"Yeah,\" they both said. Frank was holding her hand fighting back tears. \"Everything seems to be good. Do you guys want to want to know the sex?\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" Frank said yeah and Rachel said no. \"Please?\" Frank pleaded. \"Didn't we already argue about this?\" \"And I said I wasn't giving up so can you please just swallow your pride,\" he said. \"It's not pride I want it to be a surprise.\" \"And it will be because we don't know yet; please.\" \"Ugh.\" \"Is that a yeah?\" \"Okay but you owe me,\" she said. \"Thanks, uh doctor yes we want to know.\" \"Okay,\" the doctor moved the tool around and said, \"and it's a girl.\" \"You see, and you wanted to paint the nursery blue,\" Frank said. \"It's a girl?\" Rachel said. \"Yep.\" A tear came down her face. \"Now do you guys have a name ready?\" the doctor asked wiping the goo off her. \"Well I like Justice but he likes Marilyn,\" Rachel said. \"Marilyn Justice Nikki Marron-Farmer. What about that?\" Frank asked. \"That's good, but what about Justice Marilyn Nikki Farmer-Marron?\" Rachel asked. \"We'll talk about it.\" The doctor gave them their next appointment and a picture and sent them on their way. He didn't want to hear their bickering anymore. When they got outside the press bombarded them. \"So Ms. Marron was this the big one?\" one reporter asked. \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" another asked. Rachel put picture up to the camera and said, \"Guess.\" With that Frank helped her into the car. When they got home Rachel plopped down on the couch. \"Justice and I are hungry,\" Rachel said. Frank sat next to her and smiled. He put his ear up to Rachel's stomach and said, \"Marilyn said she has nothing to do with that,\" Rachel laughed \"What do to eat?\" She thought about it for a second. \"Just bring me the jar peanut butter and the jar of pickles,\" she said. Frank made a face. \"Don't give that look, it's either that or chocolate-covered bacon.\" \"You are so lucky I love you,\" Frank said making his way to the kitchen. \"Love you too,\" she said. He came back with her weird order and sat as far away from her as possible. \"You want one,\" she joked. \"If I put my hand in that jar you will kill me.\" She laughed because she knew he was right. \"Can you snuggle with me?\" Rachel said stretching her arms. He sat next to her and she laid her head on his chest. Rachel looked at her ring and smiled. \"You really love that ring,\" Frank said. \"Yup,\" she said, \"I love this ring,\" she kissed her ring, \"I love our daughter,\" she rubbed her stomach, \"And I love you,\" she kissed him. \"Why every time I come in here you two are all lovey-dovey?\" Fletcher said closing the door. Rachel pulled away and frowned. \"Why every time we get all lovey-dovey, you show up?\" she said. \"Because I have the worst timing ever.\" \"And I have to make dinner before your mom kills me,\" Frank said getting up. \"Waaaaah,\" Rachel whined when he got up. \"It's either dinner or snuggle-time,\" Frank said pretending to weigh the two situations. \"Well I am still hungry,\" she said. Frank smiled and went into the kitchen. \"I still don't understand how water and oil fall in love,\" Fletcher said. He dropped his backpack and sat next to his mother. \"How was school?\" Rachel asked. \"Like every other day, I learnt something new. What about you?\" he asked. Rachel reached inside her purse and showed him the ultrasound picture. \"Awww,\" Fletcher said. \"Yeah the doctor said she is health and everything.\" \"She? It's a girl?\" he asked, \"I thought you didn't want to know.\" \"I didn't but Frank started begging again.\" Fletcher laughed, \"Well I'm going to do my homework.\" \"Okay, study for at least an hour,\" Rachel said. \"Whatever you say mom,\" he kissed her on her cheek and walked away. \"Frank!\" Rachel yelled. He ran inside the living room, \"Yeah.\" \"I'm going to let you pick her name.\" \"What's the catch?\" he asked. \"No catch, but you need to do one thing for me.\" Frank smirked, \"And what's that?\" Rachel smiled that smile that had a message. A message that no guy can say no to. Frank smiled when she got up, took him by his hand and pulled him into their bedroom.[Chapter 6] The Bodyguard: my sequel \"Well, well, well look who's here. After three months you two finally decide to visit little ol me,\" Sonya said when she saw Frank and Rachel enter the bar. \"Hey Sony, how you been?\" Rachel asked. \"Not as good as you; you might be one of the prettiest pregnant woman I've ever seen,\" Sonya came from the behind the counter and hugged both of them. \"Might? She is the prettiest pregnant woman in the world,\" Frank said. \"Thanks you honey,\" Rachel said and kissed him. Sonya shook her head. \"Oh Lord, you got him scared sprung,\" she said. \"Damn straight,\" Rachel said. Sonya laughed her way back behind the counter. \"So why do you guys want to all of a sudden come here?\" Sonya asked. \"Well I sort of, kind of still need a maid of honor,\" Rachel said. \"And our daughter needs a God-mother,\" Frank said. Rachel smiled, \"We were wondering if you know anyone.\" \"Well, there is this best friend of yours who would love to do all that for you,\" Sonya said. \"Who?\" Frank asked. \"Me!\" she yelled. Rachel smiled. \"No, we couldn't ask you to be responsible for all that; you have to run this place and then go home and take care of your kid,\" she said. Sonya was not going to give up, \"Yes you can ask me be responsible for all that. You guys no I love being busy, it keeps my mind from thinking of he-who-should-not -be-named and and… and you two are pulling my leg aren't you?\" \"Yeah, pretty much,\" Rachel said. \"You guys are so mean.\" They sat there talking when Rachel eyes widen. Frank automatically panicked. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. \"She's kicking,\" she grabbed his hand and put it on her stomach. \"Wow, she's strong,\" he said. \"Just like her daddy,\" Rachel said looking into Frank's eyes. Frank leaned in and kissed her. \"Hey, break up this little love-fest I got customers,\" Sonya said. Rachel laughed. \"I have to go to the bathroom, anyway.\" She walked away and that's when someone made their move. \"You two make a very cute couple,\" Blondie said. Frank turned to face her and said, \"Thanks.\" \"I'm sorry if I caused any trouble in the past, I just thought you would like a girl like me,\" she said. \"You are an attractive woman, a blind man could see that, but I've been in love with that woman ever since I met her. You shouldn't try to buy a man's love, just be yourself.\" \"Well, thanks for the advice. I'm Jessica, by the way,\" she said. \"I'm Frank,\" they shook hands and she walked away. \"You know you are washing your hands when we get home right?\" Rachel asked coming up behind him. Frank laughed, \"Um, O.K.\" Rachel sat down and asked, \"So what were you and Malibu Barbie talking about?\" \"You don't want to know what I said because you are going to flip,\" he said. \"Yes I do want to know,\" she said. \"She said she was sorry for trying to cause trouble in the past and I told her that she was attractive and any man would be lucky to have her, just not me.\" \"So she's attractive huh?\" \"Um, sure I guess, I was just trying to give her courage,\" he said trying to wedge his self out of the conversation, \"Besides I only have eyes for you.\" He gave her an innocent kiss on the lips. \"You really are going to dig that pick-up line from the grave?\" \"It's working right?\" \"Oh my God ya'll are too much,\" Sonya said dropping two sodas in front of them. Sonya turned the stereo on and went on her break. About five couple got up and started dancing. Frank and Rachel sat in silence until a particular song came on. \"If I…. Should stay.\" Rachel looked at Frank, who was staring straight at her, and smiled. He had got up and held out his hand and she gladly accepted. On the dance floor, Rachel laid her head on his shoulder and closed her eyes. She was feeling the same way she did when they danced to this song for the first time. That night was magical, till morning came but that was the past and she knows for a fact that he was her future and she was enjoying every second of it. Four months later: April 22, 1995 8:17pm Rachel and Frank were sitting in the living room, sitting on opposite sides of the couch. Rachel had her legs stretched out on the couch reading her book. \"You hungry?\" Frank asked Rachel. \"No,\" she answered calmly and continuing to read her book. \"You need me to turn on the television for you?\" \"No, my book is getting good.\" \"You want me to rub your feet?\" \"Nooo Frank.\" \"Do you want a pillow for you back?\" \"Frank if I need something I'll let you okay?\" He nodded. Five minutes later he started, \"Do you….\" Rachel had enough and threw her book at him. \"Ow, what was that for?\" Frank asked. \"Please, shut up,\" she said, \"Go talk to Fletcher or something, I'm not handicapped I can do anything I want.\" \"Sorry,\" he got up and went outside to the backyard with his newspaper. Rachel was enjoying the silence but then she got tired of quiet so she listened to some new music for her next album. About five songs later she fell asleep. Frank came in the living room and saw her and smiled. He covered her with a blanket and removed the earphones from her ears. He went into their room and went to sleep. At 2:56am Rachel's eyes flew open. 'Either I'm peeing or…' \"FRANK!\" she yelled. Frank didn't hear her and stayed asleep. \" F R A N K! \" she yelled to the top of her lungs. He heard her that time and ran inside the living room. \"Yeah,\" he said out of breath. \"Remember when I said I can do anything I need?\" she said. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Well I can't do everything.\" Frank was half-sleep and very confused. \"What do you mean?\" \"I need a ride somewhere.\" \"Where?\" Rachel was getting frustrated especially when she felt her first contraction. Her eyes looked like she was about to kill him. She tried to explain this as calmly as she could, \"My… Water…Broke.\" Frank froze. When Frank wasn't moving Rachel threw her Walkman at him and he strung into action. He took hand and helped her off the couch. \"Fletcher!\" Frank yelled. \"I'm here, I'm here,\" he came in the living room with Rachel's suitcase and everything. \"What, how did you know?\" Frank asked. \"WHO CARES JUST GET ME TO A HOSPITAL!\" Rachel yelled. \"Okay, okay, okay,\" Frank said helping her to the car. \"Excuse me ma'am, my fiancée is labor and I have no idea what to ask or what to do, I just know that she is screaming to the top of her lungs right now.\" \"Sir, calm down we'll take care of her,\" the nurse summoned the medical dream team to get Rachel. They brought Rachel in and took her to the back. When Frank was about to go after them the nurse stopped him. \"Wait sir, is that Rachel Marron?\" she asked. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Well after all this is said and done, can I get an autograph for my daughter?\" \"Yeah, sure whatever,\" he ran to catch up to the doctor. He found that they had already put her in a room. \"What took you so long?\" Rachel asked when he walked inside the room. \"I got lost,\" he said and sat down and took her hand. \"You know after she's born you are never, in your life, touching me again,\" Rachel said. Frank laughed. He kissed her hand and said, \"I love you too.\"[Chapter 7] The Bodyguard: my sequel 10 hours later: \"Her contractions are 2 minutes apart and she is fully dilated,\" the doctor told Frank, \"It's time to push.\" Frank was shaking with excitement. \"Okay,\" he said. 'This is it,' he said to his self, 'I'm about to be a dad.' He walked into the waiting room to tell everybody the news. Sonya, Sy, Bill, Tony, Henry and Fletcher stood up when he walked in the room. \"Is everything okay?\" Tony asked. Frank smiled. \"It is time to push,\" he said and everybody started cheering. Sonya pushed herself through the crowd and put her hand on Frank's shoulder. \"Promise me one thing,\" she said. \"What?\" \"The next time you come through that door you will have a little baby and make sure I'm the one that holds her first okay?\" \"Okay.\" \"Be prepared to go through hell,\" she said pushing him through the doors. Rachel was having the worse time of her life. \"You still want to kill me?\" Frank asked poking his head in the door. She smiled and shook her head. Frank walked to the side the hospital bed and stroked her hair. \"Your daughter is trying to kill me,\" Rachel said, \"I promised myself I would never have any more kids after the pain I experienced with Fletcher, why the hell you have to come along?\" Before Frank could say anything Rachel grabbed his shirt and a couple of chest hairs and screamed, \"Ahhhhh.\" \"Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow, Ow,\" Frank yelled. After a few seconds, she let go. \"I never knew you were so strong,\" Frank said rubbing his chest, \"But, um, the doctor said it's time to push.\" Rachel sighed, \"Finally.\" A few minutes later, the doctors came in and prepared everything. \"Okay Ms. Marron next contraction push,\" the doctor said. \"Okay.\" Her next contraction came and she grabbed Frank's hand and pushed. \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\" Rachel breathed and loosened her grip on Frank's hand. \"The baby's head is very low so the next two tries might be it.\" \"Frank, do me a favor,\" Rachel said. \"Anything.\" \"Tell me why you love me,\" she said. \"Now?\" \"Yes know, before my next contraction.\" \"Okay, I love you because you have the best heart into world, you are so beautiful and you never fail to melt my heart when you want. And I love it when you're angry because you have the sexiest evil glare in the world.\" She smiled until a contraction came. She gripped his hand and pushed. \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\" \"I can see her head just give me one big push,\" the doctor said. Rachel didn't say anything she just pushed. Ten second, \"WaaaaaaWaaaaaa.\" \"Here she is,\" the doctor said pulling the baby out. \"Oh my God,\" Frank said, \"Look at her.\" He was crying for the first time in 20 years. The doctor placed her on Rachel's stomach. \"Wow she is so beautiful,\" Rachel said she was crying too. \"ND, do you want to cut the umbilical cord?\" the doctor asked holding out the scissors. Frank didn't think twice; he took the scissors and cut the cord. They took her away to clean her. She was crying. \"We made that,\" Frank said to Rachel, \"God I love you so much.\" He kissed her and turned his attention back to his daughter. The doctors put her in a swaddle and gave her to Rachel. \"Hi, I'm your mommy,\" Rachel said rocking her daughter. \"And I'm your daddy; I'm the one who keeps boys your age from taking you away from me.\" \"She has your eyes.\" \"And she has you face.\" \"She looks exactly like a Marilyn-Justice.\" \"And like a Farmer-Marron.\" \"Do you want to hold her?\" Rachel asked. Frank took her, \"So she's Marilyn-Justice?\" \"Yup.\" \"Can I show her off to the others?\" Rachel nodded. Frank came in with Marilyn-Justice and said, \"I want you guys to meet my daughter,\" everyone ran over to him, \"Marilyn-Justice Nikki Farmer-Marron.\" \"Awww she is so adorable.\" \"I already got some great ideas for her,\" Sy said. Frank went into panic mode and looked at him. \"We'll talk,\" Sy said. \"Can I hold her?\" Sonya asked. Frank nodded and gently gave Marilyn-Justice to her. She rocked her. \"Can we see Rachel?\" Bill asked. Frank thought about it. \"Um, I don't know let me ask her and Sonya I'm taking her now.\" Hesitantly, Sonya gave her back. Frank walked back to Rachel's room and found her asleep. He shook his head and looked at his daughter and she was sleep as well. He sat down in the chair next to Rachel. He kissed Rachel on her forehead and kissed Marilyn-Justice on the top of her head. \"Frank,\" Rachel said. \"Hi.\" \"She looks just like Nikki did when she was a baby, well I only saw pictures but she still looks like her,\" Rachel said. Frank got nervous. \"Well she looks a lot like you to me, but I never seen Nikki's baby pictures.\" \"I really wish she was here to share this moment with me.\" Frank didn't say anything else. Rachel sensed that something was wrong. \"Why every time I bring up me missing Nikki you get all quiet, do you know something I don't?\" Rachel asked. He'd been longing to tell Rachel about what happened with Nikki; that she kissed him and admitted to paying to a man to send a hit man to kill Rachel, but right when he's about to tell her, he thinks about her how angry she would be so he doesn't tell her. \"I didn't know her for very long but she was very lovely,\" he said. \"Well I think you two would have been very close,\" Rachel said, \"She really liked you being around.\" Before he could say anything Marilyn-Justice woke up. She saw Frank and smiled. \"She smiled at me.\" \"Because she knows who you are and she already loves you,\" Rachel said sliding her hand down Frank's arm. \"Speaking of love, everybody wants to see you.\" Rachel's face lighten up, \"Well tell them to come in.\" Everybody got a chance to hold Marilyn-Justice but the one thing they shouldn't have done was give her to Fletcher, because he refused to give her back. \"Fletcher she hasn't ate since she been born,\" Rachel said. \"I'll feed her.\" \"Okay so you want to breast-feed?\" \"Here take her; I got to catch a ride home with Tony anyway,\" he gave her to Rachel and walked out. \"She sleeps just like you,\" Rachel said. \"So Sy was talking about some ideas he had for her,\" Frank said. \"Yeah, he wants her to come to interviews with me and guest star on T.V. shows yada yada, I think some are good but she's just a newborn,\" Rachel said. \"I don't think I want that,\" Frank said. Rachel shook her head, \"I'm not about to argue with you about this again.\" \"We're not arguing, I just don't want fame to go to her pretty little head before she can spell her own name,\" he said. Rachel didn't say anything else. 'He's right, God I hate it when he's right,' she thought to herself. \"Can you hold her for me; I want to take a nap.\" Frank took her from Rachel and start to rock her. As soon as he knew Rachel was sleep he got up and stood in the corner. Marilyn-Justice opened her eyes. \"Hi, honey,\" he said, \"I know you can't understand a word I'm saying, but no matter how mad you make me in the future I will love you forever and never let you go.\" He kissed her hair. \"I don't know what I'm going to do when you start dating. That's the bad thing about looking like your mommy; all the boys are going to want you and then I'm going to have to kill someone.\" He saw the bottle of milk on the little table and took it. This was very new to him but it felt natural, feeding his daughter. When the bottle was empty and she was burped, he sat back down. After few minutes Marilyn-Justice fell asleep and soon after Frank did too, with his daughter laying there sleep his chest.[Chapter 8] The Bodyguard: My sequel 3:20am \"WaaaaaaWaaaa,\" Marilyn-Justice cried. \"Frank, get her,\" Rachel mumbled in her pillow. \"Why me?\" he mumbled back. \"Because she's crying.\" \"Well she didn't get those strong lungs from me.\" Rachel pulled the cover off of him. \"Okay I'll get her,\" he said getting out of bed. Marilyn-Justice was still crying her he got to her room. \"Okay sweetie what's the matter?\" He picked her up out of her crib. He checked her diaper and yeah it was full. Frank placed her on the changing table and changed her. After waiting an hour for her to go back to sleep, he went back to his room and lied down. \"Dirty diaper?\" Rachel asked. \"Mmmhmm.\" Rachel put her head on his chest and went to sleep. They had been home for two weeks and barely said anything that was un-baby-related. Marilyn-Justice was 6 pounds with ivory skin, and people could see some of Frank in her but more of Rachel. She also had a head full of curly hair. Sy thought she was the perfect baby model, which led to yelling, which led to Rachel slapping Frank. They didn't talk for two days. Now Frank understands that he has to accept that a quiet peaceful life was dead and gone. He was in the kitchen cooking breakfast. \"Fletcher your ride will be here any minute, get down here and eat something,\" Frank yelled. \"I can't find my red high-tops.\" \"They're in the living room where you left them.\" \"Okay sweetie how about this?\" Frank heard Rachel say in Marilyn-Justice's room. She sang: Everyone fall in love sometime Sometimes it's wrong, sometimes it's right For every win, someone must fail There comes a point when When we exhale (yeah, yeah say) \"Here's the chorus,\" she said. Frank was leaning against the doorway. Shoop, Shoop, Shoop, Shoop be doop, Shoop, Shoop \"Shoop?\" Frank said. Rachel turned around at the sound of his voice. \"How long have you been standing there?\" she asked. Frank smiled and walked in. \"Somewhere between 'Everyone' and 'Shoop'.\" He wrapped arms around her. He leaned down and kissed her. \"Hey you two don't make another one,\" Fletcher said. \"What do you want Fletch?\" Rachel asked still kissing Frank. \"I just wanted to say bye.\" Rachel didn't say anything, she just waved. When they pulled away, Rachel said, \"Well someone has a birthday coming up in a few weeks.\" Frank sighed, \"It's not a big deal.\" \"That's just like saying you aren't a big deal,\" she said, \"And you are a big deal.\" She gave him a peck on the lips and freed herself from his embrace. \"Sure, whatever you say, well breakfast is ready and so is her bottle.\" \"Oh I already fed her.\" \"How?\" \"How else does a mother feed her child without a bottle?\" \"Oh, well okay.\" He walked over to the crib and picked up Marilyn-Justice. \"Why do you hate your birthday so much?\" Rachel asked. \"I don't hate it, I just don't think it's important,\" he said, walking into the living room. Rachel followed and said, \"Well I do.\" \"That's because you love planning parties and stuff.\" \"And I just might plan yours if you let me.\" \"No.\" \"Yes.\" \"No, Rachel.\" \"Yes, Frank.\" \"Why can't you take no for an answer?\" \"Because I don't like the word no.\" \"Look Rachel, 38 isn't a big deal please let it go.\" \"Nope.\" \"Please?\" \"Nope.\" \"Rachel.\" \"Frank.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I love you and I want you to have the best birthday ever.\" \"Just cake and ice-cream would do the trick.\" \"Well I think about it if you think about it.\" \"Deal.\" When the doorbell rang Rachel went to go get it. It was a UPS worker. \"Does a Frank Farmer live here?\" Rachel nodded. \"Well can he come to the door?\" \"Frank!\" Frank came to the door still holding Marilyn-Justice. \"Um, sign here please?\" the UPS worker asked, \"I hope you don't mind me asking, whose kid is that?\" \"Ours,\" Rachel said. \"Yeah right,\" he said under his breath, \"Here's your package sir.\" Frank took the pack and shut the door. \"What's that?\" Rachel asked. \"Nothing important, so do you want your breakfast before it gets cold?\" he asked putting the package on the counter. \"Yeah,\" she said. He placed Marilyn-Justice in her car seat and made their plates. Rachel took the package and started to open it until Frank turned around. He put the food on the counter and grabbed the package from her. \"No peeking,\" he said. \"Is it for me?\" Rachel asked. \"That's for me to know and you to find out.\" He smiled at her and she smiled back. They ate in silence until Rachel said, \"So I was thinking the other day.\" \"About?\" Frank asked. \"About our wedding,\" she said. \"Oh, me too.\" \"Well, we've been engaged for 7 months and we never brought it up,\" she said, \"We haven't even set a date.\" Frank didn't say anything else. \"So I was thinking about an autumn wedding.\" Frank smiled. \"I like autumn. I secretly love the color changes of leaves.\" Rachel laughed. \"So do I.\" \"So how about November 3rd?\" he asked. \"That's good; it gives me time to work off my baby weight. Why November?\" \"It's not too close to Thanksgiving.\" \"Okay November 3rd it is.\" \"WaaaWaaaa.\" \"I got her,\" Frank said. Frank was helping Fletcher with his homework when Marilyn-Justice started crying. \"I'll get her,\" Fletcher said. \"No you work out your math problem, I'll get her.\" When he got to her room she already stopped crying. He looked into her crib and saw something odd about her. Her face was light blue. He put his finger under her nose and he didn't feel any air. \"Fletcher, call 911!\" he yelled. \"For what?\" he yelled back. \"Marilyn-Justice isn't breathing!\" \"What!\" Rachel said running into the room. She was coming from her private gym. \"The paramedics are on their way,\" Fletcher said. The paramedics came in about 4 minutes. They were at the hospital waiting in the waiting room. \"Parents of Marilyn-Justice,\" the doctor said. Frank and Rachel walked over to him. \"It was a close-call but we got her breathing again,\" he said. \"Close-call?\" Rachel asked, \"You mean she almost died?\" He nodded. \"Well what was wrong with her?\" Frank asked. \"Turns out your little trooper has asthma.\" \"What?\" Rachel said. \"Now what happen before you knew she wasn't breathing?\" the doctor asked. \"I was helping Fletcher with his homework in the next room when I heard her crying,\" Frank explained. \"Well that cry saved her life. It took just enough air long enough for us to get to her.\" \"When can we take her home?\" Rachel asked. \"Well we are going to keep her overnight for observation but you can take her home first thing tomorrow morning,\" he walked out of the waiting room. Rachel started crying. Frank pulled her into his arms and said, \"It's okay. She's okay.\" Rachel still kept crying. \"I'm her mother how could I not notice.\" \"You couldn't have noticed. These things just happen.\" What he said didn't help her, she still blamed herself. When they went to see her she was wearing an oxygen mask and Rachel started crying some more. That day was the worst day of her life.[Chapter 9] The Bodyguard: my sequel Rachel refused to leave Marilyn-Justice's room when they brought her home in the morning. \"Rachel, you should eat,\" Frank said. \"No,\" she said flat out. \"Nothing is going to happen while you eat, trust me,\" he said. \"You don't know that.\" \"Yes I do. I know everything.\" \"Did you know that our daughter had asthma?\" she said coldly. \"No, but I know now, and I know everything is going to be okay,\" he put his hand on her shoulder. \"Just bring my food to me, I'm not leaving her,\" she said. \"You are going to have to come out of here sometime.\" \"No I'm not.\" \"So you're going to sleep in here?\" \"If I have to, then yeah.\" \"Then who am I going hold when I fall asleep?\" \"Do what you did before you met me.\" He was tired of arguing with her. \"If your food gets cold, don't blame me,\" he said walking out the room. 'He just doesn't understand,' she thought. Eventually she left the room, but only to get herself a blanket and a pillow. After a few hours everybody was sleep, except Frank. He wanted to wait until Rachel was asleep. When she finally did he carried her into the bedroom so she can sleep comfortably. Then he slept in Marilyn-Justice's room. In the morning Rachel panicked when she realized she was in her bed. She got to the baby's room and saw the most beautiful sight. She saw Frank sleeping in the rocking chair with Marilyn-Justice on his chest. Before he woke up, Rachel ran to get her camera and took a picture of them. \"You know I'm going to burn that picture,\" Frank said opening his eyes. Rachel laughed, \"Over my dead body. You two sleep just alike; mouth open, drool and light snoring but she's cuter when she does it.\" Frank got up, gently, and gave the baby to Rachel. \"I have to take a shower,\" he said. \"Where are you going?\" Rachel asked. \"Fletcher and I are going to an Angel's game, we need guy time.\" \"Well I was going to go to the shopping with Sonya to cheer her up,\" Rachel said. \"Then who's going to watch Marilyn-Justice?\" Frank asked. \"When will you guys come back?\" \"Not until late, but the game doesn't start until 4 o'clock you can go now and we'll leave when you come back.\" Rachel shook her head, \"We are going to dinner after that.\" \"Well can't you go tomorrow?\" Frank asked. \"Sonya is ready to slit her wrist right now, she needs me.\" \"What's wrong with her?\" \"Her divorce is final and you-know-who is taking custody of her son, Bryan.\" \"Wow, how she doing.\" \"Divorce is not a good color on her. But neither was you-know-who so, this will be good for her.\" \"Well me and Fletcher will just go next home game then, you go cheer Sonya up.\" \"Okay, I'm sorry honey,\" Rachel kissed him and went out the room. 3 Three Weeks Later: Frank opened his eyes to a \"Happy birthday,\" from Rachel. He took his pillow and put it over his head. \"Come on birthday-boy get up,\" Rachel said, climbing on top of him. \"Can't I just sleep through the day to get it over with?\" he asked through his pillow. \"Get up,\" she said bouncing him up and down. Frank removed the pillow and said, \"Don't start something you can't finish.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Think about what you are bouncing on,\" he said. It took her a moment but then she figured it out. \"Shut up, and get up, I have a surprise for you.\" She got off him and walked to the kitchen and Frank followed. He saw on the table, they never used, a giant breakfast. There was pancakes, hash browns, waffles, bacon, eggs, muffins, sausages, potatoes, fruit, and a big picture of orange juice. \"You hungry?\" Rachel asked with a smirk on her face. \"Who are you and what have you done with Rachel?\" he asked in shock. Rachel sat him down and put a fork in his hand. \"All for you and if you don't finish me and Fletcher will finish it for you,\" she said, \"And just like you wanted tonight I will make you a cake and Fletcher got you some sherbet ice-cream. You got what you wanted this time, but next year I'm going all out so enjoy.\" \"Thank you honey,\" he said. \"Me, Fletcher and M.J. are going to the grocery store, you have about a four hours to do what you want to do.\" She went in Marilyn-Justice's room and put her in a stroller. \"You know this will be the first time she goes out in public,\" Frank said. \"Get ready to see her plastered on magazines tomorrow,\" Rachel said. She met Fletcher at the door. \"Happy birthday Frank,\" Fletcher said. \"Thanks Fletch,\" Frank stuffed some pancakes. \"Enjoy,\" Rachel said closing the door. When Rachel said enjoy, that was just what he did. He practiced his knife throwing; he tightened the bolts on the baby's crib, and fixed the furnace. There was one last thing that he had to do before they got back was to play his guitar. He hid it under the floor boards to hide it from Rachel. She didn't know that he played nor did she know that he loved music just as much as she does. He also wrote songs, too. After they separated, he wrote a bundle of songs about Rachel. When they found each other again, he never had time to play his guitar, and he never had an inspiration, but now he does. He took his guitar into Marilyn-Justice's room and led the words flow. When he heard the door open he ran and hid his guitar and ran to the living room. \"Hey you guys,\" he said. Rachel laughed. \"Our little girl is a heartbreaker. There was at least two little celebrity baby boys trying to babbling at her and she smacked both of them.\" \"Yeah, mom had to stop her from hitting the cashier who tried to touch her,\" Fletcher said. Marilyn-Justice was just babbling away and squirming in Fletcher's arm. \"That's my girl,\" Frank said. Fletcher gave her to Frank and went to his room. \"Heartbreaker, just like her mommy,\" Rachel said, \"I'm going to put her down for her nap.\" She took her from Frank and went into the room. \"Um, what's this?\" Rachel asked coming out the room with music sheets. Frank mouth dropped. \"Want to explain?\" Rachel asked, she was about to have some fun. \"Um, Rachel give it here,\" he said. \"No, I think want to read it.\" \"No you don't,\" he tried to take it but she put it behind her. \"Yes I do.\" \"Rachel, stop playing, give it.\" \"Not before I read it,\" she took off upstairs to her room. Frank ran after her, \"Rachel, this is not funny.\" \"Yes it is.\" If she went into their room he would have got her so she kept running and Frank kept going after her. \"Rachel, stop.\" They made it back to the kitchen and Rachel hid behind the island. \"Where are you, this isn't funny Rachel.\" Her laughing gave her away and Frank caught up to her and snatched the paper from her hand. \"Come on, honey let me read it.\" \"No.\" \"I'm going to read it one way or another.\" \"And how are you going to do that?\" \"You'll see, it might not be tonight or tomorrow or in six months but I will,\" she smiled very devilishly and walked away. \"Oh boy,\" Frank said. Now I think that I have stalled long enough. NOW WHO'S READY FOR A WEDDING! Review if you are cause I sure am. Just give me a couple of weeks and I will be ready.[Chapter 10] The Bodyguard: the sequel November 3rd You Guys Are Invited To The Farmer-Marron Wedding; We Hope You Are As Excited As We Are. Enjoy: \"Dun dun da dun,\" Sonya said, popping her head into Rachel's dressing room. Rachel was freaking out. \"Don't make me even more nervous with that tune,\" her voice was shaky. \"It's okay, honey it will be over before you know it,\" she walked into her room and put her hands on Rachel's shoulders. \"How do you feeling?\" \"Like I'm going through morning sickness all over again.\" \"That is just wedding jitters. Just stay organized; hair and make-up and then you put on your dress. But first, let me get you a drink,\" Sonya said walking out. \"What would I do without her,\" Rachel said to herself. She started putting on her mascara and heard her door open. \"I'm back, but with the light stuff,\" Sonya said. \"Anything is better than nothing,\" Rachel got up and took the glass. Before she can drink Sonya said, \"Wait. I want to take this moment to propose a toast before the bridesmaids finish getting ready.\" \"Ugh, can't I just drink?\" Rachel asked. Sonya shook her head. \"Okay, hurry up.\" \"Okay I just want say that I think you are doing the right thing and that you will never end up like me because I never seen a more perfect couple in my entire life, I love you Rach.\" \"Dang, I just did my mascara,\" Rachel sobbing and fanning her face, \"Love you too Sony.\" They touched glasses and guzzled down the champagne. \"It is 12:00 o'clock, that gives me two hours to work my magic with that forest you call hair and Tracy is going to do your make-up, then the dress. Now, before we do all this, are you ready for the best day of your life?\" Sonya asked. \"Oh my God, Sonya,\" Rachel said covering her mouth, \"I'm about to get married.\" \"You need a hug?\" Tears came down Rachel's face, \"Do you have to ask?\" Sonya put her arms around Rachel and said, \"Not really.\" On the other side of the church, Frank was freaking out (and when I say freaking out I mean freaking out). \"Breathe Frank,\" his friend and best man Bruce said. He was breathing into a paper bag. \"Oh my God, the room is spinning,\" Frank said. \"Calm down, you will be married to that gorgeous woman of yours and off on you honeymoon in no time. By the way, where are you taking her?\" Bruce asked. \"I'm taking her to a cottage in Lake Tahoe, she likes the snow,\" Frank said, still breathing into the bag. \"You look like crap Frankie,\" Tony said, walking into the room. \"Thanks.\" \"Well it's true,\" Sy said coming in behind Tony. \"Shut up both of you,\" Bruce said, \"You will only make him more nervous.\" \"Let me get him a beer, don't worry you will have time to brush your teeth later,\" Tony said. \"Look who came to see her mommy,\" Fletcher said coming in holding Marilyn-Justice. \"Aw, look at my little flower girl and my ring bearer,\" Rachel said. Rachel had her hair in a bun and light weight make-up on. Marilyn-Justice had a black and red dress on with a flower crown and Fletcher was wearing a black tuxedo. \"You look so pretty mom,\" he said. \"I know right. When's the last time you've worn a tux?\" \"When I was seven at Aunt Sonya's wed- never mind.\" \"Time for the dress,\" Sonya said acting like she didn't hear what Fletcher said. \"Oh my God, this is all becoming so real,\" Rachel started tearing up for the 7th time. \"Oh no, you are not about to ruin my master piece,\" Tracy said fanning Rachel's face. \"Sorry.\" \"Where's Bill?\" Sonya asked. \"He's just got here, he said traffic was really bad today but he will rush to get dressed though,\" Fletcher said. \"Tell me why he is walking down the aisle, Rachel?\" Tracy asked. \"He was the one who introduced us and he always been like my father when I got into show-biz,\" Rachel said. \"Thanks,\" Bill said walking in the room, \"Ah why isn't she in her dress yet, the place is packed.\" \"Oh my GOD!\" Rachel said. \"What I do?\" Bill asked. \"You are overexciting her,\" Sonya said fanning Rachel. \"Opps.\" Rachel's friend Pat passed her the garment bag with the dress in it. \"Go into that room and put this on and we'll all be out here,\" she said. \"Okay.\" Rachel walked into the room praying to God that nothing will happen. \"Man, calm down you look alright,\" Henry said. \"Is my dad here yet?\" Frank asked, still with his paper bag in his hand. \"Yes he is coming up the stairs right now, now give me that bag, you don't want your dad to see you acting like a bitch on your wedding day, do you?\" Tony said. Frank shook his head and gave him the bag. A few moments later Frank's dad walked in the room. \"Well, well, well, look at my son, all grown up and about to get married,\" Herb said. \"Hi dad.\" \"Well isn't time for him to go out there?\" Herb said. \"We have to wait for Sonya to call, so we know that they are ready,\" Bruce said. \"Good, Frank, let me talk to you for a moment,\" Herb said. \"I'll pass,\" Frank said. \"Franklin, corner, now.\" Frank got up and followed Herb. \"Yeah, Franklin,\" Sy said making everyone laugh. \"Now I know that you wish that your mother was here, but we have to remember that she is here in spirit, telling me to fix you tie,\" Herb straightened out Frank's tie and pulled out a chain with Jesus on the cross, \"Your mama made me promise to give this to you on your wedding day. I wore this the day I got married and to me and your mom it means that the strongest power in the world is something we can't see. We can't see Jesus, but we feel his power; we can't see love but we know it's there and we can't see your mama but we know that she is out there in the front row, waiting for you to shine, so my son,\" he put the chain on Frank's neck, \"Shine away.\" Frank clutched the chain and said, \"Thank you dad. I love you.\" \"I love you too Frank.\" \"Hey, Herb, you should go to your seat we are about start,\" Sy said. \"Okay,\" he walked to the door and looked back at Frank. \"Shine.\" One tear came down Frank's face and her tucked the chain inside his tux. \"I love you mom,\" he whispered. The organ player sat down and played a tune for the bridesmaids and groomsmen to come out. First, it was Henry and Tracy, and then it was Pat and Sy, then Tony and Emma, after them Sonya and Bruce came down the aisle with Fletcher, pulling Marilyn-Justice in a wagon, behind them. When the organ player started Here Comes the Bride, everybody stood up. \"Bill, don't let me fall,\" Rachel whisper, before walking. The whole time Rachel was walking, she stared into Frank's eyes. They were keeping her from crying. It was the same for Frank, he trained his self not to cry but it was slipping up on him. \"And who gives this woman to this man,\" the preacher said when Bill and Rachel got to in front of him and Frank. \"I do, Bill Devaney,\" Bill said. He kissed Rachel on the cheek and gave Frank her hand. Rachel gave her bouquet to Sonya and stood in front of Frank. \"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today, in the sight of God, to join together Rachel and Frank in Holy matrimony,\" the preacher started. \"I want to start by saying a quote I heard that reminds me so much of these two, ' If you love something, let it go, if it returns it was always yours, if it doesn't it was never meant to be . Now let us begin, who has the rings?\" Fletcher walked forward, with both rings on a pillow, and gave them to the preacher. The preacher held the ring out to Frank and said, \"Do you, Franklin Michael Farmer, take Rachel Elizabeth Marron, to be your lawfully wedded wife, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, as long as you both shall live?\" \"I do.\" He gave Frank the ring and Frank slid the ring on Rachel's left-hand ring finger. Then the preacher took the other ring and held it out to Rachel and said, \"Do you, Rachel Elizabeth Marron, take Franklin Michael Farmer, to be your lawfully wedded husband, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, as long as you both shall live?\" \"I do.\" The preacher gave the ring to Rachel and she slid it on Frank's finger. \"If there is anyone who feels that these two should not be wed, let them speak now our forever hold your peace.\" The preacher waited a few seconds and said, \"I now pronounce you husband and wife,\" he turned to Frank, \"You may cherish your bride.\" Frank released Rachel's hands and gently took her face in his hand and placed a soft kiss on her lips. Everyone clapped their hands. After a few seconds they pulled away and faced the crowd. \"I present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Farmer.\" Rachel took Frank's hand and they both walked out the doors of the church. When they got into the limo Frank said, \"I love you, Rachel Marron.\" Rachel smiled and sat on his lap and said, \"I love you too, Franklin Farmer.\" She kissed him sat on the other side of the limo. \"Please don't call me Franklin?\" \"Too late.\"[Chapter 11] Hey you guys.

By the way, I will post in a few minutes, after I revise the chapter. Smooches.[Chapter 12] The Bodyguard: the sequel Saying good-bye to everyone was easy for Frank and Rachel, but driving to Lake Tahoe was hard. \"Where are you taking me?\" Rachel asked. \"It's a surprise, honey,\" Frank said not taking his eyes of the road. \"You know, this is the part of the horror movie where we bust a tire or something and are force to walk into the woods and get chopped into pieces by a masked killer,\" Rachel said, in her scary voice. Frank didn't say anything. \"Or you just wanted to marry me and then kill me.\" Know that Frank laughed at, \"You don't have to worry about that.\" After a few hours Rachel was getting more anxious. \"Please, can you just tell me where we're going?\" Frank sighed and said, \"I'll give you a hint, we left at midnight right?\" \"Right.\" \"And we have been on the road for five hours, am I correct?\" \"Yes, you are.\" \"Now, depending on traffic, we have two more hours to go. Try to figure out what places are seven hours away from Los Angeles.\" \"Is this a hint or a riddle, 'cause I'm not very good at riddles.\" Frank laughed at the puzzled look on her face. \"And that's the reason I'm not telling you.\" Rachel was getting very annoyed, but it went away quickly when she looked down at her wedding ring and realized that she was married. Frank saw her looking at the ring. He took her hand and kissed it, \"I love you.\" \"If you love me, you'd tell me where you taking me.\" \"Figure out my hint.\" \"You can't just tell me what city?\" she asked desperately. \"Nope. When you see the sign, then you will know where we are going.\" Rachel let it go for a while; just long enough for her to fall asleep on Frank's shoulder. Frank knew that she was tired because he can hear her snoring. He passed the Welcome to Lake Tahoe sign and tried to wake Rachel up. He waited until he pulled into the driveway to really try to wake his wife up. \"Rachel,\" he said. \"Mmmm,\" she groaned, \"What?\" \"We're here.\" When she heard that, she popped up like a jack-in-the-box. She looked out the car at the one-story cottage and said, \"Wow.\" Frank got out the car to open her door. \"So what do you think?\" he asked. \"This is- wow.\" \"I'll take that as a good thing.\" He went to the trunk and got the bags. \"Where did you find a place like this, we are in the middle of nowhere,\" Rachel asked. \"My family doesn't have just one cottage.\" \"But, why the snow?\" \"Because I know how much you love the snow.\" He took her hand a guided her to the front door. Before Rachel could reach for the doorknob, Frank opened the door and scooped her up in his arms. \"What are you doing?\" Rachel laughed. \"I'm nothing if not thorough my dear,\" he said walking inside the door. \"So do you want to get settled while I cook breakfast or do you want to get settled and go out to eat?\" Frank asked setting her down on the couch, \"There is a restaurant a mile away from here.\" \"I'm tired of driving,\" she whined. \"Okay, then that means that I'll cook,\" he said walking into the kitchen. Rachel grabbed their bags and went into the bedroom. Rachel realized that Sonya knew where they were going because she packed Rachel's suitcase with snow outfits. There was a few outfits in particular that she made sure Sonya packed and she couldn't wait to see Frank's reaction. After she put their clothes in a drawer she hopped in the shower. She was surprised that the hot water actually worked and it never ran out. \"Breakfast is on the table,\" Frank said, opening the door. Rachel popped her head out of the shower curtain and said, \"Okay, I'll be out in a minute.\" After eating breakfast, Rachel asked, \"So what are we doing?\" \"Whatever you want,\" Frank said taking the dishes to the kitchen, \"We can go shopping, ice-skating, go on a nature walk, anything.\" \"We can go ice-skating?\" \"Yeah, what do you think that thing is in the back is?\" \"Don't get smart or you won't get you wedding present,\" Rachel said. \"What, wedding present?\" he asked. \"More like wedding presents.\" \"What is it?\" \"I'll give you a hint, you will love it.\" \"Ugh.\" \"Do you skate?\" Frank asked tying the laces on his skates. Rachel shook her head. It wasn't a lie, but she actually loved ice-skating but last time she was still with Fletcher's dad. When Fletcher was a baby, his dad fell while skating and bumped his head and died. That time of her life was hard; twenty-two, a dead fiancé, alone with a newborn and had no job, until Bill found her and promised to take care of her. She swore after Randy, Fletcher's dad, died she would never risk ice-skating by herself again. \"You never learned?\" Frank asked surprised. \"Can you help me with my skate, it doesn't want to stay tied?\" she asked ignoring his question. Frank knew when Rachel was uncomfortable about something so he didn't push. \"Sure,\" he took her by her foot and slid her toward him, making her squeal. \"Don't ever do that again,\" she said hitting him on his arm. He helped her off the ground and led her to the ice. They spent the whole day skating. After an hour Rachel trusted the ice and let herself go. Frank was very surprised when she would do minor tricks and spins. When the sun started to go down, they got back on regular ground and took a walk through the forest. Frank showed her the tree he broke his arm on as a child and where a family of rabbits was. \"You want to do something really corny?\" Frank asked. Rachel looked at him with a confused look on her face. \"It depends,\" she said. Frank took out a pocket knife and started carving something into a tree. When he was done let her see. It read: Frank Farmer Rachel Marron Forever \"Wow,\" Rachel said, \"That is corny.\" Frank handed her the knife and said, \"You can carve the heart if you want.\" She took the knife and carved the heart out. When she was done, she ran her hand down the tree trunk. Frank came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. He kissed her on her neck and said, \"Do you have any idea how much I love you?\" Rachel turned around and put her arms around his neck and said, \"No, but I think you are about to tell me.\" \"I love you more than life, more than all the words in all books in the world, more than love itself and I bet I love you more than you me,\" he explained. One small tear came down Rachel's face and she whispered, \"It's not possible.\" \"What?\" Frank asked. \"You loving me more than I love you, it's not possible.\" \"Prove it.\" She pulled him closer to her and placed a soft but forceful kiss on his lips. Frank pushed her against a tree and tightened his arms around her. After making out against a tree for about half an hour, they walked back to the cottage hand and hand. This time Rachel cooked dinner, spaghetti to be exact. It was one of the things she knew how to make. \"So do you want to exchange gifts?\" Frank asked, sticking a forkful of spaghetti in his mouth. \"Okay, you first,\" Rachel said. Frank got up and grabbed a small box from his bag. He opened it and gently pulled a necklace out. He came up behind Rachel and put it around her neck. \"Wow, this is beautiful.\" The necklace had a heart shaped locket on it and inside the locket was a picture of her mom, dad, Nicki and her. \"Where did you find this picture, I've been looking everywhere for it?\" Rachel asked. \"Remember that day UPS came to deliver that box and I wouldn't let you see it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well coincidently, a friend of mine moved into that house you used to live in when you were little and found these pictures in the basement behind the furnace,\" Frank explained, \"So I had her send it over me.\" \"Thank you, now you just killed my gift.\" Frank stood in front of her and said, \"Well, what is it?\" Rachel was silent for a few moments. \"You have to earn it,\" she said. \"What?\" Frank laughed. \"You have to earn it,\" Rachel repeated. \"What do you mean?\" \"Frank, if I have to say it again, you're not getting it at all.\" \"Okay, well how do I earn it?\" he asked. \"You have to wash the dishes, take a shower, and brush your teeth. By the time you're done, you will be ready for your gift.\" \"Can you tell me what it is?\" he asked. \"I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you, oh yeah, you have one hour.\" \"What?\" \"Starting now,\" Rachel said. Frank didn't say anything; he just got up and did what Rachel told him to do. While he was doing that Rachel went to the bedroom and prepared his gift. \"So how is it staying at Aunt Sonya's house?\" Frank asked Fletcher. He was done with his chores so he decided to call the kids and say good night. \"Awesome, Bryan is so cool,\" Fletcher said. \"Well I'm glad you are having a good time, how's your sister doing?\" \"Oh she's fine, she was a little whiny after she realized you guys were gone but sleep now, hey Frank can I asked you something?\" Fletcher asked. \"Sure.\" \"Now that you are married to my mom, do I have to call you dad?\" he asked. \"Only if you want to, Fletch.\" \"I think I'll stick with Frank, Aunt Sonya wants to talk you, night, love you,\" Fletcher said handing the phone to Sonya. \"Hey, what ya'll doing,\" Sonya asked. \"Nothing, have the kids been causing you trouble?\" \"No, but your daughter kept hiding from me today, I found her in the closet, under the table, behind the couch, she is a real busy body.\" \"Yeah, I think she gets it from me. What are you guys doing?\" Frank asked. \"Nothing, I'm cooking, the boys are playing games and Ms. Busybody just woke up again. I think she heard your voice because I have you on speaker.\" \"You might want to try to get her back to sleep because once she's up she's up. Rachel usually sings her a lullaby, but you can't sing so it might be harder.\" \"Rachel made me a recording of her singing so it won't be that hard.\" Sonya and Frank continued their conversation, until Rachel came into the living room in her robe. \"Who you talking to?\" Rachel asked. \"Sonya,\" Frank answered. \"Oh then you can't get you present now,\" Rachel said. \"Hold on Sonya, yes you can, I did everything you asked me to do now, I want my gift,\" he demanded. \"I can't give it to your gift while you're on the phone.\" \"Yes you can,\" he said. \"No I can't.\" \"Yes. You. Can.\" \"No, you don't understand,\" Rachel untied her robe reveal her in black, see-through, lingerie, \"I really can't.\" When Frank saw her, he nearly dropped the phone. \"Frank, you still there?\" Sonya asked. \"Yeah, I'm going to have to call you back.\" \"Don't make another one.\" \"No promise,\" Frank said before hanging up the phone. He had never seen Rachel in lingerie before so I guy you can imagine how he feels. \"Are you angry that I ended your conversation with Sonya, cause if you are I can go?\" Rachel said, teasing him. Frank shook his head and said, \"You are making me a lot of things, but angry is not one of them.\" \"Do you a want to tell me about them?\" Rachel asked in a husky voice, \"Or better yet, you can show me.\" She strutted into the bedroom and without thinking twice Frank followed.[Chapter 13] The Bodyguard: the sequel 5 years later \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday you, happy birthday to Marilyn-Justice, happy birthday too, you.\" I blew out the candles. \"Five years old, my daughter is five years old,\" Daddy said. So yeah I'm five years old. I'm told I have a brain like my brother's and resilience like my father's. People would say I have a voice my mother but I don't like talking, to me it's unnecessary. I only say mommy, daddy, and Brother Fletcher and let my body language. I love to read and write. I have read the dictionary at least five times. I'm smarter than an average five year old. I hate being touched my people I don't like or know. Especially Sy, he rubs me the wrong way. \"So how's to feel to be the most famous five years old in America?\" Sy said, putting his hand on my shoulder. I swatted his hand and he quickly retracted. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Daddy?\" I asked and looked at the cake. \"You don't have to ask to eat your own cake honey,\" Mommy told me. I smiled at her. Mommy, Daddy, and Brother Fletcher knows how much I love them. Whenever Brother Fletcher is in trouble for something stupid I do my best for him to regain the things that was taken away from him; temper tantrums were my best friend until I was four, that's when a switch became Mommy's best friend. Now I just leave the begging to Brother Fletcher. \"Corner or middle?\" Daddy asked before cutting. I didn't say anything. \"I'm going to go with corner.\" I smiled at him. \"What is wrong with that girl?\" Sy asked Uncle Tony, \"I suggested that they put her in her public school so she can make friends whose parents buy Rachel's CDs, but she refuses to talk to anyone but her family and she barely even talks to them, I swear, if she was my kid, I wouldn't let her out the house.\" I hid around the corner and listened, crying until Mommy came. \"Honey, what's wrong?\" she asked. I peeked behind the corner and watched them talk and Mommy looked and listened with me. \"She's just unique,\" Uncle Tony said, \"I'm telling you, that kid is special.\" \"No, an albino raccoon is unique, that girl is just plain weird,\" Sy said. More tears came down my face and I tugged on Mommy's dress. \"It's okay, I'll deal with him later,\" she said, \"Oh I hate seeing you cry, hey how about tomorrow we go to the book store after you come home from school, would you like that?\" I nodded and hugged her legs. She picked me up and said, \"Let's go dry your face, it's almost time to open your presents.\" I laid my head on her shoulder. We went inside the bathroom and dried my face off. \"Okay princess, this is from me and Mommy,\" Daddy said passing me my first present. It was a heavy box. I tore the box open and it revealed a mixture of Barbie books and Dr. Seuss books. I could feel my face brightening up. 'More books!' \"She likes them,\" Mommy said. \"How can you tell?\" Sy asked. \"Do you see that face?\" Daddy asked, \"It's just screaming, I love my present.\" \"Well she is going to love my gift,\" Auntie Sonya said pulling something out her pocket. She passed it to me and I looked at her with a confused face. \"Open it,\" she said. I ripped the paper and it was a library card. I was so happy. \"You like it?\" Auntie Sonya asked. I got up and wrapped my arms around her. \"Well your welcome,\" she said. I let go of her opened the rest of my gifts. Uncle Tony got me a cabbage patch doll. I named her Missy. Brother Fletcher made me a CD with all our favorite songs on it. Sy (sigh) got me a make-up kit. I like it, but I don't like wearing make-up very much, at least he tried. Bill gave me a mini Barbie jeep. I couldn't stop riding it. I was going so fast that I messed up my hair. It made Mommy mad, but she got over it. After everybody left, I snuck in the kitchen and got my fifth piece of cake when I heard Mommy and Sy talking about me. \"Sy, how could you say something like that?\" Mommy asked. \"I didn't know she was listening, she probably hates me now,\" he said. \"No, she already hates you, but just because you thought she wasn't listening doesn't mean you should have said that. Why would you even think that?\" \"Wait how did you even know I said that?\" \"I found her listening and you were still talking. You made her cry and she never cries.\" \"Well I'm sorry.\" \"Don't say sorry to me, say it to her. If you aren't on her good side, then you aren't on my good side, now go fix it,\" Mommy said walking away from him. \"That brat,\" he whispered. I popped out and said, \"Takes one to know one.\" I saw the surprised look on his face when he realized I said a full sentence. \"What?\" he asked. I didn't say anything. I just walked back to finish my cake. \"So how does it feel to be five?\" Brother Fletcher asked. We were in his room passing is basketball back and forth. I smiled. \"I know, I remember when I turned five. Mom threw me a giant birthday party with my all my friends. She hired a clown and a magician; he made mom's ID disappear. Mom refused to pay him until she found it, it was so funny.\" We played until Daddy came in the room. \"Okay you two, time for bed, ya'll have school tomorrow.\" \"Just a few more minutes, we aren't tired,\" Brother Fletcher asked. \"Nope, you have basketball practice in the morning and she has show-and-tell tomorrow. Come on MJ.\" He held out his hand and I took it. \"Night sissy.\" I waved and went with Daddy. \"Mommy?\" I asked when she came to tuck me in. \"Yeah sweetie?\" she sat down next to me. \"Am I weird?\" I asked. \"No honey, you are just not like most kids, you are way better.\" I smiled. \"Do you want me to read to you?\" she asked. I nodded and passed her the new book she got me. She read the first two pages and stopped. \"Do you like Sy?\" she asked. I shook my head. \"Is it because of what he said today?\" I shook my head. \"You just don't like him?\" I nodded. \"Okay, well if he causes you any trouble just tell me and I'll handle it.\" I smiled at her and looked at the book. \"Do you want me to continue?\" I shook my head. \"Okay,\" she closed the book and kissed my forehead. \"I love you,\" she said. I blew her a kiss and shut my eyes. 'Sy is going to pay,' I thought to myself and fell asleep.

I read a really good story about Elizabeth getting pneumonia and that inspired me to watch the King's Speech. I loved it, so that is why I'm writing this story. It is set just after the end of the movie. Dedicated to ingrid-matthews, the author of that brilliant story and to my amazing beta, Bellatrix Nellie Le-Lovett. Thank you so much, both of you! Disclaimer: I don't own the King's Speech. The characters belong to the Royal Family of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, and to their portrayers in the movie. The events belong to British history and the movie belongs to the Weinstein Company. Chapter One ' I was right ' thought Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth, as she strolled arm in arm through the grounds of the grand royal palace that she called her home with her husband, King George VI. \"Well, I must say your speech was brilliant, Bertie. Barely a trace of a stammer. When you began, I could hardly believe it was the same man I married all those years ago. Lionel Logue has done you the world of good.\" \"I know you, my darling, and this is purely your w-way of stating that you were right.\" sighed the King, looking over at his wife and cupping her cheek with his palm, smiling at her. \"You see what I mean? You're almost there, Bertie, you just need a few more sessions with Lionel and you're cured.\" \"Yes. I suppose so, though I think I shall remain friends with him.\" \"I wouldn't expect anything less, darling; he saved the future of your country. You obviously have a bond with him and that can't be broken, not by anyone.\" \"Yes, he saved my livelihood, maybe even my country, but it was you that saved my life. I couldn't have done it without you, Liza, darling, I really couldn't.\" \"Oh, what have I ever done for this country?\" asked Liza, her tone half way between questioning and exasperated. \"You are the people's Queen, the mother of the future Queen. You are my w-wife and the people respect you, not only for that, but for being who you are.\" \"Technically, I am Queen consort.\" \"Technically, you are the most beautiful woman…I have ever seen.\" interrupted the King, wrapping her arms further around his wife and kissing relentlessly, her laughing all the while, just as they had in the car all those years previously. They strolled out very far away from the gravel walking path, doing this, blissfully unaware of where their journey was leading them and only realising that they had done so when they almost went flying face first into the iron gates surrounding the palace. \"Blimey, that was a close one!\" laughed Elizabeth, turning them both around to head back towards the path. \"I am afraid we got a little carried away there, Liza.\" \"Just a little, yes.\" laughed the Queen, causing her husband to stop and smile at her. \"Bertie, what are you smiling at?\" she questioned. \"You. During the past fifteen years, you laughed around four times. Now you've equalled that total in a mere few minutes. You are a wonder, Ma'am!\" ended the King, mock bowing so far that his face almost collided with the gravel. \"Why, thank you, sir!\" laughed the Queen, curtseyed so low that she lost her balance altogether and would have toppled to the ground had her husband not been quick enough to catch her around the waist, pulling her to her feet once more. They then proceeded to walk separately for a while, though judging by the proximity to each other that the couple had just shared, the few feets separation was equal to total isolation, were it not for the small smiles they threw at each other every few passing moments. The pair appeared to be drifting in their own separate worlds, but Elizabeth was brought back down to earth with rather a large bump. She thought that she had heard a click, soft though it was it was definitely there. She turned her head just in time to catch sight of a glint of silver. The woman only had a split second to react once she realised what it was. She knew she ought to think about this, to warn her still ignorant husband, but she realised she wouldn't have time. Her legs were moving once her brain had barely comprehended what was happening and she threw herself across the gravel path, leaping in front of her husband and shielding him with her body. Just as the trigger was pulled. A/N: Sorry for the shortness of the chapter, I just didn't want to drag it on too much. The next chapters will be longer, I promise. Also, sorry for the cliffhanger. It just came to me and I thought it was pretty much perfect to end the chapter with. Please review so I know how I did![Chapter 2] Chapter Two A/N: Sorry for the wait, my holiday didn't get rid of my writer's block! Again, thanks to my brilliant beta. Check out her stories, they're way better than mine! Bertie was drifting through his own imagination, his memories, both the good and the bad. He had been reliving his happiest memories, not of a childhood spent in a palace, but of turning his head over his uniformed shoulder to see the most beautiful woman in the world floating down the aisle of Westminster Abbey, her white dress flowing around her. Their brief kiss on the balcony, little Elizabeth, baby Margaret. In fact, thought the bemused King, this was the first time that he had realised it. A small moment at a summer evening's garden party, the wedding, the girls, every single joyful moment within his entire memory was Elizabeth. He smiled to himself for a moment as he thought of this, but then he saw the guards rushing to the metal bars, restraining and somewhat manhandling a man with what seemed to be a strip of thick metal. Then he felt the light weight pressing against his back and that awful, like the well-aimed shot of a rifle. He turned at the sound, his thoughts still very much on his wife, who was staring distantly at the metal of the gates. He automatically turned her around to face him and wrapped his arms tightly around her, kissing the top of her head and holding her flush against him. She held him just as close as he did her, tears dripping down her face and falling onto her husband's chest. Then her grip loosened. Upon feeling this, Bertie removed his arms from her shoulders and held her by the forearms in front of him. She was far too pale, the blood seemingly gone completely from her face. She was shaking uncontrollably and swaying on her feet. Suddenly, she swayed violently and her legs gave out completely, bringing her tumbling down to the gravel, her husband just barely managing to catch hold of her before her head collided with the jagged path. For the first time since he had noticed the effect of Lionel Logue's therapy sessions, the King was speechless. His voice wasn't only stammering, it was practically non-existant. He tried for what seemed to be a millennium to find his voice, at last forcing a stammer from his bone-dry throat. \"H-H-HELP ME! P-PLEASE HELP!\" he yelled, attracting the attention of the captain of the guards, who came sprinting over as fast as he could, flanked by two juniors coming to the end of their training. As soon as he reached the royal pair, he bent down and started shouting orders at the guards. \"Williams, fetch the King's physician, tell him to come immediately, no exceptions. Jones, down to the control team, check on the captive.\" The men dispersed and the captain turned to the King. \"Sir, the Queen must be taken straight up to her chambers. The doctor shall be sent up there as soon as he arrives.\" \"I-I'll t-take her, C-Captain.\" stammered the King, wrapping one arm around the small of her back and the other under her knees, groaning ever so slowly as he prepared to lift her large weight off the ground, but was surprised to feel that she wasn't very heavy. In fact, he had lifted little Elizabeth into her bed the other night as she had fallen asleep chasing Margaret into her nightdress and he could almost swear that his eldest daughter weighed more than his wife did now, which was extremely worrying. He half ran into the palace, cursing the many doors that separated the hundreds of rooms within the palace. He eventually reached the chambers that he shared with his wife, barely managing to evade the gaze of a sprinting Margaret. Kicking open the door to their bedroom, Bertie laid her down on the bed, being careful of the wound on her side, which, even though it was staunched by his hand was still flowing blood liberally, staining the pure white sheets a terrifying shade of crimson. His other hand reached out instinctively for hers, clasping it firmly against his chest and kissing it repeatedly, praying for time to quicken outside of the room. At long last, seventeen minutes and thirty-eight seconds later, the door to the bedroom flew open and the King's physician strode pacedly through the door, bowing quickly to the King as he entered, then running to the Queen's side. He looked to the King for permission, who nodded his head hurriedly. \"Your Majesty, this part may be disturbing for you. I will have to cut away the dress around the injury and the wound itself will be in plain view. If you wish to, I would advise you to turn your back at this point, sir.\" Trusting his physician with his wife's life, albeit slightly less than with his own, as he had on several occasions previously, Bertie obeyed the doctor's advice and reluctantly turned his back on his wife. He instinctively turned his head around several minutes later, when he heard a small subconcious scream of pain exit his wife's lips. As soon as he turned his head, an unescapable gasp escaped his own lips. From his position, with the doctor leaning over to reach his bandages, the source of the bleeding was completely visable. Unbeknownst to him, tears were falling down his face, streaking down onto Elizabeth's porcelain cheeks. He turned his back once more as his physician applied the bandages. Once he had finished, he bowed to the King once more and exited the room. Once he had left, Bertie moved back to the chair beside their bed, stroking his wife's hair once more. \"I'm so, so sorry, darling. This is all my fault. You were only trying to protect me. This should not have happened to you. Please be alright, Liza, I can't live without you. Please do not die, my darling. I need you.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter Three A/N: I don't own any members of the Bowes-Lyon family, they belong to history/present, and for the purpose of this story, the pneumonia when King George V died didn't happen. Also, thank you to my amazing reviewers, EleKat (x2!), The Scarlet Empress, bigben43 and of course, my brilliant beta, Bellatrix Nellie Le-Lovett. Five days, ten hours, twelve minutes and thirty-eight seconds had passed and still no change had occurred. Apart from the eight obligatory hours each day he spent running the country as it were, Bertie spent his every waking moment at his wife's side, holding her hand and waiting for the moment when she would awaken and tell him that everything was alright. But the moment never came. He had also had to deal with his sister-in-law's emotion. Rose, being one of the elder Bowes-Lyon children, was not generally an emotional person, as she had to be strong to deal with her younger brothers, but the sight of her favourite younger sister so still brought floods of tears to her eyes. It took her daughter, Mary, quite a few minutes to calm her. Mary had come to see her aunt as well and was also moved by her condition, but remained strongly composed for the sake of her mother and uncle. Bertie had even allowed Lillibet and Margaret to come and visit her, as he could no longer hide from them what had happened. Besides, the way that his wife was, he could not deny that they may not have another chance, though he hoped to high heaven that that would not be true. Margaret, after helping her cousin to calm her godmother, had broken her father's heart by asking the question he had dared not ask himself. \"Papa, will Mama get better? Will she be alright again?\" Bertie took a deep breath and bent down in front of Margaret, making certain that Lillibet was right beside her. \"Now, darling, Mama is going to be right as rain. She just needs a little time to get better.\" soothed Bertie, enveloping both his daughters in a hug. The truth was that, in fact, Bertie wasn't sure who he was trying to convince, his daughters or himself. That night he dismissed the governess and put the girls to bed himself, then he went and sat at his wife's bedside once more, wondering if his words would make her awaken. But no, she remained as still as ever. One morning at the end of the week, everything changed. And not for the better. The physician had been called for during the night as the Queen's condition had worsened considerably, meaning that Bertie had recieved no sleep as he had switched between controlling the media coverage of the situation and calming Lillibet and Margaret as they heard of their mother's worsening condition. At last, in the early hours of the morning, Bertie retreated to his wife, to find the doctor looking over her worriedly. \"Doctor, what has happened?\" asked the King, running over to his wife and grasping her hand. \"Sir, I've conducted some tests and I have to say that the results have not come back all together positive.\" \"Why, what has happened?\" \"Well, the wound is healing nicely, but I regret to inform you that the Queen's lungs have become quite congested, which indicates only one thing.\" \"Pneumonia.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter Four A/N: Thank you to my reviewers, EleKat and Frog1 (cool name by the way!). Also, this is not beta-read, so forgive any mistakes. Time stopped for the King. He turned to his unconcious wife and his mouth opened wide in shock. He hadn't noticed before, but now it all made sense. His wife had been weak and tired for months, her eyes had lost some of their sparkle in sadness, and she had paled considerably. She never complained, poor soul, and if he did ask, she just simply replied that her duties were draining her. He had never even expected this. It also explained why she was so light to carry after she had saved him, lighter than Elizabeth, barely heavier than little Margaret. How could he have not known?! Tears began to fall uncontrollably from his eyes, streaking down his wife's face as they fell. The doctor bowed out of the room to give the king some privacy. \"My God, Liza, I am so sorry.\" breathed Bertie, stroking her brunette waves as they fanned around her on the pillow. He did that every morning when he awoke, stroked his wife's hair until she awoke, wrapping her arms around his neck. But she did not. Her eyes remained closed, her hands unmoving. Suddenly, a noise from the door made him start. He turned, prepared to tell the fretting housekeeper that he would stay with Her Majesty for the night, but instead of grey hair and fading green eyes, his gaze was met with brown curls and chestnut eyes. \"Lillibet?\" he asked, his eyes straining a little to see his daughter through the darkness. \"Darling, why are you awake at this hour?\" \"I was worried, Papa, I'm terribly sorry to disturb you.\" she whispered, turning to return to her bed. \"No, Lillibet, don't be silly. Come here, darling.\" he beckoned, rising from his seat to embrace his daughter. \"Now, why are you so worried, darling?\" he asked, his tone of voice very soft and considerate, his stammer lost in the moment. \"I worry about Margaret a little. She's quite the soldier, but I can see that she is hiding how sad she really is. She doesn't play with her horse any more, or run about the palace, or even ask for a story at night. She just sits with her doll, holding her with barely any interest whatsoever, and when Mrs. Crawford told her that she must go to bed, she went straight away, without a complaint. She won't answer me when I ask, but I know she is worried about Mama. She's so young, she doesn't quite understand what is wrong with her. In truth, neither do I.\" Lillibet's speech came to an end quietly, while her father looked on sadly. \"Do you want to see Mama?\" he asked, stroking his young daughter's cheek. \"Yes please, Papa.\" whispered the young girl, taking her father's hand and walking in step with him to her mother's bedside. Bertie resumed his position on his chair and pulled Lillibet onto his lap. Her tearful face immediately broke into a sad smile. \"Hello, Mama.\" said the young princess, reaching for the Queen's hand. \"It's me, Lillibet. I'm sorry to be up so late, but I just wanted to see that you were alright, and for you to see that we are as well, although we miss you terribly. Don't worry, I am doing my best to keep Margaret on the straight and narrow, but she desperately wants to see you well again, as do Papa and I. Please get better soon, Mama. I love you very much and Margaret will send her love as well. Goodnight, Mama.\" she finished, bending down to kiss her mother's cheek before rising from her position on her father's lap, kissing him on the cheek as she went. \"Goodnight, Papa.\" she whispered, walking tiredly through the door to return to her bed. \"Goodnight, Lillibet.\" he replied, walking after her, intending to put Lillibet to bed himself, stopping in the midst of the room when he heard a small rustling sound coming from the direction of the large curtains. He sighed and turned in the direction of the sound. \"Margaret?\" he called quietly, smiling a little when the small girl appeared. \"I'm sorry, Papa.\" she apologised quickly, thinking that she was in trouble. \"Come along, Margaret, darling. It's time to be in bed.\" he said simply, reaching out the hand that wasn't clutching Lillibet's towards his younger daughter. She took it gladly, rubbing her eye with her other hand, before turning back towards the bed. \"Get well soon, Mama.\" A/N: Review please. I wrote the majority of this earlier today and it isn't beta-read this time, so please give me feedback.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five A/N: Thanks to my brilliant reviewers, EleKat and LittleLestrange67. You're both stars! Bertie was irritable for the majority of each day that he spent running the country, but on that particular one, he was even more so. The man truly hated the idea that every day he spent in his office, looking over files and signing paperwork, was a day that his Liza could completely recover and be back to normal by teatime, while he could not be able to attend the moment to hold her hand. On the other end of the scale, any day she could very well take a turn for the worst. Any day could very well be her last. As he could do nothing about it, his duties having to come first while the country was so deeply immersed in war, Bertie had made a pact with himself that he would rush home every evening and go straight to her. So that is what he did. The man walked briskly up the staircase towards the quarters where his family lived, just about managing to restrain himself from taking the carpeted steps two, even three, at a time. He was desperate to see his wife, as he had been detained for almost three hours, sorting out a national crisis with the army fighting in Austria. He pushed the door of his bedroom open, preparing himself with a sigh to see his pale, unmoving wife lying still on the bed. But that was not what he saw, when he looked towards the white silk sheets of their marriage bed, as that was all that was there. The sheets. Bertie's heart almost stopped as his mind flew through the possibilities. She could have taken a turn for the worst, as he had feared. She could have been taken to a private hospital for further treatment. She could even be... ' No! ' he told himself sternly, not willing to allow those kinds of thoughts to run through his mind, not until he knew for sure. Forcing himself not to give in to the panic of his mind, Bertie left the room once more, taking off in the direction of the first place he thought of; his daughters' nursery. He didn't know why his mind had directed him to that place in particular, there was just something in the depths of his thought processes that told him that the room would lead him somewhere, would lead him closer to discovering where his wife had disappeared to. As he walked through the last winding corridor to the girls' nursery, he heard a hushed voice from within. More curious than worried, the man gently pushed open the door. Then he paused at the doorway, mouth gaping in shock. There were his two little girls, perching as usual upon the edge of young Elizabeth's special chair as they listened intently to their bedtime story, beaming at the last page of the time familiar tale. Their horses were resting on the wall beside the door, and their toys were littered across the floor, something that the girls never allowed to happen unless there was just cause for such excitement. Which, as far as Bertie could see, there certainly was. The cause of the girls' excitement was sitting comfortably in the chair opposite them, with a book of fairytales open across her knees, as the end of the story was revealed to the girls, who had probably heard it one hundred times, yet still they never tired of it. \"And the prince and his princess, Cinderella lived together happily ever after.\" concluded Liza, his Liza, looking up to see both girls with their heads leant back against the chair. She smiled at this, reaching over to them and tucking a blanket around their shoulders. She would rather do anything than disturb them, not when they were already so peaceful and quiet, and when they had been through so much. Instead, she sat by their side on the chair, stroking their hair and sighing in contentment. Finally, after five minutes of gazing his wife as she watched over their daughters, Bertie decided he could stand it no longer, and stepped further inside the room. \"Liza?\" he asked, feeling a tiny amount of guilt as she started, jumped and turned. But the guilt was short lived, as he saw the look of utter joy on his wife's face, one that was replicated on his own as she walked towards him and collapsed into his arms. Bertie stiffened in fear for a moment, before he realised that she had melted into his arms out of pure relief, not for any other reason. Knowing this, he held her back, wrapping his arms so tightly around her back that he thought she not be able to breathe until he pulled away, but she did not seem to mind. Anyway, he could not let her go for fear that she would just fade away, for fear that this was just a dream and that he would wake up by her bedside once again. \"I can hardly believe you're here, Liza. It's like a dream that I don't want to wake up from.\" Bertie admitted to his wife, speaking slightly over her shoulder in his reluctance to let her go. \"Well, you don't need to let me go, Bertie, because I'm not a dream. I'm here, I'm well, and I am not going away again.\" Liza reasoned with him, stroking his cheek tenderly as she did so. He allowed to do this for a moment, before reaching up his own hand and covering hers with his. \"I know that you won't go away, my darling, because I won't let you. I will never let you be hurt again. I promise you.\" With these words and a smile on each of their faces, Bertie and Liza walked hand in hand towards their bedchambers, leaving their two daughters behind, beaming ear to ear in their sleep. Little did they know, but there was one more smiling person on the scene. In the gardens, a mere twenty feet away from the palace, a figure cast in shadow watched the family's joy, a rifle clutched in their hand. And not at all for the first time. A/N: Spooky! Please review for me![Chapter 6] Chapter Six A/N: Thanks to EleKat and daydreaming87, my brilliant reviewers for the last chapter. For the first time since the terrible incident, now some two months ago, Elizabeth ventured out into the palace gardens. Before she had come out, she had been more than a little scared, but had overcome the fear very quickly, telling herself sternly that she was being ridiculous. ' After all ,' Elizabeth had thought. ' There are men out there facing the Jerries, and I am worried about taking a step out into my own garden . This is ludicrous .' So, the Queen had fetched the girls and walked out into the bright sunlight, smiling widely as the light morning breeze rustled through her hair. It had been so long since she had been outside, long enough that she had almost forgotten how lovely it felt to walk on a lovely spring morning. The laughter of her two daughters broke the woman's thoughts, as she turned her head to see Margaret turning cartwheels on the lawn, her dress riding right up past her knees as she did so. Lillibet, though she looked sorely tempted to, was not discouraging the girl, instead watching her with a joyous laugh. This was a wonderful thing for the elder Elizabeth to see that the child was not utterly serious for every moment of the day. She was, after all, still so young, and should not be so duty bound at her age. She was just a free spirited child, like any other. No sooner had the thought of free spirits crossed her mind than a pained scream echoed from across the garden, and Elizabeth turned to see the freest spirit she had ever known, lying in a crumpled heap on the grass. With a tiny gasp, the woman took off down the lawn, kneeling down on the stretch of green as she reached the pair, seemingly not caring that the pastel colour of her dress was being marred by the fresh dew on the grass. \"Oh, Margaret, darling! What have I told you about cartwheeling on the lawn after it has been raining?!\" Though her words were relatively strict and lecturing, her tone was not, and it was not long before the stern look on Elizabeth's face, the only stern thing about her, faded away, to be replaced with only a look of concern. \"Have you hurt yourself?\" \"A little bit, I think.\" the young girl responded, gently prodding at her ankle. From the look on the child's face as she did so, she had hurt herself a little more than a bit. \"Oh, darling. Come, hold onto me and we'll get you across to the bench on the patio. Come along, darling.\" Elizabeth instructed with a comforting tone, bringing Margaret up into her arms and carrying her across to the forest green garden bench, though doing so rather awkwardly, due to the slight agitation of her gunshot wound. \"Are you alright, Mama?\" Lillibet asked of her mother, a look of concern flashing across her delicate features. \"Perfectly.\" the woman responded, pushing a stray curl away from the younger girl's face. Sometimes, she felt that she had laid too much responsibility on her firstborn's shoulders, purely by giving the baby her own name to live up to. \"What is happening here, then?\" came a sighing voice from the direction of the house. The voice belonged to an exasperated looking Bertie. \"Our little Margaret decided to turn a cartwheel on a water logged lawn. I think she may have twisted her ankle.\" Elizabeth explained, standing from the bench on which the young child was perched, wincing in pain as her foot was agitated. \"Oh, dear.\" the man responded, his voice very clearly laced with sympathy as he examined his young daughter's foot. \"Well, you see, Margaret, this is why you ought to listen to Mama. She does know what is best for you, and she knows how to stop things like this from happening. So, whenever Mama asks you to do something in the future, you must listen to her. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, Papa.\" the girl replied meekly, her head bowed a little to show that she was truly apologetic, with a pouting in expression on her face. Neither of her parents could find it in their hearts not to forgive them, an incredible talent that both girls had acquired over the years, though Elizabeth no longer really used it the technique, as she believed herself too mature to do so, and had little cause to. \"Good. Now, let's all go inside.\" the man suggested, causing the whole group to stand and begin to return back to the palace, Bertie having picked Margaret up, swinging her around in his arms in an attempt to make her forget about the pain she felt, and Elizabeth holding onto the hand of her namesake daughter. It was the young Elizabeth that had been the first to notice. She had stopped dead in her tracks, staring out at the trees edging the garden, her eyes wide open in fear and her face as pale as a ghost's. \"Lillibet?\" her mother questioned near immediately, as, being the one holding her hand, she had been the first to notice the girl's odd behaviour. \"What's the matter, darling?\" \"Mama, I saw someone in the bushes. I saw something move. I think there's someone in there.\" the brunette whispered into the elder's ear. All at once, memories of the previous two months flooded her mind, flashing before her eyes as she glanced towards the trees. It was happening again. Barely taking the time to think about it, something she had recently been doing more often than not, the Queen took her daughter's hand and bolted for the door, prompting her husband to do the same. They had hardly shut the door behind them when a terrifying sound came from the gardens. It was a sound that was familiar to them all, far too much so for Bertie and Elizabeth. It was the sound of a gunshot. A/N: Uh oh, once again. I'll try and update soon, so please review![Chapter 7] Chapter Seven A/N: Thanks to daydreaming87 for reviewing. The evening after the near miss of another assassination attempt, Bertie and Elizabeth lay together in their bed, embraced in each other's arms as a means to remain strong, not only for themselves, but for all of Great Britain, including their fretful daughters. The girls had taken many hours to become settled, as Lillibet had been so worried about the man she saw amidst the trees and Margaret fussing about the awful pain in her ankle, but they had eventually succumbed to the peace of slumber, something their parents were unfortunately unable to do. For a reason she could not place her finger on, Elizabeth suddenly felt tears wet her face, flowing from her eyes and blurring her vision. The moment she felt this, she bit down on her lower lip, in an attempt to stop herself from sobbing, as she did not want Bertie to be disturbed. ' He is under enough strain as it was, without adding my silly fears to the mix. ' she admonished herself, sighing through her bitten lip. Unfortunately, for all her efforts, her sigh was intercepted by a shivering sob, and the King finally looked down towards his wife, noticing at last his wife's delicate state. \"Liza? What on earth is the matter?\" Despite the importance of the situation, the woman could not help but notice that her husband had not stuttered in the phrase, as he had used to do. Lionel Logue must have done him more good that she had expected, even after the broadcast at the beginning of the war. \"It's nothing.\" she responded, her words being betrayed by the tears brimming in her eyes. Bertie did not buy the façade for one moment. \"Liza? Tell me.\" the man responded. This time, Elizabeth knew there was no room for arguments. Bertie was a loving man, gentle and kind, but when he used the certain tone of voice he had just done, she knew that there was no chance that she would be able to remain silent. \"I just don't know why they are targeting us, that's all.\" she told her husband, speaking so quickly that he almost did not catch the majority of the sentence. However, from what he heard, the man had got the gist of it. \"I'm just a little scared. Not so much for me, but for the girls, and for you. I don't want to risk any of you being taken away from me.\" Bertie, understanding her concerns immediately, wrapped his arms even tighter around his wife, kissing her cheek as he did so. He knew how she felt all too well, as it was how he had felt for the past two months, while he was still unsure whether his love would live or die. \"Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Windsor… I will never let that happen. Not to you, or to the girls. I will protect you, I promise.\" The words held so much meaning and emotion in them that the woman nearly started sobbing afresh. Luckily, years of being brought up under strict guidelines in her household allowed her to keep the pain under control. \"Thank you. And that you don't even need to ask whether I would do the same, because you know I would do so in a heartbeat.\" she responded, holding him closer to her, as if to reinforce her promise. \"I know you would.\" he responded to her, with not a note of lying. After all, there was no cause to do so, so why should he even try to? His wife had always been truthful, with important matters at least, and she would never even consider lying about something concerning their darling daughters. \"Do you think that it will be alright, Bertie?\" Elizabeth asked. She hated showing weakness, even if there was cause to do so, because, through after all their struggles with his stammering, she had always been the strong one of their pair. She hated allowing herself to give into the waves of emotion that flooded over her, but sometimes she just had to do so. \"I do think so, yes. I can't say for sure of course, but I do believe that we will come through this. After all, this country has been through worse than this before, as have we personally. We can do this, Elizabeth, I know that we can.\" Bertie used his best efforts to convince his wife, as he knew that she was very set on what she believed after she was convinced of it. However, she seemed to be listening, and seemed to be very aware of how much he believed in what he said. \"I suppose that you're right.\" she told him, leaning further into the man's comforting embrace. \"We Windsors have been through two wars that spanned all of Europe, one that we are still fighting at this very moment. We can stand strong through something as terrible as this if we have fought through all of that.\" Their conversation finished, Bertie and Elizabeth settled back into the pillows of their bed, their shoulders feeling lighter, as they had confessed what was bothering them to each other, sharing the burden of such a dangerous time between them. \"This is how we have survived all these years, you know, Bertie?\" Elizabeth told him, after a few minutes of blissful silence. \"Not by status, or by wealth, or by notability. Just by staying together, supporting each other. We survive by being a partnership.\" \"Yes, we do. And this is a partnership I shall trust for all my life, and with my life, for however long that may be.\" Bertie finished, leaning over to kiss his wife chastely on the lips. That night, the pair slept peacefully, all worries of the man from the trees gone from their mind as they dreamt of a country not tarnished by war. They had not seen the man hidden behind the wall beneath their bedroom window. That night, the mysterious figure would strike at their hearts. A/N: Ominous! Please review![Chapter 8] Chapter Eight A/N: Thanks to daydreaming87, Twinsfan725 and moran87, my great reviewers. Also, I would just like to mention that I know that this occurrence does not follow fact, but forgive me for that! When they woke early the following morning, both Elizabeth and Bertie could feel from deep within them that something was not as it should be. Something was wrong. There seemed to be an air about the palace, an air of fear and anxiety, one that the couple, at this point in time, could not put a finger on. Still, they knew that it was present, and that was terrifying beyond belief. It took only a dozen minutes at most from the time they had woken for the king and queen to rise from their beds, no longer able to forgo discovering what had happened to make them feel so alarmed. Whatever it was, it could not be something small, and that was another danger that they could not afford to have, not with things in the world as delicately balanced and violent as they were. Becoming a little more nervous with each second that passed by, the pair acquiesced to split apart from each other, in an attempt to cover ground in the palace quicker. Bertie took the downstairs rooms and the gardens, to see if something had occurred to do with the war, or with Churchill, while Elizabeth took the upstairs, to ascertain whether something had happened to their family, or somewhere within the household. Unfortunately, and to the horror of both parties, it was Elizabeth who found the answer to their question. Bertie had been ascended a gilded staircase at the forefront of the palace when he had almost been knocked back down it by a running flash of green dress and brunette curls. He was about to protest when he found that the woman who had tumbled into his arms was, in fact, his wife. \"Liza? What's happened? What's the matter\" Bertie asked, his words all merging into one another in his haste to discover what had happened. It took Elizabeth a few minutes to gather her bearings enough to be able to answer. \"It's Lillibet.\" the woman answered, her breathing still quickened and fearful for the girl. This brought the king's own fear to a much higher pitch. \"I went upstairs to check on the girls, it was the first thing that I did. Margaret was there, but Lillibet had disappeared in the night. None of the servants know where she is.\" By the end of her explanation, Elizabeth had begun to sob, the terror for her namesake child evident in her actions. Although his own fear was just as severe as his wife's, he could see that she needed him, and that was his priority as the moment. \"Oh, Liza.\" he sighed, kissing the top of the woman's head as tears welled up in his own eyes. His Lillibet, stolen in the night. Whoever had committed such a terrible crime, they could not have had good intentions in mind, as they would not have done so if they had. This terrified the king more than he had believed possible. The only thing that truly mattered to his family, and he was not about to lose his daughter, as he had almost lost his wife. \"What are we to do, Bertie?\" she asked, her head rested on the man's chest, when he held her tight to him. \"If she's been taken away from us, if she has been hurt…\" \"I won't allow that to happen.\" he assured his wife, cutting her off mid-sentence by pressing two fingers to her lips. \"I promise you that I will never allow that to happen, to any of us.\" \"But what if it has already happened?\" she questioned the man, pulling her head abruptly from his chest, her face in a state of confusion, mixed between pain and anger. \"You can't change the past, Bertie. If Lillibet has already been hurt, or God forbid even killed, there is nothing even the King of Great Britain can do about it. So, don't make me a promise you may not be able to keep. I won't allow my heart to be broken again.\" Much to the surprise of even herself, the woman turned on her heel and began to ascend the grand staircase, leaving her husband alone and aghast in the foyer. He had understood that she would be upset, he had known that the moment she had informed him of the terrible situation, but he had thought that they would stick together in this. Evidently, she had not felt the same, as she would not have run away from him if she had. ' Perhaps this has finally pushed her too far.' the man thought, seeing this to be the only rational explanation for her strange behaviour. ' So much has gone wrong over the past couple of months, there has been so much danger in the world, and now it has struck right at the heart of the family. Our own daughter. If she has been completely taken from us, my Liza will never forgive herself, or forgive me. She will be destroyed.' With a sigh, Bertie ascended the staircase, turning, contrary to what his mind told him, to his right. He knew within a heartbeat where he was going, as he visited the room every night. Knowing Liza, she would have also sought refuge in the place. As he reached the door of the room, the man was not surprised to find that it was open, neither was he surprised that there was a brunette figure sat on the floor, a rag doll embraced tightly in her arms. The woman was acting as if she could not let the toy go, as if she were clinging to it for her own life. \"Do you really think that we will get her back?\" Elizabeth asked, her voice cracking with the tears she cried. \"I know that we will.\" the man sighed, leaning down to wrap his arms around his shaking wife. \"So long as we stay together.\" A/N: I needed to bring it back to the love at that point. Don't worry, they will stay together. Please review![Chapter 9] Chapter Nine A/N: Thanks, as always, to daydreaming87, and to Twinsfan725 and moran87, for reviewing the previous chapter. For a week now, a large number of the police services had been attempting to track down young Princess Elizabeth. As the heir to the throne of the Commonwealth Nations, her safety was extremely important, and the order of the king was just as important, especially when backed up by the queen and Mr. Churchill, as well. Unfortunately, their efforts were fruitless, and they were no closer to finding the princess, in truth, then they had been seven days earlier. Over this time, Bertie and Elizabeth had been growing more and more fearful, trying to strike a balance between keeping the calm across the country, whose succession had been put into jeopardy, and preventing Margaret from becoming too scared, as she was terrified of something happening to her elder sister, while still attempting to lead the search for the girl. It was a difficult torch to bear for the both of them, particularly for the Queen, who felt that it was somehow her fault that her daughter had been stolen from them, but both were determined not to rest until they had found Elizabeth and she was safe and sound in the family home, a hope that was shared by the whole of the Commonwealth, who prayed for the girl to be returned to them. All that could be done now was to wait for the police to accomplish their task, and ask the Lord that it would not take long for them to do so. One evening, at the dinner table, the family had gathered by candlelight to eat, as they had been too busy during the day to do so. The regent queen had gone to bed, more than a little fearful about her granddaughter, and David had never sent word either way about his attendance at the dinner, not bothering to even contact his own family when, not only the princess, but his own niece had been abducted. Both of the royal couple knew that he had probably cared more about his darling Wallis than he did about young Lillibet. The three of them had sat in silence for a considerable amount of time, eating their food, but not really enjoying it. Even Margaret, who had been given a generous helping of chocolate cake for her pudding, did not seem to be happy enough to relish the indulgence of the dessert, which she was never usually allowed to have except for her birthday, as she was far too worried about the fate of her elder sister to do so. When the girl had been sent to bed, as the clock had struck nine o'clock, far too late for such a young child to be out of the nursery, Bertie and Elizabeth shared a knowing glance, as both of them had noticed the substantial amount of pudding left in the bowl. The pair knew exactly how terrible Margaret was feeling, and that she was far too young to understand that none of the occurrence was her fault. \"She just wants Lillibet to come home, you know?\" the brunette pointed out, sighing a little as she talked of the ordeal their family had been through. She had hardly gotten any sleep since the girl had gone missing, instead choosing to sit in a chair beside Margaret's bedside, for fear that they may return to take the girl away. \"I do.\" the man answered, doing the same as he glanced towards his wife, the sympathy in his eyes for his wife as clear as their shared pain at speaking of the circumstances. \"I also know that that is all that we want as well, that everyone in the nation wants. And I hope that we will get what we wish for soon.\" \"So do I.\" Elizabeth responded immediately, a sad smile on her face, though she felt that she was about to cry, hardly able to restrain the hurt that she felt. \"Every day without her, I become more and more fearful for her life, for all of our lives. It terrifies me that something could have happened to my daughter, especially when I should have been closer to her, to protect her. This would never have happened in the old house in Piccadilly, and it may not have happened if I had had a closer watch on her.\" By the time she had finished the speech, two tears had already streaked their tracks down through her make up, and another few of them surfaced in her eyes, preparing to fall at any moment. Feeling strongly that propriety could be damned, Bertie rose from his chair, crossing the room to the other end of the table and bending down to his knees before her, wiping the tears from her cheeks. \"Liza, this was not your fault, not at all.\" he told the woman firmly, clasping her hands tightly in his and raising them to his lips. \"Someone has taken Lillibet, and we are extremely hurt by this, but it is not the fault of either of us. All we need to concentrate on now is finding her.\" A smile lighting up her face, Elizabeth bent down a little in her chair, pressing her lips firmly to his, as if he were a buoy in the rapids. However, just as they wrapped their arms around each other, the door burst open, causing them to break apart just as suddenly. \"Beg your pardon, Your Majesties.\" the guard apologised, as soon as the door was open, bowing his head as was respectful to do. \"But your presence is required in the gardens immediately.\" Both of the members of the royal family stood instantaneously and exited the room, not quite sure as to why their presence was required, but having gotten into the habit of doing so, since the hunt for Lillibet had begun. When they entered the garden, they found it to be empty, except for young Margaret, who ran to her mother the moment she saw her arrive, insisting that she had seen a flash of movement in the bushes. Seeing that she was extremely tired, both of her parents ignored this, passing it off as a trick of the darkness, and so had led her inside, even as she continued to protest her case. However, the trick of the darkness had not been false, as, for the third time, the eyes that seemed to light up a little at the sight of the palace opened wide, the excitement glinting clearly in them, as their owner considered the possibilities it posed for their empire. A/N: Not again! Please review![Chapter 10] Chapter Ten A/N: Thank you so much to daydreaming87, moran87, GaspILostATooth1 and CaptainoftheUSSTardis for reviewing the last chapter. You really encouraged me! Another week had come and gone, and still they had not made any considerable progress in finding the princess, something that had made a large dent in the morale of the Commonwealth, something that could not have occurred at a more terrible time, given the progress that Germany were making in their fights against the Allied forces, who continued to stop them from taking over the entirety of Europe in conquest, as they so clearly wished to do. It had also affected the morale of the royal family themselves, which in turn had injured the optimism of the troops, something that could not have been more ill-timed. Elizabeth had ceased making public appearances, as had young Margaret, leaving only Bertie to face the crowds. This was one of the factors that made the man even more determined to locate his daughter sooner rather than later. Over the past week, he had been working tirelessly, in order to find the young girl, and had hired the most expensive team of detectives that he could, as they were renowned for being the best that money could buy. Finally, after all those hours of work, from before the sun rose to long after it had set, they found a lead. The person who had kidnapped her was almost certainly the same Nazi terrorist who had shot Elizabeth, all those months ago, and that meant that they knew where to find him. The moment they had found this valuable information, the king had sent a highly trained group of British officers to break into the small holding, along with himself, while Elizabeth waited outside the place, given that her husband had not permitted her to enter, despite her protests, in case things became too much for her. She had, of course, argued that she was not at all squeamish at the sight of blood, but he had not listened, protesting himself that she would not want to be in the presence of the man who had almost caused her death, even if he was shot himself for the act, and that he would not permit her to be in the vicinity, should such a penalty be issued. As they arrived outside of the den, which was quite obviously a rough place to hide, the king and queen stepped out of their car, hands clasped tightly together as they prepared to move in to find their eldest daughter. \"She will be alright, won't she, Bertie?\" Elizabeth questioned her husband, her face clearly showing her fear. It was very obvious that, despite the strong persona she put across, she cared about her daughters and her husband far more than anything else in the world, and you would have to be a fool to deny that fact. Not seeing himself as a fool, the man pulled his wife to his chest for a moment, kissing the top of her head tenderly. \"Of course she will. Lillibet is strong, just like her mother, and she will be absolutely fine.\" The woman nodded within a moment and pulled away from him, fisting her hand in her husband's shirt and crushing his lips to hers, something that she had not done with such passion for a very long while, given all the strife that had befallen them, leaving them separate for much longer than they would have liked to have been, though they rarely enjoyed being apart, in truth, so in love as they were. \"Come back, and bring her back to me.\" was the last thing that Elizabeth said to her husband, before he ventured into the depths of the den, and he did not respond vocally, merely pressed a kiss to her hand, as was proper for a king to do, and streaked into the place beside his officers. It could have been a dozen minutes, an hour or a century, but the Queen of the Commonwealth had sat stock still in the car that they had arrived in, as was requested by the two men responsible for her safety in this rather rough area. She had not wanted to remain still, as she feared that she would go mad doing so, but obeyed with no protest, as she saw that the poor men were only trying to do their jobs, and as they were taxing jobs at the very least, she decided that she would be a merciful woman only if she allowed them to guard her with overly complicating the process for them, especially when there was no need to do so. ' What if they don't return?' she asked herself, petrified of the answer but knowing that she would have to confront the possibility, if not for herself then for the realm. ' What if the man knew they were coming, and shot them all before they could get anywhere near Lillibet? What if he has shot her already? What if they are both dead? What if…?' Her morbid thoughts were interrupted by a crashing noise, where the wooden door had collided with the stone of the wall as it was thrown open. For a second, the woman feared that it was the gunman who had opened it, and her limbs stiffened in an attempt to stop herself from running away out of fear. However, when she saw the comforting uniform of the guards and, as another figure moved out of the shadows, cradling a smaller one in his arms, she moved from the car, not allowing herself to stop running until she had reached them. \"Lillibet!\" she exclaimed, taking the girl from her husband's arms into her own. \"Oh, my darling, Lillibet, I am so glad that you are safe.\" \"She is a little shocked, but she will be fine.\" Bertie explained, manoeuvring one of his arms so that it covered both his daughter and wife. \"Everything is going to be alright now, Eliza. I promise you that it will be.\" A/N: I think that the last chapter is going to be the next one, but I am going to be doing a story about Elizabeth and Bertie when they were younger, with the engagements and everything. Please review![Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven A/N: Here goes the last chapter. Thank you to daydreaming87 and GaspILostATooth1 for reviewing the previous one. Finally, it was all over. A year and a half had passed since the terrible incident of Elizabeth's shooting, and in the first week of May, 1945, Germany declared their surrender, meaning that, for the British fighters at least, the war was well and truly ended. She still could not quite believe that it had all ended, as the war had taken over their lives for the last six years, never leaving their minds for a single moment in all of this time. It had been far worse than the Great War, in her opinion at least, and had lasted for two years longer. The number to fall had been enormous, and they would never be forgotten in all of history. That much was certain for Elizabeth, and the woman was glad of some confidence in her life, after all the uncertainty of the past years. As the war had ended at last, Margaret and Lillibet had brightened no end, though their mother was sure that they had not forgotten their ordeals and would not do so any time in the near future, and therefore she was far more content, and so was Bertie, who walked around each day with a smile on his face, despite the weight of sovereignty still resting on his shoulders, precisely as it had done before and during the war. His work had long since ceased with the man named Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who had made such great accomplishments with her husband that she now called the man by his given name, something that she had been taught never to do, except with her family, of course. However, her husband still remained great friends with the man, and they still met up on occasion, to discuss how his condition was progressing, among other things. Though she had not known him well, Elizabeth liked to think that she had become a friend of his also, and most certainly of Mrs. Logue, who she found to be a very interesting woman, and a brilliant companion when the two of their spouses were off discussing model airplanes together. The girls had also begun to grow up, Elizabeth being of an age when she would come with them on a great deal of their royal tours, and not being far from being able to do so either. Sometimes, their mother would wonder where the time had gone, where all the years remaining of their childhoods had disappeared to, but each time she found that she knew the answer. She was losing her children to themselves, to the years and to time itself. But that did not matter. Everyone must live their own lives someday, after all, as she had done, and as they would do now. It was rather odd to think that, one day, when her Bertie was dead and gone, little Lillibet would be the queen, the position that she had held herself for the near decade that had gone by, the only difference being that her daughter would be the monarch and her husband the consort, a situation which had not occurred since Victoria, the girl's own great great grandmother. But, although it would most certainly be a brilliant experience for her, Elizabeth wished with all her heart that her daughter would not become queen for years and years to come, as her doing so would mean her father being lost to them, and if there was one thing that she was certain of, it was the fact that she could not survive for long without her Bertie at her side, and she prayed every night that she would not have to do so, as she did not even wish to try. A pair of arms wrapped around her waist reminded the woman that she was not alone in the room, and she turned to face her husband with a smile on her face, one that she saw he mirrored, once she had turned to face him. As she always did, when in private at least, she greeted the man with a peck on the lips, rather than a kiss on the hand as George and Mary had used to do, as was fitting for a king and a queen. But the truth was that, unless they had to, the couple did not think of themselves as King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, nor did they think of their daughters as Princess Elizabeth or Princess Margaret. At home, away from the crowds of the public, they were just Bertie and Liza, Lillibet and Margie. They were just an ordinary family at heart, and that was what they would always remain to be. When they were together, as a two or as a four, Elizabeth knew that her family still thought of what they had almost lost in the war, not from the forces of Hitler, but from a single Nazi gunman who had almost taken it all away. He had shot at her, while trying to get to Bertie, and that had destroyed the girls' spirits, and her husbands, or so she had been told. He had kidnapped Lillibet, and she had almost died, something that would have near killed her mother to be told. He had tried to take it all away from them, to make them feel that they were trapped, surrounded, alone. But they had never been alone, and never would be. They had stood strong through all the terror, purely because they had stood together. The Windsors had held strong through times of trouble, and she hoped that they always would, even after she and her husband were dead and gone. There were times when Bertie looked at his wife, and he saw the fragile woman laid abed, clinging desperately to life itself. Those images haunted his nightmares, they were his greatest fears, along with the same happening to Lillibet or little Margaret. But the majority of the time, when he saw his wife, he saw the strong, brave woman that he had married, the mother of his children, the queen of his country. Once, she had been shattered, but now, and forever more, his darling stood strong. A/N: And there is the end! I'm quite sad to have finished this story, but it is done. As I said, keep an eye out for the Elizabeth and Bertie story I'm going to do. I'm not sure what it will be called yet, but it is the only King's Speech I'm planning, so it shouldn't be hard to spot.

Descending the stairs outside the Logue flat, Bertie winced as a woman's scolding voice reached him. He had not supposed that gentle-looking Mrs. Logue could attain such volume. \"P . . . poor old Logue,\" he said with sympathy. \"I'm afraid he's for it.\" \"Serve him right,\" said Elizabeth primly, three steps below. \"He shouldn't keep secrets from her.\" \"But we asked him to keep them!\" Bertie pointed out. \"It doesn't matter who asked him,\" Elizabeth retorted. \"Husbands shouldn't keep things from their wives.\" She marched downstairs, while the king of England trailed after her, pondering the incomprehensibility of women.[Chapter 2] Betrayed \" Nobody wants that . . . I least of all.\" The words hung in the air as David turned away with an air of finality, pretending to busy himself with papers. Bertie stood rooted to the spot, questions crowding into his throat: How could you do this to your country? To your people? To your family? At long last, he choked out just one word: \"When?\" \"Very soon, I believe.\" David's glance flickered up, then rested on him with a studied expression of surprise and brotherly concern. \"Oh now, Bertie, don't look so shellshocked. I'm sure you'll do just fine.\" With a nonchalant little pat on his brother's arm, as one would give to a nervous child facing a school examination, he went back to puttering about with his papers. Bertie was silent. It was not just his old disability that restrained him. It was the feeling that if he opened his lips to speak, or took one step, or moved even a finger so much as a fraction of an inch, he would be violently ill all over the floor. Only his eyes spoke now, and in them was his real question. How could you do this to me?[Chapter 3] Two Sessions \". . . Who p . . . pulled her out? Little Tommy Stout.\" \"Very good, Bertie.

Logue shrugged as he closed the door. \"She's not my patient.\" Bertie attempted to picture his wife taking orders from Lionel Logue. A corner of his mouth twitched upward. \"Lucky for you,\" he remarked, just as Logue added feelingly, \"And a good thing for me.\"[Chapter 4] Lifeline \"Are you sure you're feeling better?\" \"Of course I am, silly man.\" Her voice is still hoarser than he likes, but there's a chuckle in it. \"Who would know if I didn't?\" Bertie can't answer for a minute. She sounds so much like herself again, great waves of relief are crashing over him. \"I . . . I'm so glad.\" Paltry words, but all he can get out. \"The question is, how are you?\" A pause. He thinks of the dinner ahead of him. No Elizabeth to smile soothingly at him across the table, to smoothly turn the conversation away from him whenever she senses him struggling, to turn the whole ordeal into a joke afterwards. Without her, his family gatherings are like drowning in a sea of harsh lights, and voices, and faces. \"I am . . . about as you'd expect.\" \"I'm sorry, darling.\" The warmth in her voice reaches through the telephone, feels like a hand caressing his cheek. \"I wish I were with you.\" He's gripping the receiver like a lifeline. \"I miss you.\" \"I miss you too, my dearest. But I'll see you soon.\" Bertie closes his eyes. \"Yes. I'll see you soon.\" Thank God.[Chapter 5] On the Telephone (Set shortly after the meeting at the Logues' flat.) \"Hello, is that Lionel Logue?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Dr. Logue, please hold for His Majesty King George VI.\" \"Logue? Bertie here.\" \"Ah yes, Bertie, how are you?\" \"P . . . pretty well, thanks. I was wondering if we could schedule some extra sessions before the c . . . coronation.\" \"Certainly, I can manage that.\" \"And I thought p . . . perhaps, while we're at it, we could talk some more about not being afraid of things. You know, lately I've been feeling this strange terror every time I hear my wife walk into—\" \"Oh, shut up.\"[Chapter 6] Of Curtsies and Hugs One night, when it was the girls' bedtime, Bertie excused himself from the commotion that seemed to be forever going on around him now, and slipped upstairs. He had scarcely seen his daughters since the day of the Accession Council, and something was weighing on him. He went into Lilibet's room just as the nanny was putting out the light, and quietly motioned her out. In the darkness, he sat down on the edge of the bed. \"Papa?\" asked a drowsy voice from the pillow. Bertie reached to brush the soft hair back from Lilibet's face. \"Just come up to say good night,\" he whispered. \"Are you and the ponies ready for the move?\" \"I think so.\" He caught the note of reserve in her voice. \"Lilibet, I want to t . . talk to you about something,\" he said abruptly. \"When we're in private, just the family—you needn't curtsy.\" He flinched a little at the memory. \"In fact, I'd rather you didn't,\" he added, in a lower tone. \"But Grandfather liked us to,\" the child said, dubiously. \"Yes . . . I know.\" \"So isn't it right?\" Bertie continued to stroke her hair as he thought. The last thing he wanted to do was confuse his conscientious little daughter. \"You see, Lilibet,\" he finally said, \"there are two kinds of kings.\" \" Two kinds?\" Lilibet asked wonderingly. \"Yes. One kind prefers curtsies. . . .\" \"And the other kind?\" Bertie slid an arm under her shoulders and raised her up so he could gather her to him. \"And the other kind,\" he murmured in her ear, \"prefers hugs.\" He felt her arms go around him and hold on tight. \"Papa . . .\" \"Yes, darling?\" \"I'm glad you're the other kind.\" Bertie smiled in the dark. \"So am I.\"[Chapter 7] Silence Elizabeth sat upright in her chair, holding a hand of each of her children. A silence had settled over the room. It was a silence she knew well—the silence of a group of people waiting for her husband to speak. She had seen the doubt behind the polite smiles as she'd walked behind Bertie to the broadcast booth, a few minutes ago. Most of these people had worked with the king before, liked him, respected him. And had very little faith that he could get through this speech. You don't know , she'd been thinking, as she graciously greeted the assorted dignitaries and technicians. You have no idea. All those lessons, all those hours and hours of practice, until he was hoarse. You don't know how hard he's worked, how determined he is. He can do this. Now she sat holding her breath, wondering whether she would even be able to hear Bertie's voice over her pounding heart, if he started. When he started. She felt the unease in the silence around her. Stop it , her mind ordered. Don't you dare doubt him, any of you. He's ready. It will be different this time. It will be. It has to.[Chapter 8] What Margaret Knew Margaret knew what she wanted the instant Papa appeared in the doorway. \"Now Papa tell a story!\" she called out. \"Can't I be a penguin instead?\" Papa asked. He dropped to his knees and waddled into the room, looking very much indeed like a penguin in his tuxedo. Both girls giggled, but Margaret would not be distracted. \"No, I want a penguin story ,\" she insisted. She watched with satisfaction as Papa glanced at Mama, then seated himself on the nearest chair. Lilibet would probably scold her later for bothering Papa, but Margaret didn't care. She knew she wasn't being a bother, whatever anyone said. Of course Papa didn't like to speak for very long if he could help it; everyone knew that. Margaret had known it since she was a very little girl. But she knew other things too. She knew that Papa always thought up the loveliest and funniest stories. She knew that if you looked carefully, you could see a twinkle far down deep in his eyes when he told one. She knew there would be hugs and kisses when it was done. Margaret knew that Papa really loved to tell stories. He just didn't know it himself.[Chapter 9] Her Majesty The queen mother had been invited to sit with the rest of the family at the king's first wartime speech. She had turned down the invitation. It had not escaped her notice that, even with his father gone, her son was still nervous in her presence. However she felt about that, she kept it to herself, as usual. Very rarely had she interfered with her husband's treatment of Bertie. He was the boy's father, and a ruler preparing all his children to play important roles in life, and he must know best. Now Bertie was king, and by the same token, she would not allow herself to distract or influence him in any way. He would have enough on his mind on this day; she could spare him the added burden. So she sat alone, listening to his voice on the radio. At first, it was the hesitant voice she was used to hearing. Then it started to become stronger, steadier, more confident. Its growing power was reflected in the unaccustomed emotions dawning on his mother's face: surprise, and wonder, and then, gradually, a fierce pride. She was conscious of only one thought: She wished his father could hear him.[Chapter 10] Shadow (Set after the family dinner, early in the film, where David insisted that Wallis be included.) In the car, Elizabeth gave Bertie a significant look. \"He can't be serious,\" Bertie repeated, weakly. \"Darling, I'm afraid he might be.\" \"But he can't! He w . . . wouldn't. Elizabeth, I know him. He wouldn't be that reckless.\" She laid her hand on his. \"Perhaps you're right.\" Bertie squeezed her hand and stared out the window, trying to believe his own words. He felt the presence of something like a shadow, very near him. He could not have named it, but it was there, dark and cold, and it stayed close as the car rushed into the night.[Chapter 11] Promise Elizabeth finds Bertie standing by the window in his study, silhouetted against the rainy twilight, and struggling with an obstinate lighter. She feels the tremor in his hands as she takes it from him, speaking low and soothingly, as she would to one of her children. \"Promise . . .\" he says quietly. \"Promise me, no more.\" Elizabeth looks deep into his eyes, then away, feeling his humiliation and hurt as though they were her own. But she says nothing. To make that promise would be to give up on him. And they both know she will never do that.[Chapter 12] Easy The king leaned back and folded his hands, having delivered another perfect radio address in his mellifluous voice. \"Easy when you know how.\" Bertie stood rigid behind his father's chair, trying not to let his face show that the shaft had gone home. He knew it had been directed at him. Too many such comments had been casually flung in his direction, over the years, for there to be any doubt. Easy , he thought bleakly. Dear God. Easy. The words still burned in his mind as he stepped aside to let the photographer take his father's picture. How could he ever explain what it was like to know what he wanted to say, and open his mouth, and not be able to say it? There were days when he felt eaten alive with envy of people around him—days when, God help him, he envied even his own wife and children—for doing so effortlessly what he could never do. \"Have a go yourself.\" The king's voice was still casual, but with an unmistakable undertone of command. Head bowed, Bertie came back obediently to the desk. He could not defend himself or beg off. He did not have the words.[Chapter 13] Made Glorious Summer by This Sun of York (Inspired by a Shakespearean prompt at day_by_drabble. Thanks to Haiza Tyri for feedback and help.) \"So . . . an actor,\" Bertie mused aloud. He and Logue were walking back towards the entrance of Westminster Abbey, having finished rehearsing for the coronation. \"Of a sort,\" Logue acknowledged. \"What sort?\" Logue hesitated. \"The failed sort, mostly,\" he said, at length. Bertie grimaced, remembering who had used the word first. \"I'm s . . . sorry. I shouldn't have—\" \"No,\" Logue interrupted. \"You were right. Whoever made that inquiry—he got his facts straight.\" \"I find that hard to believe. I've never known a man s . . . so steeped in Shakespeare.\" \"Ah, well, loving the words doesn't mean one can perform them adequately,\" Logue replied, a touch ruefully. \"It took me some time to learn that. Even now, I'm not altogether sure that I have.\" They walked on in silence for a moment, before he began to quote softly, as if to himself, \"'Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud: Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.'\" Bertie glanced sideways at him. \"As bad as that?\" Logue suddenly smiled, his old cheerful air reappearing like a ray of light breaking through a cloud. \"No. Not bad at all, really. I have a job that I find quite satisfying. I still get to work with the language that I love. Just in a different way than I expected.\" \"'My crown is called content: A crown it is, that seldom kings enjoy,'\" Bertie murmured. He realized that the other man had stopped walking, and looked up to see Logue staring at him with equal parts astonishment and pleasure. Bertie broke into a grin and clapped his teacher on the shoulder. \"My friend, anyone who could get me quoting Shakespeare has had a career he can be proud of.\"[Chapter 14] Looking the Part (Note: When I found out that Kate's tiara at the royal wedding was the tiara that Bertie gave to Elizabeth, I just had to do a drabble—or double drabble, as it turned out—about it. :-) A little research plus a little imagination led to this. It's set three weeks before Edward VIII's abdication.) The tiara had been a gift from Bertie, some time ago, but she had never worn it. The sweet gesture was like him. But diamonds and ornate scrolls were not like her. So Elizabeth mused as she sat before her mirror, balancing its slight but solid weight on her palms. It wasn't that she didn't like it. But—it was a tiara. And the Duchess of York was not a tiara sort of person. Her style was conservative, modest, sensible. As Mrs. Simpson delighted in reminding everyone these days. Elizabeth's lips tightened as she stared at the sparkling, alluring thing she held in her hands. Then, quickly, she lifted it and settled it on the smooth dark waves of her hair. Chin up, she gazed at the unaccustomed image in the mirror, ignoring her own uncertainty. Perhaps it was not like her, but it conveyed what she wanted to convey. Even though to whom, exactly, she wanted to convey it—to the public? The family? Mrs. Simpson? The king himself?—was not quite clear to her, even now. Until she went downstairs, finally ready to go out with her husband, and saw his tired eyes brighten at sight of her.[Chapter 15] Articulate You're the disappointing son of a brewer . . . jumped-up jackaroo from the outback . . . you're nobody. . . . The words tore themselves from some dark place deep within Bertie, spewing their poison into the clear, cold air. He strode on, though he heard Logue's walk faltering and then stopping, though he could sense the other man's hurt through the growing distance between them. Still he went on, tasting the bitterness of the irony that began, relentlessly, to force itself upon him: that the one time he had actually needed his defect, it had failed him.[Chapter 16] Trapped \"Forty seconds, sir.\" The door to the little room squeaked shut, leaving him with just the microphone and Logue, in the dimness and the silence. Silence that even their few quiet words to each other could not lift. Silence that, in a few seconds, he would have to fill. Millions outside, waiting, listening. At the back of his whirling mind, a memory stirred. Another dimly lit place—a stair landing. His brother's voice: \"Now I'm trapped.\" His brother, now safely away from all this. Bertie drew a breath. David , he thought wildly, you don't know the meaning of the word.

However, when his eye was not caught by a foreign princess, but rather by the youngest daughter of an earl, could Bertie balance love and duty in pursuit of Lady Elizabeth? Dedicated to daydreaming87. Disclaimer: Everything belongs to its rightful owners, including the story to me and its title to daydreaming87. Chapter One The time had come at last, the time when Albert, second son of King George V, must select for himself a wife, so as to further the alliances both within the United Kingdom, and with countries abroad. With the Great War scarcely ended, and partnerships once again open for negotiation, the man had more choices than he could believe. And yet, despite the plethora of beautiful, well titled women suggested to him, and his opportunity to choose any one of them he wished, he could not bring himself to believe that even one of them was the one he should call his wife. Of course, since he had been a very young man, the prince had been taught that marriage was for the advancement of their country, and that only foolish nobles would marry for love alone. His own parents had had their marriage arranged between their fathers, and though they seemed to be happy, their relationship missed the spark of passion that he had heard of in instances of true love. That was what he wanted, whether or not he would ever get it. However, when he had broached this subject with his father, he had been shot down in flames, told that his wife's purpose would be to provide him with a partner and an heir, with other children to follow if desired. With all the advancements of the world that had come in the last few decades, Albert could still scarcely believe that the archaic practice of arranged marriages still remained. But there was nothing to be done, and the choice would need to be made, sooner rather than later. A ball had been arranged for that evening at the Palace, and the man was well aware that this was merely a ploy of his mother's to try and speed up his decision. He had discovered a list of women's names abandoned on the breakfast table, which had fed his notion that the ball was a matchmaking affair. He doubted that this had been accidental, as one of the servants would have cleared it away in a heartbeat, if she had not expressly desired it to be left for him to find. Sighing deeply, Albert scanned the list, noticing the changes in his mother's handwriting, some subtle and some not so. Queen Mary had clearly taken a great deal of time with each letter of some young women's titles, her hand swirling gently over them, foreign princesses and first daughters of the richest and most important lords in the country. However, there were others that had merely been scribbled down on the page, as if they were merely an afterthought, second, third and even fourth daughters of men who were of hardly any consequence to the British Isles, women who had only been invited for the sake of appearances. Albert glanced down the list once again the moment he had reached the bottom of it, trying to find a name that would spark his interest, or even better, his affection. But there was nothing special there, it seemed, just a list of titles and names forming endless combinations before his eyes. None of them seemed significant enough to him, none of them seemed suitable, none of them seemed... right. Still, he supposed there was nothing to be done. He would have to attend the ball; it would be unseemly not to. And after it was done, he could simply tell his father none of them had been to his liking, and they could go back to the drawing board. It was not a permanent solution, and he was near certain that his father would resent him for it, but at least it would give him some more time to find a woman for himself. As the prince prepared for the evening, he wondered to himself what it would be like to be married, to have someone to rely on him, to stand by him through thick and thin, to be there with him, always at his side. Whomever he selected to be his wife would also be the mother of his children. She would need to be loving, a woman who really cared about her offspring and their welfare. Albert sighed. ' I'll never find anyone to live up to my expectations, if I have this detailed a criteria for a perfect wife.' ' Perhaps I will find someone good enough.' he thought, realising that a little positivity in the face of this challenge might be the way to move forward. ' There will not be anyone as perfect as I had wished for, but I doubt there is a woman in the world who would be a match for that expectation. Still, I suppose I should give them a chance. It's more than likely, after all, that these women will be as nervous as I am. And I can hardly pull out of the race before I've reached the first fence to jump.' Satisfied that his attitude was far more acceptable, Albert put on his brave face as he dressed. He winced slightly at the clothes he had been forced to wear, hating the pretentious nature of the ornate garments, more of his mother's work, he did not doubt. He glanced up at the clock, to see that it would soon chime seven. In just half an hour, the grand ballroom would be filled with women, one of whom could become his future wife. He scoffed slightly at the thought. ' I doubt that very much; not if I have anything to do with it.' Little did he know, the woman he would marry, the woman he would come to fall in love with, was stepping across the threshold at that very moment. A/N: I know that I have been promising to do this story for so long, but with the amount of exams I've had, I simply haven't had time to finish the first chapter. The updates might be a bit few and far between, but I'll try to put up new chapters as often as I can. Extra thanks to daydreaming87 for continuing to keep me motivated to get on with doing this story, and please review![Chapter 2] Chapter Two A/N: Thank you to hannah, daydreaming87, HorcruxCupcake, amandacrey96, FancyFreeThinker101, gretchonbad and Helenesse for reviewing the first chapter. I really appreciate it! The grand ballroom rang out with the sound of laughter and clinking glasses, all merging together to create a deafening noise in Prince Albert's ear. He was not enjoying the evening in the least; the lords and ladies were most tedious, his parents were completely overbearing and the women, in general, were exactly the same; pretty, simpering and uninteresting, almost the complete opposite of what he had wished for in a wife. Finally, the noise became almost unbearable, and so he moved out onto one of the many balconies that littered the castle, hoping for some time alone, to remember that he was a man in himself, and not just a bargaining chip to form an alliance with another important family, as he had begun to feel as he was introduced to lady after lady in the ballroom, none of whom had taken his fancy at all. ' I suppose I'll never find any woman that meets my standards.' he mused, taking a sip from the champagne flute he carried with him. He had been drinking a fair bit of alcohol that evening, not enough to be noticeable, but just enough to give him a pleasant, light headed feeling, which had been one of the only things giving him the ability to get through the tedious night. Of course, he knew that he would have to marry. There was no questioning that fact. He was a royal prince, he was expected to find a good wife and have children, to continue the royal line, should his brother not produce any. ' Mind, with David's love of women, they need only worry about his children being legitimate.' he thought bitterly. He did not know whether it was the truth or not, but his brother's action of flirting with every female in the ballroom had frustrated him immensely, another reason he had wanted to escape the party. A chill wind swept across the balcony, sending a heady shiver down Bertie's spine. Spying a set of steps leading down into the gardens, the young man quickly moved to descend them, hoping that the temperature would increase a little at a lower altitude. Of course, the gardens were far less private than the balconies, but Albert was willing to take the risk of bumping into a few strangers, for the sake of not freezing to the bone. ' Besides, others may have come out here to escape the crowds. Some of them may even be rather decent.' He must have walked half a mile through the twists and turns of the gardens before he happened upon another person. It was a young woman, sat alone on one of the cold stone benches that filled the grounds. Her gown was simple and elegant and her hair was tied up in a sophisticated manner, though not as extravagantly as some of the other women in the room. She was staring into the distance, as if wishing she could join the stars dotted around the sky. ' Perhaps I would rather do that as well.' Bertie thought to himself as he approached the girl. ' It seems a far simpler life.' He was only a few paces away from the woman now, and yet she still had not noticed his approach, too lost in her own little fantasy to realise that she was being watched. As he moved closer, Bertie noticed the finer details about the woman. She was small and slender, with chestnut brown curls the same shade as her eyes, which twinkled in the light of the waxing moon. She did not appear to be from the richest family, as her dress was made of materials which, although they had been arranged beautifully, were clearly less expensive than those of some of the other women in the ballroom, but on her, the dress seemed as beautiful as any array of silk and velvet. He hardly noticed the woman's gasp, but was brought out of his reverie when she stood abruptly from the bench, smoothing her dress down with her hands and adjusting the numerous pins holding up her hair. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to st-startle you.\" Albert began, cursing his tongue for being unable to pronounce the phrase without stammering. ' Whatever must she think of me.' she wondered. \"That's alright, Your Highness.\" she responded, her voice smooth as dripping honey, with all its sweetness. \"I was miles away, I'm afraid.\" \"You- You know who I am?\" he questioned the woman, at a loss for anything else to say which would not make him appear a fool. It was a foolish statement in itself, but foolish statements were still a little better than an awkward silence, in his experience. \"It would be difficult not to, Your Highness, given that this ball has been in your honour.\" she responded, before inclining her head towards the clothes he wore. \"Besides, you are not exactly a covert operative in that attire.\" Bertie looked down at himself to see the ceremonial sash worn over his dinner jacket, it's design marking him out clearly as a prince of the Crown. Immediately, he felt his cheeks begin to flame and hoped that the darkness would hide this fact. He did not wish to appear any more foolish than he already felt. \"Are you enjoying the party?\" he asked, trying to bring the conversation back onto a simpler path. \"It's been quite a celebration,\" the woman commented in return, although her smile looked a little forced. Bertie knew exactly how she felt; these types of celebrations were no more her cup of tea than they were his, it seemed. \"But I feel that I must be heading home soon. It's getting quite late.\" Disappointment flooded his heart, and Albert could not quite pinpoint the reason for the sudden emotions, although he did his best to prevent them from reaching his face. She had curtsied slightly to him, before beginning to walk away. He did not know what had possessed him to behave in such a way, but before he knew it, he had hollered the question across the gardens. \"What is your name?\" The young woman turned to face him, the moonlight illuminating her features and making her appear almost like a spirit, like the Lady rising from the Lake, Excalibur in hand. She was incredibly beautiful, he realised suddenly; he did not know how he had not noticed before. Her voice had the sweetness and richness and depth of chocolate, leaving him wanting more, and as she turned, the curls of her chestnut hair shone, glowing just as brightly as the stars above her. \"My name is Elizabeth.\" A/N: They've met! Please review![Chapter 3] Chapter Three A/N: Thank you to mrseljefino, katiebrown, Guest, HorcruxCupcake and daydreaming87 for reviewing the last chapter. The ballroom had scarcely been cleared from the previous night's celebrations, but already Queen Mary had begun to prepare for another to take place the next week. Normally, Albert would have objected or tried to interfere, but on this occasion, he remained silent and allowed his mother to do as she wished. After all, the celebration was his best chance of seeing Elizabeth again and that opportunity could not be passed up. He had taken additional care in preparing himself that night, wanting to ensure he looked his best. Elizabeth was a Lady, after all, if not one of the highest ranking, and he would need to make a considerable effort to prevent another young chap from catching her eye. He was dressed in a crimson jacket today, a deep shade, rich but not garish, and he wore simply cut dark dress trousers, with his shoes highly polished and his hair tamed flat against his head. It was not an extravagant outfit for such a celebration, and the ladies would certainly be vying for attention from his brother David in place of him, but Albert didn't care for the ladies. Only for one of them, one who would no more be impressed by an intricately embroidered suit than he would be by an elaborate gown. Albert felt his insides flutter like butterflies, as he thought that tonight he would be able to see Lady Elizabeth once again. He had only met her the once, and only briefly at that, but there was something deep inside his chest that wondered if she could be the one, if she was that perfect wife he had so desperately wanted. ' She is not perfect.' he told himself vaguely, something that he had learnt even after being with her for so brief a time. It was obvious in every move she made that she was different to all the others. Her hair was not twisted and turned into the intricate patterns the other ladies attempted, but pinned up simply, as if she had better things to do than to spend hours sitting in front of a mirror. ' But her imperfections, strangely, are the things that make me think that she truly is perfect.' Bertie found himself frowning at his thoughts. He had never thought of any woman the way he thought of Elizabeth. To him, they had always been swarms of titles, jewels and mindless chattering about topics no one cared about. But this young woman was so much more than that. She was the type of woman he had always dreamed of having as his wife. His thoughts were buzzing around in his mind, like a thousand moths round a candle flame, but before he had a moment to make sense of it all, he heard a gong sound. The prince could barely disguise his sigh at the evident summons, signifying that the ball was about to begin. ' Mother always makes such a grand gesture out of everything.' Still, he found himself close to sprinting down the palace steps, tripping over his feet in his haste to reach the ballroom. The hurry caused his legs to ache, a dull pain that was only a taster of the agony he had experienced in his childhood, but he found that he did not care. Elizabeth was the only one who he felt he could speak to, and he was not about to waste any opportunity to have an intelligent conversation. Bertie searched for half an hour, scanning the ballroom for a glimpse of his friend, but eventually, he had to accept the fact that Elizabeth was not among the guests. He considered retreating back to his bedroom and pretending the next morning that he had come down with a chill, but he could see his brother staring at him from the corner of the room and knew that running away was not an option; after all, if he told his story after David had seen him, nothing would please his brother more than to get him into trouble. Instead, he circled the room, making small talk with people of importance, the ones that he was expected to speak to, although he did not enjoy their conversations in the least. The only one he wanted to speak to seemed to be the only upper class lady in all of England missing from the ballroom. \"Bertie!\" hollered David, across the noise of the musicians. The younger prince sighed at his brother's boisterous behaviour, which had not changed a jot since they had been boys, although he could not contain a chuckle as his mother approached the boy and clipped him round the ear for his rudeness. Nevertheless, Bertie did approach his brother, deciding that it was most likely better to speak with him than to leave him to concoct more devilish ways of catching his attention. \"Ah, Bertie, there's someone I wanted you to meet.\" David told him and Bertie had to fight back a sigh of annoyance. His elder brother took great pleasure in trying to set him up with girls, if nothing else, to emphasise the fact that their mother had written him off as too much of a ladies' man to consider at first go. \"This is Lady Mary Bowes-Lyon, the eldest daughter of the Earl of Strathmore. A lovely girl from a lovely family, which you must already have found for yourself. I understand you are already acquainted with her younger sister, Elizabeth?\" At that moment, Bertie truly could have kissed his brother. With no surname for the girl he had met in the gardens, he had no way of contacting her, no way of knowing if he was to see her again. But now he knew her surname he could write her a letter, inviting her to come and meet him. Who knows if she would agree or not, but at least she could now make her choice. Bertie went through the rest of the evening with a beaming smile on his face, anticipating another meeting between himself and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. He could hardly contain his excitement and his mind buzzed with so many thoughts that he could hardly hear his mother's end-of-ball speech; the most prominent of all was how well her name would fit with the title of Duchess of York. A/N: Please review![Chapter 4] Chapter Four A/N: Thank you to bellovettrix, daydreaming87, katiebrown, Helenesse and Frog1 for reviewing. Bertie sighed, throwing away yet another sheet of paper bearing a badly-written letter. He had spent Lord knows how long trying to perfect his first piece of correspondence to the Earl of Strathmore's youngest daughter, but every attempt he made was more idiotic to his eyes, and he imagined would be to Elizabeth's, as well. He had never in his life met a woman who could make him, an educated well-spoken young man, sound like a stuttering little child, excepting his mother and grandmother, who had held that power over him since childhood. But even they had just made him guilty and fearful; it was only Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon who could truly make him look a fool. Eventually, a good two hours after he had first put pen to paper, and though it still was not perfected, he had written a letter that he deemed good enough to send. It was informal, a little more informal than his mother would have liked to see, but luckily enough, she would not be reading it. Dear Elizabeth, I hope this letter finds you in good health, as you were sorely missed at the ball held at the Palace last week. Your sister Mary, who did attend, did not speak of any ailment having befallen you, but I hope you are well nonetheless. In a fortnight's time, my mother has planned to host another ball, to celebrate the birthday of my brother, David. He shall, naturally, be inviting a group of his friends to the occasion and it is my wish that you would attend the celebration as well, so that I shall not be left alone with no companion of my own. I do not get on well with my brother's regular companions and I should like to be able to see you again. I hope to hear from you soon, Albert. The letter was sent in the post before he had a chance to change his mind about its content, but this did not prevent the man from fretting about it. He spent half an hour after the paper changed hands considering the different ways he could have made his point, wondering whether he should have written more formally or made the request more detailed, but after that, a knock on the door from David requesting his company for a riding session provided a welcome distraction. Or so he would have wished. Unfortunately, it seemed that this was not to be, for David had always been a perceptive man, at least when it came to embarrassing his younger brother. It took just half an hour at most before the topic of conversation turned to the party and from there, Albert had fallen unwittingly into a trap. \"So, Bertie, who will you be inviting to the party?\" David asked, smirking slightly as Albert's horse stumbled a little, seemingly reflecting the shock of its rider. \"Come along, you must be bringing someone. It becomes quite depressing, watching you milling around on your own all evening, particularly when Mother spots a suitable woman for you.\" \"I- I hadn't really th-thought of it.\" Internally, Albert cursed his treacherous tongue. It seemed to be only when he so needed to sound convincing that his stammer chose to make an appearance. Though he tried to hide it, David was smirking, relishing his brother's embarrassment, just as he always had done. \"Oh, fair enough.\" David responded, sounding a little disappointed. His ever-present smirk made him a great deal less convincing. \"So, you haven't invited the dear Lady Elizabeth to the event?\" Bertie coughed loudly, choking on the morning air itself until his brother rode close enough to clap him on the back. In all honesty, he was grateful for the time to think, as he did not know what answer he could possibly give that would not result in further ridicule from his brother, and eventually decided on the truth. \"As a matter of fact, I- I have.\" he answered and was not surprised that David's face remained completely unchanged. This was not news to the man at all and both of them knew it. \"Have you taken a shine to her?\" David asked, his smirk fading away to leave an expression of pure interest behind in its place, a rarity for a man as comically minded as him. ' He really wants to know.' Albert realised, trying to disguise his shock. ' He actually seems to care.' \"Yes, I- I suppose I have done.\" The younger man was trying his best to sound nonchalant, as if he had only a passing interest in the Earl of Strathmore's daughter, but this could not be further from the truth. She was so much more than a passing fancy to him- in fact, he wanted her to be so much more than that. \"Is little Bertie really in love? Should we hear the Westminster bells ringing soon?\" It was as if David had read his mind, a skill he had been honing ever since they were boys, but Albert managed to school his features into an expression of neutrality, riding further ahead to avoid the conversation that would have continued, had David had his way. Once he was alone, Albert found himself pondering on his brother's words. He had been joking, of course, a jest to make his brother a little more red in the face, but for Albert, it was an interesting point to consider. Elizabeth was a witty, charming, intelligent woman, but did he really wish to have her as his wife? A smile spread widely across Bertie's face, for he knew that there could only be one answer to that question. In Albert's mind, the ball for his brother's birthday could not come quickly enough, for then he would see Elizabeth again, and an all important question could be asked. All that remained after that was to see what her answer would be and Bertie could do nothing but pray that she would say yes.

A whirl of dresses and dance music passed by in every heartbeat, yet every heartbeat seemed to last a thousand years or more as Bertie awaited Elizabeth's arrival. She had sent her response not a day after the request had reached her and seemed to be excited at the prospect of another ball at the Palace. Although he was unsure, the man could hope that she was equally excited to see him again. On the rare occasions he pulled his gaze away from the door, Bertie glanced over to find his brother, David, chuckling to himself. ' Oh, how stupid he must think me, surrounding by his flock of hens over there.' the younger man thought bitterly. ' But I do not care, not really. I would rather seek Elizabeth's company than any of those empty-headed dolls.' David raised his glass and eyebrows in time to propose a silent toast to his brother; Albert often wondered if the man was aware of how patronising his behaviour could be, though he doubted he would change even if he knew. Silently seething, the young prince plastered a smile onto his face, hoping beyond hope that he would not be made to face the crowds alone for much longer. As if by magic, the liveried man by the door announced the entrance of the Earl of Strathmore, his wife and his children. There were a fair few of the children in attendance, half a dozen, leaving only three absent, but Albert only cared for one, the dark-haired girl laughing with her sister, Mary, at the back of the group. Albert had to restrain himself from running towards Elizabeth and throwing his arms around her, he felt so much relief at her arrival. Of course, he never would have done something so uncouth, not with so many people around, but the temptation was great nonetheless. Instead, he moved calmly towards the group. He inclined his head respectfully to the Earl and planted a kiss on his wife's hand, before he made his way towards Elizabeth. \"Good evening, Your Highness.\" Elizabeth greeted, curtseying respectfully to the man. Bertie had to prevent himself from sighing at the gesture; he wished that Elizabeth would not show such deference towards him. He treated her as a person, not an Earl's daughter, and wished that she could do the same for him. ' But we're different.' he reminded himself. ' I'm a Royal Highness and always will be. She has been raised to never forget that, even if she might want to.' \"Good evening, Elizabeth.\" On reflection, Bertie knew that he should have used her title, just as she had his, but the thought vanished from his mind as her smile warmed even further. \"Would you like to take a walk in the gardens?\" Elizabeth nodded her head, taking his proffered arm. \"I would love to.\" They walked, arm in arm, until the music from the ballroom was only a distant sound carried away by the breeze. Bertie relished this closeness, which would have been impossible under scrutiny in the ballroom, and had to fight not to pull her even closer, afraid of offended her. Surprisingly enough, it was Elizabeth who moved closer, lighting leaning her head on his shoulder. Bertie fought not to gasp; such a gesture would have been too intimate for a husband and wife in public, let alone an unmarried man and women who were not even engaged. \"You're thinking about how improper this is.\" Elizabeth's sudden comment brought him from his reverie. It always surprised him how well she could read his thoughts, especially since they had known each other such a short time. \"The thought crossed my mind as well, but I don't truly find I care. I've never cared much for propriety and my mother has many older daughters to teach and marry off before my turn comes around. For now, at least, I can enjoy my improprieties, before I have the training to know any better.\" Bertie smiled. Having grown up with so many rules and regulations himself, it was Elizabeth's free nature that had attracted him to her originally. He was relieved to know that she had not changed in the time they had been apart. \"I've been trained on p-propriety since I was small.\" Bertie cursed his stammer as he spoke, for Elizabeth's expression had changed. He had stammered a few times in the woman's presence, but he did not think she had ever noticed it before. Well, now she had. \"You have a stammer?\" she asked, as if it were not already clear. But her voice did not sound the same as others had done when asking the same question. Instead of scorn and contempt, he found only interest and sympathy. ' Another thing that makes her so very different.' \"Yes.\" he answered tentatively and took a deep breath. His stammer was usually strongest when he spoke of it. \"I've h-had it since I was qu-quite young. I- I can hardly re-remember a time w-without it.\" \"I find it rather endearing, to tell the truth.\" Elizabeth told him and Bertie could not help but smile at that. \"But it must be so awful for you. When you've such scrutiny put on you by the public, when people make up falsehoods against you and there's nothing you can do to defend yourself.\" \"That's the curse of royalty, I suppose.\" Bertie commented light-heartedly. But Elizabeth did not appear light-hearted. In fact, she looked quite the opposite. \"It's not a curse I could ever bear. All the attention, the expectations, the lies. Everyone expecting you to be something that you're not. I could never stand to be royal. Most likely, I'd go mad.\" Bertie's heart sunk so far that he could imagine it slipping from his shoe onto the ground. Elizabeth saw this and once again, sympathy was the emotion in her eyes. \"I'm so sorry, Bertie.\" And then she was gone.

A couple more balls had been held since the calamity of David's birthday celebration, but Bertie had not had the heart to invite Elizabeth to either of them. Her elder sister, Mary, had attended at his brother's invitation, but she had been accompanied only by one of her brothers; her youngest sister was nowhere in sight. ' It's likely for the best.' Bertie thought bitterly, cursing his own stupidity. ' Considering the disaster our last meeting became.' The prince had replayed the events of David's ball over and over again in his mind and each time he did so, he felt more and more foolish. Perhaps he was overreacting, perhaps things were not as bad as he remembered them- but then her words rang through his mind and his heart shattered all over again. I could never stand to be royal. I'm so sorry, Bertie. ' She knew.' Bertie had realised, while he sat alone on the bench in the gardens, long after Elizabeth had left him. ' She knew what I wanted to ask her. That was why she apologised, because she knew she was breaking my heart. And yet she said it all the same.' Bertie shook his head, disappointed at his own reaction. It was wrong for him to expect her to marry him, simply because he had had the idea to ask her. If she did not want the royal life, then that was her decision to make, not his. Nonetheless, the man could not help but remember: ' It was the royal life she said she did not want. She never said she did not want me.' But that hardly mattered now. No mattered how often he had wished to do so, he could not rid himself of his royal blood, nor could he deny his birthright. He had been born to be a prince of Great Britain, and would be heir to his brother's throne until David had children of his own. The royal life was his past, present and future; he could not put that aside for one woman, however wonderful a woman she may be. So, with a heavy heart, Bertie returned to the endless lists his mother had made, in search of a name that caught his eye in hope that she would be a more suitable choice for a bride. It was a futile attempt, for the only names that caught his eye were the ones that began with 'Elizabeth', on the off chance that they may be referring to her. And so Bertie returned to his old self, allowing his mother to introduce him to any suitable young ladies and saying the bare minimum to them before wandering off to stand on his own again. It was as if he had never met Elizabeth, as if all those wonderful changes she had made to him had been just a dream. The more he thought about it, the more Bertie pitied the woman he would eventually marry. The match between his parents had been arranged by their own and they held affection at the very most for each other. Now, yet another girl would be trapped into such a loveless match. ' Perhaps I might come to care for her in time.' he supposed. ' After all, she will be my wife and the mother of my children. But she'll never have my heart. That will always belong to another.' And it was not only he who would be wed to someone else. In time, Elizabeth would fall in love with another man, one who would not crush her with responsibility, but would only expect that she was a loyal wife and a caring mother. ' That's all she wants.' Bertie reminded himself, as if that would lessen the pain of knowing she could never have that with him. When these parties and occasions were over and done with, Queen Mary finally resigned to the melancholy which had enveloped her younger son, Bertie spent the majority of time locked up in his bedroom, wishing not to be disturbed as he tried to decide which noblewoman could possibly take the place of his dear Elizabeth. After days and weeks of trying, Bertie was close to despair over the matter. In all the lists of names and titles, he could not find any whom he might wish to make his bride. However, as a knock came at the door and he prepared to shoo the person away, he heard a footman call that there had been a letter for His Royal Highness. The moment the door was open, Bertie saw the handwriting on the envelope and smiled; for one, it was addressed to 'Dear Bertie'. Bertie opened the letter with shaking hands. My dear Bertie, I am so very sorry if the comments I made offended you in any way. I only felt bound to point out that the royal life, the constant attention and the endless procedure, is not one that I could envision for myself. Once one becomes royal, I feel that one's life no longer belongs to oneself, but to the people. And I cannot bring myself to accept that burden, however much I may wish to. I hope that you may find someone worthy of being your wife and I wish you all the happiness in the world for when you do. With great love and affection, Elizabeth. Bertie read the letter a dozen times over, ensuring that his eyes were not deceiving him. Yes, he had been right. It had been the royal life which she had not wanted, not him. Yet this letter was merely another painful reminder of how she could not have one without the other. Then a thought struck him. He was only the second son. He would never be king and he would not even be heir presumptive for a great deal of time, God willing. Once he was married, he could retreat more into the background and live out his life in relative peace. And she could do that with him, could she not? Bertie sat at his desk and put pen to paper, desperate to convince this wonderful woman of that fact before he lost her. Dearest Elizabeth... A/N: Please review![Chapter 7] Chapter Seven A/N: Thank you to bellovettrix, mrseljefino and daydreaming87 for reviewing the last chapter. Letters had been exchanged, back and forth, back and forth, but at last, Elizabeth had consented to return to the palace. For all that she had reluctantly agreed, she had rather made it seem that she did not wish to see Bertie. This, of course, was not the truth. The truth was that Elizabeth was very fond of Bertie; she grew fonder still every time they met. But this was what she was afraid of, and the reason why she had rejected so many invitations to dance and to dinner. She did not want to become any fonder of Bertie, for fear that she would be unable to let him go. No matter what else he may be in private, to the public Albert was a prince. He was expected to always behave in the correct way, to be polite and charming and politically correct. Most of all, he was expected to marry a princess. ' The royal family have never given in to that issue.' she told herself, as she had done every day since she had first met the prince. ' A prince must wed a princess. Even the second son of a king cannot marry the youngest daughter of a Scottish earl.' After the end of the Great War, her mother, Cecelia, had made finding a husband for her youngest daughter her highest priority. She had a great deal more time to do so, she had said, having withdrawn now from public life. Elizabeth had tried to object, but found her pre-war excuse to be invalid; all her elder sisters were married now, and she was the only one left, bar two of her brothers, Michael and David. The War had taken a great deal from her, including another brother, Fergus, whom she had loved dearly. He had used to call her 'little Lizzie' and twirl her round in his arms until she was giddy. There were times when, even six years later, she could not believe he was gone. Elizabeth did not involve herself much in the choosing of her future husband, for she knew that she would never find one she truly loved. Instead, she contented herself to play with little Rosemary, Fergus' daughter, twirling the child around just as her father had once done. The child had been laughing so loudly that Elizabeth did not hear her maid enter the room. When she finally noticed the poor girl, who had been hovering in the doorway with no idea whether to announce herself or not, her eyes were immediately drawn to the envelope she carried. Within moments, Elizabeth had retrieved the letter from inside and settled down in a chair to read, Rosemary clambering onto her lap to join her. Dearest Elizabeth, I am writing to tell you that I understand your misgivings about royal life, for I often feel them myself. Had I not been born a royal prince, I certainly would not have wished this fate upon myself, even if I am only a second son and, God willing, never to be king. It is a grim responsibility to bear and I understand your wishing to avoid such public acclaim all to well. I do, however, ask that we do not allow this to diminish our friendship. I have grown very fond of you, Elizabeth, and do not wish to lose you. You are one of the very few people I have met in my life who have treated me as a man and not simply as a prince. When I am with you, I feel that I can forego all expectations and just be myself. I hope to speak to you soon, Yours sincerely, Albert. Elizabeth leant back in her seat, breathing a deep sigh. She did not know if she was relieved to hear from Bertie or if it had simply made her heartache all the more painful. Either way, tears were beginning to well in her eyes. Rosemary had noticed her aunt's distress and wound her arms gently around her neck, offering comfort in the only way a child knew how. \"Why are you crying, Aunt Lizzie?\" she asked, her voice soft, as if she were trying to keep a secret. \"Are you sad?\" \"I'm not quite sure, darling.\" Elizabeth replied. \"Was it the letter?\" The girl, inquisitive as she was, had eased the letter out of her aunt's hand and was holding it close up to her face, trying to decipher Bertie's elegant script. \"Yes, darling, it was the letter.\" Elizabeth nodded shallowly. Rosemary looked up at her, the expression on her face making it clear that she would not accept such a simple answer. \"A young man wrote to me, asking if we might meet soon.\" Rosemary smiled widely. \"Is he your beau?\" \"No, Rosemary.\" she answered, her voice a great deal flatter than she had intended it to be. \"I do not have a beau, nor do I want one. This boy is a friend of mine, a dear friend. But he's nothing more than that.\" \"Does he want to be more than that?\" It was odd to hear such an insightful question from the lips of a girl who was barely six years of age. Then again, she was extremely similar to her father- Fergus had always had an innate ability to ask her the questions she constantly asked herself. \"I'm not sure, darling.\" she responded, after a lengthy pause. She glanced down at the piece of paper, which Rosemary had laid down on the table in front of them once she had gotten tired of it. \"Perhaps he does, but I doubt it very much. He's a son of the royal family; he'll marry a daughter of another royal family, just as princes have done for hundreds of years.\" The lie slipped easily from her tongue, but her niece still remained unsatisfied. She flashed Elizabeth a knowing smile, so similar to her father's. \"Do you want him to be more than that?\" \"He is a prince, Rosemary.\" the woman told the girl, edging around the question. \"It could never be.\" \"But would you want him to be your beau?\" the child asked, her smile increasing tenfold as she realised the answer. Elizabeth shook her head. \"Of course not, darling.\" That lie did not come as easily. A/N: Please review![Chapter 8] Chapter Eight A/N: Thank you to CountessCora, bellovettrix and daydreaming87 for reviewing. Elizabeth curled a loose lock of hair around her finger, a nervous tick that, despite her mother's complaints, she had not yet managed to overcome. James would be arriving any minute, to take her out dancing and somehow, she was more anxious than excited. James Stuart had been courting her for a week or two, after her mother had insisted she find a beau. He was a decent boy, more decent than many of the others, and so she had chosen him. She tried not to think about his professional connections- as equerry to Prince Albert he had a position of good standing in society and she tried not to think in any more depth than that. After a great deal of persuasion from her mother, Lord Glamis had acquiesced to him taking her out for the evening, so long as she was accompanied by her elder sister, Rose. Rose had been a chaperone for her siblings for many a year and so tended to stray away after a while, leaving Elizabeth and James alone for a considerable portion of the evening; their father was not aware of this, of course, but Rose had promised not to tell of the impropriety. Their dinner was a fairly informal affair, and once it was complete, James took Elizabeth out into the nearby gardens. There they walked for a few minutes, not a word passing between them. The lady had wondered if she ought to reach for his hand, to try and put him at ease, but she could not quite bring herself to do it. Each time she imagined holding his hand, she saw herself walking up the aisle on her father's arm, to greet and wed a man who was not Bertie. It was not a thought that she was able to bear- not yet, and perhaps not ever. \"So, Elizabeth,\" James began, anxiously scratching at the back of his neck. \"They've finalised the conditions for the Germans; they and their filthy Alliance will pay for every penny of the damages caused in France and all their spare money after that will go to the nations of the Entente. If you ask me, the Germans ought to have footed the bill entirely, but it has been shared between all the Central Powers.\" \"But is that not rather harsh?\" she questioned, maintaining a guise of ignorance that was common for a woman to portray. In fact, she was rather knowledgeable about the Great War, her own house having served as a convalescent home for the wounded. She tried not to think of the other reason the War touched a nerve; it only made her eyes prickle with sadness. \"I gather it was not the Germans who started the aggression, or at least not them alone. Why is it that only they are being made to pay for its consequences?\" James started, as if he had been slapped. He clearly had not expected such depth of analysis on the situation, especially not one so unpatriotic and especially not from a woman. Elizabeth had to hide a slight smirk at her achievement. \"They've claimed responsibility for the war and so they must expect to be made to pay for it.\" the man explained, speaking quickly, as though he thought he could convince her of his view by sheer speed. Elizabeth considered challenging him again, but thought better of it. ' After all,' she thought. ' He's a decent chap, and he might be all I have in the end. I'd be better off not alienating myself completely.' \"I'm sure you're right.\" The words felt very false to speak, but it was no different to the hundreds of evenings she had spent in a ballroom chuckling at the narrow-minded comments the gentlemen made. It was some of a life sentence for a woman of her standing- and yet not when she was with Bertie. \"Elizabeth, I have a question to ask you, if I may.\" James began, seeming unsure of himself once again. There was something about his fragile confidence that made Elizabeth feel a little guilty, but she could not bring herself to hide who she was forever. He would have to understand that about her if… the woman could not bring herself to finish the thought. \"I wondered if you might consider coming to my house for dinner sometime in the next week. My mother is itching to meet you and I'm not sure how much longer I can bear to deny her.\" The young lady forced a smile onto her face, though she hoped James did not notice the sorrow in her eyes. No matter how much he tried to disguise its importance, the meaning behind the gesture was unmistakable. A man brought a lady to meet his mother when he wanted her approval for a wife. \"James, it's a terribly flattering offer.\" she sighed, trying to disguise her sadness the same way he had done his anticipation. She achieved about the same level of success, judging by the way the smile fell from his face. \"And I'm certain that your mother is a wonderful woman. But…\" \"Elizabeth, please don't mistake me.\" James stated, though it sounded a little more like a plea. \"I am well aware of the circumstances surrounding you and His Royal Highness. I am more than close enough to him to realise your feelings and to realise his. But I think you ought to understand-\" \"What?\" the brunette questioned abruptly, unable to keep the irritation from her voice any longer. There was only so much being talked down to an intelligent woman could take. \"What must I understand, Mr. Stuart?\" Her tone was not lost on the young man, nor was her form of address, and he tempered his next words more carefully. \"I was simply going to suggest that you keep your options open, so to speak. It would not do to place all your hopes on one thing to suddenly find it out of your reach. It would only lead to heartbreak, and I would not want that for you. I may be second choice, but I am a secure option and I promise that I will try my level best to make you happy. If you are willing to accept that.\" Elizabeth's temper had calmed now, leaving only her head and heart in competition. On the one hand, she had to find a husband soon, if only to find a voice for herself somewhere in polite society. On the other hand, was the benefit of a husband really worth it, if not found with the man she truly wanted to marry? For all her passions and fire, pragmatism had always been one of the young lady's greatest assets. Today, it was perhaps a curse. Here she stood, all but signing her life away. There would never be a chance with Bertie after this, surely. He would move along and find someone else, whilst she married James Stuart and settled down for an ordinary life. Apart. Elizabeth never imagined she would allow her heart to be overruled in such a desperate situation. But then she had never imagined she would be placed in one. And as she acquiesced with a smile to Mr. Stuart's invitation, she could not help but curse the Fate she did not truly believe in. ' Why?' she asked, to no one in particular. ' Of all the men in England, why did I have to fall for him?' A/N: Really sorry it's been so long for this update, the next one won't be as long. Please review![Chapter 9] Chapter Nine A/N: No reviewers. Satisfied her mother was occupied picking flowers from the gardens, Elizabeth allowed herself to slump slightly against the bench behind her, the tiredness of these hectic few weeks finally taking hold. Since she had attended dinner with James' mother, she had seen the boy thrice, and on each occasion he seemed to become more and more eager to set another date. It was rather endearing really and any other girl would be thrilled to be the centre of such attention; Elizabeth, on the other hand, could not bring herself to care as much as she should. Ever since the news had broken among the family of James courting her, it seemed that Elizabeth could not escape conversation about the matter. She had received dozens of letters from her married sisters asking for every detail and even her brothers would not leave the matter alone. It was all becoming rather irritating, in truth, but she could not object. It would look far too suspicious to respond to such happy news by storming out of a room, as she itched to do each time someone asked for the date of the wedding. It was either that or cry out the truth, that she did not want to marry James. That she did not want to marry anyone but Bertie. \"Elizabeth!\" came a call from the house and the young woman immediately sat bolt upright, knowing her mother would turn to the source of the noise at any moment. Fenella, wife of her dearest brother John, was rushing down the steps from the house. The poor woman looked as if she had seen a ghost. \"Fenella, whatever is the matter?\" Elizabeth questioned, once she was close enough that the two would not be reprimanded for shouting across the grounds. \"Oh Elizabeth, you'll never believe who's come to see you.\" Fenella had something of a flair for the dramatic. She would never openly state something if she could build the suspense before it, a trait that Elizabeth found immensely irritating. Luckily enough the woman was also quite perceptive, which allowed her to realise her folly before she risked a kick in the shin. \"The Queen, Elizabeth. The Queen is here!\" \"No, this must be some of a joke.\" Elizabeth said dismissively, relieved she could find the breath to form the words. \"I swear to you, she's in the drawing room.\" Fenella insisted, inclining her head in the direction of the house to add force to her point. There was a slightly wild look in her eyes, not enough for her sister-in-law to think her mad, but enough that she knew this was no prank. \"Good God.\" Elizabeth whispered, her head beginning to spin. Instinctively she brushed down her dress, glad that she had chosen to read instead of helping her mother weed the flower beds. Heaven knows how the Queen would have reacted if she had arrived in the drawing room covered in earth. Her mother would have fainted at just the thought of it. \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" Fenella cried out, ushering the younger woman towards the house. She made the question sound so simple, as if Elizabeth's entire future were not resting upon this conversation. ' If I choose it to be my future.' she reminded herself. It was becoming increasingly difficult to think that way. Elizabeth paused at the mirror opposite the drawing room door, checking her appearance a final time. Her hair, pinned tightly atop her head, had begun to frizz slightly from the heat and her dress was not her most flattering, but it would have to do. The youngest-born daughter of a Scottish noble with a reputation for speaking her mind, she was unlikely to make a worse impression than the Queen would have expected. For some reason, the young woman had expected a great fanfare, the Queen accompanied by her entire retinue, all bedecked in silks and jewels. She had only come out three years earlier and the bustle of the royal court was never far from the front of her mind, especially since she had met Bertie. It was almost a shock to see a middle-aged woman, seated, alone, in her drawing room, her elegantly-coiffed hair missing a crown. \"You are Lady Elizabeth, I assume.\" the Queen asked. The brunette was still too star-struck to do anything but nod, bobbing a curtsy. \"Hmm. You are rather less pretty than I had assumed you would be.\" \"Pardon, Your Majesty?\" she questioned. It was probably a breach of etiquette to contradict the Queen, but Elizabeth had never been one to follow the rules. \"When my son told me he had fallen in love with a Scottish woman, I had assumed that you must be a raving beauty.\" the woman explained, glossing over the insult with an ease acquired by years of meeting dignitaries and tiresome nobles. \"He is, after all, a young man and susceptible to beauty as all men that age are. However, I must confess I do not think that is the case with you.\" \"And why would you think that, if I may ask, Ma'am?\" Elizabeth pressed, trying not to sound too eager. The Queen chuckled to herself. \"You have spirit, young lady, I'll give you that.\" It was another of those phrases Elizabeth had heard all through her life. She was never quite sure how the descriptive was intended. Her father used the term 'spirited' to describe his prized horses; for her mother it was the greatest insult. \"Most girls I have met cannot find the courage to look me in the eye, let alone to question me as you have done. Those empty-headed little dolls that swarm the ballrooms in summer are rather tiresome after a while, particularly when I consider that I have two unmarried sons for whom that would likely be the pool they will have to fish from, so to speak. You seem to be different, Lady Elizabeth.\" \"So I would hope, Ma'am.\" Elizabeth commented. The Queen raised her eyebrow, clearly not expecting to be addressed a third time, but smiled all the same. \"Very well, then.\" Queen Mary stated, rising from her chair. Elizabeth had to fight not to take a step backwards, not wanting to seem rude. \"I ought to go upstairs to rest. I will dine with you and your family tonight, then return to Balmoral in the morning.\" The older woman had almost reached the door by the time Elizabeth found the words to speak. \"Your Majesty?\" \"Yes?\" she asked, turning to face the younger woman. \"You came all the way from Balmoral to Glamis, to see me.\" she stated. The Queen offered a small nod. \"Why?\" The Queen smiled, the kind of sly smile only worn if one knew a secret they could not be made to part with. \"Let us just say, I was sent on something of a mission, by someone I hold very dear. They wanted me to see you for myself and form my own opinion.\" \"To what end?\" Elizabeth could almost hear her mother's shrieking voice in her mind, but she pushed it back. She had broken so many rules of etiquette already, what was one more? The smile grew even wider. \"To make sure that I see what he does.\" A/N: This is such a wonderful little nugget of history that I couldn't not use it. Queen Mary really did come and meet Elizabeth, because Bertie refused to marry anyone else. She gave her approval after only meeting her once! Hope you enjoyed and please review![Chapter 10] Chapter Ten A/N: Thank you to Candy Couture for reviewing the last chapter. It had been three months since the Queen had come to Glamis and it seemed that not a minute had gone by without Elizabeth thinking about Bertie. He had sent his mother to come and visit her, to determine her suitability as a bride; there was no other explanation. Even so, the young woman could not help but smile a little. It seemed that she was not the only stubborn one. The night after the Queen had left, Elizabeth had been set upon with questions from her mother, the woman seeking to analyse each miniscule detail of their meeting, what she had said, how she had stood, anything to deduce what sort of impression she may have given. She had answered shortly, with as little detail as possible, something that frustrated the woman no end. She continued to press for the next few days, but Elizabeth did not relent. It was bad enough to discuss her romances with the royal family, let alone her own. When the postman came by with a packet of letters, Elizabeth watched anxiously while her father sifted through them, picking out a couple that would be sent upstairs to her mother, a couple to be shared between her brothers, keeping the ones meant for him balanced on the edge of his plate. He gave her a tired smile when he caught her staring, as she had done every morning, then shook his head. Once again, there was nothing for her, Bertie neglecting to address his interference. Once again, she was a little upset he had not replied. Elizabeth had written to Bertie a few days after his mother's departure, her page littered with water marks and smudges, but she had not bothered to rewrite it. She wanted the prince to know just how much he had hurt her when he ignored her request to be left in peace. She would never be a royal duchess, would never survive living in the public eye, unable to be herself. She had told him all of this but he still would not let her go. The issue she was forced to address now was whether she really wanted him to. \"Lost in thought?\" came a familiar voice from the doorway. Elizabeth looked up, plastering a smile onto her face. Of all the people she would have wanted to see at that moment, James Stuart was very low down on her list. \"I suppose you could say that.\" she answered, shuffling forward slightly to perch on the edge of the settee, the way her mother had taught her. When she was alone, she tended to sit on the furniture. \"I wasn't expecting to see you.\" \"I was just popping in, thought we may be able to have a little chat.\" Elizabeth's smile faded as James came nearer. There was something about the way he walked, measured and controlled that made her wary- usually, James seemed to trip over his own feet half of the time, rather like her. \"What did you want to talk about?\" the young woman questioned, feeling somewhat mechanical. They were both aware she was going through the motions; they both knew exactly what he had come to say. \"I've had an offer to go and work in America.\" James stated, speaking far quicker than she had expected him to, as if he could not wait to have the truth revealed. \"It's an incredible offer, and the Palace are happy for me to take it up. I'm rather a lucky chap on all counts.\" \"Of course, of course.\" Elizabeth responded, trying to keep her voice light. Her eyes were still wide with shock. \"It's all rather exciting, isn't it?\" \"That's how I'm choosing to see it, yes.\" James agreed. He took a couple of deep breaths before he continued. \"The matter is, Elizabeth, that I'm going to be living on the other side of the world. And I'm not sure if you feel the same, but I believe that might make it a little too difficult… for us.\" Elizabeth inclined her head a little sadly. \"I appreciate your honesty, James, it does you real credit. Most men would have done a bunk without giving it a second thought. But you're right, it would make things too difficult. I'm a British woman through and through, I doubt I would do all too well in America.\" \"I hope you will stay in touch, letters and the like.\" James requested, looking her tentatively in the eye. The young woman smiled gently. \"I would like that very much. I'll need to hear how you've taken the New World by storm, swept a young American lass off her feet.\" \"So I should hope.\" James laughed. For a moment, it was just like the cheering times they had spent together over the past few months. It was the first time Elizabeth realised she might have done well with James in the end. The two stood in unison, sensing all the necessary words between them were said. There was an awkward moment's pause, but James was the first to overcome it, leaning forward to place a tender kiss on Elizabeth's cheek. That kiss was filled with all the words that had not been necessary, but still ought to have been acknowledged nonetheless. The kiss was filled with the promise of what might have been. Inclining his head respectfully, James took his leave, his shoulders slumped with relief. He had barely reached the door, his hand poised on its handle, before he turned to face her once more. \"Elizabeth, I've not let anything hold me back. I'm taking a chance when it's presented to me, because it's the best chance I have of being happy.\" The brunette woman blinked at him, not quite understanding the significance. She had congratulated him on his achievement already, they had said everything they needed to say. \"Promise me that you'll do the same.\" With that, James left the room, heading off into the distance, and Elizabeth sank back onto the settee once more. She doubted she would ever see the man again, a dreadful shame for she had come to enjoy his company of late. But his message was a precious one, one she would try and live by. There was no point letting a chance pass her by, when she knew how infinitely happy it would make her. ' Sometimes the pleasure outweighs the pain.' she acknowledged. ' I ought to give it a go at least.' The young woman stood, making her way to the writing desk set in the corner of the room and pulling a sheet of paper from a leather binder. She retrieved her father's favourite pen from the drawer, the same pen she had used to play at drawing with when she was a child; it was ironic, she supposed, that a memento from her childhood would play such a role in determining her adult life. Elizabeth took a deep breath to steel herself. Then she began to write. A/N: I think I quite liked James by the end and I was sad to get rid of him, but that was another historical detail I couldn't avoid (obviously, as we know where this is going!). Hope you enjoyed! Please review![Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven A/N: Thank you to bellovettrix for reviewing the last chapter. The service had been beautiful, decorated with all the grandeur and luxury one would have expected of a royal wedding, but as Elizabeth hung her delicate white dress in the wardrobe of her borrowed room, she could not help but wish she had feigned illness to avoid attending, for the event had merely prompted thoughts in her mind she did not wish to address. It had been almost a year since James had gone to America. According to his letters, the young man was steadily working his way through the ranks in the oil company he had taken employment with, now supervising a staff of fifty drillers on his own. He was busy enough to only write her periodically, which caused the young lady a little embarrassment, as she always answered his letters the very same day, having little else to occupy her mind. She had taken a different attitude to the letter she had received three months ago, the golden seal emblazoned on the back striking fear into her heart. At first, she had thought it might be Queen Mary, writing to offer her approval, or otherwise, of the young lady her son had fallen for. Stranger things had happened at sea. But one look at the handwriting on the letter inside and Elizabeth replaced the paper in the envelope. She could not bring herself to read the words, when she knew what they would say. It almost a week before Elizabeth summoned the strength to read the note. It was an invitation more than anything else, handwritten and heartfelt, to play bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Mary. Her mother had almost fainted at the prospect, fanning herself with her hand for a good ten minutes until she finally calmed. My daughter! she had exclaimed. The bridesmaid for a princess. If only she knew the rest of the story, she might never come round again. Social gatherings had always been prime opportunities for the upper classes to gossip, especially weddings. Elizabeth could not count the amount of comments she had heard in the pews and behind the champagne glasses about the young unmarried princes. Prince David was not such a worry; the man always seemed to have a woman on his arm, though how many were appropriate to wear a royal tiara was another matter. Prince Albert was the one prompting concern, the word in the court circular being that he had refused to marry any other than one mystery woman. It was rather like a fairy story, they said, if an inconvenient one. Elizabeth had once enjoyed such tales, before she had been at the centre of them. Of all her siblings, only dear Mary seemed to have noticed her pining. She too had received an invitation to the wedding, a nod to her accompaniment of her sister to that ball in London so long ago, and had spent the whole event watching Elizabeth try to keep her eyes away from Bertie. She succeeded for most of the ceremony, but the vows made the temptation took much to bear. She had turned her head a little to the side, to find the prince had been staring at her the whole time. Elizabeth did not know whether that made the situation earlier to bear, a weight being pushed onto her shoulders just as another was relieved. \"Heading to bed early?\" Elizabeth chuckled quietly. Her sister had a habit of appearing the moment anyone even thought her name, as if she heard their subconscious calling out for her. \"It's been a long day.\" she reasoned, knowing anything more elaborate would blow her cover immediately. Mary managed a nod, though her smirk made it clear she was not going to let the subject lie. \"I thought the princes both looked rather dashing.\" Mary chatted, perching herself on the edge of her sister's bed. Elizabeth fought not to roll her eyes at her sister's blatant attempt to disguise her intentions. She settled for a raised eyebrow instead. \"They did! Both dressed up in their uniforms…\" \"Mary, we both know the point you want to make.\" Elizabeth sighed, removing the pearls from her ears and returning them to her jewellery box. \"Save us both some time and make it.\" \"Alright, then. Prince Albert's still in love with you.\" Mary blurted, smugly rising to her sister's challenge. The younger girl finally stopped trying to busy herself, taking a seat beside her sister. \"I think he's going to propose. After all, he sent his mother to meet you. Why would he do that if he saw no future in it?\" \"He does see a future in it,\" Elizabeth murmured. \"That's rather the problem, actually. He certainly sees a future, but I don't.\" \"Lizzie…\" Mary chastised, but her sister quickly cut across her. \"He already asked me.\" the younger sister revealed, watching Mary's eyes grow wide. They had always been so close, telling each other everything. It took her a moment to process the fact that her young sister had kept such a secret from her. \"I turned him down.\" \"Why would you do such a thing?\" Mary asked, still not understanding. \"What choice do I have, Mary?!\" Elizabeth cried, crossing to the bedroom window. From this height, she could almost see the Palace. \"If I marry him, that would make me a royal! The Crown belongs to the country, not to themselves! I could never be one of them, a life of waving and cutting ribbons! I could never stand to have everyone watching me, judging me, to bite my tongue and keep a neutral stance! I would never be myself again!\" \"But if none of that existed,\" Mary pressed, seeming to have ignored her sister's outburst. That was another frustrating habit the woman kept, selective hearing. \"If he was just a lord of a country house in the middle of nowhere, would you marry him then?\" \"Of course I would.\" Elizabeth did not hesitate for even a second. There was no point hiding the truth, not from Mary. The woman looked as if she might cry. \"But he isn't the lord of a country house. He's the Duke of York. Nothing can change that. However much I might want it to.\" Then they were silent, neither knowing how to continue such a heartfelt conversation. In the end, Mary stood to leave her be, a gentle smiling at the corners of her mouth. It did not meet her eyes- there was only worry and heartache there- but Elizabeth appreciated the gesture nonetheless. Once she was alone, the young woman looked back to the window, straining her neck to see the outline of Buckingham Palace in the distance, an imposing figure keeping check on the rest of London. ' I could never call that place home.' Elizabeth told herself, wishing she believed the same words in her heart. The truth was, she could have lived anywhere, so long as it was with Bertie. A/N: I promise this will be resolved soon, but it really did take a while for her to come round to the idea! Please review![Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve A/N: No reviewers. The room was ornate, gilded, everything one would expect of a royal residence. Elizabeth shuffled uncomfortably to the edge of the plush settee, barely wanting to sit on something so overtly expensive. The footman had assured her the prince would be with her soon, but each moment she waited, she wanted a little more to run away. ' I shouldn't have come.' she kept telling herself. But surely she could not leave now. It seemed as if a decade went by before the door finally opened, a red-faced Bertie appearing from behind it. He had clearly been running, the poor chap, and Elizabeth felt even guiltier once she realised the time, rising slowly from her seat to greet him. She had been so desperate to see the man, she had not even considered that he might be asleep. \"I'm s-sorry to have kept you.\" Bertie stammered. He was far less able to control the habit in the mornings, it seemed, and no wonder, when she had all but dragged him from under the covers. \"It's quite alright.\" Elizabeth assured him, holding her hands up in a gesture of peace. \"The truth is, I didn't realise how early I was. Nowhere near appropriate visiting hours for family, let alone at the Palace. But I needed to see you and I wasn't sure I could wait any longer.\" \"What is it?\" Bertie asked, taking a seat on the settee and gesturing for her to do the same. There was a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, almost as if he knew what she wanted to confess. Or hoped it. Elizabeth took three deep breaths, the way her brother Fergus had taught her to calm herself. She had not done it since he was killed. Perhaps she had thought it would only work if he was there to guide her; after all, it had failed her when that dreadful telegram had arrived. ' But this is not dreadful.' the young lady reminded herself. ' This is the most wonderful news I could ever impart.' \"I know you've been rather keen to talk about the future.\" Elizabeth began, before realising how formal her tone had become. They might as well have been discussing Parliament or the recent rainy season for all the emotion her voice betrayed. \"About our future. And while we've been apart recently, it is something that I have given a great deal of thought to as well.\" Bertie looked as if he had woken on a cold December morning to find Father Christmas sitting beneath the tree. There was a childish joy in his smile that Elizabeth could not help but try and emulate. \"Anyway, now that we are here, together, and we have both been considering the future in this way,\" Elizabeth continued. She was beginning to fumble over her words, excitement and nerves mixing together to birth butterflies in her stomach. She took a deep breath to steady herself. This time, she only needed the one. \"I wondered if you had anything you would like to ask me.\" Bertie's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Elizabeth instantly regretted her boldness. The amount of pressure she had put on him was immense, she had never considered how such sudden worry might impact his speech. \"Oh, Bertie, I'm dreadfully sorry.\" Elizabeth lamented, trying to hide how flustered she had become. \"I didn't think, I just blurted out what was on my mind. Of course-\" Bertie held out his hand to stop her. He had such an air about him that he made even that gesture seem kind. He smiled at her the way no one had ever done before, as if he was smiling into her very heart. \"Are you quite finished, Elizabeth?\" The use of her given name was not lost on the woman as she smiled in return. \"Yes, I think so.\" \"Then I can finally say what I've been longing to say.\" Bertie's voice was so different to the way she had heard him speak at official functions, on the rare occasions she had heard him speak at all. For all his nerves, he had barely any trace of a stammer. \"I never thought I would get the chance to say any of this actually, given how many times you turned me down, but I prepared for it anyway, just in case… well, third time lucky, so to speak.\" Elizabeth could not help but interrupt. \"Third time? You've proposed to me once.\" Bertie opened his mouth to contradict her, then closed it again as he realised what had happened. \"You never read the letter I sent you, after my mother's visit.\" \"I couldn't bring myself to.\" Elizabeth admitted, looking more than a little sheepish. \"Each time I opened the envelope and recognised the handwriting, I replaced it, because I couldn't bear to question the decision I made all that time ago. Do you honestly mean to tell me that you proposed again in writing?\" Bertie nodded his answer and Elizabeth placed her head in her hands, trying to dam the tears that threatened to flood down her cheeks. \"I cannot believe I was so foolish as to turn down a royal proposal twice over. Even if the second occasion was an accident.\" Elizabeth began to chuckle and Bertie laughed along with her for a moment. It was one of the things she loved most about the man, that he could find the humour in himself, and in her, when any others would chastise their breaches of etiquette. The laughter came to an abrupt end when Bertie knelt down upon the carpet beneath their feet, taking her hand in his own. For just a second, Elizabeth considered that he ought not to be doing this, a royal prince kneeling before the youngest daughter of a Scottish earl, but the thought soon left her mind when Bertie spoke. \"Now, I don't actually have a ring,\" Bertie explained, taking his turn to appear sheepish. \"I wasn't expecting this to happen so early in the morning, but there you are. The fact is, Elizabeth, for you, I would wake at any hour, for any reason, because I care about you deeply and I only want for you to be happy. With that in mind, I must ask, for the third time, would you do me the great honour of becoming my wife?\" The first time Bertie asked, Elizabeth had been certain in her refusal. The second, had she realised, she would have taken much longer to deliberate. On the third occasion, she scarcely took the time to blink. \"Of course I will.\" A/N: It finally happened! Hope you enjoyed and please review![Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen A/N: Thank you to Frog1 for reviewing the last chapter. The sapphire adorning her left hand sparkled even in the dull Scottish sun, much to Elizabeth's joy. Her sisters had fawned over the gem since the first moment they had laid eyes on it, their eyes filled with hunger. It was not a particularly large ring, neither the sapphire nor its small diamond accents coming close to the size of most royal engagement rings, but it seemed her mother was the only one that minded. Her sisters only cared that the ring had come from a royal prince. Elizabeth herself only cared that it came from Bertie. The Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne threw herself into planning the wedding with a vigour never before seen in a bride's mother. She studied every page of Burke's Peerage to compile the guest list, she searched high and low for the most beautiful flowers in the country, and most of all, she sent letters of appeal to every well-known dressmaker for a thousand miles around, offering one of them the honour of designing the wedding gown for a royal duchess. \"But it is hardly an honour, is it, Mother?\" Elizabeth had protested, desperately fighting the urge to roll her eyes. \"Yes, I will be a royal duchess, but not when I step foot into the church. After that, I will be the Duchess of York. A grand title, yes, but there are many far grander that I shall never see.\" \"You are missing the point entirely, Elizabeth.\" Cecilia Bowes-Lyon complained. \"You will be royalty. Your husband's position in the line of succession is of no consequence to the papers, so long as you are a beautiful bride.\" \"I doubt I will be given the chance to be anything else.\" Elizabeth could not help but allow one snide remark to slip through the net. Luckily for her, her mother was too embroiled in etiquette ledgers to notice. Mary did not approve, when she heard of the exchange. That came as quite a shock to her younger sister; after all, the eldest sister had always been the first to question her mother's mad flair for the dramatic. \"Lizzie, she is only trying to help.\" Mary chastised, as she watched her children run across the lawn, chasing each other around in circles. She still recalled playing the game when they were children, hefting a baby Elizabeth around on her hip. \"Lord knows, she has a lot on her plate. You are marrying the Duke of York, she can hardly throw a chapel-and-garden-party affair.\" \"You know, I wish that she would.\" Elizabeth sighed. She too was watching her nieces and nephews, envying their innocence. They could run to their hearts' content and never have to worry about stopping. Responsibility was a million miles away. \"I never wanted a grand affair. So long as I am wearing a white gown and a veil, stood at a church altar with Bertie by my side, everything else is superfluous.\" \"Are you honestly telling me you are not the slightest bit eager at the thought of your wedding day?\" Mary's eyes were narrowed in that knowing way of hers. She understood her sister far too well. Elizabeth blushed, looking down. She did not want to admit defeat just yet, but the smile spreading across her face had rather given the game away. \"Well, perhaps just a little.\" \"Only a little?\" Mary pressed. Her younger sister swatted her gently on the arm. \"I'm sorry, Lizzie. But you are marrying the love of your life. You are well within your rights to be excited about it. Especially for a ceremony at the Abbey and reception at Buckingham Palace. I know, it is not a necessity for you, but it can hardly hurt!\" \"I suppose not.\" Elizabeth conceded. \"Oh, Mary, I can hardly believe it. I am marrying a man I not only get along with, but actually love. It seems more like a fairytale than reality, to wed a prince. I only wish it were so simple as the stories would have me believe.\" \"Lizzie, Bertie is second in line to the throne, with a strong father and young brother to come before him.\" Mary reminded her sister, watching the young woman shake her head a little. \"You may come into the spotlight at special occasions, stand on the balcony of the Palace, perhaps, and open a few exhibitions, but aside from that, you can live a normal life, as a normal family. I know you never wanted to be a public figure, but it will not be as unbearable as you might think.\" \"Do you truly think so?\" Elizabeth asked, watching her sister intently as she waited for her answer. Mary had never been one to stray from the truth, even for the sake of sparing someone's feelings. If she thought something would be for the best for her younger sister, then it must be the truth, however simple it might seem. \"Elizabeth, the fact of the matter is that you love him, and that is worth more than any adversity you might face.\" Mary smiled gently at her sister, reaching out to affectionately brush an imaginary blemish from her cheek, the way she had done when she was a child. \"Yes, your children will be royals, as will your husband, but they will be your family most of all. And you will love them with all your heart.\" Elizabeth looked out across the lawn, where the children ran and played together. But she did not see her sister's dark curls or hear her husband's laugh. She saw little girls with her gentle smile and sons with Bertie's sparkling eyes. And suddenly all her fears ebbed away. Mary was right. It did not matter how many strangers knew her name, how many newspapers published accounts of her holidays. Bertie was to be her husband, the father of her children, and the joy that overwhelmed her heart at the thought was far stronger than any fear. ' I always imagined I would lose my own life if I married a royal, but it is not as simple as that. Yes, I will have lost the life I have known, but I will gain a new one, a better one. And I cannot wait for that day to dawn.' A/N: Bit of a filler chapter, but hope you liked it nonetheless. Please review![Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen A/N: No reviewers. Throughout the many months of planning, Elizabeth was warned of the perils of an April wedding, yet the morning itself dawned clear and bright. It was a small victory in the grand scheme of things, but still enough to bring a smile to the young woman's face. Or at least it would have been, had she not woken beaming already. The gown had been hung on the edge of her armoire, the pearls and silver threads glittering in the candlelight, and Elizabeth lay for a moment simply gazing at it. Many of the details had not been her own design, the dressmaker being employed by Queen Mary, but it still managed to capture the spirit of the bride rather well. ' I wonder what Bertie will think.' Elizabeth thought idly. Her smile grew wider at the very thought of his name. It seemed so bizarre, to think that in just a few hours she will be a wife, a royal wife, no less. Marriage had been seen as an ultimate goal for Elizabeth since the day she was born, and yet something about her wedding felt rather rushed, as if she was not yet ready to open this new chapter. \"You love Bertie.\" the young woman whispered to herself, a mantra of sorts that she had taken to repeating whenever the butterflies fluttered in her stomach. \"And Bertie loves you. Nothing else matters in the world.\" And so Elizabeth threw back the covers and tiptoed across to her vanity, retrieving the enamel hairbrush she had been given as a child and running it through her rumpled brown curls. All through her childhood, the caress of the soft bristles had been calming, comforting in its familiarity. It seemed rather appropriate to hold it now, on the day she would finally become a woman in society's eyes. A soft knock sounded at the door, swiftly followed by Mary's softer voice. \"Lizzie, are you up yet?\" \"Yes.\" she called in response, her cheeks already aching from smiling. She could only imagine the agony she would be in by the day's end, after hours of waving to adoring crowds. ' Still,' she supposed. ' I imagine having Bertie's hand to hold will rather dull the pain.' \"Oh, darling.\" Mary sighed, as she closed the door behind her, a wistful expression on her face as she took in the scene before her. \"I can hardly believe it. I still remember the day you were born, Lizzie, your tiny little smile. It doesn't seem that long ago.\" \"If it's any consolation, I can hardly believe it myself.\" Elizabeth chuckled, gently replacing the hairbrush on the vanity. \"All that time I spent professing my hatred of public life, and yet here I am, bound for Westminster Abbey to marry my prince.\" \"These things are sent to try us.\" Mary jested, retrieving her sister's gown from the armoire, taking a moment to run her hands over the ornate design. \"This is beautiful, Elizabeth.\" \"Well, I will leave that abbey a princess in my husband's name.\" the younger woman pointed out. \"I suppose Queen Mary wanted to ensure I looked like one.\" \"Well, you certainly will.\" Mary sighed. She managed only a few moments of smiling before the tears brimmed over, falling in glittering streaks down her face. Elizabeth crossed the room in three quick strides, winding her arms tightly around her sister's neck and resting her head on her shoulder. For those few short minutes, it was like they were children again, with Mary taking responsibility for her sister's happiness every waking moment. It was finally beginning to sink in that, by the end of the day, that role would be Mary's no more. Almost an hour passed by, until Elizabeth finally stood in the mirror, her wedding veil draped about her shoulders. That one piece of ethereal tulle had transformed her from a woman to a bride and once it was removed that evening, to be replaced with a tiara the king and queen would offer her as a wedding gift, she would transform from bride to royal duchess. Just the thought of it sent a shiver down her spine, though she was not quite sure whether it was of fear or excitement. \"Time to go, Lizzie.\" Mary instructed, watching from the doorway once again. She blinked back the tears that threatened to resurface once again. For a woman who did not cry often, Mary had been reaching for her handkerchief every few minutes, the emotion of her younger sister's wedding too much to overcome. With a gentle smile and a final glance in the mirror, Elizabeth moved to the doorway, taking her sister's hand in her own as she descended the staircase of her London house. A small crowd had gathered at the bottom of the stairs, her mother and father among them, as well as a cluster of nieces and nephews running wild who were struck dumb by the sight of their ethereal aunt. \"Oh, Elizabeth.\" sighed the countess, her voice muffled by the glove-clad hand clapped over her mouth. \"My darling, you look beautiful.\" \"Thank you, Mother.\" she answered. Though she had felt months of little more than frustration towards her mother, now it was only love. She was her mother, after all, she only wanted the best for her daughter. And today, Elizabeth would not begrudge any mother that, not when it had all worked out for the best. The clock on the mantel chimed the hour and the Earl of Strathmore checked his pocket watch to confirm it. \"Elizabeth, we have to leave, else you'll be more than fashionably late.\" The young lady nodded her agreement, taking her father's proffered arm and letting him escort her to the car waiting outside. Even the chauffeur seemed to be beaming from ear to ear at the prospect of what was to come. \"Are you certain about this, Lizzie?\" her father asked, once they had both settled into their seats. The engine started up, the car beginning to drive away from the house she had called her own for the last few months. It occurred to her for a moment that she would not return to that house again. From now on, her home would be in a palace, the one thing she swore she would never allow to happen. And yet the thought of living there with Bertie made everything bearable, just as it always had. When Elizabeth smiled, hers was the widest smile of all. \"Absolutely.\" A/N: There'll be a couple more chapters to this, and then we're done. Hope you enjoyed and please review![Chapter 15] Chapter Fifteen A/N: Thank you to Candy Couture for reviewing. As the car slowed to a halt in the shadow of Westminster Abbey, Elizabeth could barely hear her own thoughts for the cheers and shouts of the crowd. It was the opposite of what she would have wanted for her wedding day. She had always dreamt of a quiet ceremony in the Scottish countryside, not an intruding eye to be found. ' But you chose to marry a prince.' she reminded herself. ' And this is only the first hurdle to overcome.' Seeing her vacant expression and assuming it to be simple nerves, Elizabeth's father reached over to pat her hand. \"You needn't worry, Lizzie. There is nothing to be afraid of in the young prince.\" \"No, I know that, Father.\" she protested. She could never imagine being afraid of Bertie. But the baying crowds pushing forward against the barriers erected by the police for her safety, they were another story entirely. \"I suppose I am not so used to being in the spotlight.\" Her father gave her hand a gentle squeeze before he pulled away. \"Not to worry, dear. I'm sure after a while it will be like second nature to you.\" \"Yes,\" she answered bitterly, then murmured under her breath. \"That's rather what I'm afraid of.\" As the chauffeur pulled open the passenger door, the final barrier between the young lady and the outside world at last pushed aside, the sound of the crowd became deafening. Her heart was pounding desperately, a drummer's march inside her chest, and when she first stood, the blood rushed from her head so suddenly that she almost swooned. She managed to catch herself in time, luckily enough; that would have been an introduction the public would not quickly forget. Seeing hundreds upon hundreds of faces, smiling and waving faded flags clearly left over from the war effort, for the first time, Elizabeth felt the love the public bore towards this great institution. Yes, they crowded the monarchy, but only because they wanted so desperately to be a small part of their story. And she would not begrudge these poor people that, not today. Slowly, tentatively, Elizabeth raised her hand and waved. The already deafening sound grew impossibly louder at her acknowledgement, groups of women in the crowd looking among themselves, as if only her recognising their presence was the greatest moment of their lives. ' I suppose I never realised how important all this was to them.' She could not dwell on her revelation for long, as she took her father's arm and crossed the threshold into the great abbey, the bright sunlight dimming as she moved into the building. But it was not dimmed enough to hide the one tombstone that remained uncovered by the red velvet carpet lining the aisle, and it was almost enough to bring the woman to her knees. She had heard of the monument when it was unveiled, more than two years ago, but she had not given much though to the role it would play in her own wedding. ' I ought to have planned this a little better,' she thought, feeling the tears well in her eyes. ' He was one of so many, who gave so much. Just like Fergus.' The archbishop seemed to jump in alarm as the bride knelt down on the floor, touching her hand to the cool black marble, feeling a shiver run up her spine. In that moment, she could almost feel his embrace, the day before he had left for the front. He had promised he would always be there for her. And it seemed fated now, that he was here. Elizabeth looked down at the intricate array of blooms in her hand, and she knew just what to do. Delicately, she laid the bouquet atop the tomb, closing her eyes for a moment. \"Thank you, Fergus.\" she whispered, her voice crackling with emotion. \"I knew you would never miss this.\" With a final silent prayer, Elizabeth stood again, retaking her father's arm and pretending she did not see the tears in his eyes, just as he pretended he had not heard her speak to her long-dead brother. Both knew the importance of the moment they had shared. After all, her wedding day would not have been right without Fergus, even if fate had snatched him from them too soon. With the tomb left behind her, Elizabeth finally looked ahead, to see Bertie stood at the altar. He had his back to her, as was the tradition, his brother David awkwardly shifting from foot to foot beside him. In truth, David seemed more nervous than Bertie, something which made the young woman smile a little. It seemed any worries her fiancé had fostered over his choice of wife had long since gone. It was not until she reached the altar that Elizabeth finally saw Bertie's face, his great beaming smile mirroring her own. In his eyes, she could see all the love he had borne for her all these years, and the promise of decades to come; she imagined he could see the same in her own. For that beautiful moment, they were the only people in the world. The archbishop's address brought them back to the present, although Elizabeth did not truly listen to his words. It was pomp and ceremony for the benefit of the gathered royals, the expected words at a public event. It did not matter in the grand scheme of things. There was only one sentence that truly mattered, and it was not long before the couple were facing each other, each cradling a ring in their palm. \"I, Albert Frederick Arthur George, take thee, Elizabeth Angela Marguerite, to be my lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.\" \"I, Elizabeth Angela Marguerite, take thee, Albert Frederick Arthur George, to be my lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish and obey, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.\" The couple did not hear the applause, they did not hear the cheering crowds outside the church. The only attention they paid to the outside world was to the archbishop, when he, at long last, pronounced them husband and wife. It had been many years in the making, but somehow, the touch of wedding band against wedding band as the two clasped their hands together made their first kiss all the sweeter. A/N: So, there you have the wedding, with another little historical detail I got to use! The tradition of British royal brides placing their bouquet on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey was started by Elizabeth, in memory of her brother, Fergus. Hope you enjoyed this long awaited moment, please review![Chapter 16] Chapter Sixteen A/N: Thank you to Guest for reviewing the last chapter. The opulence of Westminster Abbey seemed nothing compared to the wedding reception awaiting the newlyweds at Buckingham Palace. Flowers adorned every surface, vines woven with delicate blooms laid along mantelpieces and wound around bannisters, as if the beautiful gardens outside were creeping through the walls. Hundreds of people from dozens of countries mingled together happily, music played loudly through the ballroom. It was a grand occasion, one that would surely be memorable for all who attended. And yet Elizabeth stood out on the balcony, her arms wrapped around herself to try and keep herself warm. The mid-spring air was much warmer than she was used to, having been raised up in the Scottish Lowlands, but her flimsy gown did not offer much protection from the elements. She knew that it was not the most impressive of hiding places, given that her white gown would have identified her in a heartbeat, but there was something comfortable about the place that had made her seek it out. In the face of her whole world turning on its head, she needed any comfort she could find. It seemed she was not alone in that thought, for when she was finally discovered, a dozen minutes later at most, it was by none other than her groom. \"Hiding?\" Bertie asked, smiling good-naturedly as he approached her. There was something about the certainty behind his question that made Elizabeth love him all the more. \"Why on Earth would one hide from their own wedding reception?\" the young woman challenged, as nonchalant as she could manage. Bertie smiled a little wider. \"I'm hiding too.\" Elizabeth let out a noise somewhere between a sigh and a laugh, shaking her head the way one might do to a misbehaving child. \"I know how difficult it must be for you.\" Bertie stated, suddenly the serious man again. It was a strange quality in the prince, to embody such incredible spirit and yet such regal dignity all at once. Elizabeth idly wondered for a moment whether their children would inherit those traits. It was that thought that sparked the determination in her eyes. \"It will be difficult.\" she conceded. There was little point in trying to deny it, after all. \"But there are far more difficult roles in the world to fulfil, and there are thousands upon thousands of people who will struggle far more than I will in their lives. Perhaps it is my role to help them, in what small ways I can.\" Bertie furrowed his brow slightly, looking bemused and just a little triumphant. \"So you do believe the monarchy does good?\" \"I always did, Bertie,\" Elizabeth sighed, suppressing a glimmer of frustration. She may have never wanted the life for herself, but she was born an aristocrat, however low of one, and the hum of republicanism beginning to echo across the nation was not one that called to her whatsoever. \"Just not necessarily me. Most of the world believes that only a princess by birth can take on a prominent role in the royal family. I suppose I shall just have to try and prove them wrong.\" Bertie nodded, pleased but not surprised by his new wife's determination. He had seen the fire in her eyes the first night they met, heard the principles from her heart each time she rejected his proposals; those qualities were what had drawn him to her in the first place. Elizabeth was strong, it could not be doubted. But gold and jewels were heavy weights to bear alone. \"I doubt you will have many s-supporters at first.\" Bertie confessed, slipping a little back into his stammer. His nerves were finally starting to get the better of him. \"Not amongst the c-court, anyway; I imagine the public will love you beyond words. But you were not their ch-choice for a royal duchess, and I would not… expect any of them to make life easy for you.\" Elizabeth's eyes glinted, that same spark he had seen in her that very first night. Slowly, a smile spread across her face. \"Then we shall have to make it doubly difficult for them to prove themselves right.\" The couple laughed together, joyful, all barriers between them cast aside by that one small word: we. It had been used so instinctively, without even thinking of the implication, and that was what made it certain to be true. As they fell silent once more, the music from the ballroom grew louder, the melodies carrying on the spring breeze, as if the notes were whirling on the balcony around them. \"I suppose we'd better make a reappearance before too long.\" Elizabeth stated, the pragmatic side of her overcoming the desperate urge to remain on the balcony, feel the breeze in her hair and Bertie's hand in hers. If anything, Bertie seemed even more reluctant than she had, but he nodded nonetheless. Whilst Elizabeth's pragmatism was merely a trait of her personality, Bertie's had been drilled into him since childhood; appearances first, and feelings second. That was the way of the royals, and though it would take a long while to get used to, Elizabeth imagined she would get the hang of it eventually. \"Very well, then.\" Bertie smiled, offering his new wife his arm. She gratefully accepted the gesture- as much a show of support as the expected formality- and with a quick adjustment to the skirt of her gown, they set off back into the ballroom, where they would surely not find a moment's peace for the remainder of the evening. But it did not matter so very much, Elizabeth told herself, as she was introduced to perhaps more than a thousand people she had never laid eyes on before. For it might have seemed a lonely existence, but she was not alone. Her family dotted around the ballroom, her brothers and sisters, her loving parents, and the memory of one favourite brother who never came home, all of them lived and breathed inside her heart, offering courage and strength when she needed it most. And most of all, there was Bertie, darling Bertie. The memory of those few precious minutes on the balcony, with the wind in her hair and his hand resting over hers as their arms were linked… somehow, those minutes made it all worthwhile. A/N: I really hope you enjoyed this chapter, everyone! Only one more to go! Please review![Chapter 17] Chapter Seventeen A/N: Thank you to mrseljefino for reviewing the last chapter. In the whirl of cutting ribbons, watching horse races and donning hundreds of gowns for thousands of different events, three years went by in a flash. Young Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the Duchess of York, a near seamless transition from a minor Scottish lady to one of the greatest women in the land. Bertie had been right, of course; the aristocrats looked down their noses at her for a long while, their beady eyes searching for every mistake, but to the people, she was their princess from the day she walked onto the balcony. In the past year more than anything, the whole world seemed to watch her with bated breath, searching for even the smallest of signs. Now, they needed wait no longer. Laying amongst clean bedclothes, dressed in an embroidered housecoat with her hair neatly tied back by a ribbon, there was no evidence left of the trauma Elizabeth had endured these last few hours, aside, of course, from the warm bundle of blankets nestled in her arms. The baby fussed a little as the door creaked open, as if she had somehow known it was her father come to visit her. Bertie tiptoed across the room for fear of alarming the baby further; Elizabeth could see even from this distance that his eyes were rimmed with tears. \"Oh, my darling.\" the man whispered, perching gently on the edge of the bed. He kept his distance, mindful of the still-tender wound on her abdomen where her operation had been carried out. Elizabeth could see the pride behind his tears, and yet she could not stop the nagging doubts in the pit of her stomach. She moved the baby a little closer to her chest, almost protectively. She knew Bertie would never harm her or the baby, would never dream of such a thing, but her maternal instincts already were stronger than all else. \"It's a girl.\" she whispered, her eyes fixed on her daughter's face so she did not have to witness her husband's reaction. She could have a few more moments of bliss before she was forced to see the disappointment in his eyes. Eventually, Elizabeth summoned the courage to look up, biting her lip to stem the flow of emotions that would surely follow the sight of him. And sure enough, her lip began to tremble and her eyes to water as she saw the joy in his voice remain, as strongly as it had done when he had first seen the child. \"She is the m-most perfect girl imaginable.\" Bertie proclaimed. The slight stammer in his voice only made her cry more. Whatever had she done right in her life to be gifted this wonderful man? \"Besides, D-David is the heir. He'll marry soon and have children of his own. Once he has a son, no one will c-care a fig whether we have a dozen girls.\" \"They might not care a fig, but I will, if I'm the one that will be carrying these dozen girls!\" Elizabeth protested, her eyes misting with tears of laughter. Bertie laughed along with her, scratching awkwardly at the back of his head, as if he had revealed some dastardly secret. Perhaps he had not been entirely joking after all. For a few moments afterwards, the two were content to look down at their sleeping child, basking in the glow of happiness that seemed to encompass all the world at that moment. The baby fidgeted a little in her sleep, clinging to the wool of her blanket as if she had not yet become accustomed to the cold, and nuzzling her head a little closer to her mother. \"We need a name for this little one soon.\" Elizabeth pointed out, slowly rocking the child back and forth as she began to wake. \"The Palace will want to make an announcement.\" \"I d-doubt it should take too much thought.\" Bertie stated, leaning a little closer into his wife and daughter. \"I already have the p-perfect name in mind.\" \"Do you indeed?\" the woman chuckled, looking up at her husband agog. \"I thought a daughter's name was her mother's domain. Well, come along then, let me hear it.\" \"Elizabeth.\" For a moment, the duchess was so shocked that she almost answered her own name, but it only took that moment for her to realise her husband's meaning. The tears began again, streaming down her cheeks and landing on her daughter's blanket, a symbolic baptism for the young girl. \"Princess Elizabeth. I think it sounds rather smart. And I could not think of any namesake that would serve her better.\" Elizabeth took a few seconds to gather herself, before she gave a gentle nod, speechless for the first time in a long while. \"Elizabeth. I think even your father would approve of that. Then Alexandra, perhaps, for the late queen, and Mary. Your mother was the one who convinced me my scruples about public life were not enough to keep me from marrying the man I loved. I want to honour that.\" \"Very well then.\" Bertie smiled, reaching down to brush a hand across the baby's head. \"Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of York.\" As if she had heard the call of her name, the baby began to mewl softly, the edges of her tiny lips almost seeming to smile. Her two parents looked down on her, their eyes shining with love, for their child and for each other. It could have been minutes before Elizabeth spoke again, or hours. They had sat contentedly watching as this new life accustomed herself to the world, hardly able to believe that they had created something so very perfect. The baby had quieted at long last when her mother began to whisper. \"It is rather ironic, I suppose.\" she stated quietly, wrapping the blanket a little more securely around baby Elizabeth. \"What is?\" Bertie asked, confused. He could see many emotions in the day gone by, but that was not one of them. \"It is our duty as a duke and duchess is to provide an heir for the United Kingdom, should all go awry with David.\" Elizabeth elaborated, stroking her thumb tenderly across her daughter's tiny cheeks. \"Well now, we've finally done it. This child is our greatest duty complete. And she was born out of nothing less than love.\" Bertie's eyes strayed from the younger Elizabeth to the elder, and as he watched the smile slowly spread across her face, he leant in and pressed his lips to hers. It was a sweet kiss, filled with promise and hope, and the two almost wished it would never end. But of course, duty called once more, the announcement for the palace gates needing to be prepared, and so they broke apart, resuming their roles as duke and duchess once more. There would be plenty of time for love, a quarter of a century more, though they did not yet know how the coming decades would shake the very core of the monarchy. And even once Bertie was gone, and Elizabeth had to carry on alone, her memories of that perfect love carried her through the years, until the day finally dawned that her struggle ended, and she and Bertie could be together once again. A/N: Sorry for the depressing ending, but I wanted to do a brief summary of their life together, and I don't think it can be ignored that Elizabeth lost Bertie and lived half a century as a widow before she died. She was an absolutely incredible woman, and I hope this story has, in some way, been a small tribute to them. I really hope you've all enjoyed this story, and for the final time, please review! ","Summary":" Love and Duty Summary: Even as the younger son of King George V, Albert Windsor was expected to mar"},{"Movie":"Professional","Title":"Léon et Mathilda","Author":"adieue","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9635907","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Et si Léon avait réussi à s'en tirer ... Tony descendit les marches qui menaient au sous-sol du restaurant. Il longea les montagnes de boîtes de carton et d'étagères remplies de conserves, pour atteindre le coin poker aménagé au fond. La table ronde surmontée d'une lampe et entourée de chaises ressemblait à un petit oasis perdu au milieu du fouillis. Une table roulante qui faisait office de minibar, était rangée contre le mur de vieilles planches. Il le déplaça de quelques pieds, poussa sur le mur et les planches cédèrent, révélant une porte dissimulée. Il entra dans la pièce discrète en prenant soin de replacer le bar et referma la porte. La pièce de vingt pieds par trente était richement garnie de façon à impressionner les visiteurs triés sur le volet qui avait le privilège d'y entrer. Bureau d'acajou, bibliothèque garnie de livres rares et lampes de collection. Au fond, on avait allumé les plafonniers au néon accrochés au dessus d'un espace dégagé qui servait en cas d'urgence médicale. Pour l'heure, il y avait foule et Tony observa le groupe disparate qui le dévisageait. Léon Montana assis sur une chaise de fer blanc, le toubib derrière lui qui cousait le dernier trou de balle et la gamine, assise par terre sur les pieds de son sauveur, collée à ses basques au premier sens du terme. - Alors, il va s'en sortir ? demanda Tony. - Il a eu beaucoup de chance, répondit Paolo Finaldi en reprenant son ouvrage. Tony s'assit dans le fauteuil capitonné derrière le bureau et sortit un des petits cigares auxquels il ne pouvait pas résister. Il l'alluma en observant Montana. Une chose était sûre, Léon avait beau manquer de ciboulot, il était fait en acier trempé. Non seulement il avait réussi à se sortir de ce merdier vivant mais il n'avait rien. Du moins, rien qui doive le mener au cimetière à court terme. Quelques balles à extraire, quelques mauvaises brûlures ici et là, c'était tout. Il avait le cul béni, pour ça, pas de doutes. Et encore d'avantage parce qu'il venait tout juste de parler à Paul Risotto qui tenait un business à Los Angeles. Il lui devait un petit service et ce serait une planque parfaite pour quelque temps. Bien sûr, ce connard de Montana venait de lui foutre un merdier pas possible, sans compter sa gueule amochée, mais le vieux Tony était d'humeur à lui pardonner. On ne voyait pas un type filer une pareille raclée à ces cons de flics tous les jours. L'évènement serait gravé dans les annales de cette ville pour les siècles des siècles. Ça valait bien quelques emmerdes. La gamine ramena ses mains sur le genou du blessé et posa son menton dessus. - Ça fait mal ? demanda-t-elle pour la dixième fois. Léon hocha la tête en souriant. - Il y a rien de grave pas vrai ? Tu ne me raconte pas de salade. - Pas de salade. Tony fronça les sourcils. C'était la première fois qu'il voyait Léon sourire comme ça, sans compter que la petite était toute chose à ses pieds. Il remarqua qu'ils semblaient partager une sorte de complicité étrange. Il y avait un peu trop d'affection dans le regard que la petite levait sur lui et une tendresse encore plus bizarre dans le regard que le tueur posait sur elle. Il y avait quelque chose entre ces deux-là. Quelque chose de pas net. - Et voilà, c'est fini, dit le toubib en collant le pansement. - Merci Paolo. Je t'en dois une. - Un plaisir Tony, dit le docteur en refermant sa valise. - Matilda, va t'asseoir dehors à la table. Il faut que je parle à Léon. Paolo, en passant par les cuisines, dis à la Taupe de lui apporter du lait et des gâteaux. - J'aimerais mieux rester, dit-elle en regardant Léon d'un air suppliant. - Vas-y et ne discute pas, ordonna Tony. Léon hocha la tête et la petite fille sortit à regret à la suite du docteur. Tony observa Montana un instant sans rien dire. - Vous avez l'air de bien vous entendre toi et la gamine, dit-il finalement en éteignant son cigare. Léon haussa les épaules comme si ça allait de soi mais le regard lumineux de l'intimé ne plut pas du tout au mafieux italien. Dans la vie, il y a des choses qu'un homme digne de ce nom ne peut pas laisser passer et il allait en avoir le cœur net pas plus tard que tout de suite. Il se leva et approcha une chaise qu'il posa juste devant celle de Léon. Il s'assit et se pencha vers lui. - Dis-moi franchement. Il y a quoi entre toi et la gamine. - Ben rien. - Tu sais que tu peux tout me dire, assura-t-il sur un ton de confidence. - Elle reste avec moi, c'est tout, dit Léon en le regardant surpris. - Ne me prend pas pour un con ! Le regard inintelligent que lui renvoya le tueur indiqua qu'il allait devoir se montrer plus clair. - Tu t'es envoyé cette fille ? demanda Tony en le dévisageant. Répond ! - Ah. … Heu … non. Tony connaissait bien ce bougre d'animal. Il était incapable de le baratiner. Il n'avait pas touché la petite, c'était certain. - Il s'est passé quelque chose ? - … Non. Là par contre, il lui mentait et Tony lui envoya une baffe pour le ressaisir. - Ne me ment pas Léon ou tu vas devoir trouver quelqu'un d'autre pour te sortir de cette merde, dit-il en le pointant d'un doigt menaçant. Dis-moi ce qui s'est passé. Léon le regarda par-dessous, comme un chien qu'on aurait disputé à tort. - Elle, elle voulait que je … que je sois sa première fois … mais j'ai pas voulu, assura-t-il. Avec ce qui s'est passé en Italie, je … Je ne pouvais pas … enfin … tu vois. C'était donc ça. La petite était folle de cette tête de con. Clairement, Léon n'avait pas pensé à mal mais il était plus que temps de lui remettre les pendules à l'heure. - D'accord, d'accord, je te crois. C'est bien. T'es un bon garçon, t'en fais pas, dit Tony en lui tapotant la joue gentiment. Regarde-moi et ouvre bien tes oreilles d'accord. Léon hocha la tête. - C'est quoi la règle du boulot ? demanda Tony. Léon le regarda fixement. - Ni femme ni enfant. - Et ben pour les histoires de couchette, c'est pareil. Il y a une règle. Tu la connais cette règle ? Léon secoua la tête. Il n'avait jamais attendu parler de règles à ce sujet. - Cette règle c'est : ni hommes, ni enfants. Léon hocha la tête. - Ni homme, ni enfants, répéta-t-il. - Ceux qui font ça, ce sont des pervers et les pervers on leur arrache les couilles. Tu veux garder tes couilles ? Alors tu ne touches pas aux gamines. T'as bien compris ? - Oui, assura Léon la tête basse. - C'est bien, dit Tony qui serait tombé en bas de sa chaise s'il avait su qui, parmi ses collaborateurs avait fait fi du premier des deux tabous. Les gamines sont comme ça. Elles finissent par craquer pour un vieux alors ne l'encourage pas et ça lui passera. Léon acquiesça de nouveau. - Maintenant écoute ça, dit-il en se penchant vers lui, j'ai peut-être une planque pour toi...[Chapter 2] - Alors ? Tu as trouvé des méchants ? demanda Mathilda en passant la tête par la porte de la cuisine. Léon était posté à la fenêtre du fond et fixait la ruelle arrière, son fusil toujours levé. Il venait de passer leur nouvel appartement au peigne fin et tout avait l'air en ordre. - Tu as vu ? Il y a deux chambres et deux lits, renchérit la jeune fille en sortant de derrière le cadre de porte. - Oui, dit Léon toujours dos à elle. Il se retourna pour la regarder. - Peut-être que j'en utiliserai un parfois. - Alors tu as aimé ça pas vrai ? demanda-t-elle en agrippant les montants du cadre comme si elle voulait l'empêcher de sortir. Léon l'observa un instant en se demandant si elle parlait de dormir dans un lit ou de dormir avec elle. Il jugea plus prudent de ne pas répondre et rangea son arme dans sa ceinture. - Tu sais, dormir dans un lit, c'est très dangereux, dit-elle en souriant. Il faut beaucoup d'entrainement … et surtout, un bon professeur. Je ne crois pas que tu devrais t'y essayer tout seul. ajouta-t-elle d'un air malin. Il lui jeta un bref regard et se dirigea vers elle avec la visible intention de sortir mais Mathilda ne fit pas mine de lui laisser le passage. - Alors ? Tu veux un cours ? demanda-t-elle en se penchant vers lui, bien agrippée au montant de la porte. - Non, dit-il en lui faisant signe de se pousser. Mathilda le laissa passer. Elle s'appuya contre le montant en croisant les bras tandis qu'il enlevait son manteau. Elle sentit que son cœur se serrait. Il se passait quelque chose. Depuis leur départ de New York, il la regardait à peine et semblait presque la craindre. - Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? demanda-t-elle d'une petite voix. - Mmm ? fit Léon très absorbé par l'observation du garde-robe d'entrée. - J'ai fait quelque chose de mal ? demanda-t-elle inquiète, en s'avança vers lui. - Hein ? … Non, dit-il en lui jetant un coup d'œil rapide. Elle se planta juste devant lui si bien qu'il n'eut pas le choix de la regarder. - Je vois bien qu'il y a quelque chose. Pourquoi tu m'ignores ? demanda Mathilda en croisant les bras. Léon n'avait aucune envie d'aborder le sujet et rangea son manteau pour se donner contenance. - Si tu ne me dis rien, je vais devenir folle à essayer de deviner ce qui se passe sous ton crâne ! dit Mathilda avec des larmes plein les yeux. Léon se gratta la tête en regardant la jeune fille qui le dévisageait gravement. - Tony dit que toi et moi … ce n'est pas … enfin, que dans ce genre de chose, il y a une règle, dit-il plus ou moins à l'aise. - Une règle ? Ah bon. Et c'est quoi ? - C'est ni hommes, ni enfants, voilà ce qu'il dit, expliqua Léon en la contournant, tant pour saisir sa mallette que pour fuir la conversation. - Ni homme, ni enfants ? Mathilda commençait à comprendre quelle mouche l'avait piqué. - Je ne suis plus une enfant ! plaida-t-elle. Léon haussa les épaules comme pour dire que ça ne changeait rien et passa à la cuisine pour poser la mallette sur la table. Mathilda saisit la plante qu'elle avait laissé dans l'entrée et le rejoignit. Elle la posa religieusement sur la table puis s'assit devant lui tandis qu'il vérifiait que les armes avaient bien résistées au voyage. - Est-ce quetu crois que moi aussi je dois suivre cette règle ? demanda la jeune fille avec un sourire malicieux. Léon sembla prit au dépourvu, son Colt à La main. - Euh … et bien …, songea-t-il. Je n'en sais rien, en fait hum. J'imagine que non. - Écoute, moi ça me va tu sais, dit-elle en feignant l'indifférence. Qu'est-ce que tu crois que je vais te faire ? Que je vais me jeter sur toi ? demanda-t-elle amusée. Léon haussa un sourcil. - Tu as peur que je t'arrache tes vêtements ? suggéra-t-elle. Que je te viole ? Léon sourit et hocha la tête en reposant le Colt. - Non, mais Tony dit que je ne dois pas t'encourager. C'est la règle. - Oui, la règle. Bien sûr, dit Mathilda en haussant les épaules. En fait, elle n'en avait rien à faire des règlements d'un vieux mafieux italien et elle se promit bien de contourner celui-là, particulièrement, à la première occasion. Cependant, Léon n'était pas du genre à prendre les règles de Tony à la légère et désormais, il allait malheureusement falloir ruser avec finesse. L'instinct féminin tout neuf de Mathilda lui soufflait qu'en premier lieu, il allait falloir laisser passer un peu de temps avant de passer à l'attaque. - Écoute, arrêtes de t'en faire d'accord ? Ne pas encourager quelqu'un et l'ignorer c'est deux choses différentes Léon lui jeta un coup d'œil et se replongea dans son inspection. Mathilda admira ses gestes sûrs et rapides. Elle connaissait la meilleure façon d'avoir toute son attention. - Léon ? - Quoi ? - Il faudrait qu'on reprenne l'entraînement. Je crois qu'on commence à se ramollir.[Chapter 3] Droit d'auteur : Cette scène est tirée de la première version du scénario et elle appartient à Luc Besson. Il m'a semblé intéressant de l'inclure puisqu'elle semble peu connue. Si jamais je n'ai pas le droit de l'utiliser, veuillez m'en informer et je l'enlèverai, bien entendu. Le tueur et la jeune fille marchaient dans une rue sombre et mal éclairée. De vieilles manufactures et des entrepôts composaient l'ordinaire des bâtiments mais quelques immeubles d'habitations s'étaient nichés dans leur voisinage. - Quand on a des contrats, on n'a pas le temps mais ce soir, je vais te montrer comment avoir les codes, dit Léon en montrant un immeuble de l'autre côté de la rue déserte. Il traversa la rue et monta l'escalier d'entrée de l'immeuble. Mathilda le suivit comme son ombre et se plaça tout près pour bien voir. - Il y a deux manières selon la situation. Dans le premier cas, tu as le temps de voir venir et tu veux avoir le code pour plus tard. La jeune fille fit signe qu'elle suivait parfaitement. - Tu attends la nuit et tu souffle un peu de suie sur le clavier. Comme ça, dit-il en soufflant dans sa main ouverte. Ensuite, tu casses la lumière pour que le client ne puisse pas voir la poudre. Il sortit un tournevis de sa poche et indiqua la lampe au-dessus de l'appareil. - Tu te caches plus loin et quand quelqu'un entre à l'intérieur, tu vas voir quels numéros il a touché. Une fois que tu connais les chiffres, tu essaie toutes les combinaisons jusqu'à ce que tu trouves la bonne. Mais attention. Une fois par heure, et pas plus d'une minute à la fois. Compris ? Mathilda hocha la tête. - Dans le deuxième cas, tu n'as pas le temps, dit Léon en levant le tournevis. Il démonta rapidement le couvercle pour mettre le mécanisme à nu. - Il y a toujours quatre fils, tu vois ? dit-il en les lui montrant. Mathilda se retourna subitement. Un homme dans la quarantaine entreprenait de monter l'escalier, il leva la tête et les regarda surpris. - Puis-je ? dit-il en indiquant le clavier. - Pardon, dit Léon en regardant le nouveau venu. Laisse-le passer, ajouta-t-il pour Mathilda. Léon déverrouilla la porte en jouant dans les fils démontés. L'homme avança la main vers la poignée mais, tandis que Léon s'apprêtait à reprendre ses explications, il dévisagea le duo en fronçant les sourcils. - Excusez-moi mais que faites vous ? demanda-t-il. - J'enseigne à la jeune fille, répondit Léon comme si c'était l'évidence même. - Vous lui enseignez comment contourner la sécurité ?! s'insurgea-t-il. Vous vous foutez de ma gueule ou quoi ? Allez-vous en avant que j'appelle la police ! L'homme fouilla nerveusement dans une poche et en sortit un bombe de poivre mais il n'eut pas le temps de s'en servir. Une balle silencieuse troua la main qui tenait la bombe. La force du coup de feu le fit aussitôt tourner sur lui-même et Léon lui tira dans le dos, ce qui accentua le mouvement et le fit passer par-dessus le garde-fou qui entourait le porche. L'homme disparut dans les buissons sans un bruit. Stupéfiée, Mathilda fixa l'endroit où l'homme venait de disparaître tandis que Léon jetait un coup d'œil aux alentours. Satisfait, il reprit son cours. - Alors … il y a un fil au fond du boîtier et il suffit d'essayer de connecter les trois autres fils un par un. La porte grésilla au second fil et Léon sourit. - Simple n'est-ce pas ? Mathilda hocha la tête, l'air ailleurs. - Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? Je n'ai pas l'impression que tu es concentrée. - Oui, oui. La jeune fille s'approcha du garde-fou et se pencha au-dessus des buissons. - C'est incroyable ! Comment tu as fait ça ? - Quoi? - Là, le gars … Comment tu as fait ? Tu l'as poussé en bas sans le toucher, sans même faire de bruit. Comment tu fais ça ? Léon releva la tête fièrement. - Ça t'a plu ? Mathilda leva les yeux vers lui avec tout le sérieux imaginable. - C'était génial. Léon lui sourit et lui indiqua les escaliers. La leçon était terminée. Mathilda descendit tandis que Léon jetait un coup d'œil aux alentours. Il la rejoignit et leurs silhouettes disparurent silencieusement dans la nuit.[Chapter 4] Droit d'auteur : Cette scène -la suite de la précédente- est tirée de la première version du scénario et elle appartient à Luc Besson. Fred Astair dansait sur l'écran du cinéma, en faisant jaillir des étincelles sous ses talons, comme d'habitude. - Regarde ses mouvements, dit Léon à Mathilda assis dans le siège à côté du sien. Quoi qu'il dise, quoi qu'il fasse, il ne s'arrête jamais. Tu vois ? Qu'il soit triste ou heureux, le mouvement continue toujours. Fred Astaire fit une pirouette, tourna sur une chaise, grimpa sur un mur et sauta sur le sofa. - Regarde. Même le mur ne l'arrête pas. Le mouvement se poursuit. Il utilise tout. Le sol, le mur, sa course, son poids. Toute la vie est un mouvement et la mort en fait partie. Mathilda écoutait attentivement les explications. - Tu vois, il faut laisser le client continuer le mouvement qu'il a commencé. Et c'est mieux pour lui. Il pense à autre choses et ne voit pas la mort arriver. Fred Astair glissa gracieusement le long d'un bureau de bois verni puis entraîné par son élan, se mit à tournoyer joyeusement sur le parquet. - Il n'a pas le temps de souffrir. Il n'est pas surpris. Il n'a même pas le temps de penser. Il part sans le réaliser. Il part dans le mouvement qu'il a commencé. La jeune fille regarda l'écran les yeux pétillants. - C'est génial.[Chapter 5] - Alors vous travaillez tous les deux, c'est ça ? demanda Paul Risotto en croisant les bras. Mathilda et Léon hochèrent la tête de concert devant le bureau tout à fait ordinaire où Paul Risotto recevait les clients de son entreprise d'importation. - Écoutez, Tony m'a demandé de trouver du boulot pour un pro mais …, dit Risotto en écartant largement les mains. Sans vouloir vous froisser, je ne fais pas affaire avec les enfants. - Je ne suis pas une enfant, dit la jeune fille comme si elle était habituée de longue date à ce type d'erreur sur la personne. - Quel âge tu as ? - Je fais plus jeune que mon âge mais c'est … - Très jeune, coupa Risotto sceptique. - … Mais c'est un avantage. Un avantage précieux, continua Mathilda très sûre d'elle. Léon la regarda surpris tandis que Risotto, croisait les bras à nouveau, tout de même curieux de voir ce qu'elle allait bien pouvoir lui sortir pour tenter de le convaincre. - Si je cognais à votre porte en pleurant parce que je suis tombée, que je suis blessée et qu'il faut que j'appelle ma mère, est-ce que vous me laisseriez entrer monsieur Risotto ? demanda-t-elle en le fixant. Le malfrat la regarda en plissant les yeux. - De tous les pros de la ville, je suis la seule qui réussirait à vous faire faire quelque chose d'aussi stupide, vous ne croyez pas ? Mathilda posa ses bras croisés sur le bureau en se penchant vers lui. - En fait, de toute la ville, je suis la seule qui peut réussir un coup pareil. Elle se pencha d'avantage. - Des dizaines de types pas plus idiots que vous m'ont ouvert la porte et vous savez quoi ? Ils ne sont plus là pour en parler. Le mafieux la regardait attentivement tandis qu'elle se reculait dans sa chaise. - Alors ? Vous ne croyez pas qu'il serait plus prudent de m'avoir de votre côté ? dit-elle en haussant des sourcils innocents. Léon, visiblement nerveux, regardait alternativement Risotto et Mathilda qui se jaugeaient du regard. Paul Risotto partit soudain d'un grand éclat de rire et menaça la jeune fille d'un doigt amusé. - Tu me plais bien petite Signorina. Mathilda lui sourit. D'un sourire de pro. - Où tu l'as trouvé cette petite, demanda-t-il à Léon. - Devant ma porte, répondit-il mal à l'aise. - C'est une longue histoire, dit Mathilda nullement intéressée à aborder le sujet. Risotto les regarda un instant et hocha la tête. Il baissa les yeux et ouvrit un des tiroirs du bureau. Il fouilla parmi des papiers et sortit une enveloppe jaune qu'il glissa vers eux. - Une semaine, dit-il en frais d'explications.[Chapter 6] - Je suis prête. Je veux le faire ! - Non. L'homme dans la quarantaine, ses mains tremblantes levées devant lui regarda alternativement la jeune fille qui le pointait de son arme et l'homme aux lunettes noires en essayant de trouver un échappatoire. - Je vous en prie, c'est une erreur ! - Je vais devoir leur balancer du ketchup longtemps ? Léon ignora sa question tandis que le client continuait ses jérémiades. - Combien ? Je vous en donne le double ! Le triple ! - Tu sais que j'en suis capable. - Ce n'est pas la question. - Non ! Non ! S'il vous plaît ! pleura le dealer. - On est partenaires maintenant. C'est mon client aussi ! - Laisse tomber. - C'est moi qui ai réussi à avoir ce contrat ! - Je dirais plutôt que tu as failli me le faire perdre. - J'ai un sac de caché ici. Une livre ! Vous ne la trouverez jamais sans moi ! tenta le revendeur désespéré. - S'il te plaît ! implora Mathilda. - Non. Elle baissa les yeux en soupirant, leva son arme et d'une main sûre, tira sur le client qui cria de surprise. Léon finit le travail une seconde plus tard. - On va au resto ? Il reste plus rien, annonça la jeune fille en se désintéressant de leur cible. - Chinois ? - Parfait pour moi, dit Mathilda en rangeant son inoffensif pistolet derrière sa ceinture.[Chapter 7] Norman Stansfield passa dans le couloir juste au bon moment. Dans le bureau de Parker, Lewis et Nelson regardaient des photos. Stansfield entendit quelques phrases qui s'échappaient de la porte ouverte. - On a déjà vu ça sur le territoire des italiens. … Ça pourrait être Tony ? - Le 32 nous l'a envoyé au cas mais il y en a eu chez les mexicains aussi alors ça ne veut probablement rien dire, dit Lewis. Stansfield mit les freins et recula. - J'ai entendu parler de Tony ? demanda-t-il en vrillant ses pupilles dilatées sur eux. Les policiers se figèrent et la température baissa de quelques degrés. Même dans les commissariats les plus reculés de la ville, on savait que tout ce qui concernait Tony de près ou de loin devait être rapporté à Stansfield dans la seconde. - J'allais te le dire tu penses bien ! se défendit aussitôt Nelson. Le commissariat 32 vient de nous envoyer ça, dit-il en lui tendant les photos comme on jette un os à un chien pour éviter qu'il vous morde. Stansfield les lui arracha presque des mains tout en regardant Lewis d'un air qui n'augurait rien de bon. - Ça vient de Los Angeles. Le cadavre avait des traces de peinture rouge sur sa veste. On a eu une dizaine de cas ici. On dirait que le tueur se fait des cibles avant de tirer… Mais c'est évident que c'est un travail de pro, dit Nelson en jetant un coup d'œil nerveux à Lewis. - On … hum … on avait trouvé ça bizarre mais comme ça avait tout l'air de contrats réglos … On n'a pas insisté, expliqua ce dernier. Stansfield semblait absorbé par les photos du cadavre. Ses mâchoires se crispaient à intervalles réguliers, signe qu'il valait mieux se tenir le plus loin possible de l'endroit où il se trouvait. Les policiers se regardèrent avec inquiétude. - Tu sais comment ils sont à Los Angeles. De vrais paranos, dit Lewis avec un rire qui sonnait faux. - Ils ont envoyé ça partout pour voir si quelqu'un reconnaît la signature du tueur, ajouta Nelson. Un silence pesant et inconfortable tomba sur la pièce tandis que Stansfield immobile caressait les photos avec le pouce. La symphonie éclata soudainement dans sa tête. Les cordes vibrèrent à l'unisson, le piano martela les notes, les vents soufflèrent et la grosse caisse explosa de coups furieux. - Tu as une idée de ce que ça peut-être ? demanda Lewis. - Un entraînement … murmura Stansfield. Le psychopathe tourna ses yeux de prédateur vers les agents qui tentèrent de disparaître dans leurs sièges. - Je veux avoir tout le dossier sur mon bureau dans trois minutes, dit-il d'une voix terriblement calme. Plus inquiets que s'il leur avait hurlé dessus, les policiers se levèrent aussitôt pour accomplir la tâche. Stansfield tourna les talons tandis qu'une symphonie délicieuse se déchaînait sous son crâne. Les archets mordaient dans les violons, les hautbois se cabraient avec violence, le piano frappa à grand coup de marteau et les tambours grondèrent comme la foudre qui se prépare. Les notes frénétiques s'emmêlaient les unes aux autres dans une chaîne pleine de logique. La symphonie de Montana... Il s'immobilisa soudain. - Pas un mot à Los Angeles, dit-il en fourrant des écouteurs dans ses oreilles.[Chapter 8] Mathilda finit de frotter le Colt et le remit en place dans la valise ouverte sur la table. Elle jeta un coup d'œil à Léon qui regardait attentivement au travers un silencieux. - Tu sais quel jour on est ? dit-elle négligemment. - Mmm. - C'est mon anniversaire. Léon cessa son examen pour la regarder. - Bon anniversaire, dit-il en retournant à son ouvrage. Mathilda tapota des doigts sur la table, tout de même déçue de sa réaction. - Tu sais quel âge j'ai ? Léon souffla dans le tube meurtrier et regarda à l'intérieur à nouveau. - Dix-huit ans ? Mathilda pouffa tandis que Léon lui souriait en coin. - J'ai droit à un cadeau d'anniversaire. Tu sais ça tout de même. - Je n'ai rien pour toi. Je ne savais pas que c'était ton anniversaire. Léon se mit à fouiller parmi les divers items de nettoyages étalés sur la table et Mathilda se recula au fond de sa chaise avec un air mutin. - Improvise, suggéra-t-elle. Léon saisit un fil de fer garni de poils rêches. - Qu'est-ce que tu voudrais ? demanda-t-il en redressant les poils avec l'ongle de son pouce. - Un baiser, dit-elle avec un sourire suggestif. - Non. - Pourquoi pas ? Léon la regarda l'air de dire que ça ne valait même pas la peine d'y penser. Mathilda s'adossa à nouveau, guère surprise. - Très bien … mais il faut tout de même que tu m'offre quelque chose. C'est la tradition. Ce manquement à l'étiquette ne sembla pas émouvoir le tueur qui s'appliquait à curer le silencieux avec vigueur. - Mmmmm, fit-elle en posant un doigt sur son menton. Je sais ! Elle avança ses coudes sur la table en le fixant. - Dis-moi quelque chose en italien. - Quelque chose comme quoi ? demanda Léon en scrutant l'intérieur du tube pour juger de son ramonage. - Je ne sais pas, dit-elle en haussant les épaules. Un poème ? - Je n'en connais pas … À part un, dit-il comme pour lui-même en soufflant dans le cylindre d'acier. - Parfait. Je t'écoute, dit-elle en se relevant sur la chaise. Léon réalisa qu'il venait de se mettre dans de beaux draps. - Je ne sais même pas si je me rappelle …, dit-il en jetant un dernier coup d'œil à son ouvrage. Il rangea le silencieux dans son compartiment en réfléchissant tandis que la jeune fille s'adossait confortablement. - Sei il mio solo … , dit-il en levant les yeux au plafond d'un air concentré. Il s'immobilisa et son visage s'assombrit comme s'il réalisait soudain que c'était une très mauvaise idée. Hésitant, il regarda Mathilda qui attendait patiemment. Il se trémoussa sur sa chaise et détourna les yeux comme s'il ne pouvait pas se décider. La jeune fille haussa les sourcils. - Alors ? Il leva vers elle un visage si grave et sérieux qu'elle regretta presque de lui avoir demandé ce poème. Puis l'ombre d'un sourire triste passa sur ses lèvres. Ses traits s'adoucirent et ses yeux devinrent rêveurs. Il la regarda comme s'il la voyait pour la première fois. Mathilda se sentit fondre sous ce regard tendre qu'elle ne lui connaissait pas. - Sei il mio solo amore, dit-il de sa voix grave. Dei miei giovani ai miei vecchi giorni. Il la regardait d'une telle manière … Mathilda frissonna comme devant un serment. - Ma per il momento, murmura-t-il alors que ses yeux s'embuaient, Tutto cio che devo ti offrire. Il marqua un temps, comme pour se remémorer la suite. - È un poco di calore. Ed un posto nel mio cuore. Il la regarda comme on regarde une personne chère, une personne irremplaçable … - Ti amo, dit-il doucement. Puis il baissa les yeux. Il avait composé ce poème sans avoir pu l'offrir. Il y avait longtemps, à une époque où l'amour et les parfums de l'Italie l'avait enivré. Un silence feutré flotta un instant au-dessus des armes qui reposaient entre eux puis Léon brisa le charme en saisissant un semi-automatique. Mathilda leva sur lui des yeux brillants. - C'est le plus beau cadeau que j'ai jamais eu. Léon sourit timidement en prenant une lime. - Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ? demanda-t-elle. - Ça veut dire, bon anniversaire. Tu es mon seul amour de mes jeunes à mes vieux jours mais pour l'instant tout ce que j'ai à t'offrir c'est un peu de chaleur et une place dans mon coeur je t'aime (Je n'ai pas réussi à trouver le nom de l'auteur)[Chapter 9] - Robert Jackson ? L'inspecteur Jackson leva la tête pour dévisager l'homme qui venait d'entrouvrir la porte de son bureau. - Oui ? - Normand Stansfield, DEA, New York. Vous avez une minute ? Jackson se leva en lui faisant signe d'entrer. - Bonjour. Je peux faire quelque chose pour vous ? demanda le gros policier à lunettes en lui serrant mollement la main. Les secousses de la grosse main moite ressemblaient à des plaintes pathétiques et visqueuses produites par un basson déprimé. Fooouonfooouon. Stansfield sourit dégoûté et s'assit sans attendre d'invitation. - J'espère Robert, j'espère vraiment. L'inspecteur se rassit en le dévisageant. Norman croisa la jambe et joignit les mains sur son genou, très à l'aise. - Je viens pour le tueur à la peinture. C'est votre dossier n'est-ce pas ? - Le tueur à la peinture ? Ah oui ! Heu … vous n'êtes pas du DEA ? Qu'est-ce que les stups ont à voir avec ce dossier ? - Il se trouve qu'il y a un certain lien. - Ha oui ? Pourtant New York ne m'a rien envoyé à propos de cette affaire à moins que …, commença-t-il en fouillant dans une pile de dossier. - Non, dit Stansfield en levant la main. Inutile de chercher. Cette affaire est quelque peu personnelle. Jackson fronça les sourcils l'air méfiant. Le psychopathe lui sourit poliment. - Jetez un coup d'œil, dit-il en lançant une enveloppe jaune sur le bureau. L'enveloppe fila jusqu'au policier, accrocha son ventre proéminant et tomba à terre. Jackson se pencha péniblement pour la ramasser tandis que Stanfield, excédé, levait les yeux au ciel. Le basson imaginaire poussait maintenant des vents aux accents intestinaux qui empuantissaient ses oreilles. ProoooouuhhProoouh. Le policier ouvrit l'enveloppe, en sortit des photos et blanchit soudainement. La première le montrait sur le trottoir en train de contrôler un jeune homme court vêtu, évidemment prostitué. Sur la seconde, on les voyait disparaître dans la ruelle et la troisième les montrait cachés derrière un container en train de … - Je ne savais pas que les homicides étaient chargés de nettoyer les trottoirs, dit Stansfield tandis que le basson faisait maintenant entendre des souffles pimpants et joyeux, nettement plus agréables. POMpomPOMpomPOM … Jackson remit les photos dans l'enveloppe d'une main tremblante. - Ce salopard a tué mes meilleurs hommes ; MES. HOMMES. ! hurla-t-il soudain. Et dix policiers par-dessus le marché, ajouta-t-il d'un ton léger comme s'il parlait de simples dommages collatéraux. - La tuerie de Houston Street ? demanda l'inspecteur d'une voix tremblante. Norman hocha la tête en plantant ses pupilles vitreuses dans celle de l'inspecteur. - Houston Street, exactement. - Dans … dans ce cas… je crains que l'affaire soit transférée au DEA, couina Jackson en jutant par tous les pores. Stansfield sourit avec indulgence. - Non-non-non-non. Justement. Non, dit-il en hochant la tête d'un air enjoué. PAS DU TOUT ! hurla-t-il en frappant sur le bureau. Jackson sursauta comme un basson qui couinerait une fausse note. poUIIII. - Je n'aime pas beaucoup le chef de la division de Los Angeles, expliqua Stansfield posément. Il est un peu trop crispé. Il se leva en s'appuyant sur le bureau pour dévisager Jackson à deux pouces du nez. - Vous gardez cette affaire et vous allez me le retrouver sinon vous ne vous ferez plus jamais faire de pipe derrière les poubelles, chuchota-t-il plein de malveillance. Est-ce que je me suis bien fait comprendre ? POMpomPOMpomPOM Stansfield se releva, satisfait. Il fouilla dans sa mallette en chantonnant et sortit une pile de feuille qu'il déposa tendrement sur le bureau. - C'est tout ce que vous avez besoin de savoir, dit-il en appuyant son index sur le dossier. Faites les liens qui s'imposent et trouvez-moi pour qui travaille ce salopard. Jackson hocha la tête. - Vous m'informez quotidiennement. Jackson opina du bonnet à nouveau. - Merci inspecteur. J'apprécie grandement votre aide, le salua-t-il en ouvrant la porte. Il traversa le commissariat alors que la symphonie qui se déchaînait derrière ses oreilles depuis qu'il avait retrouvé la trace de Montana, reprenait de plus belle. Comme s'il avait ajouté de toutes nouvelles lignes à la partition, le basson était maintenant en vedette dans les enchaînements, apportant quelque chose d'enjoué et de guilleret. POMpomPOMpomPOM.[Chapter 10] Mathilda observa le client entrer dans le fast food et regarder le menu derrière le comptoir. Elle écrasa la cigarette qu'elle fumait pour se donner une raison d'être là et retourna derrière le restaurant. - Il fait comme d'habitude. Léon, presque invisible dans la pénombre, hocha la tête. - On y va. Ils se dirigèrent vers le stationnement plongé dans la pénombre grâce à une balle logée dans l'ampoule du lampadaire la veille et choisirent la Chevrolet grise. Léon mit la main sous son manteau et en sortit une tige de fer qu'il tendit à la jeune fille. Elle la glissa entre la vitre et la porte tandis que Léon faisait le guet. - Merde j'y arrive pas, chuchota-t-elle en s'activant. - Le loquet est plus à droite sur les Chevrolet. - Ha. Ça y est … dit-elle alors que la serrure jouait avec un déclic sourd. Ils se faufilèrent sur le siège arrière et refermèrent la portière ni vu, ni connu. - Quand on fait le coup du siège arrière, il faut se placer comme ça, dit-il en s'accroupissant derrière le banc du passager. On baisse la tête et on attend. - Comme ça ? demanda Mathilda en l'imitant. - Oui. Fais toujours attention de t'habiller en foncé. Un seul bas blanc qui dépasse et il peut te voir. - Okay. - Quand il arrive, tu le laisse s'asseoir et sans te relever – parce qu'il te verrait dans le rétroviseur – tu lèves le fusil et tu vise la nuque sous l'appuie-tête, comme ça. Mathilda copia ses gestes derrière le banc du conducteur et Léon approuva. - Et si l'appuie-tête est baissé ? - Là, c'est plus compliqué. Il ne faut pas tirer derrière la tête parce que la balle peut traverser et lui faire exploser le nez comme une pastèque. Mathilda pouffa. - On va sur le côté comme ça, montra-t-il en contournant l'appuie-tête avec son arme. Il faut l'avoir dans les vertèbres du cou. Mais il peut te voir du coin de l'œil alors il faut faire vite et être précis. C'est un coup assez difficile. La jeune fille hocha la tête et tenta quelques tirs imaginaires. - Ça va. Maintenant, on attend. Une quinzaine de minutes plus tard, l'homme d'une trentaine d'année en T-shirt et blue jeans, sortit du restaurant et sauta dans sa voiture sans être averti par aucun pressentiment. Alors qu'il introduisait la clef dans le contact, quelque chose percuta sa nuque en laissant une impression de mouillé. Il cria de surprise. - Ne bouge pas. L'homme se retourna et aperçut une forme noire à l'arrière. Il leva les mains en respirant bruyamment. - Prenez tout ce que vous voulez ! J'ai cent doll… - La ferme, dit Léon en étirant le bras pour saisir l'arme que le client cachait sous sa veste. - Penche-toi en avant, ordonna t'il - D'ac … d'accord mais ne me faites pas de mal … Il se pencha tandis que Léon et Mathilda étiraient le cou pour voir le résultat du tir. - Pas mal mais c'est un poil trop penché. Tu dois tenir ton arme plus droite. - Okay. - Essaie le tir de côté maintenant. - Replacez-vous s'il vous plaît, demanda Mathilda. - Quoi ? Mais qu'est-ce que vous … ? - Ne discute pas, dit Léon en lui fourrant son arme dans les côtes. - C'est bon ! Ne tirez pas ! Je me replace, dit l'homme de plus en plus nerveux. Mathilda leva l'arme lentement et la positionna de côté. - Non, non, non. Tu dois faire beaucoup plus vite. Regarde. Léon se servit de son siège comme démonstrateur il leva l'arme lentement puis la tourna d'un coup vif vers le client imaginaire. - Qui vous envoie ? C'est Gino hein. C'est ça ? C'est pour sa sœur ? - Je n'en sais rien. Vas-y Math. Mathilda reprit l'enchaînement. - C'est mieux, approuva Léon. Tire maintenant. - NON ! Attendez ! - Ce n'est que de la peinture dit la jeune fille. Ça ne vous fera rien. - Qu'est-ce que vous faites ? C'est une blague ? C'est … - La ferme ! dirent les équipiers en chœur. Mathilda releva l'arme à nouveau, la tourna rapidement et tira. La peinture éclaboussa la vitre de la portière. - C'est difficile avec le silencieux … - Je te l'avais dit. - Écoutez, on peut s'arranger d'accord. C'est vraiment injuste, ce type je ne lui ai rien fait. Il délire … - J'ai dit, la ferme. L'homme se tut en sentant le bout d'un silencieux contre sa tempe. - Vas-y. Mathilda tira dans la vitre à nouveau puis dans l'oreille et sur la joue avant d'attraper le coup de main et réussir à toucher près des vertèbres. Lorsqu'elle eut réussi quelques fois de suite, Léon finit le travail en achevant le pauvre client qui commençait à devenir inutilisable tellement il était proche de la crise de nerf. Ils sortirent de la voiture en prenant soin d'effacer les quelques empruntes qu'ils avaient pu laisser et disparurent dans la nuit pour rejoindre le métro le plus près. - Tu sais, on a pas le choix pour que tu apprennes mais il ne faut pas inquiéter les clients comme ça normalement, dit Léon assis sur son banc. Mieux vaut qu'ils ne sachent pas ce qui leur arrive. - Oui, je sais. - Tu dois être comme une ombre. - Invisible, approuva-t-elle. - Comme si tu n'avais jamais existée. Mathilda regarda le tunnel par la vitre en souriant. - On est un peu comme des héros avec des supers-pouvoirs. - Non. Ils étaient des nettoyeurs. Rien de plus, rien de moins.[Chapter 11] L'inspecteur Robert Jackson conduisit Norman Stansfield et ses deux adjoints patibulaires au hangar où étaient garées les voitures examinées par les homicides. Il ouvrit la porte de l'entrepôt, vide à cette heure, et laissa passer les agents du DEA devant lui, visiblement peu emballé par leur visite. - Écoutez, je ne comprends pas pourquoi vous teniez à venir voir vous-même. Il y a de la peinture et c'est tout, dit Jackson d'un air revêche. - Oui mais les photos ont quelque chose de tellement froid n'est-ce pas, dit Stansfield en regardant l'immense hangar d'un air enjoué. Haaaa. Quel endroit ! Alors où est-elle. - Là-bas, dit l'inspecteur en soupirant. Stansfield le suivit et ses déhanchements de manchots firent apparaître une nouvelle fois des notes du basson dans la tête du policier dément. FouonFouonFouon. Stansfield sourit. Il avait envie de voir cette voiture. Cela lui donnait l'impression de s'approcher un peu de ses proies et franchement, après tant de semaines sans nouvelles, il en avait grand besoin. - Là. Jackson pointait une Chevrolet grise. La vitre du conducteur avait reçue deux balles de peinture rouge bien nette. Jackson s'appuya contre un mini-van et croisa les bras. Son fauteuil ergonomique lui manquait visiblement. Stansfield ouvrit la portière arrière et regarda à l'intérieur en souriant. La symphonie de Montana jaillit de ses oreilles comme si on avait branché la radio à plein volume. Ils s'étaient trouvés là la veille. Juste la veille. La piste était bien chaude. - Il était là, au fond. Pas vrai ? demanda Stansfield en pointant le derrière du siège passager. - C'est ce qu'on croit mais il est tôt pour le dire. Les balles semblaient venir de là. Mais les billes de peintures … - … Venaient de derrière le siège du conducteur, termina l'agent du DEA en caressant le siège arrière. - Ouaip. - Alors Mathilda … chuchota-t-il comme si il voyait la jeune fille prostrée derrière le siège. Tu as raté ton coup ? Il t'a fallu plusieurs fois pas vrai ? C'était difficile ? Les notes aigues d'une flute imaginaire lui répondirent. Les hommes de Stansfield firent ceux qui n'avaient rien entendu tandis que Jackson regardait ailleurs, mal à l'aise. Ce foutu connard était complètement timbré. - Et toi Montana ? Tu lui donnais de bons conseils … Avant de te l'envoyer sur le capot peut-être ? Après tout c'est ta petite élève. Le violoncelle grave et nerveux fit vibrer l'habitacle en haletant de coups d'archet. La flute s'y mêla joyeusement et Stansfield sourit. Il se releva en tapant dans ses mains et regarda Jackson de ses yeux exorbités. - Et à part ça, qu'est-ce qu'on a ? - En fait … pas grand-chose. Pas d'empreintes, pas d'arme … juste la peinture. … Et le cadavre. Stansfield hocha la tête d'un air désolé. - Robert … J'ai l'impression que tu ne fais pas beaucoup d'efforts, dit-il en relevant la tête. Je t'ai expliqué pourtant l'importance de cette affaire. - Écoutez, je fais de mon mieux. Je vous ai averti tout de suite. - Avec six heures de retard en fait, spécifia Stansfield en levant le doigt. - J'ai juste pris le temps de m'assurer que … - Kelly. Le dénommé Kelly s'avança vers Jackson, saisit sa main et retourna le petit doigt. Peu ému par les cris de la victime, il appuya d'avantage et plus encore si bien qu'on finit par entendre un craquement sinistre au travers les hurlements de l'inspecteur. - Et voilà ce qui arrive …, dit Stansfield avec regrets. Kelly lâcha sa prise et l'inspecteur gémissant cacha sa main sous son bras comme pour la soustraire à ces maniaques. - Y a t-il besoin d'encouragements supplémentaires ? demanda aimablement Stansfield. Le policier secoua la tête avec frayeur. - Bien. J'attends un rapport complet pour demain soir. - C'est impossible … plaida l'inspecteur. - QU'EST-CE QUE TU NE COMPRENDS PAS DANS «DEMAIN SOIR» CONNARD ! hurla Stansfield. Kelly, explique-lui. - NON ! Demain … demain soir … D'accord. - Tu vois, quand tu veux …, dit Stansfield en souriant. Sans plus de commentaire, il tourna les talons en claquant des doigts et ses molosses le suivirent comme des chiens obéissants. Jackson entendit la porte se fermer en tremblant de soulagement. Il se laissa glisser par terre en tenant sa main blessée contre lui, tout en prenant la pleine mesure du merdier dans lequel il était fourré.[Chapter 12] Mathilda regardait l'écran distraitement quand elle vit apparaître un nom inoubliable. - Léon ! C'est John Wayne ! - C'est quel film ? demanda-t-il en relevant la tête de la bande dessinée qui faisait office de devoir de la semaine. - Je sais pas, j'ai juste vu son nom apparaître. - La rivière rouge ! C'est excellent. Tu vas voir ! dit-il en se levant d'un air joyeux. - On pourrait se faire du popcorn, dit-elle alors qu'il s'asseyait sur le divan. - Mmmm, répondit Léon captivé par l'écran. Elle se leva et l'œil de Léon fut attiré par une anomalie sur le coussin. Il fronça les sourcils en regardant la jeune fille qui se dirigeait vers la cuisine. Il se leva comme un ressort. - Mathilda … Elle se tourna, surprise par le ton de sa voix. Léon était debout, blême et catastrophé. Elle prit presque peur. - Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? chuchota-t-elle, craignant presque qu'un monstre se trouve derrière elle tellement il avait l'air bizarre. Les mains de Léon se mirent à trembler. Il semblait incapable de répondre. - Quoi ? dit-elle effrayée. - Qui t'as fait ça ? dit-il d'une voix blanche. - Que … quoi ? - Qui t'a fait ça ! répéta-t-il - Quoi ça ? - Ça ! dit-il en pointant sa chemise de nuit. La jeune fille baissa les yeux sur le vêtement mais ne vit rien d'extraordinaire. - Derrière. Matilda tira la robe pour voir l'arrière et vit une tache de sang. Elle resta interloquée … - Chiava il santo, murmura Léon plus pâle que la mort. Je vais le tuer ce salopard. La jeune fille réalisa soudain de quoi il retournait. Ça y est, c'était le grand jour ! - Pourquoi tu ne m'as rien dit ? demanda-t-il sous le choc. Matilda le regarda un instant sans comprendre. - Qui t'as touché ? gronda-t-il. - Hein ? - QUI ?! cria-t-il hors de lui. Mathilda réussit à comprendre qu'il croyait que quelqu'un l'avait … Elle pouffa de rire et Léon fronça les sourcils, pris au dépourvu. - Tu es blessée ! s'indigna-il comme pour lui rendre la raison. - Non, c'est pas … tenta t'elle, mais son air d'enterrement l'empêcha de continuer. C'est pas ce que tu crois …, dit-elle en s'étouffant de rire. C'est juste … HAHAHA ! Léon la fixa stupéfait. Matilda aurait bien voulu lui expliquer mais il faisait une de ces têtes… Elle ne réussit qu'à éclater de rire. Léon se dit qu'elle devait faire une crise de nerf. Il s'approcha d'elle et se pencha à sa hauteur. - Math, regarde-moi, dit-il doucement. Elle le regarda mais cela ne fit qu'augmenter son fou-rire. - Tu as besoin de soins. On va aller voir Risotto d'accord …, dit Léon en en la tenant gentiment par les épaules. - Quelle … Pfff, quelle bonne … idée, HAHAHA ! Mathilda se laissa glisser sur le sol et se roula par terre en hurlant de rire. - J'imagine … Hihi ! J'imagine …. trop sa tête … Hahaha ! Léon la regarda avec inquiétude et Mathilda rit de plus belle, tellement il avait l'air pitoyable. Elle finit par reprendre son calme et essuya les larmes qui roulaient sur ses joues. Elle se releva à moitié et le regarda en essayant de contrôler son fou-rire - C'est normal, dit-elle encore secouée de rire. Léon la regarda d'un air inintelligent. - Toutes les femmes ont ça. Visiblement il allait lui falloir un cours d'anatomie complet. - Les femmes saignent à chaque mois. Et ça veut dire qu'à partir d'aujourd'hui, je suis une femme et plus une gamine. Tu comprends ? Léon, toujours debout au milieu du salon, ne semblait pas vraiment certain de la mécanique de la chose. - Tu … tu n'es pas blessée ? Personne ne t'a … tu sais … - Non, dit-elle parfaitement sûre d'elle. Léon se ressaisit mais il semblait toujours grandement troublé. - Arrête avec ton air d'outre-tombe. Tu dois plutôt me féliciter. - Euh … Te féliciter parce que tu saignes ? - Me féliciter parce que je suis une femme maintenant, dit-elle avec une certaine fierté. Elle le dévisagea avec un sourire malicieux. - Ça veut aussi dire que tu dois aller me chercher des serviettes sinon, je vais en mettre partout. Léon eut un mouvement de recul. Il n'avait aucune envie d'être mêlé à quoi que ce soit concernant cet évènement mystifiant. Avec son air complètement largué, rien de plus réjouissant que de l'imaginer en train d'essayer de débusquer l'allée des tampons, rester paralysé de terreur devant les dizaines de boîtes vantant les degrés d'absorption ; follement mal à l'aise, piger n'importe quoi au hasard et presque mourir de gêne devant le regard moqueur de la caissière. - Hahaha ! Ce serait vraiment … HAHAHAHAHA ! Léon, complètement dépassé, laissa la jeune fille hurler de rire en se roulant de nouveau par terre. Il se gratta la barbe en l'observant un instant puis secoua la tête en se disant, comme bien d'autres avant lui, que les femmes venaient sûrement d'une autre planète.[Chapter 13] Stansfield regardait les dizaines de photos qui couvraient son bureau, les yeux exorbités. Le duo avait frappé trois fois depuis l'affaire de la Chevrolet grise. Huit contrats en tout et toujours aucun indice probant sur l'employeur de Montana et sa petite trainée d'élève. L'inspecteur Jackson avait malencontreusement perdu un doigt pour l'inciter à se montrer un peu plus compétent mais les résultats se faisaient encore attendre. Il y avait d'interminables mois maintenant qu'il attendait patiemment et il se dit qu'il était peut-être temps pour Jackson de se faire amputer un œil. Norman balaya les photos rageusement. Tandis qu'elles volaient dans tous les sens, il sortit une petite gélule de sa boîte et l'avala aussi sec. Il attendit la délivrance mais au-delà de l'effet habituel, elle ne lui fit aucun bien et il soupira. Il avait besoin d'autre chose pour se calmer les nerfs. Il sortit en trombe du bureau et attrapa John Ming qui passait dans le couloir. - Carlos …, il avait jusqu'à quand pour nous payer ? dit-il en agrippant la manche de l'agent spécial. - Hein ? Heu … Stansfield soupira excédé. Son équipe n'arrivait pas à la cheville de l'ancienne et il avait d'autant plus envie de faire sa fête à ce salopard de Montana. Une envie grandement frustrée dans les circonstances. - Demain … Demain, six heure. - On y va tout de suite. - … - QU'EST-CE QUE TU ATTENDS ?! Ming s'en fut au pas de course rassembler les éléments indispensables à l'entreprise. Stansfield leva les yeux au ciel en essayant de faire retentir la symphonie de Montana à ses oreilles, question d'être gonflé à bloc pour faire sa fête à ce petit merdeux de Carlos. Malheureusement, depuis plus d'un an et demi maintenant, la symphonie s'était doucement affadie, tombant dans les limbes, faute d'éléments excitants à y ajouter. Il était plus que temps de faire quelque chose.[Chapter 14] Léon regarda par la fenêtre en passant dans la cuisine et s'arrêta brusquement. Mathilda était en bas, au beau milieu de la ruelle sombre et à vrai dire, il était difficile de la manquer. Mini-shorts, camisole roulée le plus haut possible, longue botte qui montait jusqu'aux genoux … Elle avait l'air d'une véritable ... Léon fronça les sourcils. À côté d'elle un jeune homme noir beaucoup plus âgé, faisait des mines en bombant le torse. Léon colla pratiquement son nez à la vitre pour mieux l'apercevoir. Il avait l'air d'un dealer ou d'un foutu criminel avec ses dreadlocks et ses pantalons à moitié descendus. Une petite frappe sans envergure et un danger public. Le misérable sortit un paquet de sa poche, l'ouvrit et tendit une cigarette à Mathilda. Elle accepta avec un sourire. Le jeune homme indiqua le bout de la ruelle et Mathilda hocha la tête. À la grande horreur de Léon, ils s'éloignèrent en discutant avec animation et le garçon en profita pour passer négligemment un bras possessif autour de ses épaules. - MATHILDA ! La jeune fille se retourna. La silhouette menaçante du tueur barrait l'entrée de la ruelle et il ne semblait pas du tout de bonne humeur. Mathilda baissa la tête pour cacher son sourire victorieux. - C'est qui lui ? demanda le jeune homme sans faire mine de retirer son bras des épaules de sa conquête. - Il faut que j'y aille, dit-elle en éludant sa question. Léon fulminait en se retenant pour ne pas tirer dans la gueule de ce petit con question qu'il ôte ses pattes vite fait. Mais Mathilda ne semblait pas pressée d'en finir. Elle se pressa contre lui en murmurant Dieu sait quoi et leva son visage offert vers les lèvres de son compagnon … Léon se mit à marcher à grand pas rageur vers le couple sur le point de s'embrasser. Mathilda le vit glisser la main sous son manteau du coin de l'œil. - Dégage ! dit-elle brusquement en réalisant que son plan avait un peu trop bien fonctionné. En voyant Léon arriver, le jeune homme mit la main derrière son dos pour attraper son arme. Si ce petit con se faisait descendre, ils en seraient quittes pour devoir dégager vite fait ce qui serait tout de même ennuyeux. - Oublie ça ! cria-t-elle en le poussant brusquement. SAUVE-TOI ! Devant l'air peu amène du tueur qui fonçait sur lui, le jeune homme abandonna tout projet d'intimidation et fila sans demander son reste. Léon s'immobilisa près de Mathilda en regardant la nuisance publique disparaître dans une arrière-cour. - Rentre, dit-il en l'agrippant par le bras. Il la poussa jusqu'à l'immeuble, monta rapidement les escaliers de secours et ferma soigneusement la porte derrière eux. Il jeta un œil dans la ruelle, tira brusquement le rideau de la fenêtre, sortit son arme et la posa sur la table. Il se tourna vers elle, scandalisé. - Je ne veux pas que tu revoies ce type, c'est bien compris ? Et … et tu ne sors plus comme ça. Tu as l'air de … enfin, ce n'est pas décent. - Ça fait dix fois que je te dis que je n'ai plus rien qui me fait, plaida-t-elle. Léon réalisa soudain à quel point elle avait grandi. Ses cheveux étaient longs, son chandail affichait des rondeurs qu'il était vain de nier et elle avait même dépassé son épaule. - On arrangera ça … Mais tu ne le revois plus c'est compris ! Mathilda croisa les bras en le toisant. - Ha oui ? Et comment tu comptes m'empêcher de le revoir. Léon resta coi un instant. Il n'avait pas pensé à cet aspect du problème. - Tu ne le revoies plus c'est tout. Ça vaudra mieux pour lui. Il n'imaginait que trop bien ce petit minable lui faire des choses de force, lui donner de la came ou pire, essayer de la mettre sur le trottoir. Elle était si belle ! Juste à y penser, il regrettait de ne pas l'avoir éliminé proprement. - C'est un dealer ou peut-être même pire. Tu ne vois pas ? Elle voyait parfaitement. En fait elle l'avait choisi pour cette raison. C'était exactement le genre de petite frappe que Léon ne pouvait pas supporter. - Oui, peut-être bien, concéda-t-elle. Mais il me plaît alors … - Mathilda … Ce gars-là n'est pas pour toi d'accord ? - Je n'arrive pas à l'oublier. C'est plus fort que moi, dit-elle comme si elle lui faisait une confidence. - Comment l'oublier ? Tu l'as vu souvent ? demanda-t-il d'une voix blanche. - Oui …, mentit-elle. - Il a essayé de … Il t'a … ? dit-il en serrant les poings. - Non. Enfin … pas encore. Mais j'ai toujours envie de le voir. Je n'y peux rien, dit-elle du ton de la parfaite victime. Léon soupira, baissa la tête et se frotta les yeux avec les doigts d'un air découragé. Il savait trop bien jusqu'à quelles extrémités pouvait mener les rendez-vous clandestins et il réalisait pleinement en cet instant, à quel point il était peu outillé pour gérer ce type de situation. - Tu vois, ce qu'il faudrait, c'est que je pense à autre chose, dit-elle en transpirant l'innocence. - Autre chose comme quoi ? Elle haussa les épaules comme si elle n'en avait vraiment aucune idée. - Je ne sais pas, dit-elle en s'asseyant sur la table. Quelque chose qui ferait que je ne penserais plus à lui. Comme ça, je n'aurais plus envie le revoir. Elle balança ses jolies jambes dans le vide comme si elle réfléchissait tandis que Léon, appuyé sur le comptoir, se sentait de plus en plus largué. - Il y aurait peut-être quelque chose … - Quoi ? demanda Léon sans flairer le piège. - Je crois que si tu m'embrassais, je ne penserais plus jamais à lui de ma vie, dit-elle comme si elle parlait d'une médecine normalement dangereuse mais parfaitement appropriée, voire inévitable dans les circonstances. Léon la regarda surpris et hocha la tête vigoureusement. - Non. - Tu es sûr ? Parce que le problème se règlerait facilement. C'est toi que j'aime alors si tu m'embrasses, juste une fois, le reste n'aura plus aucune importance. Et puis si ce n'est pas lui, ce sera un autre. Tu ne crois pas que ce serait plus simple de tout régler maintenant ? Par chance pour Mathilda, Léon manquait cruellement de science féminine et loin de deviner la mise en scène, il détourna la tête nerveusement. - Embrasse-moi et tout sera réglé. Léon soupira, incertain. - Je rêve à ce baiser depuis que je te connais. Je n'aurais envie de penser à rien d'autre après ça. Il hésita. La règle était imprégnée au fer rouge dans son crâne mais pour résoudre facilement un problème aussi inquiétant et compliqué ... - Et tu ne le reverras plus, ni aucun autre petit connard du même genre ? négocia Léon qui n'avait pas envie de se refaire faire le coup. - Je te le jure, dit Mathilda en le regardant les yeux brillants. Léon se leva en soupirant. Il s'avança près de la table et se pencha vers son visage, pressé d'en finir. - Attend ! dit Mathilda en détournant la tête. - Quoi ? - Mon petit frère aussi m'en donnait des comme ça. Ce doit être un vrai baiser d'amoureux, dit-elle en haussant les sourcils. Un baiser avec la langue. Léon se recula en détournant les yeux. - Et puis quoi encore ? Mathilda retint son sourire alors que de nombreuses possibilités lui venaient spontanément en tête. - Il faut que tu m'embrasses comme ces types m'embrasseraient sinon ça ne peut pas marcher, dit-elle en haussant les épaules. Je n'ai plus l'âge de rêver à des bisous bonne-nuit figure-toi. Léon, mal à l'aise, croisa les bras en regardant par terre. Tout ça ne lui plaisait pas du tout. Mathilda sentit que son habile machination allait se révéler vaine si elle ne prenait pas les choses en main rapidement. Elle sauta en bas de la table, saisit le petit tabouret marche pied qu'elle posa devant lui et grimpa dessus pour être à sa hauteur, question qu'il ne puisse pas se défiler. - Tu vas voir, c'est très facile, dit-elle. Premièrement, mets tes bras autour de ma taille. Allez, décroise les bras. Autour de ma taille, comme ça. Voilà. Très bien. Moi, je mets mes bras autour de ton cou. Léon la laissa faire, sans oser lever les yeux. Elle se pressa contre lui et il sentit sa poitrine menue contre son torse. La chaleur lui monta aux joues. - Voilà. Tu es bien ? Il hocha la tête nerveusement, de plus en plus troublé. - D'accord, maintenant, ferme les yeux. Il lui obéi. Tout d'abord, il ne se passa rien puis il sentit la caresse furtive des lèvres de Mathilda. Sa bouche s'appuya sur la sienne, doucement, tendrement. Une chaleur troublante grimpa le long de son dos tandis que la jeune fille se pressait contre lui. Sa bouche vermeille s'entrouvrait contre ses lèvres puis se refermait comme sur une sucrerie délicieuse. Son corps en fleur se cabra tendrement contre lui, l'obligeant à lui répondre. Timidement il lui rendit son baiser et la jeune fille soupira en s'abandonnant dans ses bras. Elle y était arrivée, l'homme qu'elle aimait l'embrassait enfin. Prit par surprise par un désir qui pourtant, l'avait à peine effleuré toutes ces années, Léon se laissa emporter par l'instant. Comme il l'aimait … il l'aimait plus que tout, elle était si belle, l'embrasser était si doux. Il n'y avait plus de craintes, il n'y avait plus de règle qui tiennent et tout échappa soudain à son contrôle. L'amour l'emporta sur sa raison et il l'embrassa avec passion, communiant à sa bouche tandis qu'elle fondait dans ses bras. Elle répondit sans se faire prier en se pressant contre son ventre, provoquant son désir. - Non …, souffla-t-il. NON ! Il se recula comme s'il venait de recevoir un coup de fouet et s'appuya au comptoir en essayant de reprendre ses sens. Il secoua la tête, étourdi par le sang qui bouillait dans ses veines. - Pourquoi non ? murmura Mathilda en le dévorant des yeux du haut de son tabouret. Tu as envie autant que moi, dit-elle en jetant un coup d'œil à son pantalon. Léon se retourna vivement, ouvrit le robinet et passa sa tête sous l'eau froide. - Ça va aller. Du calme. Ça va aller …, murmura-t-il. Il ferma l'eau et s'appuya au comptoir en se passant la main dans la figure. Mathilda se glissa près de lui et l'enlaça pour tenter sa chance une nouvelle fois mais il la repoussa doucement. - C'est fini maintenant … et n'oublie pas ta part du contrat. Il sortit de la cuisine et s'enferma dans la salle de bain. Mathilda fixa la porte un instant puis sourit. Elle se mit à tourner voluptueusement sur elle-même, les mains pressées contre ses lèvres et des étoiles plein les yeux. Elle ne penserait certainement plus jamais à personne d'autre après ça… Jamais. Surtout, considérant, qu'elle n'avait jamais pensé à personne d'autre de toute façon.[Chapter 15] Bon alors suite à tous vos commentaires (merci énormément!) je me suis dit que c'était très vilain de vous laisser tomber comme ça alors c'est reparti pour un petit tour. J'espère que ça vous plaira :) Droit d'auteur : cette scène (quelque peu modifiée) est tirées de la première version du scénario et appartient à Luc Besson. Léon et Mathilda marchèrent le long du trottoir sans faire cas de la pluie. Ils montèrent la volée de marches et Mathilda s'appuya contre la balustrade pour regarder aux alentour en faisant des bulles de chewingum. Pendant ce temps, Léon tapa les chiffres que Math avait réussi à soustraire à l'aide de suie et dans les règles de l'art. Elle sourit quand elle entendit le buzzer et se tourna vers son professeur qui hocha la tête en frais de félicitation. Math ouvrit la porte puis enfila dans l'entrée en jetant un œil circonspect aux alentour. Comme un fantôme, elle gravit les escaliers derrière Léon puis arrivé devant la porte, elle colla la gomme sur le judas et cogna. Rien. Léon fit un signe de tête et elle cogna à nouveau sans succès. Puis encore une fois mais rien. - Il est monté il y a une demi-heure et il ne peut pas être sorti par derrière, dit Léon en pensant à haute voix. Il mit les ciseaux qui lui servaient à couper les chaînes par terre et sortit un petit pied de biche. - L'escalier, dit-il en regardant Mathilda. La jeune fille hocha la tête s'appuya à la balustrade de l'escalier comme si elle traînait là par hasard. Léon brisa la serrure d'un coup de pied de biche habile qui laissa la porte presque intacte. Il se faufila à l'intérieur, arme à la main. Mathilda saisit les ciseaux qu'il avait laissés par terre, jeta deux ou trois coups d'oeil à la ronde et entra à son tour en fermant la porte derrière elle. Le tueur fit rapidement le tour des pièces, puis se faufila dans le salon. Vide. Il fronça les sourcils en voyant la fenêtre ouverte et soupira en regardant la pluie. - Il a dû attendre qu'on monte et il s'est enfui par la fenêtre, dit Léon à l'endroit de Mathilda qui le suivait comme son ombre. - Qu'est-ce qu'on va faire ? - Laisse-moi penser … Mathilda se retourna et emprunta le corridor. - Où tu vas ? - Au toilette, dit-elle en cherchant la salle de bain. Elle aperçut le carrelage par une porte entrouverte et se dirigea vers la pièce. Son cœur s'arrêta presque de battre lorsqu'elle aperçut le client tranquillement allongé dans son bain. Sans un bruit, elle se jeta contre le mur du corridor. Paralysée et immobile, elle n'osa pas passer à nouveau devant la porte pour rejoindre Léon. - Pourquoi il n'a pas fermé la fenêtre derrière lui ? se demandait ce dernier en écoutant la pluie tomber. Il remarqua soudain que la veste mouillée avec laquelle il était entré était maintenant pendue dans l'entrée au-dessus de ses souliers trempés qui séchaient sur le radiateur. - Parce qu'il n'est jamais sorti ! réalisa soudain le tueur épouvanté. Il se précipita dans le corridor, l'arme au poing et infiniment soulagé, aperçut Mathilda qui le regardait l'air de dire « C'est pas trop tôt ! ». De la tête, elle indiqua la salle de bain et Léon mit la main dans sa veste pour y prendre une petite lunette qui ressemblait un peu à un périscope. Il l'ajusta et la fit passer dans le coin de la porte pour regarder dans la salle de bain. - Il dort avec des écouteurs sur les oreilles, dit-il en rangeant soigneusement l'instrument. Il entra sans prendre plus de précautions et regardant l'homme dormir innocemment. Mathilda s'appuya contre la porte pour admirer le tableau. - C'est bien de partir comme ça. Au chaud, avec de la musique, murmura la jeune fille. Léon hocha la tête. - C'est ce qui peut arriver de mieux. Dix minutes plus tôt ou plus tard, il aurait vu la mort et il aurait souffert. Mais de cette façon, il s'en va sans s'en rendre compte. - J'aimerais bien savoir ce qu'il écoute, dit Mathilda curieuse. - Attend un peu. Léon leva son arme et visa le cœur. Il resta immobile comme s'il réfléchissait et Mathilda haussa les sourcils. Elle ne l'avait jamais vu hésiter. Il se tourna vers elle, l'observa un instant puis lui tendit l'arme. Elle lui lança un regard incrédule et il hocha la tête pour confirmer que l'heure était venue. Léon savait qu'il n'y aurait jamais une occasion plus favorable pour lui faire faire son premier contrat. Le visage de l'élève devint soudain sérieux. Elle prit le pistolet en respirant profondément et Léon se poussa pour lui laisser la place. Sans la moindre hésitation, elle se posta devant le client, visa soigneusement et tira dans le coeur aussi sec. Il eut à peine quelques spasmes avant que la mort le prenne. Elle resta immobile quelques instant, observant sa première victime comme pour la graver dans sa mémoire et se tourna vers son professeur. - J'aurai encore droit à du champagne ? demanda-t-elle en souriant. Elle lui rendit son arme tandis que Léon la regardait sans répondre. Son air était grave. Mathilda lui sourit d'un air moqueur. Visiblement, il s'inquiétait mais il n'y avait aucune raison. Cela ne lui avait rien fait, rien du tout. C'était le boulot, rien d'autre. Elle releva fièrement la tête et commença à détacher ses pantalons. Léon prit un air choqué. - Il faut que j'aille au toilette, dit-elle en le dévisageant. - Ah. Pardon, dit-il en s'éclipsant. Mathilda s'assit sur le siège qui jouxtait le bain en contemplant son œuvre. Si on oubliait le petit trou en plein coeur, l'homme semblait encore dormir. C'était du travail de pro. Net et sans bavure. Elle saisit les écouteurs qui s'étaient à peine déplacés sur le crâne du baigneur et se soulagea en écoutant Iron Maiden.[Chapter 16] Léon sursauta alors que sa porte de chambre s'entrouvrait et Mathilda fut accueillie par le bout d'un canon pointé sur elle. Le tueur soupira et reposa son arme sur la table de chevet. - Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? demanda Léon en s'asseyant. - J'ai fait un cauchemar, gémit Mathilda d'une petite voix. - Eh bien … c'est fini maintenant. - J'ai trop peur, dit-elle en reniflant. - Ce n'est qu'un mauvais rêve. - Je peux venir dans ton lit ? supplia-t-elle en éclatant en sanglot. S'il te plait … - … Bon d'accord, céda Léon tellement elle semblait désespérée. Il se leva pour ouvrir le lit, la laissa monter, la recouvrit et se recoucha près d'elle, par-dessus les draps. Mathilda pleurait toujours et se pelotonna contre lui au travers son rempart de couvertures - Allons c'est fini maintenant, arrête de pleurer, dit Léon couché sur le dos. - C'était trop horrible … hoqueta-t-elle. Il y avait … du sang partout. Mon petit frère … je le tuais. Son visage était … Il … il criait et suppliait et je tirais encore et enc …, mais les sanglots lui coupèrent la parole. Léon tourna la tête vers elle et la regarda d'un air grave. Il comprenait parfaitement. - Tu te rappelles ce que je t'ai dit quand on restait à New york? Mathilda leva sur lui de grands yeux plein de larmes. - Je t'ai dit que si tu tuais quelqu'un, plus rien ne serait pareil après, que tu ne dormirais que d'un œil pour le reste de ta vie, dit-il gravement. Tu te souviens ? Mathilda hocha la tête. - Et bien ça commence ce soir. Mathilda accusa le coup. Elle renifla en essayant de retenir ses larmes. C'était le boulot. Elle venait de descendre son premier client. Ce n'était qu'une conséquence parfaitement normale. Certains chopent des cancers, d'autre des cauchemars. - Ouais … je comprends. Mathilda se tourna sur le dos en décidant d'être forte, maîtresse d'elle-même. Elle allait oublier ce foutu cauchemar et n'avait aucun besoin d'être réconfortée comme une enfant. Elle se rendormit et lorsque ses sourcils se froncèrent, que l'inquiétude s'empara de ses traits, qu'elle gémit et qu'elle se retourna pour s'accrocher désespérément à lui dans son sommeil, Léon ne la repoussa pas.[Chapter 17] Jackson était couché par terre dans une marre de sang et Stanfield l'observait en hochant la tête d'un air désolé. Le trombone de la symphonie de Montana était bel et bien foutu. Il s'était prit une volée de balles en plein dans le troufignon et gisait maintenant par terre, parfaitement ridicule. Aussi ridicule que le travail de chiotte qu'il avait à peine réussi à faire. Il y avait eu au moins quatre meurtre au ketchup et cet incapable n'était arrivé à rien. Ça faisait maintenant trois ans qu'il ne lui avait rien soumis de concluant et soudain, ça lui avait été fatal. Stanfield observa un moment le cadavre au derrière rougeoyant et soupira en levant les bras en signe d'impuissance. – Qu'est-ce que je pouvais faire d'autre hein? Qu'est-ce que je pouvais faire? dit-il en regardant le macchabée comme s'il allait lui répondre. – Rien chef. Y'avait rien à faire d'autre, dit Rob comme pour le consoler. – JE T'AI SONNÉ TOI ?! Rob en rentrant la tête dans les épaules sans la moindre envie de se commettre d'un nouveau commentaire. Stanfield soupira. À tout prendre, ce n'était pas très malin de buter Jackson considérant que le dossier allait être réaffecté à quelqu'un d'autre. À moins d'avoir beaucoup de chance, il ne serait pas aussi facile de trouver le point faible du trou du cul qui allait se faire coller à l'affaire. Le policier leva les bras et les laissa retomber comme une vivante image du regret. Mais voilà, il avait fallu qu'il tombe sur un incapable. Un trombone qui jouait mal. Et qu'est-ce qui arrive quand un instrument déconne ? Le chef d'orchestre finit par devenir fou et le trombone termine rapidement sa carrière. POM, pom, POM, pom, POM, PUIIIIIIIT! Évidemment, cet instant où on fracasse l'instrument merdique contre le mur est un grand moment de soulagement. Mais dans le cas de Montana et de sa petite salope, Stanfield avait besoin de beaucoup plus que de soulagement. Il avait besoin d'être délivré. Depuis TROIS-PUTAINS-D'ANNÉES ! Malheureusement, ce n'était pas demain la veille et dans la vie, on faisait ce qu'on pouvait avec ce qu'on avait. Il regarda le petit mignon de Jackson qui couinait dans un coin avec le genoux éclaté. Il avança vers lui, se pencha à sa hauteur et lui sourit d'un ravissant sourire. – Tu connais Beethoven ?[Chapter 18] Mathilda s'avança vers la porte de la chambre aussi silencieuse qu'une ombre. Elle inspira d'un air concentré. La jeune fille avança la main sur la poignée la tourna, la poussa et bondit dans la pièce en moins d'une demi-seconde. L'homme étendu sur le matelas se relevait brusquement mais il n'eut pas le temps de saisir son arme avant de recevoir une balle dans la poitrine. Mathilda ouvrit la lumière sans quitter sa cible des yeux. - Je t'ai eu, dit Mathilda en souriant fièrement. Léon regardait la peinture rouge qui maculait sa camisole. La peinture qui mouchetait les murs et le lit indiquait que l'exploit avait été long à réussir. C'était leur petit jeu depuis quelques semaines. Ils devaient arriver à se tirer dessus au milieu de la nuit avant que l'autre puisse saisir son arme. D'un côté comme de l'autre, cela permettait de garder la forme. - Joli coup, dit Léon, sûr que son tir aurait été fatal. Mathilda le visait toujours et Léon haussa les sourcils. Il fit mine de s'asseoir et une vraie balle troua le mur tout près de sa tête. - Ne bouge pas, dit Mathilda en le fixant gravement. Il lui lança un regard incrédule tandis que Mathilda s'approchait de la chaise où il posait sa veste de cuir. En le visant toujours, elle saisit le couteau de chasse de l'arsenal de nettoyage et le sortit de sa pochette. Elle reprit sa position, et le dévisagea. - Je veux te montrer quelque chose, dit-elle sans baisser le pistolet pour autant. Léon n'avait pas bougé d'un cheveu mais elle voyait fleurer dans son regard cette petite lueur farouche qu'elle connaissait bien. Il était tendu comme un arc, cherchant l'ouverture. Elle se sentit comme un moineau devant une panthère, le moindre faux mouvement et son plan était à l'eau. En le fixant, elle leva le couteau et le fit passer sous la bretelle de sa chemise de nuit rose. Elle fut tranchée comme par un rasoir. L'éclat sauvage dans l'œil du dangereux félin fut soudain remplacé par une lueur de crainte ; le regard d'une souris prit au piège par une belette. Mathilda fit passer la lame sous l'autre bretelle et la chemise chut à ses pieds, la laissant nue. Léon baissa instantanément les yeux. Elle laissa tomber le couteau par terre et prit le revolver à deux mains. - Regarde-moi. Une balle troua le matelas à quelque centimètre de sa main. - Regarde-moi ! Il leva les yeux sur elle. - Tu crois qu'un enfant ressemble à ça ? N'ayant aucune envie de poser pareil jugement, Léon baissa à nouveau la tête mais la balle qui troua le mur lui fit relever les yeux. - Répond-moi, demanda-t-elle doucement. Tu me trouve jolie ? - Mathilda … - Je t'aime Léon. Et tu vois où j'en suis. Je dois te tirer dessus pour que tu me regarde. Alors regarde-moi et dis que tu me trouve désirable. La lueur farouche revint au fond de son œil. - Tu crois que tu peux me forcer ? demanda-t-il gravement. - Tu ne me laisse pas d'autre choix. Ils se dévisagèrent un instant et Léon détourna les yeux. La balle qui perça son oreiller le laissa indifférent. - Et tu vas me tuer ? dit-il en regardant obstinément par terre. - Peut-être … Léon souffla un sourire, n'en croyant pas un mot. - D'accord, c'est vrai, mais je pourrais te trouer un peu. Une balle siffla à un cheveu de son oreille, si près, qu'il la sentit frôler sa tempe. Léon la regarda, stupéfait. - Les frustrations sexuelles, ça rend dingue, expliqua-t-elle. Le cœur de Léon se mit à battre plus vite. Au fond, ce jeu sauvage lui plaisait et Mathilda le connaissait trop bien pour ne pas le savoir. - Tu imagines ce qui t'attend ? Tu n'as qu'à dire que … Mais elle n'eut pas le temps de terminer sa phrase. Elle avait fait l'erreur de tourner le regard une demi-seconde et Léon, à l'affût malgré qu'il n'en laissât rien paraître, avait aussitôt saisi l'arme qui attendait sur la table de nuit. Frappé par une balle, le pistolet de la jeune fille vola aussitôt à l'autre bout de la pièce. Léon se leva comme un ressort et la tint en joue. Ils se dévisagèrent un instant. - Tu as perdu, dit-il en désignant fièrement l'arme qu'il tenait à la main. - Oui … j'ai perdu, dit-elle en s'avançant vers lui dans toute sa nudité. J'aime perdre contre toi. Léon réalisa soudain que son arme ne valait rien contre une attaque de cette nature et il sauta de l'autre côté du lit. - Mathilda … Arrête. Tu perds ton temps, dit-il nerveusement. Elle posa un genou sur le matelas et s'y étendit avec langueur. - Ma peau est douce, dit-elle en effleurant sa poitrine menue. Touche-moi, murmura-t-elle en la soulevant vers lui. La main du tueur trembla en serrant son arme. - Je ne suis pas un homme et je ne suis pas une enfant, dit-elle en effleurant ses seins. Tu veux bien me faire l'amour ? Fais-moi l'amour Léon, murmura-t-elle. Et soudain, Léon en eut terriblement envie. Elle était magnifique … Ils étaient seuls au monde … il l'aimait … mais il ne pouvait pas. Quelque chose lui disait que ce serait mal. - Non, dit Léon en hochant la tête. Sors. - Mais qu'est-ce que je peux faire … , supplia Mathilda désespérée. Je deviens folle. - Il n'y a rien à faire. Il faut que tu sortes. - Tu me désires. Je le sais … - Bon. Léon saisit ses vêtements pliés sur la chaise et sortit de la chambre. Mathilda sursauta en entendant la porte d'entrée se refermer sur la pire tête de mule qu'ait connue l'univers. Elle soupira et fut quitte pour serrer contre elle l'oreiller troué où le léger parfum des cheveux de son grand amour n'arriva pas à la consoler. Si on faisait l'inventaire de toutes les possibilités, il ne lui restait plus beaucoup d'options.[Chapter 19] - C'est pas vrai ! Je rêve ! Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous là ?! Tu es complètement folle ou quoi ? Tony regardait Mathilda qui venait d'apparaître au beau milieu du restaurant comme une mauvaise surprise. - Dégage à la cave tout de suite MERDE ! jura Tony en indiquant les cuisines. Même après trois ans, Stansfield était toujours complètement barge et il venait faire son tour de temps en temps, question de s'assurer qu'il n'avait pas eu vent d'un quelconque retour des enfants prodigues. Tony jura un chapelet complet en descendant à la cave, tout de même inquiet. La gamine ne serait jamais venue le voir à moins d'un problème grave. Il la retrouva assise à la table de poker. - Il est arrivé quelque chose à Léon ? demanda Tony sans plus de façon. - Non, il va bien, dit la jeune fille en le toisant. - Alors qu'est-ce que tu fous là ? demanda Tony abasourdi. - Il faut qu'on parle. - Parler de quoi ? Tu sais que c'est du suicide de venir ici … Bon sang ! - C'est important. Tony la regarda et hocha la tête. - Bon d'accord. Viens. Il ouvrit la porte cachée dans le mur de vieilles planches et Mathilda le suivit. Il s'assit derrière son bureau en désignant la chaise juste devant. - Alors, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? - Je viens à cause de la règle. - Quelle règle ? - Ni homme, ni enfant …. Tu te souviens ? - Hein ? - C'est ce que tu as dit à Léon. On ne touche pas aux hommes ni aux enfants. - Ha oui, ça. Et alors ? Mathilda se pencha en avant pour planter ses yeux dans les siens. - Tu dois lui dire que ça ne s'applique plus à moi. - Attends, je crois que je ne te suis pas très bien. Mathilda se recula sur la chaise. - À cause de ta règle il ne veut pas me toucher. Alors, tu dois lui dire que je suis assez grande maintenant. Toi il te croira. Tony la dévisagea fixement. - D'accord, tu es en train de me dire que tu m'as mis en danger, mis en danger tout le monde ici, risqué votre planque et tout le reste pour que ej dise à Léon qu'il peut te sauter c'est ça ? - C'est ça, dit Mathilda comme s'il n'y avait rien de plus normal. Tony resta bouchebé un instant, incapable de dire un mot. - Tu es folle bon Dieu ! - Tu es le seul qui peut arranger les choses. Tony ouvrit rageusement la boîte ouvragé sur le bureau et y cueillit un cigare qu'il alluma. - Je vais les arranger les choses moi, dit-il d'une voix blanche. Je vais te mettre une belle petite balle dans ta tête de linotte ! - Écoute, je pourrais faire des conneries encore pire si tu ne fais rien. L'amour est plus fort que tout. Tu sais ça non ? Tony la regarda, elle devait avoir quoi maintenant … quinze ou seize ans ? Et elle était plutôt bien roulée. Alors, elle n'avait pas réussi à le convaincre malgré sa belle petite gueule … Ce Léon, c'était un saint. - Et bien tu n'as pas l'air de l'exciter. Qu'est-ce que tu veux que j'y foute moi, grommela Tony. Mathilda le dévisagea avec un froid regard de prédateur et Tony songea fugitivement qu'elle devait faire peur avec un flingue au bout du bras. - Je ne suis pas venue pour des conseils. Je suis là pour faire des affaires. Elle ouvrit son sac et posa une enveloppe épaisse sur la table. - Dix mille, dit-elle en relevant la tête. Et tu lui fais parvenir un petit message mine de rien. Tu arranges ça comme tu veux mais il doit comprendre que ta règle ne s'applique plus à moi. - Dix mille ? Mathilda poussa l'enveloppe vers lui. - Le dix mille le plus facile de ta vie. - Où tu as pris ce blé ? - Je nettoie des saletés … Alors ? Tony avala la fumée de son cigare en plissant les yeux. Cette gamine était complètement barge … N'empêche, son cœur d'italien s'emplit d'indulgence pour cette folie tandis qu'il se demandait si une femme avais jamais été prête à allonger dix mille balles pour l'avoir lui.[Chapter 20] Le téléphone sonna et le policier prit le combiné poisseux qu'il colla à son oreille. - Stansfield. - C'est la Taupe. La chair de poule hérissa aussitôt la colonne vertébrale du policier qui ouvrit grande ses oreilles. - Elle est là. Au restaurant. Sous le crâne de Stansfield la symphonie de Montana explosa soudainement. Les coups d'archets se mirent à caracoler, les cuivres se déchaînèrent, la flûte, cette satanée flûte, tissa dans la trame ses notes aigües tandis qu'au loin, il entendait l'écho du violoncelle sur laquelle il allait bientôt mettre la main. - Et je veux avoir ce que tu m'as promis ! Figlio di puttana sporco ! gronda la Taupe. Stansfield avait piégé le petit-fils de la Taupe. Il avait fait mettre de la came dans le sac d'école du môme et un type qui lui devait un service l'avait envoyé dans la pire maison de redressement de l'état. Il avait fait savoir à la Taupe qu'il avait intérêt à lui livrer Montana s'il voulait que son mioche reste en bon état. Comme il s'était passé pas mal de temps le gamin devait avoir un trou de balle en acier trempé maintenant mais on avait enfin le résultat ! Sans prendre la peine de répondre à ce connard d'italien, Standfield raccrocha le combiné si fort que le téléphone à roulette fit entendre un ding retentissant. - C'est MONTANA ! Je veux tout le monde sur la route dans trente seconde ! MAGNEZ-VOUS ! cria t-il alors que les yeux lui sortait presque de la tête d'excitation. Il se précipita comme la foudre dans l'escalier de secours qu'il dévala comme s'il avait le diable à ses trousses. - PLUS VITE ! hurla t-il à ses hommes qui devaient cavaler derrière lui. Et ils avaient intérêt à cavaler ! Ce n'était pas le moment de trainer ! Enfin ! ENFIN ! La chance lui souriait ! Il sauta dans la voiture alors que ses dogues arrivaient au pas de course. Il les encouragea en hurlant des menaces et Benny eut à peine le temps de s'asseoir qu'il décolla sur les chapeaux de roues, laissant le reste des escargots se partager l'autre voiture. Stansfield fila dans les rues à un train d'enfer et se gara près du restaurant de Tony. La Taupe sortit sur le pas de la porte comme pour prendre l'air, le repéra et lui fit un signe de tête. Stansfield se détendit et prit une grande respiration tandis que le reste de son équipe se garait derrière lui. Il sortit la boîte magique qui contenait de précieuses gélules. Merde. Plus que quatre … C'était bien sa chance. Évidemment, avec le temps ces saletés étaient de moins en moins efficaces et il fallait forcer la dose. Sauf qu'aujourd'hui la chance était de son côté. Il le sentait. L'important était d'être à son max et de choper cette petite pute. Il en saisit trois et s'envoya une dose royale. Il se crispa sous le regard inquiet de Benny qui ne l'avait jamais vu s'enfiler trois de ces merdes en même temps. Le délice qui devenait de plus en plus fade à chaque mois s'empara de lui avec puissance. Il serra les dents et échappa un grognement de jouissance. Ses sens étaient multipliés, sa concentration extrême, un calme exaltant s'empara de lui, le faisant bouillonner de malice. C'est à ce moment que Mathilda sortit du restaurant et le cœur de Stansfield se mit à battre comme s'il apercevait son grand amour. En le voyant s'exciter Benny le regarda étrangement. - Heu c'était pas Montana qu'on devait choper. - Non. C'est elle, dit Stansfield en la fixant d'un regard fou. C'était une petite femme maintenant. Elle avait grandi, ses cheveux étaient plus longs mais c'était la même démarche de petite connasse. Ses yeux se vrillèrent sur sa proie. Cette proie tant attendue. Elle portait un large manteau de sport bleu, des pantalons noirs et des lunettes de soleil. Il devinait son inquiétude à son pas rapide et à sa tête baissée. Elle savait qu'elle était en territoire ennemi et pour ça elle avait foutrement raison. Elle héla un taxi et Stansfield se mit à la suivre prudemment. Ils firent quelques détours, prirent le boulevard, restèrent coincés un moment dans un embouteillage (il fallait que ce soit la foutue sortie des classes évidemment) puis le taxi reprit sa course. Stansfield fronça les sourcils. Il ne voyait plus personne dépasser sur le siège arrière. Comme pris de folie, il accéléra et fonça sur le taxi pour arriver à voir l'intérieur. Il freina brusquement, envoyant Benny se taper contre le tableau de bord. - PUTAIN DE MERDE ! Y'a plus personne là-dedans ! Elle s'est TIRÉE ! T'as rien vu pauvre con ?! cria t'il en envoyant des baffes sur la gueule de son molosse. Tandis que Benny marmonnait des excuses terrifiées, il tourna comme un fou, manqua frapper une petite grand-mère qui traversait, enfila dans l'autre voie en klaxonnant et roula furieusement jusqu'à l'embouteillage où ils furent de nouveau coincés. C'était forcément là qu'elle était sortie du taxi En serrant le volant à s'en blanchir les jointures, Stansfield incrédule regardait de tous les côtés à la fois. MERDE ! C'était juste devant une putain d'école et il y avait une saleté de foule ! Paniqué, il s'éjecta de la voiture et resta debout tout tremblant, cherchant la large veste de sport bleue au travers les jupes écossaises et les chemises blanches des jeunes filles qui avaient envahi la rue. Rien. - NonNonNonNon, marmonna t-il sans y croire. Puis il remarqua une étudiante qui montait les marches de l'entrée du collège au lieu de les descendre comme les autres. Cette démarche il la connaissait … Il plissa les yeux, incrédule. C'était elle ! Avec le même uniforme d'écolière que ces foutus mômes ! Putain le con ! Il se baissa en se dissimulant entre deux voitures stationnées. Mais bordel, comment elle avait réussi ça ?! Dès qu'elle eut disparut par la grande porte, il se précipita en courant avec Benny sur les talons, grimpa les marche quatre à quatre et se pressa prudemment contre la porte d'entrée pour jeter un œil à l'intérieur. - Monsieur, je peux vous aider ? Une surveillante rouquine laide à faire peur le regardait d'un air méfiant. - Police, dégagez. Le laideron releva la tête insultée. - Puis-je voir votre plaque ? demanda t-elle froidement. Stansfeild se sentit bouillonner de rage et eut soudain la furieuse envie de lui arranger le portrait. Mais il avait des chats autrement plus importants à fouetter et il faillit arracher la poche de sa veste en fouillant dedans puis lui colla sa plaque sous le nez. - Dégagez ! C'est une opération policière bordel ! cracha t-il survolté. - Je vous prie d'être poli monsieur. - Tu dégages ou je te dégomme c'est clair ?! gronda t-il les yeux exorbités. Tandis que la connasse battait en retrait visiblement effrayée par son regard dément et l'air peu amène de son gorille, Stansfield regarda prudemment à l'intérieur du collège. Il eut tout juste le temps de voir Mathilda disparaître par la porte arrière du bâtiment. Il poussa brusquement poil de carotte et sans prêter la moindre attention à ses protestations, il enfila dans le couloir en bousculant les étudiantes qui sortaient. Il se jeta contre la porte qu'il entrebâilla prudemment. Cheveux au vent, la jeune fille descendait les marches pour passer par la grande cour. La symphonie de Montana éclata de nouveau dans sa tête. Glorieuse. La flûte que son imagination malade avait attribuée à la petite nettoyeuse y jouait une partition aussi aérienne que sublime. Stansfield sourit. Elle se croyait tirée d'affaire. Ça se voyait à sa démarche assurée. N'empêche, qu'elle y était presque arrivée. Sûrement qu'elle avait l'uniforme planqué sous sa veste ou dans son sac. Elle s'était changée dans le taxi. Elle avait tout prévu. L'heure, l'embouteillage, l'école, les uniformes, tout … Il devait avouer qu'elle était drôlement futée. Mais pas assez futée pour semer son vieux pote Stansfield se dit-il fièrement. Mathilda suivit les étudiantes qui traversaient la cour, la rue devant puis entraient par une porte tournante quelques blocs plus loin. Stansfield fronça les sourcils. C'était quoi ce bâtiment ou elles entraient ? Il n'y avait pas de métro dans ce trou perdu … Qu'est-ce qu'il y avait dans le coin ? La gare de quartier … putain. La gare mais bien sûr ! Ce devait être un raccourci pour ces gosses de mes deux. Ils passaient sûrement par le centre commercial qui avait une sortie juste en face de la gare. Bordel, elle était vraiment douée la petite salope. Elle avait trouvé comment se rendre incognito jusqu'au train dans un temps record. En plus, jamais il n'aurait pensé à contrôler la gare de quartier. C'était un truc de banlieue pourri et l'entrée principale était beaucoup trop loin. - Tu te crois maligne pas vrai ? Dans sa tête, la flûte cristalline lui répondit enjouée et il sourit d'un sourire carnassier. Il sortit du bâtiment comme une flèche, descendit les escaliers quatre à quatre et sauta dans sa voiture qui bloquait la rue. Il décolla en se forçant un passage grâce à la sirène qui se mit à hurler et n'attendit même pas Benny qui dû s'entasser avec les autres dans la seconde bagnole qui suivit de peine et de misère leur chef survolté. Stansfield conduisit comme un dément jusqu'au centre commercial et se gara devant ce qui devait forcément être la sortie du raccourci. Il regarda la porte fixement. Il était sûr qu'il avait déjoué son plan. Sûr et certain. La porte s'ouvrit et les yeux de Stansfield s'agrandirent. Un vieux con en sortit … Il fronça les sourcils alors que l'ombre d'un doute s'insinuait dans son cerveau en surchauffe. Il tapota le volant et avala nerveusement sa salive. - Patron ? Stansfield sursauta. - Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ? demanda Rob en passant sa grosse tête d'enfoiré par la vitre. - On surveille, dit Stansfield avec un sourire taré. Alors dégage et surveille. - D'accord mais c'est qu'on est tassé dans la voiture alors peut-être … L'air cinglé de son patron enleva à Rob l'envie de quémander une place et il s'en fut sans demander son reste. Stansfield soupira brusquement. Mais PUTAIN DE MERDE ! Qui lui avait collé des incapables pareils. Cela lui rappela que les deux enfants prodigues lui avaient bousillé la meilleure équipe qu'il ait jamais eue. Et pour ça ils allaient payer. Payer très cher. Sauf que pour ça, il fallait d'abord mettre le grappin sur le maillon faible. Le policier retourna à sa surveillance un brin nerveux. La porte s'ouvrit à nouveau et des étudiantes en blouses blanches et jupes écossaises en jaillirent comme d'une source. Stansfield hurla de joie en tapant sur le volant comme un fou puis il se baissa brusquement à la façon des lions qui guettent à l'affût et observa en silence la cohorte estudiantine passer devant lui pour disparaître dans la gare. Il en passa une bonne cinquantaine et le policier eut encore le temps de se ronger les sangs avant que sa proie apparaisse enfin. Mathilda sortit et jeta un coup d'œil aux alentours. Il se jeta contre le siège puis avec précaution il regarda par-dessus le tableau de bord. Avec ravissement, il la vit entrer dans la gare. Il sortit de la voiture et claqua des doigts. Aussitôt ses cinq sbires accoururent. - Vous entrez, vous vous dispersez et vous attendez mes ordres. - Mais patrons, qui est-ce qu'on suit ? J'ai vu passer que des filles de l'école, dit Rich dubitatif. Stansfield eut l'air incroyablement découragé. - C'est parce qu'elle déguisée en jolie petite étudiante, dit-il comme s'il parlait à un enfant. - Ah, fit Rich l'air de se dire que le patron avait sûrement fini par péter un câble sur ce fichu Montana et qu'il s'imaginait n'importe quoi. - Allez, allez, dit Stansfield avec un signe impatient de la main. Moi elle me connaît alors vous allez la suivre. - Mais patron, pourquoi on la chope pas ? Ce serait plus simple, dit Benny. Le visage de Stansfield se colora d'un rouge impressionnant et les gardes rentrèrent la tête dans les épaules. - Parce que pauvre connard, c'est MONTANA qu'on veut ! COMPRIS ? Et devine un peu qui sait où il se planque ? - Ben la fille …, dit Rob. Stansfield lui fit de grands yeux, totalement impressionné par ses capacités de déduction. - Donc, c'est pour ça qu'on la suit, conclut-il. Vous voulez qu'elle s'échappe ? Alors qu'est-ce que vous attendez ? Les gorilles enfilèrent dans la gare au pas de course suivit de Stansfield. Ils se trouvèrent dans un bâtiment de taille moyenne ou se trouvaient un petit café ainsi qu'une boutique d'items divers sur le côté et les guichets au fond. Stansfield attrapa une casquette et des lunettes noires sur un présentoir près de la porte et s'éloigna mine de rien sans avoir la moindre intention de payer. Mathilda faisait la queue avec les autres pour prendre son ticket et il la désigna discrètement aux bons à rien qui cherchaient leur cible en vain. Puis, tout se passa comme sur des roulettes. Le train arriva, ils montèrent dedans, Stansfield suivit Math jusqu'au wagon central. Elle s'assit dans l'allée de droite et il s'assit quelques bancs derrière dans l'allée de gauche. Les gars de l'équipe s'en furent garder les sorties les plus proches et lorsque le train se mit en branle, Stansfield sut que sa proie n'avait plus aucune chance. Rien au monde ne pourrait maintenant lui venir en aide. Elle était à lui.[Chapter 21] Le train s'arrêta une énième fois et le dernier passager du wagon, un adolescent à casquette, passa dans l'allée pour descendre à la gare. Stansfield se trémoussa dans son siège incertain de ce qu'il devait faire. Il y avait presque deux heures qu'ils traversaient des banlieues de plus en plus merdiques. Au début il y avait tellement de foutus écolières qui criaient dans le wagon que l'inspecteur avait eu envie d'en étriper son content. Heureusement, elles étaient vite descendues dans les quartiers aisés puis le train s'était vidé peu à peu de ses passagers minables. Il ne s'était rien passé de notable sinon qu'environ une demi-heure plus tôt, Mathilda s'était étendue sur son siège et roupillait toujours. Qu'est-ce qu'elle venait foutre dans ce coin pourri ? Un client à nettoyer peut-être ? Ou bien de la famille à visiter ? Peut-être aussi avait-elle manqué son arrêt parce qu'elle dormait. Ce serait logique puisque le prochain arrêt était le terminus. Nerveux, Stansfield se mordit la lèvre en regardant défiler les carrières vides et déprimantes où moisissaient des buissons rachitiques par ci par là. Bon sang ! Qu'est-ce qu'ils allaient faire en arrivant à la gare du terminus ? S'ils étaient forcés de descendre leur filature serait foutue. Devait-il l'enlever et l'emmener quelque part ? La torturer pour lui faire cracher le morceau ? Fallait-il agir tout de suite ou lorsque le train arrêterait ? Ou bien la laisser dormir et si le train repartait dans l'autre sens envoyer Bob la réveiller. Elle se rendrait compte qu'elle avait manqué l'arrêt et il ne serait pas grillé ou bien peut-être pas ? … Pffft. Tout était confus. Il n'arrivait plus à penser clairement, il fallait absolument qu'il prenne une dose. Sa dernière dose … Ensuite il n'en aurait plus et que Dieu lui vienne en aide. Il sortit la gélule de sa boîte en tremblant. Il ouvrit la bouche mais le petit contenant magique n'eut pas le temps de s'y rendre avant que ses poumons n'explosent ; du moins, c'est l'impression qu'il eut. Ses yeux s'ouvrirent immenses alors qu'un râle s'échappait de sa gorge et que la gélule inutile roulait par terre. - Salut Stansfield. Comment ça va ? L'adolescent à la casquette qui était passé à peine quelques minutes plus tôt se laissa joyeusement tomber sur le siège à côté de lui. - Pas trop bien je parie, dit Math en souriant. Le policier l'observa les yeux ronds, incrédule. Tandis que le goût métallique de son propre sang lui emplissait la bouche, il regarda le siège où elle était supposée être et vit ses cheveux qui en dépassaient toujours. On aurait juré qu'elle était encore là à roupiller sagement. Son regard revint à la jeune fille. Sous sa casquette des Red Socks, elle lui souriait comme s'ils étaient de vieux amis. - Je suis vraiment contente de te voir Stan. Putain de bordel de MERDE ! Elle avait tirée derrière lui, au travers du siège ! Les poumons en feu, il tenta de crier pour alerter les autres mais ne réussit à produire qu'un grognement bestial. Mathilda ne sembla pas s'en inquiéter outre-mesure car tandis que Stansfield s'égosillait misérablement elle entreprit de dévisser le silencieux de son fusil, très détendue. - J'ai nettoyé le train. J'espère que ça ne te dérange pas, dit-elle en jetant un coup d'œil dans le cylindre. Stansfield comprit soudainement que tous ses hommes étaient morts, que le train était vide et qu'il allait y passer. Sa respiration entrecoupée de râles s'accéléra tandis que Mathilda faisait glisser la culasse du pistolet d'un geste expert. Elle jeta un coup d'œil dans l'ouverture et satisfaite, fit disparaître ses armes dans l'étui qu'elle portait caché contre son dos. Elle leva la tête et le regarda gravement. - Écoute, excuse-moi de te dire ça mais il faut vraiment que quelqu'un le fasse. Elle le dévisagea avec le plus grand sérieux, très professionnelle. - Ton équipe est totalement nulle. Où tu as trouvé ces crétins ? Dans une boîte à surprise ? Il y en avait trois qui dormaient. Trois sur cinq ! Tu peux croire ça ? J'ai jamais vu des navets pareils. Elle haussa un sourcil compatissant. - Sans blague, ça n'a pas dû être facile tous les jours … Elle avait parfaitement raison mais même s'il l'eut voulu, Stansfield n'était plus du tout en état de se plaindre. Mathilda haussa les épaules. - Mais bon, d'un autre côté tu n'auras plus à les supporter. C'est le bon côté de se faire descendre. Stansfield se mit à hoqueter à moitié étouffé dans son sang et la petite tueuse se fit rassurante. - J'ai touché que le bas du poumon. Le temps qu'il se remplisse, tu as encore un bon cinq minute, dit-elle en s'adossant confortablement dans son siège. Léon appelle ça le coup de l'aquarium. Tu sais comme un bocal qui se remplit. C'est pratique s'il faut dire quelque chose au client avant qu'il crève mais que lui, on veut qu'il la boucle. Paniqué, le policier se mit à ouvrir et fermer la bouche comme un poisson cherchant son air. Mathilda n'y fit pas attention. Les clients faisaient souvent de drôles de têtes quand ils y passaient. Elle enleva sa casquette et libéra ses cheveux qu'elle replaça avec un mouvement gracieux. - Je n'étais pas sûre si tu viendrais, dit-elle en posant négligemment le couvre-chef sur le siège, mais j'espérais bien que tu te pointerais. Ça fait un bail que je voulais venir voir Tony alors j'ai beaucoup pensé à toi. Quand j'ai vu que tu étais garé au resto … T'imagines pas à quel point j'étais contente. Elle lui sourit ravie et Stansfield la regarda vraiment pour la première fois. Elle semblait aussi à l'aise qu'au milieu d'un pyjama party alors qu'elle venait de descendre froidement cinq agents du DEA et que devant elle, le sixième agonisait en crachant ses poumons. Une si jeune fille … Et malgré qu'il doive mourir, Normand Stansfield fut impressionné malgré lui par le prédateur qui allait l'occire. Dans sa tête résonna le chant d'une clarinette. Plus mature et complexe qu'une simple flûte. La symphonie de Montana se rehaussa de ce nouvel instrument et il sembla au mélomane que cela sonnait parfaitement juste. - Par contre j'ai failli te perdre devant l'école, continua Mathilda. C'est pas pour t'insulter mais tu te ramollis je crois. C'était pourtant pas du grand art comme déguisement. J'ai même pas changé de coiffure. Tu te rends compte que malgré tous mes efforts pour que tu me suives tu t'es retrouvé complètement largué ? Elle le regarda par en dessous avec cette expression qui lui était familière, l'air de dire que c'était tout de même pitoyable. Sur ce, Stansfield s'étouffa en crachant une giclée de sang et son assassin tenta de l'aider en lui tapant dans le dos. - Mais il faut dire à ta défense que je suis assez douée, dit-elle comme pour l'excuser. Léon lui il se déguise jamais. De toute façon il est nul, dit-elle en souriant attendrie. Même pas capable d'imiter John Wayne. Le policier réussi enfin à reprendre sur lui et Math cessa son tambourinage. - John Wayne, tu le connais ? C'est un vieux. Il lui renvoya un regard halluciné duquel il s'avérait hasardeux de déduire si oui ou non il connaissait Johnny. Mathilda se tourna vers lui en appuyant son épaule sur le dossier. Elle attendit d'accrocher son regard pour être bien sûre d'avoir son attention. - Stansfield écoute, je ne veux pas qu'il y ait de malentendu entre nous. La balle c'est juste parce que tu nous colles aux basques. Tu comprends, à force ça devient casse-pied. Elle haussa les épaules. - Tu te doutais bien qu'on allait finir par te nettoyer un de ces jours. Stansfield qui n'avait jamais eu aucun doute de cette sorte eu l'air de s'insurger car il se mit à cracher des postillons de sang en grognant. Mathilda acquiesça comme si elle comprenait. - Je sais, je sais. Tu croyais que c'était toi qui allais nous avoir. Mais c'était qu'un beau rêve Stan. T'as jamais eu aucune chance. Léon c'est le meilleur. Le meilleur, insista t-elle. Techniquement, tu es mort depuis des années. Si tu es en sursis c'est juste parce que t'es pas à lui. Mathilda s'avança et planta ses yeux dans les siens. - T'es à moi Stan, dit-elle en le fixant. T'as tué mon petit frère. Tu te souviens ? Alors que le regard de Mathilda devenaient étrangement sombres, l'esprit malade de Stansfield lui fit remarquer que si cette gosse était devenue nettoyeuse, était devenue un tel prédateur prodige, c'était grâce à lui. Sans lui, elle ne serait qu'une petite pute comme tant d'autres. La vérité, c'est qu'elle était sa création et il avait accouché d'un monstre exceptionnel. Putain de merde, c'était quand même la classe. Et puis qu'est-ce qu'il en avait à foutre ? Depuis trop longtemps il se sentait complètement largué. À bout. Il était fatigué. Épuisé. Il était dépassé par sa propre noirceur et il en avait marre. Tout bien compté, se faire éclater par sa propre créature ce n'était pas si mal. Une fin à la Frankenstein, ça lui convenait parfaitement. - Mais tu sais, juste te descendre avec une balle je trouve que c'est trop … ordinaire, reprit Mathilda. Et puis c'est que le boulot habituel. Non. Pour toi, il faut quelque chose de spécial. Quelque chose qui … Math fit tourner sa main devant son nez à la façon des italiens quand ils cherchent leur mot. - … Qui frappe les esprits. La jeune fille passa le bras derrière son dos et en ressortit un petit couteau qu'elle tint devant elle. Le manche était entouré de bandes de cuir sur lequel était peint un symbole à moitié effacé. - Je connais bien les types dans ton genre Stan. Je nettoie la planète de leur sale gueule depuis un bail déjà. Si tu entendais tout ce qu'ils peuvent dire quand ils ont un flingue sous le nez. Soudain ils n'ont plus de masque. C'est comme si on pouvait voir leur âme juste avant qu'elle foute le camp. Et des types comme toi, j'en ai vu des tas. Malgré la douleur que lui arrachait chaque respiration, le policier se composa un air de défi. … Elle se gourait grave. Il était très loin d'être « un type comme les autres ». Dans les faits, on avait jamais vu son putain de pareil ! - Je sais que tu t'en fous de crever, dit-elle en le dévisageant. T'en as rien à faire parce que t'as fait ta marque. T'es devenu une telle terreur qu'on te craindra même après ta mort. C'est ça ta raison de vivre. Être le plus grand fils de pute que New-York ait jamais portée. Et le pire c'est que t'as réussi. Pas vrai ? T'es un grand parmi les grands. Une légende. On parlera de toi pendant des années. Sûrement qu'un jour quelqu'un écrira un livre sur toi et qu'il y aura même un film. Un affreux sourire plein de dents écarlates étira les lèvres du dément. Pour ça, elle avait foutrement raison. Même si sa carrière était quelque peu écourtée, sa main resterait imprimée à jamais sur le walk of fame des plus terrifiants salauds d'Amérique ; tout juste entre Capone et Manson. - Sauf que malheureusement pour toi … tu as tué mon petit frère. Elle lui montra le canif à nouveau et dans les yeux de la jeune fille le policier vit une lueur froide qui le fit douter. … C'était quoi ce putain de couteau ? - Mafia russe, dit-elle en couvant le poignard d'un regard tendre. On a pas mal de contrats pour eux ces temps-ci. Ils jouent du coude sur le territoire des italiens … tu sais ce que c'est. Les couteaux comme celui-là c'est la marque des Kiprov. Ils en laissent un pour signer un crime ou faire savoir qu'ils sont passés. Tu connais ce gang ? C'est leur symbole là tu vois, dit-elle en lui mettant le manche sous le nez. Stansfield n'avait jamais entendu parler de ces merdeux et de toute façon il n'avait jamais fait affaire avec les siffleurs de vodka. Mathilda le fixa d'un air résolu. Le poignard vola dans ses mains et d'un coup sec, elle le lui planta sauvagement dans l'entre-jambes. Le moribond sursauta mais son cri ne fut qu'un gargouillis sanguinolent. Il approcha sa main tremblante du coutelas avec le réflexe de l'enlever mais abandonna aussitôt, incapable de s'y résoudre. Mathilda se recula dans son banc pour juger de l'effet général. - Ça, ça veut dire que la mafia russe t'as descendu parce que t'es une saleté de pervers qui s'en prend aux enfants, expliqua t-elle. Le policier la dévisagea incrédule. Putain de merde … Il n'avait jamais touché à un foutu mioche de sa vie ! … Du moins pas comme ça. Quelle conne ! Ce truc sentait le coup monté à dix kilomètres et personne n'y croirait. Il se sentit tout à la fois soulagé et déçu. Soulagé parce que son plan était merdique et déçu pour les mêmes raisons. Finalement, ce n'était qu'une petite pute comme les autres. Elle avait simplement eu un bon professeur. Mathilda planta ses yeux dans les siens. - Quand on te trouvera arrangé comme ça dans un train qui est toujours bourré de gamines, on prendra la chose au sérieux. On fera des vérifications et on apprendra que juste avant d'y passer, ce bon Stansfield a été aperçu devant un collège de jeune fille. Le collège orthodoxe où vont presque tous les soviets friqués de la ville. Stansfield réalisa soudainement que ce n'était pas par hasard qu'elle l'avait entrainé devant cette école et une sourde inquiétude se mit à courir dans sa moelle épinière. - Quand on apprendra que tu étais devant ce collège qu'est-ce qu'on en déduira ?On déduira que l'inspecteur Stansfield était un pervers qui a eu la mauvaise idée de chasser des gamines bolchéviques et que c'est pour ça que les Kiprov lui ont réglé son cas. La jeune fille croisa gracieusement la jambe. Une pose féminine qui jura étrangement avec son déguisement d'adolescent boutonneux. - Évidemment les homicides auront des doutes mais quand la surveillante rousse dira qu'elle a vu ce salaud prendre une élève en chasse dans les couloirs du collège … puis quand d'autres témoins confirmeront qu'il a suivi cette fille jusque dans le train, il faudra bien se rendre à l'évidence, dit Mathilda fataliste. Et soudain, le policier comprit la machination. Elle l'avait piégé. Totalement. Le feu qui dévorait sa poitrine et l'élancement insupportable de son entre-jambe poignardé passèrent au second plan. Elle avait bien l'étoffe du prédateur qu'il avait cru deviner et le chant de la clarinette jaillit à nouveau sous son crâne avec insolence. Malheureusement pour elle, les collègues n'y croiraient jamais et de toute façon ils étoufferaient l'affaire mais c'était tout de même bien pensé. Mathilda lui sourit. - Tu crois que ça ne marchera pas. Pas vrai ? Après tout, pourquoi un policier d'expérience ferait quelque chose d'aussi idiot ? Hein ? C'est évident que ça ne colle pas. Sauf que tu oublies quelque chose … Elle baissa les yeux et haussa un sourcil étonné. - Tiens, justement … Elle se pencha par terre et cueillit la petite pilule magique qui n'accomplirait jamais sa destinée. - Le labo qui analysera le sang du suspect aura une sacrée surprise, dit-elle en faisant tourner la gélule entre ses doigts. Ils trouveront exactement le genre de saleté qui peut pousser un inspecteur à perdre toute prudence pour agir au grand jour comme un con exalté. Enfin, Mathilda vit la peur dans les yeux de son ennemi. Il hocha la tête comme pour nier que cela pouvait se produire mais c'était en vain. Il était camé jusqu'aux oreilles et ils le découvriraient inévitablement. Par contre … oui. Par contre le bureau ne le laisserait jamais sortir cette info sinon le DEA serait dans une sacré merde. La jeune fille lui jeta un regard de connivence. - Tout ça c'est drôlement croustillant tu ne trouves pas Stan ? S'il fallait qu'un journaliste en entende parler … Elle leva les yeux en l'air comme si elle réfléchissait. - Je verrais bien William Norton sur ce coup là. Tu te souviens de lui ? Tu as descendu sa femme parce qu'il avait fait un papier sur toi. Il serait drôlement motivé, dit-elle comme si elle trouvait l'idée amusante. Et puis s'il savait d'avance le résultat des tests sanguins, ce serait difficile de les cacher au public. Ah et j'y pense ; quelqu'un pourrait lui envoyer ce cachet et il connaîtrait même le nom du produit. Mathilda sourit en coin et se rapprocha d'un air de confidence. - Si je l'appelais de la gare, chuchota t-elle, je suis sûre qu'il accourrait si vite qu'il réussirait à photographier vos cadavres avant que les homicides débarquent. Et Stansfield qui sentait ses forces l'abandonner comprit que c'est exactement ce qui allait se produire. Savoir que c'est ce gros connard de Norton qui allait se farcir le scoop et jubiler en l'immortalisant avec les burnes mutilées l'enragea au point qu'il ne put cacher l'éclair de rage qui traversa ses yeux vitreux. - Te fâche pas. Toi qui veux être célèbre … Imagine plutôt les gros titres. Elle s'avança au bord de son siège en prenant une pose théâtrale. - « Un inspecteur du DEA est soupçonné de pédophilie, d'enlèvement et de trafic d'enfant ! ». Puis rebondissement : « Norman Stansfield traquait une jeune élève juste avant d'être assassiné dans le train où il l'avait suivie ! ». Ensuite c'est le scandale : « L'autopsie révèle que le policier était sous l'emprise de drogue alors qu'il était en fonction ! ». Et tu peux en imaginer des dizaines d'autres du meilleur au pire. Ce sera génial. Le public va adorer je te promets. Mathilda afficha un air joyeux comme si elle allait lui annoncer une merveilleuse nouvelle. - Et le mieux dans tout ça c'est que comme j'ai liquidé ton équipe de nuls, on croira qu'ils étaient impliqués eux aussi. Six agents du DEA assassinés comme des pédophiles alors qu'ils traquaient une fillette … Elle leva les mains devant elle comme pour donner plus d'importance au gros titre. - « Affaire Norman Sansfield. Le DEA sous enquête ! », dit-elle triomphalement. Cette fois, le policier moribond ne s'extasia pas sur l'intelligence retorse de sa redoutable tortionnaire, il la craint. Même au travers les bouillons de l'immonde douleur, il comprenait qu'un cirque médiatique autour de telles accusations mettraient forcément le DEA dans l'eau bouillante et alors … - Un inspecteur qui trempe dans le trafic de drogue depuis des années, c'est la pire chose qui peut arriver au DEA c'est évident. Leur seul espoir c'est de détourner l'attention des médias et justement, ils vont avoir beaucoup de chance sur ce coup là. Les journaux adorent les histoires de pervers sexuels détraqués alors tu peux être sûr qu'ils te jetteront en pâture aux chiens à grands coups de pieds. Ils fabriqueront même des preuves s'il le faut. Le fou furieux la fixa de ses yeux exorbités. - Tu comprends ce que ça veut dire ? Ça veut dire que t'es foutu Stan. Oublie tes rêves de gloire. Sur ta pierre tombale ce sera juste écrit « saleté de pédo ». Il hoqueta comme s'il voulait protester. - Jamais personne n'osera se vanter de t'avoir connu. Personne ne s'intéressera à ce que t'as pu faire. Il n'y aura pas de livre, pas de film. On te crachera dessus et on ne parlera plus jamais de toi, sauf pour vomir. Les yeux du mégalomane se fermèrent brusquement comme s'il en avait déjà trop entendu. - T'es un homme totalement mort Stan. Plus mort qu'un déchet. Même ton souvenir est mort. La tête de l'inspecteur s'affaissa et un filet de sang coula de ses lèvres, tachant sa chemise blanche. - Et ça, ÇA, c'est pour mon ptit frère, dit-elle avec les yeux brillants. Elle le fixa gravement un long moment mais ne resta pas auprès de lui pour le voir mourir. C'était un spectacle qu'elle avait déjà vu cent fois et sa vengeance était ailleurs. Comme elle avait déjà fait le trajet à trois reprises, tout était parfaitement minuté. Elle eut le temps de s'assurer que toutes ses victimes avaient l'air dormir et que leurs blessures étaient bien dissimulées. Elle se changea, effaça toutes ses traces, vérifia que Stansfield était bien mort, le couvrit avec son veston puis le train s'arrêta et elle descendit au terminus désert. Elle attendit afin de s'assurer que le train repartait en sens inverse puis appela William Norton qui faillit faire dans son froc en apprenant que le cadavre de l'assassin de sa femme l'attendait bien au chaud dans un train de banlieue. Elle monta dans le train suivant et tout en regardant distraitement les quartiers monotones qui défilaient par la fenêtre, Mathilda ressentit l'impression paisible et exaltante que l'on éprouve lorsqu'on sait qu'un chapitre de sa vie vient de se terminer.[Chapter 22] Aujourd'hui était un grand jour. On changeait la plante de pot. Tous les instruments étaient sur la table, méticuleusement alignés dans l'ordre. Sac de terre enrichie de tous les minéraux imaginables, pot de plastique bleu un chouia plus grand que l'autre, grosse cuillère et sac de poubelle en cas de déversement accidentel. Léon sérieux comme un pape, tourna la plante avec application comme pour s'assurer une dernière fois qu'elle ne se sauverait pas en courant une fois libérée. Mathilda, le menton dans la main, sourit en le regardant. Elle adorait quand il avait cet air concentré. - On pourrait aussi la planter dehors et la laisser vivre sa vie, dit-elle comme le voulait la tradition. Comme toujours, Léon hocha la tête. Il aimait bien avoir cette plante à la maison et Math haussa les épaules comme quoi au moins, elle avait essayée. Presque imperceptibles, des bruits de pas dans le couloir. En à peine un clin d'œil, ils se trouvèrent en position à la porte d'entrée, le pistolet au poing. Les pas se rapprochèrent, ralentirent. Sans même se regarder, Léon et Mathilda enlevèrent la sécurité de leurs armes, prêts à faire feu. Ce n'était pas l'heure du facteur. Léon s'avança prudemment pour regarder dans l'œil de bœuf. Il leva le doigt, signe d'attente puis le baissa, signe que tout était sous contrôle, tandis que la fente de la porte faisait entendre un tintement métallique familier. Une lettre glissa à leurs pieds et les pas repartirent en sens inverse. Ils restèrent néanmoins immobiles une bonne minute sur le qui-vive puis Léon rangea le fusil dans sa ceinture, imité par son élève. Il se pencha et saisit l'enveloppe. Elle était parfaitement blanche et nue. Il indiqua le divan de la tête et Math l'y suivit, le cœur battant. Elle était revenue la veille de sa « visite-de-reconnaissance-dans-le-Vermont-qu'elle-était-bien-capable-de-faire-seule-parce-qu'elle-en-avait-marre-à-la-fin-qu'il-ne-lui-lâche-jamais-les-basque-! ». Ce pouvait être un contrat mais ce pouvait être aussi … Léon s'assit sur le divan pour observer l'enveloppe sous toutes les coutures et ne voyant rien de suspect, déchira l'embout. Il fourra pratiquement le nez dedans pour de nouvelles vérifications et Math assise sur le bras du fauteuil croisa les bras en soupirant. - Vérifie s'il y a pas de bombe surtout. - On ne sait jamais, dit Léon. - Allez quoi ! Le tueur la regarda avec sérieux. - Toujours tout vérifier. Tout. - Je sais, je sais, dit Math en levant les yeux au ciel. Léon sortit la feuille de papier avec précaution pour inspecter à nouveau l'intérieur de l'enveloppe et Mathilda se fit violence pour ne pas lui arracher la lettre des mains. Enfin il déplia le papier qu'il regarda longuement en mettant Math au supplice puis fronça les sourcils comme il le faisait toujours lorsqu'il se mettait à lire. - Salut … Léon, ânonna-t-il. Comment va ta … mère. Il brandit la lettre devant le nez de Math. - C'est Tony ! dit-il joyeux. - Bha oui, j'ai reconnu son mot de passe, dit Math en feignant que ça ne l'intéressait plus trop. Qu'est-ce qu'il veut ? Léon haussa les épaules comme quoi il ne le savait pas encore. - Ici tout vas très … bien mais je dois t'annoncer que notre vieil ami … Stan est mort. Léon resta immobile un instant et pinça les lèvres en prenant un air désolé. - Il était à toi …, dit-il navré. La jeune fille haussa les épaules comme si elle était contrariée mais se faisait une raison. - C'était un vrai salaud. Je devais pas être la seule à vouloir lui faire la peau. Léon approuva gravement et ne sachant pas trop quoi dire devant le tragique évènement, continua la lecture pour se donner contenance. - Tu viendras faire un tour avec notre amie M. pour son anni … anniversaire. On fera une fête pour ses dix-huit ans. Léon regarda Math étonné. - C'est pas moi qui le dit, lui fit-elle remarquer d'un air innocent. Léon réfléchit un instant comme s'il avait l'impression que quelque chose lui échappait. - Tonny … comment il savait ? - Il sait toujours tout, tu sais bien, rétorqua-t-elle comme si sa question était bizarre. Léon dû en convenir. - Ben dis donc …, dit-il en regardant la lettre comme si allait lui exploser à la figure. Mathilda se leva debout sur le divan et enjouée, se mit à sauter sur le coussin. - L'important c'est qu'on peut retourner à New-York. Ce serait bien qu'est-ce que t'en dis ? Tandis que le tueur tressautait entre les bonds, il plia la lettre d'un air concentré. - Refaire des contrats dans notre quartier. Hein ? Ce serait génial, dit Math en se laissant tomber près de lui. Léon haussa les épaules. - Il nous a invités non ? - Mmmm. - Léon ! Il la regarda comme s'il sortait d'une profonde réflexion. - Aller à New-York. Ça te dit ? - Oui. Peut-être, dit-il songeur. Mathilda l'observa dubitative. Clairement, il allait avoir un peu de mal à se faire à l'idée qu'elle n'était plus une gamine. … Mais ce n'était pas pour cette raison qu'il avait l'air aussi préoccupé et il la dévisagea gravement. - Quoi ? dit-elle. - C'était bien ? demanda t-il. Math le dévisagea à son tour, incertaine. - Stansfield. Elle pinça les lèvres et sourit d'un air malin. - Mieux que bien. Il hocha la tête. Si elle le connaissait comme sa poche, il la connaissait tout aussi bien. - Je devais le faire seule tu comprends … C'est pour ça que je t'ai rien dit. Il hocha la tête à nouveau. Il comprenait parfaitement. Il leva la lettre devant lui. - Et tu vas avoir dix-huit ans ? En fait elle allait avoir dix-sept mais qui avait besoin de le savoir. - C'est Tony en personne qui le dit, lui rappela-t-elle indifférente. Il la fixa l'air de dire qu'il n'était pas dupe. Il se leva, ouvrit le tiroir du bureau de l'entrée et y prit un papier. Il le posa sur le bureau, mit la lettre à côté et ouvrit la petite lampe. - Pffft, tu crois vraiment que je m'abaisserais à faire un faux ? La réponse était tellement évidente qu'il ne jugea pas nécessaire de répondre. - Non mais pour qui tu me prends, dit-elle en s'allongeant sur le sofa, la conscience tranquille. Il compara les écritures en pattes de mouches et il dû se rendre à l'évidence, c'était bien la main de Tony. Ou du moins, c'était parfaitement imité. - Tu crois que si j'avais fait faire un faux j'aurais dit que Tony nous invitait ? dit-elle en croisant les mains derrière sa tête. Il serait drôlement content de nous voir débarquer chez-lui sans avertir … Je ne suis pas stupide à ce point. J'aurais juste dit qu'il me souhaitait bon anniversaire. Léon la regarda incertain. - Si tu ne me crois pas, on a qu'à aller à New York et tu verras bien. Il se gratta la tête embêté. - J'imagine qu'on pourrait y aller. - Bha ouais ! Ce serait génial ! dit-elle tout sourire. Elle se releva en tapant dans ses mains comme pour motiver les troupes. - Bon. Et la plante … Elle étouffe la pauvre. Léon glissa la lettre dans le tiroir et suivit la jeune femme dans la cuisine où ils reprirent leurs places respectives. Tandis que Léon faisait tourner le pot entre ses mains comme pour prévoir d'avance toutes les difficultés imaginables, Mathilda sourit à son grand amour. - Dis donc, cette année tu ne pourras pas dire que tu ne savais pas que c'était mon anniversaire. Tu penses m'offrir quoi ? Il lui renvoya un regard profond et sérieux. Il ne l'avait jamais regardé de cette façon et Mathilda en frémit des pieds à la tête. Il lui adressa un de ses rares sourires. - C'est une surprise, dit-il mine de rien. Tandis que Léon libérait la jolie plante verte de son contenant avec des gestes précis et délicat, elle se dit que ce serait avec la même délicatesse qu'il la toucherait elle-aussi. - Tu m'embrasses ? demanda-t-elle pour la cent millième fois de leur vie commune. - Non, dit-il en caressant les feuilles comme pour rassurer sa protégée. - Pourquoi ? - Tu ne voudrais pas gâcher la surprise, dit-il comme si ça allait de soi Elle lui sourit et tandis que leur plante était soigneusement installée dans sa nouvelle demeure elle se dit qu'eux aussi s'apprêtaient à emménager dans une vie plus vaste et plus riche. - Léon... - Mmmm ? - Je t'aime. Il tassa soigneusement la terre en évitant de la regarder. - Il faudrait pas que tu te ramollisses. - Je peux te fiche une raclée n'importe quand si tu y tiens. Viens dans la chambre et je te montre, suggéra-t-elle. Il tourna le pot entre ses grandes mains pour s'assurer que tout était parfait. - J'attend les preuves. Ensuite ... on verra, dit-il en la toisant. - Ben dis donc, la confiance règne. - Je te connais, dit-il en haussant les épaules. - Pas encore, rétorqua-t-elle d'un air suggestif. Il la regarda longuement. - Les règles sont les règles. Il faut faire les choses correctement. Elle pinça les lèvres d'un air déçu mais résigné. - Bon. D'accord. Mais dans ce cas, je dois me changer les idées. Elle sortit son arme de la pochette accrochée à sa hanche et recula la culasse pour s'assurer qu'une balle y était dans le magasin. - On va casser du bolchévique ? Il y a la bande à Nicolaï qui reste à nettoyer. Léon sourit en coin. Il adorait son air professionnel totalement irrésistible. - Et si on allait plutôt à New York voir Tony ? Les yeux de Mathilda brillèrent de mille feux. - On devrait emmener la plante, dit-elle en souriant. Qui sait si on reviendra. - Qui sait. Il fallut vingt minutes pour vider l'appartement à la suite de quoi ils fermèrent la porte et personnes à Los Angeles ne les revit plus jamais. Ou du moins, personne d'assez vivant pour pouvoir en témoigner. Fin ","Summary":" Et si Léon avait réussi à s'en tirer ... Tony descendit les marches qui menaient au sous-sol du res"},{"Movie":"Bodyguard, 1992","Title":"When Fate Decides to Play Matchmaker","Author":"I-Love-My-Sexy-Man-Prince","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8561976","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Frank just moved to L.A. with his parents to start a new life. Rachel is a cheerleader at his new high school. Frank had a bad tragedy that change his life. Rachel has a secret gift that only her best friend and strangers at a camp know about. Put drama and drama together and you see what happens When Fate Decides to Play Matchmaker. The meeting \"Honey, wake up,\" Frank heard his mother says softly. \"Just a few more minute,\" he muffled into his pillow. \"Come on Frank, you don't want be late for your first day of school, do you?\" she asked. He opened his eyes and looked at her. \"No, mom.\" She smiled at him and said, \"Good, get up and come eat your breakfast before it gets cold.\" She left the room and let him get dressed. After rummaging through his closet, he settled on his work jeans and white-t. \"Morning Dad,\" he said when he sits at the table. \"Hey son,\" Herb said. \"Hey, can I see the stats on the last 49ers game? Frank asked. \"They lost 12 to 6.\" Frank banged his fist on the table, \"Damn it.\" \"What did you just say?\" his mom asked putting his breakfast on the table. \"Uh, dang it.\" \"That's what I thought.\" \"Oh Katie let the boy be a boy. If he wants to curse let him curse,\" Herb said. Katherine sat down and glared at him. Frank felt the temperature drop. \"I am not feeling any love in this room,\" he said. That made his mom crack a small smile. \"I'm sorry, honey,\" Herb apologized. Katherine smiled at him and leaned in to kiss him. \"Okay, I just lost my appetite, I got to go.\" Frank grabbed his backpack and ran out the door. \"Love you guys,\" he yelled. He and his family just moved to L.A. two weeks ago from Oregon. Frank wasn't that thrilled about leaving Oregon, but there was nothing left there for him and his family but memories. His father got a great job as a lawyer and his mom wanted to open up a floral shop. Frank just wanted to play football and get a scholarship. But, he didn't want to play football at this school though. These next two years he wanted to go unnoticed. Why on earth did he think he could? As he walked into the gates of the school, he noticed how separated everybody was. Jocks were with jocks, cheerleaders were with cheerleaders, nerds were with nerds, loners were, well, alone and nobodies were with nobodies. He knew that he was not going to fit in easily. Frank walked through the crowd and finally found his locker and dumped his afternoon textbook. The bell rang and he went to his first class. \"Hey Rachel,\" Rachel's friend Mia said catching up to her. \"Hey girly,\" Rachel said. \"Did you figure out a new routine for the team?\" Mia asked. Rachel held up her routine book and said, \"What do you think this thing is filled with.\" \"Hey don't get smart.\" Rachel was the head of Whitmore High School's cheerleading team and she was the best they had. She had a great imagination and an even better taste in music to dance to. She was also very popular for being the most beautiful girl in the school. Every guy wanted her, but couldn't have her. She was a Christian girl who only believed that one should wait to have relations until they are married or are truly in love and ready. To guys it was a bunch of baloney because the last guy she dated spread rumors that they did it. He was mad because she didn't want to sleep with him and he went too far and put his hand under her shirt. She kneed him in his wenis. She was very charismatic and had a charm no other girl had. But she also had a secret. At lunch, she sat at her usual table and ate her usual salad and brownie to the side. \"How was every one's summer?\" she asked her cheerleader friends. They all started talking all at once and she tried to listen to all of their stories until she saw her best friend Andre (he's gay). \"Dre,\" she yelled getting up. He saw her and screamed, \"Rachel!\" and ran to her. He hugged and lifted her up and spun her around. \"I missed you,\" he said when he set her down. \"I missed you too. How was the Bahamas?\" she asked sitting down. He sat across from her. \"It was a-maz-ing. Do you know that most of the guys had no shirt on half the time?\" \"Oohh, so did you meet someone?\" \"Yeah, and he was delicious. His name was Dexter and we had the time of our lives.\" \"Sexy Dex.\" They continued to talk about everything that happened over the summer. \"So, how was singing camp?\" Andre asked. \"Shh, don't say that out loud. I will tell you about it later.\" \"Whatever but you should have seen parent's face-\" Rachel got distracted she looked across the cafeteria and saw a boy sit down by himself. He had a serious but sexy look on his face, dusty blonde hair the kind of reminded her of Steve Macqueen , baggy jeans that didn't sag like the other boys at the school, and smoky green eyes that made her shiver a little. \"Rachel, what are you staring at?\" Rachel snapped out of her trance. She point at the boy across the room and asked, \"W-who's that?\" Andre turned around to see who she was gawking at. \"Oh, I don't know his name but, he is in my auto shop class. I hear he just got here from Oregon,\" Andre replied. Rachel rested her chin on her hand. \"He is gorgeous.\" \"Yeah, but unfortunately, he's straight.\" Rachel giggled, \"That ain't unfortunately for me.\" She had to talk to him, but the pep rally was about to start. She got up and went to the quad. \"Okay you guys, since Stacey is a no show we are just going to do a preview for Friday's game,\" Rachel said to her team. \"Everybody give it up for Whitmore High School's Eagles!\" Rachel put her hand in the middle and everyone piled their hands on top. \"Eagles on three,\" Rachel said, \"One, two, three.\" \"EAGLES!\" They ran outside and got in their positions. Rachel looked and saw the boy she saw in the cafeteria. It shocked her for a moment but she had to focus on the routine. The music started and she yelled, \"Five, six, seven, eight.\" Frank watched the cheerleaders dance and introduce themselves. He thought it was kind of boring but then he saw a girl that took his breath away. She was one of the cheerleaders. She was tall and thin but curvaceous, had coco brown skin, her hair was wildly loose and her face was as gorgeous as a goddess. The whole time she was cheering and dancing he couldn't take his eyes of her. She turned her face and caught him staring at her. She smiled at him and kept dancing. The music ended and the dancing stopped. \"Hey man,\" he heard a voice say behind him. Frank turned around, \"Yeah?\" \"Man, I'd advise you not to look at my girl.\" The guy looked like a stocky jock who was trying to be intimidating. \"Um, I was just watching the cheerleaders,\" Frank said. \"No you were staring at my girl. The one with the forest hair is mine. Don't let me catch you looking at her again,\" the guy turned around and walked away. 'Okay, that was weird.' He walked away from the crowd a few minutes later to the empty hallways. Frank reached it to his backpack for his book and bumped into someone with papers flying everywhere. \"Dammit, I'm sorry.\" The person bent down to grab the papers and so did Frank. He gathered most of the papers. \"No, it's-\" he looked up and realized it was the girl from the cheerleading team. She was looking straight into his eyes, shocked. Frank looked down at the papers and back at her and said, \"It's okay, I should have been looking.\" He handed her the papers. Rachel smiled and took the papers. \"Um, is that your book?\" she asked pointing to the book on the floor. \"Oh, yeah thanks,\" he picked it up and put it in his backpack. They stood up. \"So, uh, where were you rushing to?\" Frank asked. \"Oh, I was trying to hurry and find my locker. Those boneheads we call counselors changed it again.\" Frank looked at his feet and said, \"Do you need some help?\" \"Sure,\" she said. \"So, what's your locker number?\" he asked. \"B23138.\" \"Oh, that's right next to mine, come on.\" They walked side by side and every time their hands bumped into each other Frank's heart skipped a beat. \"Here we are, B23138. And mine is B23140.\" \"Thanks, I swear I passed this place about five times and didn't even pay attention,\" Rachel said. \"No problem, I'm Frank by the way, Frank Farmer,\" he held out his hand. Rachel shook his hand, \"Rachel Marron.\" \"That's a very pretty name Rachel.\" Rachel blushed, \"Thank you.\" They let go of each other's hand. \"So what's your next class?\" Frank asked. \"Home economics.\" \"Me, too. Do you have Ms. Bache?\" Rachel nodded. \"Well, do you mind if I walk with you to class?\" \"Not at all.\" They walked through the halls together. \"So, I never seen you around here, are you new?\" Rachel asked. \"Yeah, I came from Oregon.\" \"Why did you move here? Oregon sounds way more peaceful then Los Angeles.\" \"It is peaceful,\" he said. \"Then why leave?\" \"My dad got a great job at a law firm and my mom wanted to open a flower shop.\" \"Was that what you wanted?\" Rachel asked. Frank sighed. \"I didn't really didn't care,\" he said. Before they could say anything the bell rang and they went inside the classroom. After school Rachel walked home with Andre. \"So are you going to tell me about singing camp?\" Andre asked. \"It was fine, just like last summer. We worked on vocals and harmonizing, just the basics.\" \"You know you are very good at acting like you hate singing when you love it,\" he said bumping her. Rachel sighed and spun around a bus pole. \"You know you love to sing, why fight it?\" he asked. \"You don't understand, Nikki is the singer in my family not me. I'm meant stay home and run my mom's bakery with her, not sing.\" \"But that's not your dream Chelly. You love to write music, good music at that.\" \"You've been looking in my song book again; I told you it was private,\" she scolded. \"Whatever.\"[Chapter 2] So, I've been busy and this story has been on my mind since I started high school. And I'm trying to use titles now so some might make sense and some might not. But ya'll might like this so... smooches. Love ya'll, enjoy. ome The Party Frank and Rachel didn't talk that much for the rest of the week. There was a 'hi' here and there but not a conversation. He dreamt about her for at least three nights. Rachel always died a little when he would just walk past her and not say anything. She never felt that way about any guy that she only talked to for less than five minute. As usual she had to figure out a way to talk to him. At lunch, she spotted at his usual table reading his book. \"I'll be back,\" she said to Andre. \"Going to talk to the future father of your children?\" Andre teased. Rachel ignored him and went to Frank's table. He didn't notice her walking up to his table. He heard someone sit down but didn't look up. \"Is anyone sitting here?\" he heard an angelic voice asked. He looked up and saw Rachel. He threw his book in his backpack so fast that if you blinked you'd miss it. \"No, you can sit here if you want to.\" Rachel took a bite of her brownie and looked at Frank's lunch and saw a flower in his bag. \"Whoa, is that a purple rose?\" she asked amazed. Her favorite color was purple. Frank reached in his bag and grabbed the flower. \"Oh, yeah. My mom puts these in my bag every day. She says that you never know when you are going need to sweet talk someone,\" he looked at her fascination with the rose and said, \"You want it.\" Rachel's face lit up. \"Really? No I can't, your mom gave you that.\" \"No you can have it. It's better than not lasting a day in my backpack,\" he held out the rose to her. Hesitantly, she took the rose. \"Thank you,\" she said, \"I wonder what purple roses mean.\" \"Well being a florist's son, I know what every rose means.\" \"What about purple roses?\" she asked. Frank knew what it meant it was weird telling her what it meant. \"Uh, it means,\" he paused for a moment, \"It means love at first sight.\" It got real awkward real fast after he said that. Rachel smelled the rose and smiled. \"Well this is the most beautiful rose I have ever seen.\" They sat in silence for a few minutes. \"So Farmer, I wanted to ask you something,\" Rachel said. \"What?\" \"I was wondering if you were going to the school pajama party tonight?\" she asked, \"As the party manager I have to get as many people to come as possible.\" Frank thought about it for a moment before asking, \"So do I have to come in pajamas?\" \"Yes, if you don't, I would tie you down and glue my grandmother's nightie on you,\" she joked. Frank chuckled. \"Well if I can borrow my dad's truck, I will definitely come.\" It took everything inside Rachel from expressing her excitement. \"Okay.\" Just then the bell rang. \"Do you want to walk with me to class?\" Rachel asked. \"Okay.\" \"So, you want us to let you go to a pajama party till when ever you feel like coming home in my car?\" Herb asked when Frank sat his parents down and explained everything. Though he left Rachel out of the conversation. \"I wouldn't put it that way, but yeah, I guess.\" \"Honey I don't like the idea of you going to a party where there isn't an adult's supervision,\" Katherine said. \"Come on mom, it's at the school, I'm sure there will be some adults there,\" Frank argued. Katherine sighed and looked at Herb. \"Well, what do you think?\" she asked her husband. \"I think Frank is old enough to go to a party at his school. But, boy if you crash my truck, I will have your ass,\" Herb warned. \"Got it, thanks you guys,\" he ran upstairs to his room. When Rachel got to the party, and it was in full swing. She search for Andre and as usual, she found him spiking the punch. \"One of these days you are going to get caught,\" she said. \"Come on, it's only wine and you love wine,\" Andre said. \"You know I want to stop drinking, at least until I'm twenty-one.\" \"But it's your favorite, grape.\" Tonight Rachel just wanted to have some fun. \"You know what, pour me a glass.\" \"That's my girl.\" When Rachel started to feel just a tiny bit tipsy, she stopped drinking the punch; she didn't want to look like a drunk. Frank had been at the party for about ten minutes and hasn't seen Rachel yet. \"Hey, you want to dance,\"' a girl asked. \"No thanks, I don't dance,\" Frank said. \"Then why did you come?\" she asked. \"To listen to music.\" \"If you like music we can go to my place and make some of our own. My parents aren't home,\" she slurred. Before Frank could deny someone did for him. \"Toni, you are drunk and slutty, go home and take an aspirin,\" Rachel said standing next to Frank. \"You don't tell me what to do Marron, and besides he wants to come home with me, isn't that right?\" \"Uh, no thanks,\" he said. \"You heard him 7-11, blow away slut,\" Rachel told her. Toni mean mugged her and scoffed and walked away. \"That was a little harsh,\" Frank said. \"Sorry but if you turned her down she would have never stopped,\" Rachel explained. Frank looked at her up and down and his teenaged boy hormones went crazy. She on a tank top that said 'I'm Sexy and I Know It' and short striped pajama shorts. \"Nice PJs,\" he said not thinking. \"Thanks it was this or just a long jersey, I know, I look trashy.\" \"No, you look hot,\" Frank stopped and realized what he said, \"That didn't come out right. What I meant was you look, well you look-\" Rachel cut him off. \"Shut up and dance with me,\" she grabbed his hand and pulled him to the dance. She let go of his hand and started to dance. Frank froze. \"Let me guess, you don't dance,\" Rachel said still dancing. \"You guessed correctly.\" Rachel laughed. \"Let me take another guess, you know how to dance, but you don't like to.\" \"You are very smart.\" \"I know,\" just then a slow song came on, \"Give me your hands.\" \"Why?\" he asked. \"Just do it.\" He smiled and put his hands in hers. \"Okay,\" she put on his hands on her hips and her arms around his neck. His teenaged boy hormones were really going beyond crazy. \"For a guy who doesn't dance, you are really light on your feet,\" Rachel complimented, \"I bet every girl you've ever dated was swept off their feet.\" \"Well I never really dated a girl,\" Frank admitted. 'Okay, now I got him' \"Really, a good looking guy like you have never had a girlfriend?\" \"Nope, never.\" \"Never, dated a girl?\" \"Nope.\" \"You never… kissed a girl?\" \"If you call being conned by a friend into volunteering for the school kissing booth kissing a girl then yes, I have kissed a girl and raised 300$.\" \"Oh, then that's not a real kiss, that was business not pleasure.\" \"Well, then I have never had a real kiss for a girl.\" \"Mhm,\" was all she said. Then the DJ turned on another slow song. Rachel kept her eyes on Frank's the whole entire time. \"You know this slow crap is getting on my nerves,\" someone said. \"Oh God,\" Rachel whispered. She knew that voice; it was a voice she wanted to avoid. She slightly turned her head saw her ex staring at her. \"Frank, do me a favor?\" she asked. \"What?\" \"Hold me closer.\" \"What?\" he asked shocked. \"Just do it.\" Quickly he pulled her closer nearly hugging her hips. Remember when I said that his hormones were beyond crazy, well now they were going Brittany Spears crazy. Rachel's arms were wrapped around his neck very tightly. \"So Rachel, you found someone else to screw,\" the boy said. \"Just ignore him, Frank,\" she whispered. \"Hey, why are you going to disrespect the guy you lost your virginity too.\" Rachel sighed. \"Who is this guy?\" Frank whispered. \"A liar,\" she answered. \"Aren't you the jackass who was at the pep rally staring at my girl?\" Frank looked at the guy and held Rachel tighter. \"Alright, I see how it is, but this isn't over sweetheart,\" the boy said and left. Rachel let out a sigh of relief. \"You can let go of me now,\" she said. \"Oh,\" he let go of her. \"Come on let's go outside,\" she grabbed his and took his outside. \"Who was that?\" Frank asked when they got outside. \"I told you, he is a liar.\" She sat down on the stairs and ran her hands through her hair. \"I'm confused, can you at least tell me who he was.\" \"He is my ex. His name is Tyson and he is a liar.\" \"Okay,\" he sat next to her, \"How is he a liar?\" Rachel sighed. \"You know I am a very good listener,\" Frank said. \"We started dating last year, when I was a sophomore. I am gonna be honest, I'm not the best Christian in the world but I try to be one and as people may find it hard to believe, I am a virgin and I plan to stay that way until marriage or until I know I'm really in love. Tyson thought that he could break me and he try. When he would he hinted that he wanted to have sex with me I would just laugh it off and say I'm not ready. One night he went too far trying to break me of my abstinence and I almost broke something of his.\" \"I'm scared to ask what it was,\" Frank said. \"You should be. But after I did that, he got mad and started some rumors that I did something some stuff I would never do.\" \"Again, I am scared to ask what they were.\" Rachel chuckled. \"Well enough about me and my problems, I'm trying to figure out how you never dated a girl before, please tell me you're not gay because I already have one crazy ass gay friend, I don't think I can handle another,\" Rachel said. \"No, I am definitely not gay and I don't know why I've never been on a date before. I just got accustomed to be alone and I think sometimes I'm happy with it.\" This was Rachel's chance to pounce. \"So have you ever wanted to go on a date?\" \"I'm a guy, of course I think about but who would want to go out with a shy guy like me.\" 'Oh my God, he is so cute when he's naïve,' Rachel thought. \"Well why don't you ask me out?\" she asked quietly. Frank's heart almost exploded. He heard what she said but his brain didn't want to believe it. \"Well, would you say yes?\" he asked. Rachel smiled. \"I don't know, you have to ask me first.\" He chuckled a little. \"So, uh, Rachel?\" \"Yes?\" \"Would you like to go on a date with me tomorrow?\" he asked nervously. Rachel put her finger on her chin acting like she was thinking about it. \"Hm, it depends on what you plan on doing,\" she said. \"I'll figure it out.\" \"Okay, I would love to go on a date with you tomorrow,\" she said. They sat there in silence for a few minutes. \"We should get back inside. I want to see how drunk Andre is,\" Rachel said standing up. \"Yeah, good idea,\" he got up and followed her back in the building.[Chapter 3] Not going to be like the first date in the movie because I hated the end and didn't want to think about it. A little more modern but awesome, but that's my opinion. Plus in the movie Frank had a chip on his shoulder and that was the president's assasination and since that had a big part in the movie, in this story he isn't old enough to protect a president so I gave him another chip and it's a little more personal for him. The beginning is going to be a little deep and emotional. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Anyway, I was going to update yesterday but, you know, it was Halloween and you are never to old to go trick or treating. Enjoy fellow fanfictioners. Have a nice night or day, where ever the heck you are. First Date Frank got in the house around midnight. He opened the door to find his parents sitting at the kitchen table. \"Hey, what are you guys still doing up?\" he asked going to the refrigerator. \"Your mother wanted to wait up until you got back,\" his father said. \"Mom, seriously?\" \"I was worried, you're my baby and I wanted to make sure you got home in one piece.\" \"Whatever, good night you guys.\" Frank started up the stairs but his mom stopped him. \"Honey, I wanted to ask you something. But I know this is a touchy subject for you.\" He sat next to his mother and asked, \"What?\" \"It's that time of the year again. Her birthday is on Sunday,\" she said. \"I know,\" he mumbled. \"It would have been her tenth birthday,\" Herb said. \"I know.\" \"There is a church a few blocks from here they have a child center attached to it and they need some more stuff and we were think-\" Frank cut Katie off. \"I'm not giving her stuff away; you guys said I could keep it.\" \"Son, you keep everything in a box in the back of your closet, you don't use them. It's been six years; holding on to memories won't bring her back,\" Herb said, \"You have to let her go.\" Frank shook his head, \"No, she was my little sister I am not going to let her go,\" Frank yelled. \"We know that she was your little sister and you loved her, you have to remember that she was our daughter. We go through this every year, we loved her too.\" He broke eye contact and looked down at his hands. \"It won't help you heal if you keep her stuff,\" Katherine said. \"How come you guys can't just leave me alone about this? I will not give her stuff away.\" He got up and ran up the stairs. He slammed his door and opened his closet. He threw everything that was in his way out of the closet. He grabbed his sister's box and opened it. He hasn't opened the box in two years. Seeing his sister's stuff brought a lot of joy to his heart. Her teddy bear Maurice was the first thing he pulled out. ' Why do you love this thing so much?\" He would ask her. \"First of all, he's not a thing and second of all he protects me from bad things when you ain't here.\" \"It's aren't, not ain't.\" \"You say tomato, I say potato.\" \"It's… never mind.\" Frank laughed at that memory. The next thing he pulled out was the picture of him holding her on the day she was born. \"I can't believe I cried that day,\" he said to himself. \"Do you want to hold her Frank so mommy can take a nap?\" Katherine asked a seven year old Frank. \"Yes.\" Katherine gently handed her over to Frank. \"Careful not to drop her son,\" Herb said. Frank looked at his father. \"I'll never drop her,\" he looked back at the newborn, \"I'll never drop you.\" Droplets of tears were running down Frank's face. Frank decided that he should put everything back up and go to sleep. He slipped into his bed and fell asleep, with his sister's teddy next to him. In the morning the sunshine woke Rachel up and she had a hangover. \"Good morning sleepy head,\" she heard Andre say. That's when she realized she was at his apartment. \"You slept in, your little boyfriend will be at your house at eight and you aren't even close to being ready. We have to go to the mall and get to Victoria Secret.\" Rachel slowly got up, \"Why do we have to go to Victoria Secret?\" \"Because, you need more underwear and they got that new cake flavored lip gloss,\" he said, giving her some coffee. \"Thanks. Why do I need more underwear?\" \"Because, after tonight you will have a new boyfriend and you need sexy underwear to tease him with.\" \"Who said he would be my boyfriend?\" Rachel asked sipping the coffee. \"Well, that is a just in case factor and the lip gloss is for your good night kiss.\" \"Who said I want a good night kiss from him?\" \"Rachel, this is me you are talking too, I know from the day you pointed him out to me that you wanted to kiss his totally kissable lips.\" It wasn't a lie; the whole time Frank and Rachel talked she just watched his lips. \"See, you are fantasizing about them right now.\" \"You know what, you have to stop reading my mind,\" she teased. \"Go take a shower, we have work to do.\" Around eight, Rachel was waiting and not being able to stand still. \"Calm down Rachel or you are going to start sweating,\" Andre said. \"Why am I so nervous? It is just a date.\" \"Yeah, so calm down.\" Just then her doorbell rang. \"Oh my gosh, it's him. Where's my purse?\" she panicked. \"Stay calm, your purse is in the kitchen. Get it and I'll answer the door.\" Rachel raced for the kitchen in search of her purse. Andre opened the door and said, \"Hello.\" \"Hi, is Rachel ready?\" Frank asked. \"Yeah hold on, Chelly, hurry up,\" he yelled and looked back at Frank, \"She's a little nervous.\" \"Damn it Dre, where did you put my purse?\" she yell back. Andre laughed nervously and said, \"One second.\" He hurried and shut the door. \"Rachel Elizabeth, hurry up!\" he yelled making his way to the kitchen. \"Do you think I'm not trying?\" They found it 30 seconds later. \"Hey,\" Rachel said slipping out of the house. \"Hello Rachel,\" Frank said. \"Okay mister,\" Andre said busting in on them, \"I want her home by midnight or I'll bust you in the head with a pipe, got it?\" \"Ignore him,\" Rachel said, \"Come on let's go.\" \"Ookay,\" Frank said, guiding her to his truck. He opened the door for her and went to the other side. \"It's warm in here,\" Rachel said. Frank started the truck and said, \"It gets very cold in here so I just like the heater on.\" \"Mhm, so where are we going?\" she asked. \"To the night fair.\" \"I always wanted to go to the night fairs but no one would take me.\" Twenty minutes later they pulled into the parking lot. \"It looks crowded,\" Frank said. \"Yeah, mostly teens are here, the more the merrier.\" She started to open the door but Frank stopped her. \"Wait,\" he said rushing out the truck. He ran around and opened her door for her. \"I'm pretty much going off of what I see in movie since this is my first date, and my mom told me to be a gentleman.\" Rachel smiled as she got out of the car. Frank closed the door and they walked into the fair. \"What ride do you want to go on?\" Rachel asked. \"Hm, I don't know, you pick.\" \"Let's check out the haunted house.\" \"Are you sure you can handle the haunted house?\" he asked playfully. \"I can handle almost anything. Unless you want to give up an opportunity to hold my hand,\" she said. \"Uh, I guess we ch-check it out.\" \"I thought you could handle anything,\" Frank asked. That haunted house really shook her up. \"I can,\" she argued, \"That place wasn't that scary.\" Frank chuckled, \"Then why did you jump into my arms Scooby Doo style?\" \"Never speak of that again,\" she warned through her teeth. \"Yes ma'am.\" After they got on a few rides they walked through the fair hand in hand just talking. \"So how was your first week at Whitmore?\" Rachel asked. \"It was good,\" he replied. \"How many people have you met?\" \"Including you?\" \"No, minus me out.\" \"Okay, your friend Andre is my partner in auto shop class so that's one. There was this girl name Michelle, she kept asking me out Monday through Friday.\" Rachel's jaw clenched and she squeezed his hand more tightly. \"Anyone else?\" she asked. \"Nope.\" \"Step right up and win yourself a prize,\" they heard guy say. \"You young man,\" he pointed at Frank, \"Come on up and win your lovely lady a stuffed animal.\" Frank looked at Rachel and asked, \"Do you want me to win you something?\" \"Nah, there isn't nothing that I-\" then she spotted a keyboard. 'I need a new one,' she thought. \"Well, I could use another keyboard.\" Frank didn't ask her no question. \"Excuse me sir, what do I have to do to get that keyboard?\" he asked the man. \"Well, you have to kick the football through that H-shaped thing on one try. Be careful because it moves.\" \"Are you sure you can do that because I don't want you to waste five dollars on me?\" \"Don't worry, it won't be a waste,\" he assured her. He gave the man five dollars and got one football. \"Thirty second on the clock, Ready, Set, GO!\" The thing started moving and the time started. In ten seconds later, \"You Are A Winner.\" The man, with an attitude, got the keyboard. \"Here you go.\" \"Thank you,\" Frank took the keyboard. \"Beginner's luck,\" the man mumbled under his breath. \"Thanks,\" Rachel said. \"You are so very welcome,\" he said, \"I'll carry this for you.\" \"You know what; I'm kind of tired can you take me home?\" Rachel asked. \"Sure, if you want.\" \"Yeah, that haunted house wore me out.\" He laughed a little, \"All right let's go.\" She took his hand and they walked to his truck. \"Did you have fun?\" Frank asked walking Rachel to her door. \"Yeah, I did, especially on the swings, you screamed like a little girl,\" Rachel laughed. \"Well you would have screamed too if they put you on the loosest one.\" \"Yeah sure.\" They stood on her porch in silence for a few seconds before Frank asked, \"So, did Andre stay here or did he go home?\" \"I think he went home, hold on,\" she opened her door, went inside and set her new keyboard set and yelled, \"Dre!\" \"I'm in the bathroom!\" he yelled back. \"TMI!\" she yelled back before going back outside. \"Yeah, he's still here,\" she said. \"Alright,\" Frank said. \"So what are you doing tomorrow?\" she asked. \"I'm just going to hang out at my house,\" he said. \"Oh, you know you can come here for a few hours tomorrow if you just want to hang out,\" she suggested. Frank smiled. \"Maybe, if my parent's let me.\" Again, they sat there in silence, kind of awkward. \"So, I guess I'll see you later,\" Frank said. \"Yeah, see you later,\" Rachel said and went inside the house.[Chapter 4] A Sunday Surprise Rachel woke up to her house phone ringing. \"Hello,\" she grumbled. \"Hey honey.\" \"Hi, mommy.\" \"What are you doing?\" he mom asked. \"Trying to figure out why you called at six in the morning knowing I hate mornings.\" Her mom laughed. \"Why didn't you call us yesterday?\" \"I was hanging out with Andre in the day and I had a date last night.\" \"Oh, well the pastor called and they need you to run the daycare today if you aren't busy,\" her mother said. \"Mom, I'm not in the mood to babysit those bad asses.\" \"WWJD?\" \"Jesus knows I hate mornings and let me go back to sleep.\" \"Rachel I will call back at in two hours and you better be on your way to church,\" she hung up the phone before Rachel could argue. \"Uuuugh,\" Rachel groaned, \"I guess I up.\" She put on her robe and turned on her mom's old record play. \"Boring, boring, boring, boring,\" she said going through her mom's albums, \"Well, you guys will have to do.\" She put on the Temptations and got her day going. Getting dressed and singing \"My Girl\" from the top of her lung she almost didn't hear the doorbell. She turned off her music and went to the door. \"Does a Rachel Marron live here?\" a delivery guy asked. \"Yeah,\" she replied. \"Here you go,\" he handed her a box and started to leave. \"Wait, who is this from?\" she yelled. \"Read the card and find out.\" Rachel closed her door and opened the box. There was a purple petunia in it with a note. She read the note out loud, \"Something to brighten up your day since you brightened up my night. Love Frank Farmer.\" She started to smile and feel all fuzzy inside. \"Frank, can you just take the toys to the daycare?\" his mother asked. \"No, mom; those kids don't deserve her stuff,\" he shouted. \"Don't yell at your mother Franklin,\" his father said. \"Then tell you her to leave me alone.\" \"Frank, can we go one year without arguing on her birthday, you don't understand how unhealthy that is for you to…\" \"ALRIGHT, Jesus, I will let them have one thing and that is it. Please don't bother me again about this.\" He left out the house to cool off. \"He must have forgotten who he was talking too,\" his mother said. \"Katherine, you know that his temper is bad this time of the year. She was his little sister and probably his only real friend,\" Herb said. \"I know, but he has to remember that we were her parents and it hurt us too when she died. He can't blow up on me when I try to help him get over her no matter how mad he is.\" \"Katie, calm down, he will be fine.\" Three hours into it, Rachel wanted to shoot herself in the face. \"Rachel, I can't find my dolly,\" a little girl said. \"Your dolly is in the bathroom where you always leave it.\" Rachel was having the worst time of her life. \"Miss Rachel, I need to go,\" a little boy said. \"You need to go potty?\" \"I already went; I need to change my pull-up.\" 'He is four and he isn't potty changed yet.' \"I alright Willis go get your pull ups.\" \"Well, my pull ups are at my house, I was supposed to tell you when I had to go,\" Willis said. \"Then why didn't you?\" \"Because I thought I could hold it.\" \"Ugh,\" she started to rub her temples. \"Are you mad at me?\" \"No, sweetie. I'm not mad. Come on lets go get you a pull-up out of the storage closet.\" After getting him set up she hung out at the sign in desk. \"Rachel, you can go over the books if you are so bored,\" the First Lady said. \"Curse me for being so good at math,\" she bent down to get the receipts and that's when Frank walked in. \"Hello?\" he asked. 'Wait, I know that voice,' Rachel thought. \"Is anyone watching these bad asses?\" she heard him mumble. 'I knew I liked him. Damn it, the one day I go without makeup and I run into him.' That when she came up. \"Hello, how may I assist you?\" she asked. \"Hey, what are you doing back there?\" Frank asked. \"The Lord's work, what are you doing here?\" \"I'm donating a toy,\" he answered. Rachel confusingly looked in the box. Catching the look on her face he said, \"I thought someone should pick one so I don't have to.\" \"Oh okay, follow me to the toy center aka the storage closet.\" \"Who do these toys belong too?\" Rachel asked sitting on the closet floor. Frank sat next to her, \"My, uh, little sister.\" \"I didn't know you are a big brother, does she care if you give away one of her toys?\" Rachel asked. \"Um, she died six years ago.\" Grief started to flush through Rachel's head. \"Oh, I'm sorry, what was her name?\" Frank looked at the ground. \"Jocelyn, we called her Josie, she was only four years old.\" \"Frank,\" Rachel whispering in a soothing way. \"You know today she would have been ten. She had been planning for since she found out that ten was a huge milestone and she didn't even live to see the day.\" Rachel scooted closer to him and put her arms around him. \"It's okay, Frank.\" He was not normally that open, but he had still had stuff pent up. \"Hey, look at me,\" she turned his face so he'd look her in the eye, \"No matter what happen too her, she is in a better place. Now, if you don't want to give these crumb snatchers anything I will keep that box in here, okay?\" \"Okay, thanks.\" \"You know, I leave in about fifteen minutes, do you want to go get something to eat. I know this great bakery down the street,\" Rachel said. \"Okay, and could you not tell anybody about this, I will look sissy?\" Frank asked, helping Rachel off the floor. \"Talk about what?\" she smiled slyly. Frank only chuckled a little. \"Ciao bella ragazza, you working on you vacation?\" a man with a heavy Italian accent asked Rachel when they walked in to the bakery. \"You know that isn't true, Frank this is my Italian uncle Giorgio, Gio this is Frank,\" Rachel said. \"Oh, you that guy she says and I quote is, 'So Gorgeous,'\" he said in a high pitched girly voice. Frank looked at Rachel, who was blushing but was ready to snap Giorgio's neck. \"Gio, may I talk to you for a minute?\" she asked. \"Sure bella, follow me to the kitchen.\" Rachel looked at Frank, \"I'll be back in a second. Sit down and make yourself comfortable.\" \"Okay,\" he sat at a two chaired table while she followed Giorgio to the back. Ten minutes later Rachel came out of the kitchen with a small circle chocolate cake with a candle and a lighter. \"You didn't,\" Frank said. \"Oh yeah I did,\" she said sitting next to him. \"How did him to make this?\" Frank asked. \"I promised him a Christmas bonus.\" \"What?\" \"My family owns this place, I'm just not working till summer,\" she explained, \"I didn't know what was your sister's favorite flavor was so I just thought that you couldn't go wrong with chocolate. Plus, this is what I do every year on my grandmother's birthday, it makes me feel better.\" \"This is probably the best thing anyone did to do to make me feel better. It is way better than hearing that it okay.\" \"Well, I'm nice like that,\" she put the candle in the middle of the cake and lit it. \"So what do you think she would wish for?\" Rachel asked. \"Probably a pony with a diamond studded saddle.\" \"Okay then that's her wish, now blow out the candle before wax get on the cake.\" He started blow but stopped. \"You blow with me,\" he said. \"Okay, on three. One, Two, Three.\"[Chapter 5] Homecoming and Friendzone \"So, if you and Frank are just friends, why are ya'll going to homecoming together?\" Andre asked Rachel who was on the other side of clothes racks at Macy's. \"One, you won't go with me, two, he asked me and three just because we're just friends doesn't mean we can't go to homecoming together. Me and you went Freshman year,\" she said. \"Yeah but you weren't in love with me,\" he said. And I'm not in love with him,\" she said, lying through her teeth. Andre separated the clothes and made a face at her. \"I know what you're going to say, 'Who the hell am I fooling I'm head over heels in love with Frank and I'm just bull crapping myself.'\" He smiled, \"And wouldn't I be right?\" She looked at the ground, \"I'm not in love with him, I just really like him. A lot.\" \"Then why are ya'll still friends?\" Andre asked restarting his search for Rachel's dress. \"I don't know. I know he likes me, I sometimes catch him staring at me for no reason at all but he is just very shy and kept to himself.\" \"And you love that about him.\" \"Again, I don't love him!\" she shouted a little too loud. A few of the shoppers looked at them. \"Carry on with your shopping!\" Andre said to the shoppers. \"I don't love him,\" she said a little quieter, \"I just entertain the thought of us in the future.\" \"That's what I said, you love him.\" \"We are all packed. Honey, are you sure you want to stay here alone?\" Frank's mom asked. \"Yeah, I'll be cool for a week,\" he answered. \"You can come with us,\" she said. \"No, he can't. I want to be able to kiss my wife without hearing 'blech,'\" Herb said shutting the trunk of the car. \"Herb, I just hate leaving my baby,\" Katherine said hugging him tightly. \"I'm not a baby mom.\" \"You're my baby.\" \"Katherine, let's go before the plane takes off.\" Katherine let go of Frank and said, \"There is two hundred dollars on the counter and the number to the hotel is on the fridge. Call us and we will come right back.\" Frank sighed, \"Mom, everything will be fine. Don't worry.\" She got into the car, \"And be careful in your dad's car.\" \"Katie, he will be fine. But Frank be careful okay,\" Herb said. \"Okay you guys, please go and stop worrying.\" Herb drove out of the driveway and left. 'Finally,' Frank thought. Rachel and Frank hung out with each other very often. They loved being around each other and just watching football games and being themselves. Frank gave her a flower out his mother's garden almost every day and was really falling for her. The only problem was that they were stuck in the friendzone. \"So, did you find your dress yet?\" Frank asked her. They were strolling through the park. \"Yeah, did you find you tux?\" \"Yeah, a black tuxedo, just like you forced me to buy,\" he said. \"You have to admit, black looks great on you,\" she said hooking her arm around his, \"So where are your parents off to?\" \"North Carolina to see my family,\" he replied. \"Why didn't you go?\" she asked. \"I want to keep my cheeks.\" Rachel laughed out loud. \"Families ain't that bad.\" \"Oh so this ain't that bad,\" he pinched her on her cheek. \"Hey,\" she complained. \"What? You said it ain't that bad, so,\" he pinched her again. \"Stop.\" \"Nope.\" She tried to grab his hands but they were too fast. Then he started to poke her in her stomach. \"Stop that tickles,\" she laughed. But he didn't. She finally caught his hands but he kept trying. \"Come on, you said families ain't that bad. This is a week with my family,\" he said. \"Stop,\" she kept trying to hold his arms while he kept trying. All of a sudden, Frank tripped over a rock backwards and fell on the grass, with Rachel falling on top of him. The laughing stopped once they realized there position. Their faces were only millimeters away. Their lips were just about to meet when, \"Hey you two.\" They both sighed and quickly got up. \"Hey Dre,\" Rachel sighed. \"Hi Andre,\" Frank said. \"What's up? Um, Chelly, we got to go. Movie night starts in an hour and I need to find my movies.\" \"Okay,\" she said walk to his side, \"I will see you tomorrow Frank.\" \"Alright, bye you guys,\" he walked in the other direction. \"I didn't interrupt anything did I?\" Andre asked then shrieked as Rachel painfully tugged on his ear. \"No, it's just as soon as you walked up, he was about to kiss me,\" she said through her teeth. \"Oh my God, please let go of my ear,\" he begged. She let go but was still pissed. \"You mad at me?\" he asked. She tried to keep a straight face but started to bust out laughing. \"Nah, I'm not mad, I'm just frustrated. Pull that crap again and you'll have to sleep with one eye open.\" Frank walked through the park for a few more hours; watching the little kids, the couples on dates. One guy was one knee holding a ring to his girlfriend. He paid attention to this couple. He couldn't hear the man but he saw him mouth say, 'Will you marry me?' The woman looked at the ring and gasped. Then Frank saw her lips say, 'Yes.' Then man slid the ring on her finger and got up and kissed her. The sight warmed Frank's heart. He might not act like it, but her was a very romantic guy and like watching romance movies. To other's it doesn't make him a man but if only those players knew. Chicks love guys with a romantic side. As he kept walking he started to think about Rachel, like always. He was so scared sometimes when he was around her. She was too perfect to exist to him. Her perfect hair, her perfect face, her perfect voice, her perfect personality, her perfect smile that would be on her perfect lips that he longed to kiss, and her perfect body. 'Uh oh,\" he thought. Something biological made him rush to his car and leave the park. Oh yeah, he was a lovesick puppy for sure. Rachel, Mia, and Andre all gathered at Andre's apartment for a small sleepy over with ice cream, soda, and Sparkle. \"Stix is so fine,\" Andre said. \"Yeah, I would do anything to have that,\" Mia said. They both looked at Rachel for her to confirm but she was in lala land. \"Rachel,\" Mia said, snapping her fingers. Rachel snapped out of her thought. \"Huh?\" she asked. \"Thinking about the F-word?\" Andre teased. Mia, confused, asked, \"What F-word?\" \"Her boyfriend,\" Andre answered. \"He isn't my boyfriend!\" Rachel snapped. \"But, you want him to be. That's why you agreed to go to homecoming with him.\" Rachel didn't say anything. \"Wait, who are we talking about? Mia asked. \"The great Frank Farmer.\" \"Oh,\" Mia said, \"He's kind of cute.\" \"Kind of? Honey, he's gorgeous. And Rachel has had her heart set on him for three months.\" Mia looked at Rachel, \"Oh my God, she's blushing.\" \"Can you to two stay out of my love life?\" \"Sure,\" Andre said, \"When you get one.\" He and Mia started cracking up. Rachel got a pillow and started hitting both of them with it. \"That is not funny,\" she yelled. \"Then why are we laughing?\" A couple days later was the homecoming dance and Andre was helping Rachel get ready. \"So do you think he will finally kiss you tonight?\" Andre asked flat ironing Rachel's hair. \"We are just friends Andre.\" \"But maybe after tonight one of you will make a move, Jesus please let one of them make a move,\" he put his hand together a looked up. \"Shut up,\" she said reaching behind her and hitting him. \"Hey, don't make me burn you, now hold your ear.\" \"So, have you heard that Tyson is the biggest slut of the school?\" Rachel asked changing the subject. \"Yeah, it's sad that those other girls don't have the sense that you do. I'm surprise he still has a dick after you got through with him.\" Rachel laughed a bit. He got done with her hair, and started on her make up. \"What color is his tuxedo?\" \"Black.\" \"Pucker,\" he said before applying her lip gloss, \"Rachel, I'm dead serious right now, when you come back, come back with a boyfriend.\" Rachel sighed. \"What if I'm wrong? What if he doesn't like me like that, what do I do then?\" \"Rachel, I have seen the way he looks at you and trust me he likes you.\" \"But, what if he doesn't?\" she insisted. Andre shook his head . \"Then he'd be a fool not to, you want to know why?\" \"Why?\" she asked. \"Because you are beautiful,\" he spun her around and let her look in the mirror. Rachel was in awe when she saw what she looked like. \"Wow, you really need to reconsider not going to cosmetology school.\" Andre brushed the hair off her back, \"Then I'd be fitting into the stereotypes. How many gays in Los Angeles own hair salons.\" \"Who cares? You are graduating this year and you haven't even decided what you want to do after high school,\" she argued. A thought came into his head and he started smirking at her. \"What's that look on your face?\" she asked suspiciously. \"I think we should make a deal.\" \"What?\" \"When your first album goes triple platinum, I will go to beauty school.\" Rachel quickly shook her head, \"Then you are never going to beauty school.\" She put her dress on, purple, of course, and quickly ate a granola bar before her doorbell rang. She opened the door and saw Frank in the black tuxedo she made him buy. And his hair was gelled back. When Frank saw Rachel his mouth dropped. Her dress went down to her knee, showing off her long legs. Her make-up was just right and her hair was literally flowing. \"Hi,\" she said. \"Hey,\" he said, \"You ready?\" \"Ready as I'll every be. Andre, come lock the door,\" she called. \"Okay.\" Frank held out his hand and led her to his car. When they pulled into the parking lot of the school and Rachel was about to open her door Frank stopped her. \"Wait, remember, I open the door,\" he said rushing out the car to her side. \"Thank you,\" she said smiling. \"What are you thanking me for? I do this all the time.\" \"Thank you for asking me to come here with you, I thought I was going to have to miss it,\" she explained. \"Oh, that's reminds me,\" he reached into his pocket and pulled out a jewelry case, \"I bought this for you.\" \"You didn't have to get me anything,\" Rachel said. \"I was going to give you flowers, but I thought that wouldn't be as special because I'm always giving you flowers so, I just bought you this.\" He opened the box and it reveals a white diamond tennis bracelet. \"Oh, Frank, it's beautiful.\" Her face was lit up. \"Well, I was walking through the mall yesterday and I saw this,\" he hooked it on her wrist, \"And I immediately thought of you.\" She looked at the bracelet closer and asked, \"How much did this cost?\" Frank laughed, \"That's for me to know and you to never find out.\" She chuckled a little and pulled him in for a hug. For a second he couldn't breathe, especially when she kissed him on his cheek just millimeters away from his lips. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"You are very welcome.\" She hooked her arm around his and they walked into the school with the feeling everything was going to change that night. I just added that bracelet because I am watching Liz and Dick. I must say that Lindsey Lohan did a fabulous job, but I think Rachel is sorta Elizabeth Taylor and what did Elizabeth love the most. Diamonds of course. What girl doesn't love diamonds. As my idol Marilyn Monroe said, 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend.' Oh yeah. I haven't been satisfied with the short amount of reviews so I'm giving every reader a task. I want every reader, and I do mean every reader, to take the title clues I give you and try to predict what's going to happen in the next chapter. Good deal? Okay. The next chapter is called 'This Is It.' If you guys can't figure out what's about to go down then you truly didn't watch the movie.[Chapter 6] This Is It Laughing, dancing, eating, they did it all that night. \"Oh my God, she did not just do that,\" Rachel said to Frank. \"I know,\" he laughed, \"I guess she'll do anything for a dollar.\" \"So will Rachel,\" Tyson said with his crew following him like lost puppies. Rachel and Frank both rolled their eyes and with to talk to Mia who, by the way, did the worm in the middle of the dance floor. \"You are crazy, I can't believe you did that,\" Rachel said to Mia. \"Hey, you should try it Rachel. It's easy, I'll show you,\" Mia slurred and swerved into Rachel. Rachel caught her and asked, \"Whoa, how many tequila bottles did trick the corner store cashier into giving you?\" Mia laughed, \"I don't know, I lost count after twenty.\" \"Okay, you need to go home,\" Frank said. Mia softly punched him on his arm, \"Buddy, come on, I don't need to go home, I'm the life of the party.\" All of a sudden, she frowned and said, \"I need to throw up.\" Frank and Rachel looked at each other and rushed her to the ladies' bathroom. Only Frank, being the gentleman that he is, waited outside. \"Let it out sweetie,\" Rachel said hold Mia's head over the toilet. \"' Gag' I'm not drunk, I just ate some bad shrimp,\" Mia argued. \"Mmhm, sure.\" After all of her stomach contents Mia rinsed her mouth in the sink. \"You really got to stop drinking so much,\" Rachel said. \"I know, but it's so fun, when you and sexy out there get together then I'll stop drinking,\" Mia said. \"Here take a tic-tac, let's go and call Andre so he can take you home.\" \"Promise me that you will never get that drunk,\" Frank said. Rachel laughed. They were sitting at the swing set in the park next to the school. \"Trust me, you will never see me that drunk a day in your life.\" \"Do you want me to push you?\" Rachel bucked her eyes. \"I'm in a dress,\" she said. \"So what,\" he stood up and got behind her, \"It's just me and you.\" She smiled and held on to the chains, \"Okay, but don't push me too high.\" He started to push her softly for a few minutes. \"You know, the school is going to get complaints tomorrow. We are outside and I can still hear the music.\" Frank slowly the swing down just a little bit. \"It's a dance, there is supposed to get complaints,\" he said, making Rachel laugh, \"What's so funny?\" \"You are sounding more and more like me every day,\" she replied. Frank laughed a little himself. He pushed her a little more until the DJ in the school said, \"All right ya'll, this is the last song. I want all the guys to get the lovely lady you came here with this evening, take her in your arms and dance the night away to this slow jam. Or at least until the song is over, ya'll have a good night.\" He turned on the final song of the night and Frank stopped pushing Rachel. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. \"I know this song,\" he said. 'If I should stay, I would only be in your way,' the song went. \"This is the song my parents danced to at their wedding,\" he said. Rachel listened to the words, 'And I will always love you.' \"Kind of depressing, but has a nice ring to it.\" Frank took her hand and stood her up. \"May I have this dance?\" he asked bowing. Rachel laughed. \"Why yes you may?\" she said doing a curtsy. She rest one hand on his shoulder and the other in his hand. They swayed back and forth. \"Doesn't Dolly Parton sing this song?\" Rachel asked. \"Yes.\" \"I bet, when she wrote this, she had to leave a man she really loves, and just couldn't find the words,\" she said. \"Have you ever had someone you love but you couldn't find the right time or words to tell them?\" Frank asked. \"Yes.\" \"Oh, do I know him?\" She stepped a little closer to him. \"It'd be weird if you didn't, how about you?\" \"Same,\" he admitted. \"Do I know her?\" \"It'd be weird if you didn't.\" As the song started to end, their lips were getting closer and closer. Then ' Clap Clap.' They quickly separated. Rain started to fall down. \"Dammit,\" Frank mumbled under his breath. \"Dang, I can't get my hair wet, Andre's going to kill me,\" Rachel said before running to Frank's car. Frank followed her trying to get the keys out his pocket. When they were in the safety of his car he said, \"Mother nature is on no one's side tonight.\" She chuckled. He started the car and drove out of the school parking lot. \"Man I hate being alone on these kinds of nights,\" Rachel complained, \"Why do I have to be a big scary cat?\" \"Well where are your parents?\" Frank asked. \"In Atlanta helping my sister Nikki get acquainted to college life for the rest of the semester,\" she answered. \"Oh.\" It was silent for a few moments before Frank said, \"You can spent the night at my house.\" Not believing what she had just heard she asked, \"Huh?\" \"My parents are won't be back until tomorrow night. You can sleep in my bed and I'll sleep on my futon,\" he suggested. \"I can't take your bed, I'm sure I'll be fine at my house.\" \"Are you sure?\" he asked. Before she could confirm the thunder clapped and she nearly jumped onto his lap. \"S-so i-is your bed comfy?\" she asked. Just a block away from his house, Frank's car started to slow down to a complete stop. \"Oh no,\" he said trying to start it again with no luck. Rachel was fast asleep on his shoulder. Frank carefully moved her so it would rest on the passenger side of her window. It was raining cats and dogs but he still got out pushed the car to the side walk so it would be parked. He began to think taking his dad's old junked pick-up truck somewhere when it was low on gas was a bad idea. The only thing he could think of was to call a tow truck, but they were expensive and he used his emergency money on Rachel's bracelet. He had no choice but to leave it there until morning. But first he had to wake Rachel. \"Rachel,\" he shook her softly. She move a little, but didn't wake up. \"Wake up sweetheart,\" he said shaking her again. That's when she opened her eye and asked, \"Did you just call me sweetheart?\" \"We have a situation,\" he said. \"What?\" she asked sitting up. \"Well, don't get mad but, my car just ran out of gas just a block away from my house and though I hate doing this to you, we have to get to my house on foot.\" \"I'm not mad, but I can't run in these heels and I'm not taking them off.\" \"Okay, I will carry you,\" he said. \"Excuse me, what?\" she asked. \"Yeah while the rain is light, just,\" he slid his hands under her and scooped her out the car. \"Wait, what are you- oh my God in the air,\" Rachel said a little nervous, \"You know, I had a dream like this once.\" When they got to Frank's house they were soaked. \"Andre is going to be so pissed that I got my hair wet,\" Rachel said. \"I can only image, let me get you a towel,\" he said squishing his way to the linen closet. 'Thank God we have wooden floors,' he thought. Rachel took of her shoes and walked through the living room. She saw pictures of people at a wedding, which she assumed was his parent's, along the mantle. She saw a little boy version of Frank hold a newborn baby. Another picture was Frank, a little older, pushing a little girl around three on the swings playing a playground. Frank looked so happy, almost proud in that picture. But, the next picture showed a tomb stone that read: Jocelyn Isabelle Farmer; An angelic girl; Sunrise: September 4, 1974 Sunset: December 6, 1978. Rachel picked up the previous picture and smiled at Frank, smiling from ear to ear. \"I love that picture,\" Frank said coming up behind her. Rachel jumped and swiftly put the put the picture back. \"Here's your towel,\" he said. \"Thanks,\" she said. She wrapped the towel around her head. \"Can I ask you a question, Frank?\" \"Sure.\" \"You don't have to now but, one day can you tell me about how she died?\" she asked hesitantly. \"Maybe,\" he told her. Frank had to take a shower before he went to sleep because he was slightly OCD when it came to staying clean, but after he was fine he exited the bathroom in his pajama pants. \"Well hello there Mr. Shirtless,\" Rachel said when she saw him. Frank blushed a little bit. \"I'm sorry but it's very uncomfortable when I sleep with a shirt on,\" he apologized. Rachel shook her head with a smirk on her face, \"You don't hear me complaining.\" That made Frank blush even harder. \"So, I got you my basketball shorts and my t-shirt, is that cool?\" he asked. \"Yeah, that's cool,\" she got up from his desk chair and got the clothes, \"Thanks for letting me stay here tonight.\" \"No problem, I kind of didn't want you home alone, you know,\" he confessed. \"You are very protective do you know that?\" she teased. \"I am just protective of people I love,\" he said without thinking. All Rachel did was smile and quickly thought of something for him to think about. \"You love me?\" she asked. Frank suddenly froze, realizing what he had said. The look on his face was priceless. Messing with Frank's head was so fun for her. \"Well, do you?\" Frank was trying to find a way to ease himself out of the situation. \"You don't have to answer that,\" Rachel said before going to change in his bathroom. Frank let out a sigh of relief. 'Dodge that bullet,' he thought. He went to get the extra blanket out his closet but he noticed that Rachel didn't close the door all the way. Now he had plenty of self-control but he never thought he would have a beautiful woman in his house getting undressed, so he control told him to walk away but his hormones told him that he will never have this opportunity again: stay. He peeked through the crack and saw her in the basketball short with her bra still on and her underwear on the floor. \"Frank do you have any mouthwash?\" she asked. \"Uh-huh, medicine cabinet,\" he answered in a fog. He watched her gargle the mouth wash and rinse her mouth out and for some reason that turned him on. Unfortunately his self-control kicked in when she reached to unsnap her bra and he hastily moved away from the door. She came out in fully dressed and laid down on the bed next two Frank. \"Did you have fun tonight,\" she asked. \"Yeah, until it started raining,\" he said got up. \"Where are you going?\" \"To get my fold out bed.\" He opened the closet door and pulled out the bed. \"You don't have to sleep on that thing, it looks on the uncomfortable side,\" Rachel said. He spread the cover over his bed and said, \"I'm okay.\" \"Are you sure?\" she asked. \"Yeah, can you shut that light off?\" \"Sure,\" she shut it off, \"Good night.\" \"Night.\" Frank woke up around three to a sound. He dimmed his light and looked at Rachel. \"Mm, stop,\" she mumbled. 'What's going on in her head right now?' he thought to himself. \"Please stop,\" she said, \"Tyson stop, I said no.\" Frank frowned at that name. \"Stop it, Tyson stop. NO! HELP! HELP! STOP IT TYSON!\" she screamed. Frank got up and tried to wake her up. \"Rachel, Rachel. Wake up.\" \"NO, LEAVE ME ALONE!\" \"Rachel, wake up,\" he tried again. This time her eyes flew open faster than a bullet. Her breathing was heavy and there were tears in her eyes. She, out of the blue, flung her arms his neck, hugging him so tightly that she was weighing him down. \"It's okay, you're okay,\" he said trying to comfort her. \"I am so glad to see you,\" she whispered. She let go and he sat at the foot of the bed. \"I'm sorry I woke you up,\" she apologized. \"It is okay. Do you want to talk about your dream was about?\" \"I rather not relive it,\" she replied. They sat there in silence for a few moments. \"You want to try to go back to sleep?\" he asked. \"No, but you can.\" \"I don't think so.\" It was quiet again. \"Let's play the question game?\" Rachel suggested. \"Huh?\" \"Yeah, we could just ask each other random question.\" \"Then you will be able to sleep?\" Frank asked. \"Probably.\" \"Okay, you start.\" \"What is your favorite food?\" Rachel asked. \"Everything. What is your favorite color?\" \"Purple. Have you ever been in a fight before?\" \"Yes. What is your favorite movie?\" \"Sparkle.\" The questions kept going and going until it got more serious. \"Have you ever loved someone so much it hurts sometime?\" she asked. \"Yeah. Do you know that to most guys, you are the most beautiful girl they ever seen?\" \"No I didn't, if you could have any girl in the world, who would she be?\" Frank acted like he was thinking but he already the answer. \"Any girl?\" he asked. Rachel nodded. Frank really wasn't thinking when he did this. He sighed in defeat, lean in and kissed her on the lips. It was soft and gentle, but that was good enough for him being that it was his first real kiss. He pulled away and looked at Rachel. Her eyes were wide with shock and were unpredictable. \"What was that?\" she asked in a soft shy voice. \"To be honest, I have no idea,\" he admitted. Rachel scooted a little closer to him and asked shyly, \"Can we do it again?\" Now Frank was the one that was shock, but too shocked to lean in and kiss her again. Their lips met once again and this time with a little more energy. It became deeper and more passionate. Neither could breathe but neither wanted to stop. When they finally did break away Frank lips move to her neck. There was one spot on her neck that made a moan escape her lips. She move close enough to be sitting on his lap with her legs wrapped around him. Frank thought life couldn't get any better until she took his hands and slid them under her shirt. He carefully laid her down on her back and at this point, everything he believed in flew out the window and he didn't want to be held responsible for what he was about to do to her. Whew. You guys have no idea how long I have been waiting to write this chapter, man. Anywho, the next chapter is called More Than You Know.[Chapter 7] Okay please don't cyber kill me. I was having some serious writer's block. I kept changing my mind a lot until Baby Bodyguard PMed me. So I was like 'okay let me finish this week' but I got lazy. But the last review I got kind of scared me into writing this before the weekend and made me happy that you guys really like this story. Sometimes I doubt my writing skills but you guys give me confidence when you review so thanks. Well, enough with all this sentimental crap. Read on and I hope you enjoy this chapter. Smooches. More Than You Know Frank never knew that he could love someone as much as he loved Rachel. She helped him find a strength he never thought he had. Rachel was probably the best thing that ever happened to him. He watched her sleep for the rest of the night; held her in his arms and never wanting to let her go. Around seven, he felt her start to stir. She looked so tired that he didn't want her to be awakened. \"What are you looking at?\" he heard her mumble before opening her eyes. \"A very beautiful girl,\" he answered. She smiled and kissed him on his lips. Frank knew that he never will get use to kissing her, it was too perfect. \"I'm sorry,\" she said when they broke away. \"For what?\" he asked. \"Well, you know. For last night,\" she paused and looked him in his eyes, \"I just wasn't ready,\" she whispered. Frank held her tighter but didn't say anything. \"I get that you might be a little disappoint and probably don't want me anymore-\" \"Why would you think that?\" he cut her off, \"I'm not one of the guys who whine because they don't get what they want. Technically, I did get what I want. I have you and that's all that matters to me.\" \"How do you know you have me?\" she asked. He kissed her just to prove a point. When she kissed him back he broke away from her he said, \"That's how.\" Rachel buried her face his chest. His heartbeat was so soothing that she could stay there forever. \"Rachel?\" Frank asked. \"Mhm.\" \"This might be a little late but, will you be my girlfriend?\" he asked. Rachel looked up at him. \"I kissed you, I slept in the same bed as you, I even let to touch my breast, something a guy almost lost a vital organ for trying to do, and you are seriously asking me to be your girlfriend?\" Frank thought smiled and nodded his head. \"Okay,\" Rachel said, \"I would love to be your girlfriend. A few hours later Frank dropped her off at her house, after getting gas for the truck, before Andre and Mia came over. She really didn't want to explain why she at home last night, but she had to because they were her friends and she wouldn't dare lie to Andre. \"So, why didn't you answer your phone, you had me worried sick,\" Andre said as soon as she opened her door. \"Good after noon to you too Andre and Mia, won't you come in,\" Rachel said walking away from the door. \"I'm serious, honey, I called at least three times last night and don't say you were sleep because you never sleep during a thunder storm.\" The three of them sat at Rachel's dining room. \"I wasn't home last night, I stayed the night over Frank's,\" Rachel said. \"Oh,\" Andre said until he actually thought about what she said. \"Wait, what?!\" him and Mia yelled. Rachel let out a sigh and said, \"I didn't want to be alone last night so he said I could sleep at his house, and I did.\" Mia, who was slightly hung over, and Andre were speechless. \"And,\" Rachel continued, \"He bought me this bracelet.\" She lifted her wrist. \"Oh my God it's so pretty,\" Mia said, \"How much did it cost?\" \"Well, I saw one just like it the other day and it was around two hundred dollars.\" \"Are you sleeping with him?\" Andre blurted out. \"What?\" Rachel asked. \"A guy doesn't buy a girl a two hundred dollar diamond bracelet unless you are sleeping with him, if you slept with him, I will be very disappointed in you Chelly.\" The room was quiet for a few moments. \"Define sleeping?\" Rachel asked. Mia's jaw dropped all the way to the ground. \"Rachel Elizabeth Marron, how could you?!\" Andre yelled, standing up out of his chair. \"Calm down Andre,\" she said. \"Don't tell me to calm down. Listen I love and trust Frank just as much as you do but I know how guys think. How do we know that he actually has feelings for you? He can spread all around the school how easy you are. Do you want your reputation to be ruined?\" \"I know he has feelings for me because we didn't have sex!\" Rachel yelled at him. When she said that, Andre's face looked a bit calmer and sat down. \"What are you saying?\" he asked, quietly. \"I'm saying,\" Rachel said, \"We only slept in the same bed, but we barely did anything so calm down.\" \"What do you mean barely?\" Mia asked. Rachel looked at the ground and said, \"We kissed and stuff.\" Andre gasped. \"You guys kissed?\" he asked excitingly, \"Who kissed who first?\" \"He kissed me first,\" Rachel answered. \"Aw, was he a good kisser?\" Mia asked. Rachel smiled a little and nodded. \"Why do you always get the good ones?\" Mia complained. \"I have no idea, wait,\" Andre started, \"What do you mean when you said 'stuff'?\" he asked, using air quotes. Rachel was hoping he wouldn't catch that. Andre might be a free-spirited person and wants Rachel to find love, but he loved her like a little sister and he wants to protect her no matter what. \"I,\" Rachel mumbled the rest. \"What?\" Andre and Mia asked. \"I let him touch my breast,\" she said a little more clearly. She could see Andre turning red, which is very hard for a black man to do. \"So,\" he said trying to not blow up on her again, \"If you guys slept in the same bed, made out and touch you in a place like that, how did you not have sex?\" Rachel started to smile think about the night before. \"Well,\" she started, \"We almost did. I mean, I wanted to and trust me, he really wanted to, too. But then, before anything could happen, something in the back of my head told me I wasn't ready and I told him to stop.\" \"And he did?\" Mia asked. \"He better had stopped,\" Andre said under his breath. \"Well, he didn't hear me the first time because he was thinking with, well, little Frank. But I said it again and he heard me and stopped. He asked me did I really want him to stop. One half of me was screaming hell no, but the smart half said yeah so I nodded and he got off of me, held me in his arms and we went to sleep.\" \"Wow,\" Mia said. \"So, what's you guys' relationship status?\" Andre asked. \"I am his girlfriend and to him, it means him making me happy 90 percent of the time and me making him happy only ten percent of the time. He told me that it is Rachel's day every day and we do everything I want, but once a year we do something he wants. And he said that he is required to give me presents just because. So pretty much he is the perfect boyfriend.\" \"Oh my God, I hate you so much right now,\" Mia yelled. \"Damn,\" Andre said, \"You know, know that you two are together, all the slutty girls at school are going after him right?\" \"Oh, and he said that I could trust him no matter what and don't go crazy every time a girl flirts with him. When they go too far then I'll be able to go crazy on them.\" Just then the phone rang and Rachel got up and answered it. \"Hello?\" she said. \"Guess who.\" She heard Frank say. \"Eddie Murphy is that you?\" \"Ha, ha, ha very funny but no. This is a guy checking up on his baby.\" \"I could get used to this, you know.\" \"Good.\" \"What do you want Farmer, I have guest.\" \"Nothing, I just missed you, that's all.\" \"I can always kick the free loaders out and you can come over,\" Rachel said looking at Andre raiding her refrigerator. \"No, get back to your guest, I promised my parents I will be here when they get back.\" \"Okay, but the offer still stands.\" Frank heard his parents walk in the door, \"I got to go. I love you more than you know Rachel. Bye,\" and hung up the phone. Rachel stood in her kitchen frozen with the phone still to her ear. \"Rachel?\" Andre asked waving his hand in her face. She still didn't budge. He hung up the phone and snapped his fingers. \"Rachel?\" he asked again. She still didn't move. \"Oh my God, is that Eddie Murphy?\" \"Where?!\" Rachel asked quickly snapping out of it. \"In Hollywood,\" Andre laughed. Rachel punched him in his arm. \"Don't tease me like that.\" \"What was you and sexy talking about?\" he asked. Then Rachel froze all over again. \"Oh no. Rachel!\" he shook her back. \"He told me he loves me,\" she whispered in monotone. Oh yeah if there were any mistakes or errors, I apologize. I literally wrote for a hour and a half non stop no proofreading. The next chapter is called Awkward.[Chapter 8] This is for you Whitney. We love you and last year on this day God took you away and it was one of the worse days of my life. I still wonder how your daughter is doing because I don't think I could lose my mother and get over it in a year so I will forever pray for her. Well, have fun in your paradise, I will always love you(no pun intended). Now I'm talking to my fanfictioners. This chapter is short but kind of heartwarming. I hope you like it. R.I.P. Whitney Houston 1963-2012. Awkward \"Oh, how good it feels to be home,\" Herb said walking in the door, \"Frank, come help me with the bags.\" \"I got to go. I love you more than know Rachel. Bye,\" Frank said and hanging up the phone, \"Here I come!\" He went to the outside to the get the bags out of the trunk. \"Hey, you guys. How was the trip?\" he asked. \"We could have gotten more alone time in a room full of pit bulls with T-bones around our necks,\" Herb complained. \"I don't know why you think that everything is always going to be peachy with me and your mom when you know she hates me,\" Katherine said, \"Honey she says thing to me that I wouldn't say to my worst enemy.\" Frank tried so hard not to laugh. His grandma was cruel, but comical. He grabbed the last of the bags and went in the house. \"Hey, son, your grandma was mad that you didn't come,\" Herb said. \"You didn't want me, too. Plus, I went to the homecoming dance.\" \"You went to your homecoming dance and you didn't tell me,\" Katherine said. \"It wasn't a big deal. You guys just walked in the door. Don't you want to rest.\" \"No, I want to talk about this,\" she said sitting on the couch next to him, \"Herb, we got to talk to our son.\" Herb sat down next to her. \"Homecoing isn't a big deal?\" he asked. \"But our son went to his homecoming and didn't want to tell us,\" she said. \"Well, who'd you go with for your mother's sake?\" Herb asked. \"No one,\" Frank mumbled, wanting to kick his self for saying anything. \"Oh, does no one have a name?\" his father asked. \"No. Look I really don't want to talk about it. Why don't I go out and get us some pizza or something? Yeah, I'll be back,\" Frank rushed. \"Frank, we're going to find out sooner or later,\" Katherine yelled to him but he was already out the door. Herb and Katherine looked at each other. \"Do you want to follow him?\" Herb asked. She looked out the window to see if Frank was gone. \"Yeah, let me get my purse.\" \"Hello sexy boy,\" Mia said when she answered Rachel's door. \"Hi Mia, how's that hangover?\" Frank teased her. \"Well, I have an excruciating headache, I'm PMSing, I feel like I'm about to throw up, and your girlfriend won't shut up about you so would you mind taking her away from me before I choke her.\" \"Stop hating Mia,\" Rachel said pushing her away from the door, \"I thought you couldn't come over?\" \"Well, I slipped and told my parents that I went to homecoming and they started asking me questions I didn't want to answer so I left,\" Rachel nodded her head in understanding, \"And I just really wanted to do this again.\" He stepped closer to her and kissed her and Rachel melted the second their lips touch and put her arms around his neck. \"Ooowee!\" they heard both Andre and Mia call from the window. Frank and Rachel broke apart and glared in their direction. \"Come on, let's go,\" Frank said. \"Where to?\" \"Anywhere but here.\" \"Where are we going?\" Rachel asked. \"I told you, anywhere you want, today is all about you.\" \"And I told you I want to do whatever you want.\" Frank looked and gave her a sly smile. \"Anything but that,\" she scolded. Frank laughed. \"Frank, can I ask you something?\" she asked. He nodded. She let out a breath. \"Did you mean it?\" \"Mean what?\" he asked. \"Do you really love me?\" Frank's faced turn a little pale. \"Hold that thought,\" he started to pull into and abandoned parking lot. He turned and looked and here. \"Well,\" she asked impatiently. He cracked a goofy grin, \"I said it, didn't I?\" \"Don't play with me,\" Rachel warned him. \"Yes, I love you. No. I adore you Rachel, I belong to you and only you. We can get in to the fight of the century and I'll still belong to you, satisfied?\" Rachel looked at him with tear in her eyes. When Frank saw her tears he panicked. \"Hey, I didn't mean to make you cry, I'm sorry,\" he apologized. \"These are happy tears,\" she said wiping her eyes then kissed him on his cheek, \"I adore you too Frank.\" \"I adore you more,\" he said unbuckling his seatbelt. \"That almost rhymed,\" she said unbuckling hers moving towards him. \"I know,\" he said before kissing her for the fourth time that day. \"Frank, do me a favor?\" Rachel asked between each kiss. \"Mhm,\" he mumbled. \"Don't think for one second that what I'm about to do changes my decision.\" And with that she jump to his side of the car and straddled him. \"I will try not to,\" he said in a bit of a shock about what she just did. From afar Herb and Katherine were watching this whole thing shocked. See their son making out with a girl was the last thing they thought they'd see. Katherine wanted to cry but Herb had a grin on his face. \"That's my boy,\" he said. \"Herb, do you realize what this means?\" Katherine said. \"What? That our son can get a girl as beautiful as her?\" \"No, Frank has a girlfriend and didn't want to tell us about her. What if they are having sex? What if she gets pregnant? I'm not ready to be a grandma!\" \"Honey, calm down, we raised a smart kid. He won't get anyone pregnant anytime soon.\" They sat there keeping an eye on them. \"You know, they remind me of our first date.\" That really made Katherine panic. \"We made love in your car on our first date. I got pregnant after two months. Herb, this is not good,\" she stressed. \"Yes, we slept with each other on our first date and yes, you got pregnant two months after but look what we got out of it. We got married; we stay in love with each other and we are happy. Plus, we got two amazing kids out of it. One is playing with her Barbie dolls in heaven and the other, well from the looks of it, is playing a real life Barbie's tongue,\" he laughed. Katherine shook her head, \"We are happy aren't we? And they sure look happy, but we are going to talk to him about this.\" Herb just laughed at her. \"Let's go home and give them the privacy they think they have,\" she said.[Chapter 9] Hey. Okay before you guys kill me I will like to say. 'sigh' I'm done with fanfiction. Nah I'm just bullsh**ing. I wonder how many hearts stopped hahaha. I am so sorry for not updating. Writer's block is a bitch. Also my mom took my computer for reasons you don't need to be bothered with. Anyway, I have been getting harassed by some fellow fanfictioners about separating dialogue so I tried it for this chapter. I didn't like it so don't expect it in the near future. Let me know what you think 'kay. Alright start reading. Love ya'll, smooches! Hating Frank got into the house around ten on cloud 9. He had just dropped Rachel off five minutes ago and already missed her. He went to the kitchen to find a note attached to the refrigerator. It read: If you are reading this then that means that you are so late that your father and I are not awake to tell you good night and we love you. Love, mom. P.S. Your dinner is in the oven. Frank smiled at his mom's picture of a smiley face. 'She is so funny,' he thought. He took his dinner out of the oven and ate in silence. Then he went upstairs, took his shower and crawled into bed. He could still smell the perfume Rachel was wearing the night before on his pillow. That scent mellowed him to sleep. Rachel woke up covered in sweat. When she realized she was in her bed at home she relaxed a little. The nightmare she kept having was getting on her nerves. Tyson was really getting on her too. He called her house at least three times a day, he followed her home on days Frank wasn't there to drive her, and he was still telling everybody that they slept together. Sometimes she thinks that she should have killed him that night, but God would tell her not to think like that. She really hated Tyson and wanted to dance on his grave. Rachel stayed in her bed until her alarm clock made her get up. She made herself a bowl of cereal and got ready for school. Her house was so quiet. Her parents were coming back in two months, but she still missed them. Her mother Alison and her dad Fletcher didn't want to leave Rachel in L.A. but Nikki needed them. Rachel knew her parents love her but Nikki was the one they love the most; she could feel it. When they first heard Nikki sing, they made sure that Nikki would be the one to represent the family. While Rachel was at home most of the summer learning how to bake and run the bakery, Nikki was at singing camp. Her parents paid so much attention to Nikki that they didn't notice that Rachel had that same gift and after a while, Rachel started to learn how to play piano and write songs, something Nikki never attempted to do. When Nikki left for college, Alison and Fletcher decided to move the family to Atlanta to help her get adjusted. Rachel didn't want to go and begged her parents not to make her go. They eventually let her stay. When her parents left, Rachel secretly signed up for the same singing camp Nikki went to. Two forged signatures on the application later, Rachel got accepted and started off for camp because she attended with Nikki the summer before for a week. She learned every basic of music there was and practiced nonstop. Rachel found that singing is her therapy and made her happy. She dreamed of being on stage in front of millions of people screaming her name, but she knew her parents didn't want to hear it. Nikki was the planned child and Rachel was 'oops' child. Nikki had a new boyfriend every week and Rachel only has one boyfriend who she has no plans to let go. They had the same genes but couldn't be more different. As soon as Rachel finished getting dressed, she heard Frank honk his horn. She grabbed her backpack and walked out the door. \"Good morning gorgeous,\" Frank said when she got into the car. \"Good morning,\" she replied. \"How is your morning going so far?\" Frank asked driving away. \"Uneventful, what about you?\" she asked. \"Well, my mom made me chocolate chip pancakes and let me smother them in chocolate syrup and when I was done eating she wiped my mouth for me so I think she is up to something,\" he answered. They pulled into the school parking lot and saw a police car. The officers were talking to the principal. Rachel and Frank decided to go asked what was going on. \"Hey, Mr. Jensen, what's going on?\" Rachel asked. The officers turned around and immediately arrested Frank. \"Hey, what the hell?\" Frank said, \"What I do?\" \"Mr. Farmer, do you know what this is?\" Mr. Jensen asked holding up a baggie. \"From the looks of it, it looks like weed,\" Frank answered. \"What does this have to do with him?\" Rachel yelled. She was very pissed. \"Rachel, get to class, you're late,\" Mr. Jensen told her. \"No,\" she said crossing her arms. \"Rachel, I said go to class,\" he commanded. \"Not until you tell me why you are arresting my boyfriend,\" she said. \"Mr. Farmer can you read this note?\" one of the officers asked holding the note to his eyes. \"It said, 'Note to self: sell tomorrow before the cops find out.' What does this have to do with me?\" \"Kid, we found this in your locker,\" the other officer said. \"That isn't mine,\" he said. \"Frank, this is your hand writing,\" the principal said. \"Here let me see,\" Rachel snatched the note from the officer's hand, \"This is Tyson's hand writing.\" \"And how do you know this?\" Mr. Jensen said. \"Because, he writes me these stupid love notes and puts them in my locker. See,\" she reached in her bag and got out the one of her notes. \"Give me that,\" one of the officers took it from her and analyzed it, \"It looks identical, but we have to compare it to something.\" \"If you could do me a favor and un-cuff me so I can get my Romeo and Juliet book report out my backpack,\" Frank said. \"We'll do the honors thank you,\" one of the officers opened Frank's backpack and got the report out, \"Their right. It's not the same handwriting, we have no choice but to let him go.\" They uncuffed him and apologized. Rachel grabbed Franks hand and walked away without saying anything. She was so livid at Tyson that she didn't want to speak. By the way she was squeezing his hand, Frank knew not to talk. They stopped at Rachel's first class. \"I will see you at lunch, ok?\" Frank assured. Rachel looked at him, with anger in her eyes. \"Okay,\" she mumbled. \"Alright, can I have a kiss,\" Frank asked with puppy dog eyes. Rachel couldn't help but laugh. \"Yeah,\" she said and pecked him on the lips. \"I love you,\" he said. \"I love you, too,\" she said and walk in her classroom and Frank went to his.[Chapter 10] The Truth: Part I A month of dating and Rachel and Frank where still going strong. They couldn't stay away from one another. Tyson was still one a mission to ruin Rachel, but that didn't stop her from having to time of her life. It was November and Thanksgiving was coming. Her parents and Nikki were coming back for Thanksgiving break. Rachel couldn't wait for her family to meet Frank. She knew that they would love him just as much as she does. Frank's parents still haven't met Rachel, but Frank wanted it to be the perfect time. He told Rachel he needed everything to be perfect. Rachel didn't want perfect, she just wanted to meet his parents and not be banned from seeing Frank. \"So will your dad kill me with his eyes when I meet him?\" Frank asked Rachel at lunchtime. Rachel shook her head and said, \"No, he kills with kindness. To me he is a big teddy bear, and he likes to hug so when you shake his hand beware.\" Frank nodded. They ate in silence for a few moments. \"So my mom is taking my dad and me out to see the place she is setting up her flower business on tonight,\" Frank said. \"That sound good,\" Rachel said. Frank started to feel a little nervous about his he was about to say next but knew he had to. \"Um, I think it will be the best and most appropriate time for you to meet them,\" he blurted out. With that, Rachel choked on her Cola. \"What?\" she managed to asked. \"My mom will be in a very happy mood and my dad would be in and even better mood because she will be happy and me,\" he paused, \"I would be the happiest if my parents meet the love of my life.\" \"Marilyn Monroe is dead, when are you going to let it go?\" Rachel asked teasingly. Frank smiled and said, \"I let her go the day I met you.\" Rachel felt her heart melt. The way he looked at her made feel so special. \"I love you,\" she said. \"I love you more,\" He challenged. \"That's not possible,\" she said before kissing him. So engulfed in their kiss, they didn't hear Andre and Mia show up. \"Sometimes I think you give literally want to make a meal out of each other's face,\" Andre said making them jump apart. \"What do you want?\" Rachel asked a little frustrated. \"We can just hang out with you guys? God, ever since you guys got together you have been ignoring us,\" Andre accused. \"Yeah,\" Mia agreed. Rachel and Frank looked at each other and back at Andre and Mia. \"We hang out all of the time,\" Frank said. Mia smiled, \"We knew we were trying to see if you noticed.\" Rachel rolled her eyes at her and said, \"I swear, if Andre wasn't gay, you two should get married.\" \"We will. We are going to have a best friend wedding,\" Andre said. \"No, you are my best friend, I refuse to share you with this flussy,\" Rachel joked. \"Who you calling a flussy, jezebel,\" said Mia. \"Ladies, ladies, there is enough of Andre to go around.\" \"You guys are funny,\" Frank said. \"Well, you have to remember, Andre was my first crush and he was my first kiss,\" Rachel said. \"And Rachel was the first person I told I was gay and didn't tell me I was wrong.\" \"Wait, one minute, Andre was your first kiss?\" Mia asked. \"Yeah,\" Rachel answered. \"But you said your first kiss was a hunk,\" she said. \"I am a hunk,\" Andre said. \"Yeah, sure you are,\" Mia said shaking her head no. The bell rang before anyone could say anything else and they went to class. \"Why did we have to learn how to put on a condom, do you know how awkward that was?\" Rachel asked when she got in his truck after school. \"How was that awkward?\" Frank started the car. \"We had to practice on a cucumber, I mean it is good practice but, you were standing there watching me struggle,\" she complained. \"That means that I will have to put the condom on when we start having sex.\" \"Don't worry, you will have a lot of practice because you ain't getting none for a while,\" Rachel said. \"Why?\" Frank whined. Rachel laughed. \"Because, we only have been together for a month and I don't see any rings on my fingers,\" she said. \"Well, technically, I am going to propose to you one day so why wait?\" Frank asked. \"I thought you were fine with waiting. And we are not getting married anytime soon.\" \"I never said I wasn't fine with it, it's just that I am a man, I have needs,\" he said. \"Yeah, well, satisfy them on your own, until I say so, got it,\" Rachel jabbed her finger at him. \"Got it,\" he repeated, \"Oh, and don't worry, I'm not ready to get married just like you, but when the time comes I'm getting my princess a big diamond,\" he kissed her hand. Rachel rolled her eyes. \"I keep forgetting I'm in love with a white boy,\" she said. Frank chuckled. \"I love you, too.\" They walked into Rachel's house just like every day and sat at her table. \"You hungry?\" she asked. \"Uh uh, sit down. I need to school you on Chemistry,\" he said gesturing to the chair. \"Ugh!\" she groaned sitting down. \"You can groan all you want. I don't want to see another 'C-' on your report card again or you are not getting sweet Frank time,\" he warned. Rachel smirked and got up to sit on his lap. \"Is that a threat or your own form of self-torture?\" \"You're trying to distract me,\" he said. \"Yeah, I am. Is it working?\" she kissed him on his lips. \"For the next ten minutes yeah, but after this you are studying,\" he kissed her. \"Who are you, my father?\" she said. \"No, I am,\" a deep voice said. Rachel jumped off Frank's lap and Frank hurried and stood up. \"Daddy, what are you doing here?\" she asked. \"I live here,\" he answered. \"You guys weren't supposed to be back until Friday.\" \"Well we came early, and just in time, too. Rachel, who is this?\" Fletcher asked looking at Frank. \"Daddy, this is my boyfriend. I told you about him remember?\" Fletcher looked at Frank up and down. \"I remember you telling me about a friend you never said anything about a boyfriend. What's your name, son?\" he asked Frank. \"Frank Farmer, sir. Nice to meet you,\" Frank held out his hand and shook his hand. \"Firm grip, hands of a football player. You play?\" Fletcher asked. \"I did at my old school. I'm from Oregon.\" \"Oh, well, in this family we hug,\" Fletcher said pulling Frank in for a hug. He expected Frank to be surprised but he wasn't. \"Dad, don't break him,\" Rachel said and Fletcher released Frank, \"Where is Mom and Nikki?\" Rachel asked. \"They are at that new studio that just opened. We got Nikki an hour of studio time. Frank, you should hear her voice. I swear she will put songbirds out of business,\" Fletcher boasted. Frank looked at Rachel and grabbed her hand, \"I always loved Rachel voice. She sings like an angel.\" Fletcher grimaced a little. \"Both my daughters can sing, but Nikki is a star waiting to happen,\" Fletcher said. \"Okay Daddy, enough about Nikki. We need to study so,\" she gestured to the door. \"Oh, yeah, you guys were studying hard when I walked in the room. Go too far and that boy won't make it out this house,\" Fletcher said walking out. Rachel looked at Frank and smiled. \"We should get started,\" Frank said. \"Yeah, I guess,\" Rachel sighed. They studied for an hour before Frank had to go home. Alison and Nikki came home a few minutes after he left. \"Rachel!\" Nikki yelled when she saw her. \"Nicole!\" Rachel yelled back. They hugged each other like there was no tomorrow. Rachel missed her big sister so much. \"Hey, Rachel, don't mess up Nikki's nails she just got them done, and where is my hug?\" Alison said. \"Hi, Mommy,\" Rachel said hugging her mom. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" Alison kissed her daughter on her forehead. \"You guys just missed Rachel's boyfriend,\" Fletcher said. Alison sat on her couch. \"Oh, you got back with the nice boy, what was name?\" she asked. \"Yeah, Tyson wasn't it?\" Nikki said. \"No, it's not Tyson,\" Rachel said. \"Definitely not Tyson,\" Fletcher said. \"Oh, that's too bad,\" Alison said, \"I liked him. He was such a gentleman.\" Rachel flinched a little. Tyson was far from being a gentleman. \"Alright, let's get settled in,\" Alison said, \"Rachel, I think I'm in the mood for some spaghetti. Be a doll and cook please,\" before she went toward the stairs.\" \"Well actually, Mom, I have plans tonight. Nikki, you do it?\" Rachel turned to her sister. \"Yeah, I got it,\" Nikki said going to the kitchen. \"Nikki, you are going to mess up your nails, Rachel I asked you to do it,\" Alison said going up the stairs before Rachel could say anything. \"But, Mom I have plans,\" Rachel yelled after her. Alison slammed the door to her room. \"Ugh,\" Rachel groaned. She went to the kitchen and started getting the ingredients out. \"Don't worry sissy,\" Nikki said, \"I got it,\" she took the stuff from Rachel's hands. \"Thanks, you guys aren't here ten minutes and I'm already the slave again,\" Rachel complained. Nikki shrugged her shoulders. \"That's what you get for being the youngest,\" she teased, \"So where you got to go?\" \"I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents tonight,\" Rachel answered. \"Oooh, is he cute?\" Nikki asked bumping Rachel's shoulder. \"Gorgeous, which reminds me, since you're here; can I borrow your white tennis shoes?\" Rachel asked. \"Why you want to wear my white shoes, pass me the mixing spoon?\" \"White symbolizes purity, I don't want them thinking I'm taking their son's virginity.\" Nikki chuckled. \"You guys haven't done it yet?\" she asked. \"Yeah, Rachel,\" Fletcher said walking in the kitchen. \"Oh God,\" Rachel put her face in her hands. She didn't want to talk about this subject with her dad. \"Daddy, were you eavesdropping?\" she asked. \"You're changing the subject,\" he said not answering her question. \"Dad, leave us alone,\" Nikki told him. Fletcher laughed. \"I'll be listening,\" he said before leaving. Rachel made sure she heard a door close before answering. \"No, we haven't,\" she answered. Nikki wanted to laugh so hard. \"Why not? It's not like it's a bad thing, I just hurts just a little.\" \"Well Ms. Experience, I care about my relationship too much for it to be ruined by having sex. And Frank respects that,\" she explained. \"Mhm,\" Nikki said. \"Don't 'Mhm' me,\" Rachel said. About two hours later Rachel was walking to the address Frank told him to meet him at. It was right near her bakery and she could see three figures in the distance. She walked closer and stopped when she heard his voice. \"I love the way you walk when you're determined Rachel,\" Tyson said coming out of the darkness of the alley that gave Rachel chills. \"What do you want?\" she asked backing away from him. \"I want a lot of things and you happen to be the one of them. Now we could do this the easy way or the hard way,\" he said maliciously. That's when something clicked in Rachel's head that she should run. She tried to walk away but he grabbed her and covered her mouth. \"Come on Rachel, you want to be a good girl and not run because you can't escape me baby girl, we have unfinished business.\" Tears started coming down her face when she felt his erection against her leg. \"Shh, baby, normally I done bite but you stopped me from getting what I wanted the first time so try something again I will be forced to do so,\" he whispered in her ear. He slipped his hand down her body and started unbuttoning. By this time, Rachel was bawling and her eyes got heavier and heavier until she blacked out.[Chapter 11] This chapter is short. I know that don't have the right to post a short chapter since I took so long to update but I think this make up for it. Ya'll still with me? The Truth: Part II Beep, Beep, Beep. Before she even opened her eyes were she was. The smell of a hospital was strong. She slowly opened her and took in her surroundings. Like she predicted she was in a hospital room. The events of that night came back to her. Going to meet Frank's parent, Tyson, passing out; it was all coming back to her. \"Rachel, baby,\" Alison said holding Rachel's hand. \"Momma,\" Rachel said, her voice hoarse. \"Oh my baby girl,\" Alison said, a tear going down her face. \"Mommy, where's Daddy and Nikki?\" she asked. \"They are in the cafeteria. Your sister thought you would want a chocolate muffin when you wake up,\" her mom answered, \"Do you remember what happen?\" Rachel nodded. \"What do you remember?\" \"I was going to see Frank and,\" she paused, \"Oh God, where's my Frank?\" \"Calm down, him and his parents are in the waiting room, he found you. He said someone was choking you but he didn't see you it was. Do you remember who it was?\" Alison asked. She nodded. \"It was Tyson,\" she answered then panicked, \"Oh my God, he didn't-\" \"No, Frank got there before he did anything. We are going to the police tomorrow and file a report. Don't worry.\" Rachel sighed in relief. \"Hey, she awake,\" Fletcher said walking in with Nikki. \"How are you feeling?\" Nikki asked. \"I've been better,\" Rachel said. \"We got you a muffin,\" Nikki said. \"Thanks,\" Rachel looked around, only one person was missing, \"I want my Frank.\" Frank and his parents were in the waiting room. He was violently shaking and trying not to cry but tears kept falling down his face. \"If something happens to her,\" he whispered. \"Son, everything is going to be fine,\" Herb assured him. \"You said the same thing about Josie. If I lost Rachel too, I would die,\" he said. \"Honey, calm down or you're going to hurt yourself,\" Katherine said rubbing his back. He started rocking back and forth. The thought of life without Rachel was so unpleasant. \"God let her be okay,\" he prayed. God works very quickly. \"Franklin, her dad is coming,\" Herb said. Fletcher came through the doors and smiled at them. \"I didn't have a chance to formally introduce myself,\" he said, \"I'm Fletcher.\" \"I'm Herb and this is my wife Katherine.\" \"How's Rachel?\" Frank spoke up. \"She wants to see you,\" Fletcher told him. Frank didn't have to hear that twice. He sped down the hall looking for Rachel's room. He found it and went in. \"Hi doll face,\" Rachel smiled at him. If he wasn't in a room full of people, Frank would have kneeled down and cried tears of joy. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Well come here, you don't get to save my life and not get a kiss,\" Rachel said holding her arms out. Frank chuckled and walked over to her and gave her a peck on the lips. \"You okay?\" he asked sitting in the chair next to her bed. \"I've been better, how about you? Have you been crying?\" Rachel asked. \"A little bit. I was worried,\" he admitted. \"Aww,\" Nikki said, reminding them that they weren't alone. \"You guys are so cute,\" Alison said. \"A little too cute,\" Fletcher said walking in with Frank's parents. \"Can you guys give us a moment?\" Rachel asked. \"But we just got in here,\" Fletcher complained. \"Come on, Fletch. They need a little time together,\" Alison said pulling her husband with her out the door. Once they were alone Rachel scooted to make room for Frank. He sat down and wrapped his arms around her and buried his face in her hair. \"Don't you ever scare me like that again,\" he whispered. She snuggled up to him. \"I try my best.\" The room was silent but Rachel could see her mom trying to peek in. She gave her mom a 'Stop being nosy' look. \"Rachel, who was it?\" Frank asked. Rachel sighed. \"Tyson,\" she whimpered out. She felt Frank's grip on her get tighter and his body get tense. \"I knew he was off, but why would he target you?\" he said. Rachel didn't say anything. The way the energy changed from love to fear and worry Frank knew something was wrong. \"This isn't the first time he's tried something like this, is it?\" he asked. He felt his shirt get damp. \"Rachel, it's my job to protect you but I can't do that if you aren't honest with me,\" he said. Rachel was still quiet. She didn't want to be weak to him but she had to. \"Okay, I'll tell you,\" she whispered. Last year Tyson and Rachel were driving back to her house after going to a movie. His hands kept going to her thigh and trying to go up her dress but she swatted his hands away. \"Rachel, do you love me?\" Tyson asked out of the blue. \"What?\" she asked. \"Do you love me?\" he repeated. Rachel let out a sigh. \"Answer me, Rachel,\" he said harshly. \"No Ty, I don't love you,\" she answered. Tyson started gripping the steering wheel. \"Why not?\" he asked. \"Because, we just started dating a few weeks ago, I don't know you well enough to love you,\" she explained. Tyson's breathing started getting louder and he sped up the car. \"I'm sorry Ty, I didn't want to hurt your feelings,\" Rachel said sweetly, \"I like you but let's just take things slow.\" Rachel didn't get a response. Tyson was really going fast and it started to scare Rachel. \"Tyson, slow down,\" she said. \"Shut up,\" he growled. His tone stunned Rachel. \"Excuse me, don't talk to me like that, I know you're hurt but-\" \"I said shut up!\" He yelled and slapped her in her mouth. She whimpered from the pain. \"See what happens when you piss me off?\" he snapped. Rachel could taste blood and started sobbing. \"You need to learn who you belong to Chelly,\" he whispered. He pulled on the side of the road and turned the car off. \"You are mine,\" he took off his seatbelt and moved toward Rachel. \"Tyson stop, I want to go home,\" she choked out . He didn't listen to her and move to her side of the car. \"Tyson, get off me!\" she yelled. \"Shut up bitch,\" he hissed in her ear. \"Stop it!\" she tried to push him off but failed. He started sliding his hands under her blouse and pulled off her bra, then something clicked in Rachel's head. This wasn't her, she isn't the damsel in distress. She scooted up and kneed him in his crotch. He immediately jumped back to his seat cried out, \"You bitch.\" Rachel shot out the car and ran as fast as she could. She didn't know what direction she was going but she had to get away from him.[Chapter 12] Love Waits… Frank was feeling a lot of thing. He felt sad, overwhelmed, and most of all angry. What Rachel told him hit him way down in a place he didn't know he had. Someone tried to hurt his woman. His woman. He started to feel very possessive over Rachel. She was the sun in the dark space that was his life and if you even attempt to take the sun away from the universe, things will happen and none will be good. Rachel was waiting for him to say something, scared that this would change their relationship. 'He doesn't deserve a damaged girl like me,' she thought. \"Your right,\" she heard Frank say. \"What?\" she asked. \"I don't deserve like you, but you are not damaged. You are strong, kind, courageous, and just downright beautiful. I have done nothing that good to deserve you,\" he said. As if she needed to cry some more, tears started falling down her face. \"Why do you say things like that?\" she sobbed. \"Because it's hard to explain how much I love you Rachel.\" She continued to cry until she couldn't anymore. \"Frank visiting hours are over,\" Katherine said poking her head in the room. \"Okay,\" Rachel was asleep on his chest so he slowly slid away from her. \"I love you, honey,\" he kissed her on top of her head and went to with his mom. \"So Rachel seems like a wonderful girl,\" his mom said as they walked to the car. \"She is wonderful,\" he said looking at the floor. He was thinking of all the things that Rachel told him. He literally wanted to kill Tyson. 'How could someone be that cruel to a goddess like that,' he thought. \"Mom if they arrest the guy who did this, what will happen?\" he asked. \"Well, they he will go to jail and Rachel can get a restraining order. Don't worry honey,\" she said. He couldn't help but be worried. Frank loved Rachel and he will do whatever it took to keep her safe. After the hospital released Rachel the next day, her parents took her straight to the police station. \"Now are you sure that this was Tyson Jones?\" the officer asked her. Rachel nodded. \"So how long have the harassment been going on?\" Rachel nervously looked at her parents. They didn't know anything about this. \"For about a year,\" she said, \"We were dating for about three week in sophomore year and he started different with me. One night he asked me if I loved him and I said no, then he hit me and tried to… he pinned me down in his car and started…\" she couldn't get it out. She hated the feeling of being scared and weak. It made her want to vomit. \"It's okay; you don't have to say it. We have enough to get him arrested. If this goes to trial, you are going to need a lawyer, do you have one?\" the officer asked. Rachel immediately thought of Herb. \"My boyfriend's father is a lawyer, I could ask him,\" she suggested. \"Ms. Marron, I think you are very brave and I promise you that we will do whatever we can to bring him down,\" the officer assured her. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"Well, have a nice day, you guy,\" he got up and walked away. \"Come on, Rachel let's go home,\" her mother took her by her hand and led her out the station. A two weeks after the attack, everything was tense, especially Frank and Rachel's relationship. Since they haven't found Tyson, Frank was being very protective of her. She couldn't go anywhere without him, Frank called her every two hours and a guy couldn't look at her without Frank going off. This was a very annoying to Rachel and she had it up to here with him telling her what to do but she knew he just wanted her safe. \"Okay you are going to love me Rachel!\" Andre said loudly bursting inside her room. \"Don't do that,\" she scolded. \"My bad,\" he laid on her bed next to her, \"Guess what I got you.\" Rachel closed her eyes, she really didn't care. \"What?\" she huffed out. \"You, Rachel Elizabeth Marron,\" he said in an announcer's voice, \"Are going to be seated front row to see Prince in concert with your best friend this Saturday.\" Rachel shot straight up and looked at him. \"Are you serious!?\" she squealed. \"As a heart attack,\" Andre took the tickets out of his pocket and said, \"You, me and Prince. We are going to have a ball.\" \"Oh my God, I can't believe… wait, I can't go,\" she said drooping her eyes. \"What, why?\" he asked. \"Frank would never let me go, he is extremely protective of me these days,\" she said. \"Come on, you have to come, do you know what I had to do to get these tickets, I'm sure you can go out with your best friend.\" Rachel really want to go but a concert with thousands of people getting a Prince high, Frank would never say yes to that. 'But this is my life,' she thought. \"Okay, I'm definitely going and I don't care what Frank has to say about that because he doesn't rule my life,\" she said with confidence. \"You're not going to tell him, huh?\" \"Nope,\" she laughed. \"Frank, honey, I need you to go and pick up the turkey,\" his mother said. \"Alright, I'm going to stop by Rachel's first,\" he said heading out the door. \"Baby, let the girl breathe,\" Katherine mumbled. \"You say something mom?\" he asked. \"Nope, but hurry up, it's getting dark.\" Driving to Rachel's he started think about the past week. Tyson still wasn't caught and every time he wasn't with Rachel he worried. He made it his duty to check on her very often, her safety was everything to him. He pulled up in her driveway and her mother immediately open the door. \"Hi, Ms. Marron,\" he said. \"Hello Frank,\" Alison said, \"Rachel's in her room with Andre, go on up.\" He nodded to her and made his way to Rachel's room. As he got there Andre came out, not seeing Frank, and said, \"Don't worry Chelly, this concert is going to the greatest experience in your life,\" he turned and saw Frank and bucked his eyes. The smile from Rachel's face quickly went away when she saw Frank. \"What concert?\" Frank asked he looked at Andre, who looked at Rachel, who looked at Frank. No one said anything. \"Rachel, what is he talking about?\" \"Um, I got to go, I'll see you in Saturday Rachel,\" Andre said leaving the couple. Frank looked at Rachel with a lot of confusion. \"Baby, sit down, we need to talk,\" Rachel said. He sat next to her on her bed and asked again, \"What was he talking about?\" Rachel sighed and said, \"Well, you know that singer Prince right?\" Frank nodded, \"Well, he is coming to town on Saturday and Andre got two front row seats so, um, yeah, I'm going with him.\" As Rachel expected, Frank quickly stood up and protested, \"Rachel, do you know how dangerous that is, why would you put yourself in that kind of environment?\" he said sternly. \"Frank, you are overreacting, I have always want to see this guy live in here's my chance, Baby, I promise I'll be careful,\" Rachel said. \"You don't need to be careful because you are not going!\" he yelled. \"Frank, I'm going and I think it's time for you to go,\" she got up and opened the door for him. \"Rachel, I said you are not going to that concert!\" \"And who are you to tell me otherwise!\" she yelled, finally snapping. \"Um, your boyfriend!\" he yelled back. \"That's right, you are my boyfriend. Not my husband, not my father, not my bodyguard, not God, you are my boyfriend and I suggest you remember that and stop smothering me if you want to keep it that way and I'm going to that concert on Saturday whether you like it or not!\" she pushed him out her room and slammed the door in his face. Frank was speechless. 'Oh my God, I am smothering her, she must hate me,\" he thought. He started to knock on the door but decided not to. She needed her space.[Chapter 13] I cannot even begin to express how sorry I am for not updating. I have a lot on my plate and I put writing on the backburner but I am determined to finish this because I already have the sequel planned in my head. I hope most of ya'll are still with me so please review to show me you guys want this story to continue. I mean it REVIEW! PS, I know it is short, Im working on making my chapters longer. Okay continue with your reading. So Emotional \"Forget him,\" Rachel said to herself, so angry she was pacing back and forth. She didn't regret on thing she said, in fact she was happy for saying it. She finally got her backbone back. She was not going to be told what to do anymore, but she still knew that Frank's heart was in the right place. All he wanted to do is make sure she was safe. Rachel started thinking about everything, and just started crying. Everything was hitting her very hard; Tyson, Frank and a freaking D- in History. She lied down on her bed and held on to her pillow. This making her cry harder because she wished her pillow was Frank. He would have been there to hold her while she cried tears that had been waiting to pour out since the attack. Laying there crying an idea pop into her head. She got up and grabbed her keyboard and song book and started on a new song. The song title was 'So Emotional.' Frank stopped at the grocery store and got the turkey like his mom had asked. He was trying not to get let his emotions show but Rachel's word hurt him so deeply, he just want to hurt something. He swore that if he ever saw Tyson again that he would exactly that. When he got home, he finished his Thanksgiving Break homework and watch cartoons in the living room. His parent was probably at his mom's shop so he was alone. He dozed off on his couch and was awaken by his house phone. When he looked at the clock it was close to midnight and he could hear his father snoring. \"Hello,\" he said when he answered the phone. He didn't hear anyone talking, just a piano. He automatically knew it was Rachel. The song went on for a few minutes and then he heard Rachel pick up the phone. \"What did you name that one?\" he asked. \"'So Emotional.' I'm working on the lyrics, but I just wanted your opinion,\" Rachel said. \"I like it, is it a ballet or an up tempo song?\" \"I haven't decided yet, I think it can be both.\" No one said anything for a minute. Neither one wanted to be the first on to say 'I'm sorry.' \"Well, it's late, I guess I'll see you later,\" Rachel said. \"Rachel-\" she hung up before he could say anything. Frank kept the phone to his ear knowing she was gone but his hand wouldn't let go. \"Frank, who was that on the phone?\" Katherine asked coming downstairs in her robe. Frank finally hung up the phone and said, \"It was the wrong number.\" His mom nodded and went to the cabinet and pulled out a box of tea. \"What are you doing?\" he asked. \"I'm going to made you some chamomile tea with lemon,\" she said. \"Why?\" \"Sweetie, you haven't slept through the night since Rachel got attacked. You are exhausting yourself worrying about her,\" she explained. Frank sighed, \"Mom, I can't help the fact that I want to protect her. If I lose her, I'll die.\" Katherine shook her head and put water in the kettle. \"Baby, it wasn't your fault,\" she said. \"Mom it was my fault, I should have just gone to pick her up-\" \"I'm not talking about that,\" she cut him off. \"Then what are you talking about?\" he asked. \"Josie.\" \"Okay, mom, goodnight,\" he got up and started to leave. \"Franklin, don't walk away from me,\" Katherine said sternly. \"Mom, I don't want to talk about this,\" he groaned. \"You never want to talk about it, one day you are going to explode.\" Frank turned to look at her. Tears were coming down her face. It hurt him seeing his mother cry. \"Ma, don't cry,\" he pleaded. She wiped her tears and poured the now hot tea in a cup and gave it to him before heading back up stairs. Frank went to go sit down when he heard his mom say, \"You know, you may have lost your sister, but I lost my daughter but I'm not losing my son.\" Frank turned around but she was gone upstairs. He went back to the couch but again the phone rang. He answered, \"Hello.\" He listened to the call and almost passed out. \"Rachel, get up,\" she heard her dad say. She groaned and threw her pillow at him. \"Okay, you made me do this,\" Fletcher picked her up out of bed and put her on her feet. \"What the hell!\" she yelled. \"Put you shoes on, we'll be in the car,\" he threw her coat and tennis shoes. \"Wait, where are we going?\" she asked but he was already out the door. \"Okay, then this better is good,\" she said to herself. Both Frank and Rachel and their families arrived at the police station. They were all in their pajamas. \"Do you know what's going on?\" Rachel asked Frank. Frank looked at her and put his arm around her waist tightly and whispered in her ear, \"They found him.\" Rachel's knees almost gave out but Frank's grip held her up and carried her inside. \"Ms. Marron, Tyson Jones was caught by our officers earlier today but he pulled a gun out and shot one of our men. They killed him,\" the officer said. Rachel didn't want to look so happy because she didn't want him to died, just for him to leave her alone and Frank felt the same way. \"Oh thank God,\" Alison expressed. Everybody looked at her. \"What? It isn't like no one wanted to say that,\" she said. Frank looked at Rachel and reached for her hand. \"What about his parents?\" Rachel asked. \"They are on their way but if you don't want to see them it's okay. They told us that they don't blame you for anything.\" Rachel smiled and said, \"I think I want to go now.\" Everybody said their goodnights for the night but Frank and Rachel kept their distance. It was clear their relationship was going to be rocky for a while. Now that Rachel was safe, Frank could breathe a little better. Rachel was happy that Tyson was out of her life but she was still kind of peeved at Frank for his behavior for the last few weeks. They would have to talk because their parents are spending Thanksgiving together so the kids could have their first holiday together. Both Frank and Rachel thought that maybe it was a bad idea for their moms to meet because now they are the best of friends in just a short time.[Chapter 14] Happy Superbowl, I am super juiced because after the Superbowl Prince is going to be on New Girl and I can't wait. Anyway drama ahead. Happy Thanksgiving Today was the day. Thanksgiving day. Frank woke up feeling good. He loved Thanksgiving especially his mom's ham and his dad's famous potato salad. Rachel's family was coming early in the morning because the moms wanted to cook together. Frank also really wanted to talk to Rachel. He didn't her to be mad at him, he just wanted her to understand where he was coming from. And he has not kissed her in a week and his lips were weeping. After Frank got out of the shower he put his underwear on and walked into his room. While he was going through his dresser someone came up behind him and covered his eyes. \"Guess who,\" Rachel whispered seductively in his ear. \"Hm, is she tall?\" he asked smiling. \"Yes.\" \"Is her hair curly?\" he asked. \"Uh huh.\" \"Hm, is she a C cup?\" he said with an even bigger smile. Rachel let go of his eyes and punched his shoulder. \"Frank!\" she complained. He turned around. \"What? I like it. They fit perfectly in my hands,\" he said staring at her chest. Rachel covered her breast with her arms only perking them up. \"You are such a pervert,\" she said but she was smiling. It's been awhile since she smiled at him and he missed her smile like crazy. \"I want to kiss you,\" he said. Rachel pushed herself closer to him. \"What's stopping you?\" she asked. With that Frank kissed her. It was supposed to be just an innocent kiss but as soon as their lips touch for the first time in days, Frank couldn't help but be a little forceful. His hand moved to her butt and hers to his neck. They stayed like that until Rachel realized Frank wasn't wearing pants. \"Honey, get dressed before you get too excited,\" she said as she pulled away from him. He groaned and let go of her and put his jeans and shirt. \"Your mom told me to tell you that your breakfast is ready,\" Rachel said as she started to leave his bedroom. \"Excuse me?\" Frank said and Rachel turned around. \"Who said you were allowed to leave yet?\" he stalked toward her and grabbed her by her belt buckle. \"This is a lovely house Katie,\" Alison said while they were cleaning the turkey at the kitchen tabled. The men and Nikki were in the living room watching sports center. \"Thank you AliCat,\" Katie said. \"Hey, Rachel has been up there for a while, what are they doing?\" Fletcher yelled from the living room. Nikki looked at her dad like he had two heads. \"Daddy, have you seen how fine Frank is? Rachel is probably raping him right now,\" she said. \"Oh,\" Fletcher looked back at the TV but then he thought about it, \"Oh hell no.\" He shot off the couch and went for the stairs. \"Dad, stop,\" Nikki grabbed him. \"What?!\" he yelled. \"Let me go get them, do you really want to kill someone on Thanksgiving?\" Fletcher looked at the stairs and then at Nikki and then at the TV. \"They better be down here in five minutes or I'm coming up there,\" he said before going back to the living room. Nikki shook her head at him and headed up the stairs. \"Frank stop it, that tickles,\" She heard Rachel giggle. To make things more interesting Nikki didn't knock, she just opened the door. \"Just to let you know I am so going to look,\" Nikki said loudly. \"NIKKI!\" Rachel yelled. \"How are you not worried about what they are doing?\" Fletcher asked Herb. \"Because I trust my son, he is a complete gentleman. I know he wouldn't do anything Rachel wouldn't want him to do,\" Herb said not taking his eyes away from the game. \"So do you think they had… had… you know, intercourse,\" Fletcher shivered at the thought. Herb gave in and looked at him, \"No, Frank would have told me.\" Fletcher sighed. \"Look man, I don't mean to be rude but you never had a daughter, you can't possibly know what it is like to worry about your baby girl,\" Fletcher said. Herb stared at him blankly. He wanted to yell at him and hurt him for almost causing him to open that long healed wound. He just turned away and brought his attention back to the television. At that moment, the kids came downstairs to join the adults. \"Good morning everyone,\" Frank said. \"Morning, honey,\" Katherine said. \"Morning, Frank,\" Alison greeted him. \"Hey son,\" said Herb. Fletcher just nodded to him. \"Kids, make yourself useful, peel those potatoes,\" Alison said. A couple hours later, the food was finished and they were all sitting around the table. \"Everyone hold hands, Franklin, you lead us in prayer?\" Katherine said. Frank groaned, \"Do I have to?\" \"Frank,\" she gave him a look. Frank sighed, \"Bow your heads and close your eyes,\" everyone did so, \"God, we come to you in a season of giving and love, please bless this food we are about to eat and please help it nourish our bodies and make us stronger. Also God please bless every single one of us at this table and the ones that could not make it to this day, in Your name we pray, Amen.\" \"Amen,\" everyone else said in unison. \"Let's eat!\" Herb said loudly, making everyone laugh. Food was being passed around and the conversations were entertaining, until Fletcher got a few drinks in him and said something. \"So, Frank, what was taking you and Rachel doing this morning?\" he asked. Frank looked at him with a confused look. \"I mean we sent Rachel up there and we had to send Nikki to get you both two, what were you doing?\" Before Frank could say anything, Rachel said, \"We were talking.\" Nikki made a giggly noise. Rachel gave her the 'shut up' look. \"I trust that Frank wouldn't do anything to disrespect our home, now would you Frank?\" Katherine asked her son. \"Yes ma'am,\" he said. \"Trust trust trust, everybody trust Frank. Well I don't trust you, Frank. If I found out you force my daughter to do anything-\" \"Mom get that beer out of Dad's hand,\" Rachel said. \"Fletcher, you do not have to worry about my son, I told he is a gentleman and I know he would force Rachel,\" Herb said calmly. \"I told you that you can't possibly know what it is like to worry about your daughter because you never had one!\" \"SHUT UP!\" Frank yelled slamming his fist on the table. The women gasped in fear. \"Frank, calm down,\" Herb said. He knew that what Fletcher said had set off a trigger in Frank. \"Are you going to let him disrespect our family like, he doesn't even know what we been through!\" Frank yelled. \"Honey, calm down,\" Katherine cried. \"Oh please enlighten me,\" Fletcher said. \"Frank,\" Rachel said. \"Frank,\" Katherine whispered. He looked at Rachel and asked, \"Do you want to know what happened?\" Rachel knew exactly what he was talking about. Jocelyn.[Chapter 15] If I cried writing this, you guys are about to cry reading this. This is about the day Jocelyn died. Remember Frank was about 10 so this was tramatic to him throughout the rest of his life. Also there are a lot of you who read my story. I would really appreciate it if every single one of you guys review. I worked very hard on this chapter and I really would like some responses please. Okay, I'm done. The Last Day of Jocelyn Farmer \"Frankie!\" Frank heard Jocelyn yell from her bedroom. \"What?\" he yelled from his room. \"I can't find my Malibu Barbie, did you take it?\" she asked. Frank sighed, \"Why would I need your Malibu Barbie?\" \"And why do you two need to holler when you guys can just get up?\" Katherine interrupted. Frank groaned and went it to Josie's room. \"Sorry momma,\" Frank and Jocelyn said. Katherine smiled and walked away. \"I have not seen your Malibu Barbie today; do you want me to help you look for her? Frank asked. Josie nodded, \"You look downstairs while I look up here.\" Frank went downstairs and looked like she said. He looked though the kitchen and the living room, he found it tucked in between the couch. \"Josie, I found her,\" he said. Frank heard her squeal and run downstairs. \"Thank you,\" she said taking her Barbie away from him. Before he could leave the room Josie asked, \"Frankie, can you take me to the park?\" \"It's snowing outside,\" he said. \"And? I'll wear a coat. I want to make snow angels,\" she said. Frank shook his head, \"No Josie, I don't want to go to the park.\" Jocelyn made a face and hollered, \"Mommy, Frankie's being a meanie!\" Katherine came into the living room and said, \"What did you do Frank?\" \"Nothing, I just don't want to go to the park today,\" he explained. \"Come, honey, ya'll need to get out of the house and the park is right down the street. You guys can go to the candy store too,\" Katherine said. Frank's face lit up when she mentioned the candy store. \"Come on, Josie,\" he said making his way to the door and putting his snow coat on. Josie squealed again and followed him. Frank helped her put her coat on and put her on his back. \"Bye Momma,\" they both yelled. As they walked outside, Frank noticed their neighbor Mr. Greene staring at them. Mr. Greene was an older man you was always nice to him and Josie. He wore glass and always smiled when he saw Jocelyn. He also called her angel because he said she was so pretty. \"Hi, Mr. Greene,\" Frank waved. \"Hello Frank, where are you and that little angel headed?\" Mr. Greene asked. \"To the park and then Mommy's letting us go get some candy,\" Jocelyn said. \"Yeah? Do ya'll need some money?\" Mr. Greene asked. \"No, we're good,\" Frank said as he continued walking. \"You sure?\" he looked at Josie. \"Yeah, Mommy gave us money, see you later Mr. Greene,\" Jocelyn said. \"You sure will angel,\" Mr. Greene said under his breath. When they got to the park, Frank set Josie down and ran to the slides while Jocelyn ran to the snowiest part of the park. \"Jocelyn, stay where I can see you?\" Frank told her. \"Okay,\" she said as she started making snow angels. \"Look who it is, it's the Ms. I'm-So-Pretty-Everybody-Likes-Me-But-In-Real-Life-I'm-A-Ugly-Duck,\" a little girl said approaching Jocelyn. \"Leave me alone, Brandy,\" Josie said. \"Oh, what are you going to do if I don't, tell your brother?\" Brandy pushed Jocelyn into the snow. \"Stop it,\" Josie cried. \"Oh, look, she's crying. You are even uglier when you cry.\" Jocelyn got up from the snow and ran to Frank. \"Frankie!\" she cried. She slammed into him and hugged him tightly. \"What, why are you crying?\" he asked. \"I want to go home,\" she sobbed. \"But we just got here,\" he said. \"I don't care, I want to go home, please Frankie?\" she started crying even harder. Frank sighed. \"Okay, let's go home,\" Frank put her on his back and walked back home. On the way home Jocelyn asked Frank, \"Frankie, am I ugly?\" \"No, you are the prettiest little girl in the world, why?\" he asked. \"Because, the kids at daycare say I am,\" she said with a frown. \"Do you want me to tell Mom?\" Jocelyn shook her head, \"Then they'll call me a tattletale.\" Frank stopped and looked at her. \"Do you want me to do something?\" She shook her head again. \"Jocelyn, I am supposed to protect you, that's the point of being a big brother. I promise I will take care of it and I promise that nothing is ever going to happen to you while I'm around,\" he said. Jocelyn smiled, \"Okay.\" \"Now, race you back home,\" Frank started running towards the house. He heard Jocelyn yell, \"Cheater!\" as her little body tried to catch up. \"Frank, we will be right next door at the Jones, call us if you need us,\" Katherine said. She and Herb were going to a dinner party at the neighbor's house. \"Okay, Mom,\" he said. \"Watch your sister,\" Herb took his wife by the hand and led her outside. \"I will,\" Frank called out. The couple walked to the house next door. \"How you doing Farmers?\" Mr. Greene called out. \"Fine, thank you John, how are you this evening,\" Herb said back. \"I can't complain, how are the kids?\" Mr. Greene asked. \"They are fine, they are in the house getting ready for bed,\" Katherine said. Mr. Greene smiled and said, \"Have a good night.\" \"My G.I. Joe doesn't want to marry you Barbie; he has to save the world,\" Frank and Jocelyn were play with their toys in Jocelyn's room. \"And he needs someone to make him breakfast, Barbie can make the best pancakes,\" Jocelyn complained. All of a sudden, the lights turned off. \"Frankie, why'd the lights turn off? Jocelyn asked. Frank got off the floor and look outside. It wasn't windy or a storm. \"I don't know,\" he said. Jocelyn started to cry. \"Calm down, I'll go get my flashlight,\" he went to his room next door to get his flashlight. As soon as he entered his bedroom, his door slammed shut. He grabbed his flashlight and opened his door back open. \"Josie?\" He didn't get a reply. \"Jocelyn?\" he went to Jocelyn's room and found that she wasn't there. \"Jocelyn?!\" he yelled in a panic. He ran around the house looking for her. \"Josie, come on this is not funny!\" he cried. Finally he ran outside calling her name. \"Jocelyn!\" he cried out. He still didn't get a reply. \"Josie, please say something!\" he yelled. He ran to the neighbor's house and banged on the door. \"Mommy, Daddy!\" The door flew open and his parents came out. \"What? What's going on?\" Herb asked. \"Josie, I can't find her,\" he said. \"Oh my God, my baby,\" Katherine cried. Frank's parents and other people at the party started calling her name and the police came a few minutes later. Frank suddenly heard a distant cry, \"Frankie!\" Frank stopped in his tracks. \"Frankie!\" the voice called again. It was coming from the woods across the street from his house. Frank took off into the woods and kept going and didn't stop even when he heard his mom calling him. He kept running until he tripped over something. He looked back to see what he tripped on. It was Jocelyn. She was naked with blood all over her body and bruised in between her thighs. \"Frankie,\" she whispered. Frank sat up and stared at her. He could feel himself going into shock. \"Josie? Who did this to you?\" he asked. Her eyes could barely stay open. Frank shook her to wake her. \"Josie, please, stay awake, you have to stay awake, tell me what happened,\" he started to cry. \"Mr. Greene, he put h-his thing in me, and he hit me. Why would he do that Frankie?\" she whispered. She was dozing off again. \"Josie, I'm sorry. I didn't protect you, I'm so sorry. It's my fault,\" he sobbed. Jocelyn shook her head and used her last breath to say, \"It wasn't your fault… I love you Frankie.\" And her eyes shut. Frank cried and cried and cried, begging her to wake up. \"Josie, please, wake up, you can't die.\" He shook her but her body was lifeless. Frank could feel a part of him dying. He looked at his sister and thought that he couldn't leave her there in the cold. He took off his shirt and wrapped it around her and cradled her in his arm and walked toward his house. Tears blurred his vision but he made his way back. \"Frank!\" his mother cried. She ran over to him and stopped when she saw that he was carrying Jocelyn. \"Oh God no,\" she dropped down to her knees and cried. Herb ran over to his family and tried to take Josie from Frank but Frank wouldn't let her go. He sat on the ground and cried with his mother. The police came over to them and tried to ask Frank what happened but then Frank saw Mr. Greene hurrying over to his house. Frank saw red. He handed Jocelyn over to his dad and walked over to Mr. Greene's house. \"Mr. Greene,\" Frank said when he approached him. \"Ah, Frank, what going on over there?\" Mr. Greene asked nervously. \"You killed my little sister,\" Frank said in a menacing tone. Mr. Greene looked at the young boy with fear in his eyes. \"I don't know what you are talking about Franklin,\" he said. \"I'll kill you. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I will kill you,\" Frank left on that note. He knew his life would never be the same. He was going to fight to his last breath to make sure that man was going down. Okay see ya'll probably next weekend. Again, I want everyone to review on this chapter.[Chapter 16] Broken Everybody looked at Frank with a different look in their eyes. By the end of his flashback, Frank was looking at his hands, shaking and crying. He wouldn't look up at anyone; he didn't want to look at anyone in the eye. The guilt he felt had numbed him. His parents had tears in their eyes, Rachel was trying to stop herself from crying; Nikki and Alison were bawling while Fletcher was stuck. He never felt so bad in his life. He wanted to apologize to Frank and his parents. No parent should go through that and no big brother should witness that. \"Frank,\" Rachel whispered as she reached for his hand. He quickly moved his hand away from her. Rachel knew what exactly he was thinking; she knew he was downing himself. \"Frank, it wasn't your fault,\" she said. He nodded and started rocking back and forth. \"It was, I shouldn't have left her, it was my fault,\" he said. \"Honey, no it wasn't, it was no one's fault but his,\" Katherine said softly. Frank shook his head and didn't say anything. \"I'm sorry,\" Fletcher said, finding his voice again, \"I didn't know. I was just so worried about Rachel.\" Herb looked at him and said, \"You didn't know, we try to keep it on the down low so people won't look at us like we are so unhappy. That changed my family forever, I don't have my little girl anymore and I have a son who lost a major part of himself. I barely let it go but Frank was never the same after that. He used to walk around the house like a zombie and never wanted to express how he was feeling. When we finally cleaned out her room, he threw a tantrum and he had to be sedated. We tried to get him help, but no amount of therapy could mend his broken heart. When he joined the football team, he got to release a lot of anger but still, his heart will always be in pain for the rest of his life, all because of one man who took his sister away from him and got away with it due to lack of evidence.\" Frank stood up out of his chair and went his room. Everyone looked after him. A few moments later, they heard things hitting the wall and crying. Rachel hurried and went upstairs. \"Rachel,\" her dad called after her but she still continued on her path. She twisted the doorknob and it was locked. \"Frank, open the door,\" she said. She jumped when something was flung against the door. \"GO AWAY!\" Frank yelled. Rachel, instead, kept pounding on the door. \"Baby, please, let me in,\" she said. She could still here things being thrown against the wall. The louder things got, the more she banged on the door. Frank's parents came up the stairs to get him to open the door but nothing worked. Finally Herb decided to break the door down and after a few hits the door opened. The room was a mess and Frank was in the corner of his room with his knees hugged to his chest. His face was emotionless and he stared into space, not acknowledging Rachel and his parents. \"Rachel, you should go, he wouldn't want you to see him like this,\" Katherine said. Rachel shook her head. \"I'm not leaving him,\" she said. She walked toward him and sat next to him. Katherine and Herb looked at each other and decided to leave the two alone. Frank was still catatonic so Rachel started talking. \"You know, when I was little I collected dolls, I don't think I ever told you that, maybe because it was so corny. Anyway, I would drag my parents to antique stores all over town to find the perfect doll to add to my collection,\" she paused to see if he'd respond but nothing so she continued, \"One day, Nikki and I were arguing over something, I think it was Jell-O, and she smashed this one doll I had that was made of glass, I called her Ice Princess. Did I mention that they all had names?\" she paused again but nothing. \"Well, like I was saying, she smashed it so I did what any person would do, I threw the Jell-O in her face,\" Rachel smiled at the memory, \"She told my parents and I got my butt whupped. I swear I was so mad at my parents. I don't know if you noticed but my parents value Nikki more than me. It used to mess me up so much. I always wonder why Nikki got away with the stuff I got in troubled for. I eventually got over it, I mean, when I turn eighteen I'm moving in with Andre so they can have a house without me. Andre has been my best friend since third grade, whenever I was with him I felt loved. Sometimes he would sneak in my window on stormy nights and cuddle with me until we fell asleep. I love my family but Andre is like my brother, my dad and my mother all wrapped in one,\" she said. Frank was still staring into space but Rachel could tell that he was listening. \"One day when I was 9 and he was 10, while we playing outside a car came and the man inside stopped by my house. He rolled down the window and told us that he had some candy for us. Now we knew this guy was suspicious so Andre said no thank you and we continued our game, but the man got out of the car and walked over to us and grabbed Andre and started pulling him to his car saying be good or I'll kill your sister. Andre was a very weak little boy so it was easy to grab him. Andre stayed quiet but I, on the other hand, started screaming bloody murder. The man kept yelling for me to shut up but I screamed even louder. Finally our parents ran out the house and the man dropped Andre and ran.\" Rachel paused again and looked at Frank. He was looking at her but didn't say anything. \"The reason I'm telling you all of this is because brothers and sisters have to protect each other. It isn't just one-sided. You didn't hear Jocelyn scream, did you?\" she asked. Frank looked down and shook his head. \"My guess is that when he grabbed her, he told her not to scream or he would kill you. From what I heard, Jocelyn adored you and she didn't want you to be killed too. She was probably thinking about your parents too. If she had scream, he would have killed you too, I'm sure of it. She was keeping her parent for losing both of their kids. She was a strong little girl, I know she was and when she told you that it was your fault she meant it. You had protected her for so long, but it was her turn to protect you. She died so you can live, not in guilt or in pain but in happiness. If you ask me, she was an angel.\" Tears started to come down Frank's face again. He looked at Rachel and said, \"He took my sister away from me.\" Rachel pressed her forehead against his and said, \"I know, you know and God know, just because he got away with it in court doesn't mean he got away with it in life, in due time that son-of-a-bitch will get what's coming to him.\" Frank moved his head down to Rachel's bosom and said, \"Sing to me.\" Rachel wrapped her arms around him and started singing. I will love you any way Even if you cannot stay I think you are the one for me Here is where you ought to be I just want to satisfy you But you're not mine and I can't deny you Don't you hear me takin', baby Love me now or I'll go crazy Ooh, oh, sweet thang Don't you know you're my everything? Ooh, oh, sweet thang Don't you know you're my everything She continued to sing as Frank cried. He was finally letting it go.[Chapter 17] Hey my lovlies, just wanted to stop by and say hey and maybe update. I am sure you guys will laugh at this chapter because Frank is being his usual adorable self. PLUS my favorite character is being introduced. I also made a time jump, btw. Better Safe than Sorry School was back and so were Frank and Rachel. Thanksgiving Break might have changed their relationship for the better. Neither had any secrets and everything was crisp and clear. Though Frank still didn't like the fact that Rachel still went to the concert, he couldn't help but laugh when she came back and her voice was gone. School wasn't changing so let's jump to summer vacation because nothing exciting happens in school, honestly. In Los Angeles it was 90 degrees outside and if you didn't have an air conditioner then it was 100 degrees inside. Frank was trying to decide whether or not to camp outside on his back porch when Rachel surprised him. \"Hey good-looking,\" she said slapping his butt. Frank jumped and turned around fuming. \"Don't do that,\" he complained. Rachel laughed at him and asked, \"What? This?\" She slapped him again. \"Yeah that,\" he pouted. Rachel smiled at him and kissed his pouty lips. \"Why are you so grumpy today?\" she asked. \"I'm not grumpy, it's just hot out here,\" he said, \"Look even the bugs don't want to come out.\" Rachel rolled her eyes at him, \"Stop being a baby, a little heat ain't never hurt anybody farm boy.\" Frank continued with his pouting as she made fun of him. \"What are you doing here this late, it's almost six?\" he asked. They sat down in the porch swing. \"I just wanted to see my baby, and my parents were having company for Nikki so I had to disappear so I was wondering if I could spent the night?\" she asked softly. Frank sighed. He had noticed that her parent paid more attention to Nikki and he knew that Rachel was a little hurt by it, but if only they knew. \"I'm sure my parents won't mind, let's go ask,\" they got up and went to the living room where Herb was watching football and Katherine was knitting. \"Hey guys,\" Frank said, \"Can Rachel spend the night?\" Katherine looked at Herb with concern in her eyes. \"I don't know if I'll feel comfortable with you two having 'sleepovers' just yet,\" she said. Frank rolled his eyes, \"Come on mom, don't you trust us?\" \"No,\" both his parents said in unison. Rachel looked at Katherine and said, \"I understand, I'll just call Mia and tell her to come and get me.\" Herb sighed. He couldn't stand Rachel's sad eyes. \"Frank, you sleep on the couch and let Rachel have your bed.\" \"Herb!\" Katherine protested. \"I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, boy, you better be on this couch by nine and the door remains open,\" he said to Frank. \"Yes sir,\" Frank said. He took Rachel's and led her upstairs to his room. He left the door cracked so his dad wouldn't say anything. He and Rachel laid on his bed just relaxed. \"Baby?\" Rachel asked. Frank turned his body to face her. \"Yes?\" \"Do you ever think about it?\" she asked. Rachel could tell by the confused look on his face that he wasn't following. \"You know what, never mind,\" she said looking back at the ceiling. \"Rachel, what is it?\" Frank asked. \"It's nothing, forget I said anything,\" Rachel said. \"Come on Rachel tell me,\" he said. Rachel sighed. ' I can't believe I'm asking him this,' she thought. \"Do you ever think about…\" \"What Rachel?\" he pushed. \"Do you ever think about having sex with me?\" she asked. Frank didn't know how to answer to that. All he said was, \"Oh.\" Rachel took his silence as a no. \"It's okay if you don't Frank,\" she said. Frank quickly tried to smooth the situation out. \"No, babe, I do think about it, I was just shocked that you asked. I always think about making love to you,\" he said. \"Always?\" she asked. \"Yeah, most of the time but I know that you aren't ready so I don't say anything,\" he said. \"But what would you say if I told you I was ready now?\" she asked. Frank just stared at her. He couldn't believe what she was saying; the thought of touching her in that way was making him very excited. \"Well not at this minute, you perv,\" Rachel said as she felt something poking her hip. Frank quickly shifted praying that he would calm down. \"My bad,\" he said, \"But are you sure you are ready?\" Rachel nodded. \"Well, not until we talk about, you know, protection and everything. And I want us both to get tested,\" she said. \"But we're both virgins, Rachel,\" he said. \"It's just for my peace of mind, babe, I just want everything on paper.\" Frank closed his eyes and thought about everything she was saying while trying to get the images out of his head. \"So you are telling me,\" he paused and looked her in the eye, \"That if I go out and buy me a box of condoms, there is a possibility that I won't be a virgin going into senior year?\" Rachel laughed at him, \"There is a great possibility that we won't be virgins going into senior year. But I want you to promise me that you will go out and buy some condoms.\" \"I will go out and get me some tomorrow that is a promise. Maybe you should get on the pill,\" he suggested. Rachel laughed at him again. \"Baby, I got on the pill before I even started high school,\" she informed him. Again, Frank couldn't say anything but, \"Oh.\" The next day After Frank dropped Rachel off at her house and drove straight to the local drug store. As he was looking through the condom section he couldn't decide which one to buy. 'This one says more protection but this one says more pleasure. I want to be protected but I also want her to feel good. I know they say that girls don't have an orgasm their first time but I want to at least try to make her feel something besides my thing causing her pain. Maybe I should get both and test them out. But, I'm sure she wouldn't want to go again in the same night. Maybe I should get some lube so it wouldn't hurts so bad. I don't want to sound cocky but I do have a package on me and I don't want her to be in too much pain. Oh, duh, this one says protection and pleasure. I'll get these and I'll get the lube too, just to make things smoother. And I'm going to get these baby wipes just in case she bleeds. Maybe I should grab some candles as well for aromatherapy. I want her to be as comfortable as possible. \"Frank?\" a voice snapped him out of his thoughts. Frank looked and saw a girl from school. He tried to hide his basket behind his back. \"Uh, Tammy?\" he guessed. \"Toni,\" she said annoyed. \"Oh, my bad. Hi,\" he said. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked trying to peak in his basket. \"Just doing a little shopping,\" he said nervously. \"For condoms?\" she smiled slyly. Frank hung his head down in defeat. \"Better safe than sorry,\" he said. \"I guess so,\" she moved closer to him making him move back, \"So you and Rachel still together?\" \"Yes, we are going on 9 months now,\" he said. \"So you guys are physical I see,\" she said. \"Toni, that isn't any of your business, now if you will excuse me I have to pay for my stuff,\" Frank said. He walked away from her no longer ashamed that his basket was filled with nothing but sex stuff. Later that day \"Rachel, can we please stop?\" Mia begged. They were jogging around the neighborhood and went through the park when Mia sat down and started whining. \"Stop being a baby Mia,\" Rachel said. \"Just for five minutes, please?\" Mia whined. Rachel groaned and sat next to Mia on the park bench. She was trying to keep herself busy. She missed singing camp, it was the one place she didn't have to hide. Since her family was home she was becoming more depressed than she already was. Even after the whole Tyson thing her parents still paid more attention to Nikki than Rachel. Today her family was holding another get together so again she had to find a place to sleep over. She felt so homeless sometimes. \"Rachel, it is almost 100 degrees out here, why are we running?\" \"Because you don't keep a body like mine by staying still and crying about the heat,\" she answered. Mia drank from her water bottle when she saw a guy looking at them from the other side park. To Mia he was the most beautiful man she had ever seen. He was huge with brown eyes and nice brown hair and he had on a black motorcycle jacket. \"Am I tripping or is the hunk staring at us?\" Mia asked with a huge grin on her face. Rachel looked to where her friend was staring and looked back at Mia. \"Are you serious Mia?\" \"What? He is beautiful,\" Mia said still staring. \"He looks like a thug,\" Rachel laughed. Mia rolled her eyes and ignored her. Just then the ice cream came to them and passed them two chocolate ice cream cones. \"These are a gift from the guy in the leather jacket,\" the man said before leaving. \"Oh my God, I think I'm in love. He gave us cold chocolate Rachel,\" Mia enthused. Rachel only laughed at her friend while eating her ice cream. She was never one to turn down chocolate. \"I think he is coming over to us, how do I look?\" Mia asked frantically. \"Sweaty,\" Rachel said. Mia rolled her eyes and finally the guy reached them. \"Hello ladies,\" he said, he had a rough and slightly Italian accent. \"Hi,\" both Rachel and Mia said. \"I'm Anthony Scipelli but my friends call me Tony,\" he said with a huge smile on his face. \"I'm Mia,\" she said. \"You have a very pretty name Mia, and what is your name?\" he asked Rachel. She looked at him up and down and figured he was cool. \"Rachel.\" \"So Tony,\" Mia said, \"Where are you from?\" \"I guess I kind of stick out, I'm from New York. I am staying with a friend for the summer,\" he said. He and Mia hadn't taken their eyes off of each other. \"How old are you?\" Rachel asked with no shame. \"Rachel!\" Mia scolded, \"I am sorry Tony, my friend left her home training at home.\" Tony chuckled, \"It's okay, I'm 20 years old if you must know.\" \"And on that note we have to go, see you around Tony,\" Rachel grabbed Mia and left Tony hanging. \"Wait, here's my number Mia, call me sometime,\" he caught up to them and gave Mia his number before Rachel pulled Mia away. I had so much fun writing this chapter. What do you think about Rachel's decision? And what does Toni have up her sleeve? More importantly... how cute was Frank at the drug store? Plus my boy Tony is in the picture and him and Mia are smitten. Anyway review and tell me what you think. I finally decided to brainstorm and not just write whatever came to my head so there is more to come soon.[Chapter 18] Well, This Sucks Frank and Rachel were laying on Frank's bed listening to music. It was even more hot than it was last week and going outside wasn't an option. Frank wasn't use to the weather being this hot and was being more cranky than usual. \"Ugh,\" he groaned. Rachel rolled her eyes at him; this was about the tenth time he complained about the heat. It was already noon and they were both bored. While thinking about it Rachel came up with an idea. \"Baby?\" she looked at Frank. \"Yes?\" \"Let's go to the beach,\" she said. Frank lit up like a Christmas tree. He was thinking about Rachel in her bathing suit, with water glistening and dropping all over her body. \"Frank, you are thinking out loud again,\" Rachel giggled. Frank quickly tried to think of something that would make him calm down. \"My bad,\" he said. \"It's okay,\" she said, \"So do you want to? I could call Mia and Andre and they could meet us there.\" Frank thought about it some more. Venice was about an hour away and he didn't want to be in his hot truck for that long, but then again he really wanted to see Rachel in her bathing suit so he sucked it up and said, \"Yeah, let's do it.\" They got up and told Frank's parents where they were going and drove to Rachel's house so she could change into her bathing suit but when they walked in the temperature dropped. Her parents were in the front room with a man she never seen before. \"Rachel, what are you doing here?\" Alison asked, \"I thought I told you that we were having company.\" \"I just came to get my swim suit, we're going to the beach,\" Rachel explained, \"Wait right here Frank, and I'll be back.\" She hurried upstairs, leaving Frank. He could feel the awkwardness in the atmosphere. He smiled nervously and said, \"I'm just going to hang out in the dining room.\" A few minutes later Rachel came back down stairs wearing a tank top and shorts. She kissed her parents goodbye and they were on their way. When they made it to the beach, Mia and Andre were already there. Rachel frowned when she saw Tony standing next to Mia but quickly fixed her face. \"Hey guys,\" Rachel said when they approached them. \"What took you two so long?\" Andre complained. \"My truck was low on gas,\" Frank explained. \"Whatever you're here now, so can we get to that beach, it's calling my name,\" Tony said. Mia smiled and said, \"Come on.\" She grabbed him by the hand and they skipped merrily to the beach. Frank, Rachel and Andre were looking at them so confused. \"Where did she meet him again?\" Andre asked. \"At the park while we were jogging, he bought us ice cream and they exchanged numbers,\" Rachel said. The group slowly walked towards the beach. \"How old is he?\" Frank asked. \"I think he said 20,\" she answered. \"Wait, isn't she 16?\" Frank asked. \"17,\" Andre said. They were interrupted by Mia's loud squeals as Tony picked her up and dipped her into the water. \"Well, as long as she happy, right?\" said Frank. Rachel shrugged her shoulders. They found a spot to lay there towels and moved to the beach. After a couple hours in the water Frank and Tony went to the ice cream man to buy the girls something. \"Tony, can I ask you something?\" \"Sure man,\" Tony said. \"You know, I've known Mia for almost a year and I have to say she's grown on me, like a sister. Plus she is Rachel's best friend,\" he said. \"Oh, you want to know what my intentions are,\" Tony said. Frank nodded. \"Well, I really like her. She's funny, smart and she is so easy to talk to. I know she is a younger than me but I can't help myself and she is so beautiful. Girls like her back home never even looked at me twice but the minute I saw her it was like nothing mattered anymore except her. I'm sure you understand; I see you and Rachel and I want Mia and I to be like you guys.\" Frank couldn't argue with that, Tony is like him when he first met Rachel. \"I felt the same way. When I first saw Rachel she was the most beautiful creature walking this earth and when she talked to me I felt like I instantly fell in love with her, but I took it slow and you and Mia are moving pretty fast.\" \"How long did you wait to ask Rachel out?\" Tony asked. \"About three months, we met on the first day of school but we were just friend up until October,\" Frank said. \"Man, I can't wait that long,\" Tony said. \"I'm not telling you to wait that long, I'm just saying slow down. You should try being her friend before you get serious; get to know her and find out what she likes. I know Rachel loves purple; she really loves music and baking. I notice that when she is nervous her eye twitches a little bit and when she lies, she bites the inside of her lip. I knew all of this before we became a couple.\" Tony thought about it for a minute. \"Good idea, but what if she makes a move before I know all of these things?\" he asked. \"Then go with it and figure it out later.\" They bought the snacks and went back to the group. Frank took Rachel home and they made plans to hang out the next day. Rachel walked into her home and announced, \"I'm home and hungry.\" She chuckled to herself while making her way to the kitchen where she saw her parents stand there. Her mom had her arms folded and her dad had a paper in his hand. \"Hey guys, why do ya'll look mad, I'm in before curfew?\" she asked. \"You tell us,\" Fletcher said. He gave her the paper he was holding. It read: Dear Rachel Marron, We are happy to announce that it is Camp Tune's 10 th anniversary and we would like to invite the following students: Charles Robinson, Anthony Harrell, Anastasia Watkins, Lisa Phillips and Rachel Marron. These students all were the best and most gifted out of all participants and it will be an honor if all five could attend the ball we are throwing for our 10 th birthday. Please call (805) 234-9375 to RSVP for you spot. And remember to work on your scales. -Laila Perry \"Oh crap,\" Rachel mumbled. \"So can you explain this?\" Alison asked harshly. \"I-I don't see how this is a big deal,\" Rachel said. Her hands were shaking for the tension in the room. \"Not a big deal? You went behind our backs and attended Camp Tune. Can you even sing? Do you even have the skills to make it? No, you don't. How can you do this? You are ruining the chance for our family to be something. What about your sister? Have you thought for one minute how this could affect her and her career?\" Fletcher yelled at her. Rachel's nervousness had turned into anger and her parents were pushing it. \"And since you are such the little singer, you are going to sing for us and we will be the judge of that,\" her mother said. Rachel's eyes were still at the floor. She was trying to control herself from disrespecting them. \"Come on Rachel, prove it to us,\" Alison yelled. That was it. \"WHY DO I HAVE TO PROVE MYSELF TO YOU ?!\" Rachel exploded. Both of her parents were taken back. \"Rachel, don't you raise your voice at us,\" Fletcher said. \"I don't care anymore! I don't care that you are my parents; I don't care that I live in your house and I damn sure don't care about what you think of me. Do you want to know why? You never cared about me unless I am dying. You never asked me what I want to do with my life, you never asked me if I want to learn what it would takes to make it, and you never even ask me how I feel about ANYTHING! The only thing you care about is Nikki. You think Nikki is so perfect that you forget about me. Why did you even have me if you were going to neglect me and show favoritism?\" she hollered. Alison and Fletcher were speechless. They both didn't know what to say except, \"G-go to your room.\" \"Gladly,\" Rachel made a beeline to her bedroom and slammed the door. Her plopped on her bed and thoughts were racing through her head faster than a race horse. She was going to prove herself, not to her parents but to somebody who mattered. Around midnight, Rachel had a bag packed and she would get some money out of her bank account, she was going to prove that she has what it takes. This was what she wanted. Before she left she snuck inside Nikki's room. \"Nikki,\" she poked her. Nikki stirred but didn't wake up. When she poked her again her eyes slowly opened. \"Rachel, what time is it?\" she asked sleepily. \"Don't worry about it. I need you to send Frank a message for me. Let him know that I will be okay and I'll come back soon.\" Nikki rubbed her eyes, \"Where are you going?\" \"Vegas, I have to do this,\" She said. \"Is this about what they said? Rachel, you don't have to prove yourself to them.\" \"I'm not doing this for them I'm doing this for me, just tell Frank I'm coming back and I will call him when I find a phone, and please don't tell him where I am or mom and dad?\" Nikki looked at her sister and ever in the dark she could see how serious she was. She smiled and said, \"Okay. I will tell him. Be careful Sissy.\" Rachel hugged her sister, \"Thank you. I'll be back, I just don't know when.\" Nikki hugged her back and said, \"Go before I change my mind.\" Rachel smiled and left Nikki's room to the front door. The warm summer air relaxed Rachel. She knew the bus station was a bit far but she would walk fast. She wanted to get there by morning so she could catch the early bus. That walk was towards her future and it would make or break her.

Meet me at the bottom when you are finished and excuse any mistakes I made. And I don't own anything, if I did I so wouldn't be here right now. A Chance in a Million Rachel had been missing for two days and even with Nikki's reassurance that Rachel would be okay Frank was still scared out of his mind. When he asked Nikki if she knew where Rachel was she simply told he that she couldn't tell him. The police had interrogated her but she still wouldn't tell. She wanted to give Rachel time to call but if she didn't make contact in the next two days Nikki was going to reveal her sister's whereabouts. While Rachel was away her Fletcher and Alison were playing the concerned parent roles in front of the police and cameras but Frank knew it was probably an act. It boiled his blood that her parents were responsible for this whole thing. He didn't want Rachel going back to that house when she came back… if she came back. Even though her back hurt from sleeping on that bed at the shelter, Rachel walked around Vegas in amazement. The streets were so alive with talent. There were dancers, magicians, even the bums look interesting. She found a place to set up her keyboard and used the bucket she found by a dumpster to collect tips. Once everything was set up she started singing. Rachel was in that same spot for four hours and only made 60 dollars. The night before she slept at a shelter but today she wanted a motel room and not a sleazy one and 60 bucks wasn't going to cut it. She was tired and her body ached. As she slumped back to the shelter she stopped by a club that had an interesting poster. The poster was for the battle of the band and the first prize winner wins 1000 dollars. She wished she had a band but it was only her. When she began to walk away she was knock out to the ground by an unknown object. \"My bad, lady,\" a guy carrying some drums said, \"I would help you up but my hands are kind of full, are you okay?\" \"I'm okay,\" she got up and wiped herself off, \"Do you need some help?\" \"Yes please?\" he passed a drum to her and she held the drum in one hand and her keyboard in the other. They walked in the club through the back way and into a dressing room. When they walked in the room it was two guys already in there. \"Mikey, who is this?\" asked a guy tuning his bass. \"Hey what did you say your name was?\" the guy called Mikey asked. Rachel smiled at the group and said, \"I'm Rachel.\" \"I'm Mikey and these are my brothers Ricky and Jimmy,\" Mikey said, \"Our band is called Tripps because we're triples. \"Hello,\" both the boys said in unison. All of the boys had on black dress pants with a black vest and bowties. Ricky had on glasses and Jimmy had a suspenders. \"Rachel, if you don't mind we are on in ten minutes and we have to rehearse,\" Jimmy said. \"Oh, my bad, I didn't mean to hold you guys back.\" She walked out the door and as she left she heard the sound of drums. The beat made her foot start tapping. When the bass play, her eyes bugged out of her head. She knew that beat, she had heard it in her dreams before and she knew what song would go with it. She ran back into the dressing room and the boys stopped. \"I can sing and I can play the keyboard,\" she said frantically, \"I write songs, some that could be hits, and I know just the song to go with your music and I noticed you didn't have a singer and I was wondering if I could sing with you. Every band playing tonight has a singer except you and if you want to win you need me, we need each other,\" she paused and breathe, \"Please let me sing,\" she said. The guys looked at her, processing everything she said. They looked at each other and back at her. \"We don't have time to rehearse it with you,\" Ricky said. \"You don't have to, I know this song. I could make up some instruments on my keyboard and sing my lyrics. Please?\" she begged. Ricky and Mikey looked at Jimmy as if he was the decision maker. Jimmy looked her up and down and sighed. \"Okay, you can sing with us.\" When it was time for them to play Rachel took a deep breath and adjusted the microphone. She looked at the guys and nodded to them and they began to play. She said a silent prayer and sang. Huh, yeah, woo, hey yeah, huh Ooh yeah, uh huh, yeah I want to dance Clock strikes upon the hour And the sun begins to fade Still enough time to figure out How to chase my blues away I've done alright up 'til now It's the light of day that shows me how And when the night falls Loneliness calls [Chorus 2x:] Oh! I wanna dance with somebody I wanna feel the heat with somebody Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody With somebody who loves me She seen the crowd start getting up and dancing. I've been in love and lost my senses Spinning through the town Sooner or later the fever ends And I wind up feeling down I need a man who'll take a chance On a love that burns hot enough to last So when the night falls My lonely heart calls [Chorus 2x] Oh! I wanna dance with somebody I wanna feel the heat with somebody Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody With somebody who loves me Somebody who somebody who... somebody who loves me, Somebody who somebody who... to hold me in his arms. I need a man who'll take a chance, On a love that burns hot enough to last. So when the night falls, My lonely heart calls. [Chorus 2x] Uh-Huh The guys fell to the song perfectly. She pointed to the crowd and invited them up on stage. (Dance) Com' on, baby (Dance) Woo, yeah (Dance) Now get with this, hahaha Whoa, oh, oh Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me baby? Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me boy? Don't you wanna dance (dance) With me baby? With somebody who loves me Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance? Don't you wanna dance? (Dance) Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance? Don't you wanna dance? (Dance) Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance...(Dance) Uh-huh With somebody who loves me The song ended and they received a standing ovation. Flowers were thrown onto the stage and whistles and claps filled the building. The band and Rachel joined hands and bowed as the curtains went down. They gathered their instruments and ran back to the dressing room. \"That was amazing!\" Mikey said. \"Yeah, Rachel, you were on fire, come here,\" Jimmy said then he picked Rachel up and spun her around. \"I have to say, you were out of sight,\" Ricky praised. \"Thank you. You guys were great too,\" Rachel said. Her cheeks were burning from smiling so hard and her body still was tired but she had never felt more alive. Other bands went on and it was time to announce the winner. \"We did it, we did it, we did it, we won, we won,\" the boys all sang as they walked out of the venue with the trophy and the prize money of a 1000 dollars. Rachel was so happy that she was speechless. She did it, she proved herself and now she was ready to go home, it couldn't get better than this. As the band walked over to their van and loaded there instruments a man in a suit came over to them. \"Hello, my name is Calvin Johnson and I am assistant to Clive Davis of Arista Records,\" the man said. \"Seriously?\" Ricky asked. Rachel and the rest of the band looked at each other with excitement of their faces. \"Seriously, first of all, I want to say that you guys were amazing. We loved everything about you,\" Calvin praised, \"Especially you Missy,\" he pointed at Rachel. Rachel started blushing. \"Wait, we?\" Mikey asked. Calvin understood the confusion. \"Clive Davis was in attendance tonight. He would have been here to talk to you his self but he had some things to set up before tomorrow.\" \"What's tomorrow?\" asked Jimmy. Calvin smiled, \"We are considering signing your group to Arista Records.\" \"Oh my God,\" Rachel said. She was feeling overwhelmed and held on to Mikey's arm so she wouldn't fall on her butt. \"Man, are you kidding!\" Ricky exclaimed. \"We would like to schedule a meeting for tomorrow morning to discuss everything, let's meet at this restaurant across the street for breakfast around ten and we will talk,\" Calvin handed them a business card and left the group. Even though the guys insisted that Rachel stay with them for the night, she really wanted to sleep in her own room so she used the money from her cut and got a hotel room and they would pick her up in the morning. She spread out on the bed and felt herself finally relax. She stared at the ceiling and thought about everything that had happened in the last couple of days. Everything that could go right did and she did it all by herself. She suddenly thought of Frank. It had been a while since they talked and Rachel knew that he was freaking out. She grabbed the phone and punch in his number. After a couple rings, the phone picked up. \"Hello?\" Herb said sleepily. \"Hi Mr. Farmer,\" Rachel said. \"Oh my God Rachel, sweetie you had everybody worried sick. Where are you?\" he asked. Rachel sighed. \"I can't tell you. Can you wake Frank up for me please?\" She waited a moment and smiled when she heard Frank's voice. \"Rachel?\" Frank asked. \"Hey baby,\" she said. Rachel immediately felt the ache in her heart. Hearing his voice made her long for him to be there with her. Tears started flowing down her face. \"Rachel, baby, where are you?\" asked Frank. \"I'm sorry, I can't tell you.\" \"Rachel please?\" he begged, \"You don't have to go back to your parents, you can come stay with us if you want, tell me where you are and I'll come get you.\" Rachel wiped the tears away. \"Not yet baby. Don't worry; I'll call you when I'm ready to come home but not now, not when I'm so close.\" \"Close to what Rachel?\" \"My future,\" she said. She heard him sigh on the other end. \"Are you safe?\" Rachel giggled. \"Yes Frank, I'm safe. I going to go to sleep now, I might call tomorrow.\" \"Okay, Rachel, be careful please?\" \"I'm always careful. I love you.\" \"I love you more.\" \"Sure you do, good night.\" \"Night.\" They hung up the phone and Rachel changed into her pajamas and fell asleep quickly. Rachel was awoken by the sound of banging on the door. She thought she was dreaming and laid back down. Then she heard voices yelling through the door. \"Rachel open the door, don't act like you don't hear us,\" Mikey said. \"Yeah, there is a maid's cart right next to us and we can open this door, whether your dressed or not,\" that was Ricky. Rachel groaned into her pillow and got up to open the door. \"What time is it?\" she asked rubbing her eyes. The boys waltz inside her room. \"It's time to go, now go get ready,\" Jimmy threw Rachel her backpack and she slumped to the bathroom. When she was finally ready, they hopped in the van and headed to the restaurant. The restaurant was empty with only the staff setting tables. Rachel and the boys looked around for Clive Davis and saw Calvin waving at them from the back so they walked to him. Next to him in the corner of the booth was Clive Davis. Rachel's heart was pounding when she saw him. This was the man that held her future in his hands, a very good future she might add. She had the urge to hug and thank him but she would save that part for later. \"Good morning guys,\" Clive greeted them, his voice deep and husky. The boys were looking at him like someone gave them a million bucks. \"G-good morning Mr. Davis,\" Jimmy stuttered out. They sat there for a minute in silence until Calvin said something. \"Let's get down to business.\" Everybody at the table nodded in agreement. \"So, we want to sign your band, but we have to get a lot of things out of the way before we can do anything,\" Clive said. They went over contracts and legal issues for a while and Rachel noticed that Clive was sort of leaving her out, and Mikey noticed too. \"Excuse me, but is Rachel going to be included in this deal?\" he asked. Clive and Calvin looked at each other and back at the group. Rachel's heart began to sink because she knew that this meeting had nothing to do with her. Clive looked at Rachel and said, \"Come on Rachel, let's talk outside while Calvin explains everything to them.\" He got up and Rachel followed him. Outside was calmer and Rachel began to relax a little. She still couldn't get over all of the street life that was going on in Vegas. She wouldn't mind living here for a while. Clive took her by her hand and they started walking. \"Rachel, how old is you?\" he asked. Rachel looked down at the ground. \"I'll be 17 this August,\" she answered. \"Have you finished school yet?\" Rachel shook her head. This talk was not going well. \"Where are you from?\" \"Los Angeles,\" she said. \"Why are you here?\" Rachel sighed and explained the whole situation that went down in LA. She expressed how she wanted to prove to someone that she could make it without any help. Clive listened carefully to her story, he found it a little difficult to not get lost in her voice, it was music to his ears. \"So, who do you want to prove yourself too?\" he asked. She shrugged her shoulder. \"I guess you,\" she said. Clive chuckled, \"You already proven yourself to me, but I sense that you aren't ready.\" \"I am ready,\" she argued. Clive smiled and shook his head. He stopped walking and looked into her eyes. \"Rachel, I would be lying if I told you that I didn't want to sign you, you have the most beautiful voice I have ever heard but I know that you aren't ready. So I am not going to sign you now, but I am going to make you a deal. Okay, are you listening to me?\" Rachel nodded. \"I want you to go home and move out of your parents' house, they will only hold you back; I want you to finish school, whether with a diploma or a GED; and I want you to prove to everyone meaning your parents, your sister, your boyfriend, and maybe the entire community that you are worthy, and that you will make it. When you are ready to do that last part, I want you to call me and I'll be there. Okay? Do we have deal?\" He held out his hand and Rachel shook it. \"We have a deal,\" she said. Clive smiled at her and said, \"Good now, let's say goodbye to the boys and I am going to take you home, okay?\" \"Alright.\" They went back to the restaurant and said goodbye to the guys. They all hugged Rachel and thanked her for helping them. While Rachel was gathering her things from her hotel room she called Frank to tell him that she was coming home and to be at her house in a couple of hours. He wanted to come and get her but she assured him that she had a ride. Rachel and Clive boarded his private jet and Rachel said her goodbye to Las Vegas. She had to go back home and face the music. After the plane ride, Clive called for a limousine and they rode to Rachel's house. Going through LA made her feel like she was gone for years instead of days. The feeling of home started to arise in her. When they finally pulled in front of her house Rachel was reluctant to get out of the car. \"Are you okay?\" Clive asked. Rachel exhaled. \"Define okay.\" Clive snickered at her, \"You'll be fine, kiddo, now let's go inside.\" Rachel got out first, then Clive and they walked to her door. Rachel squeezed her eyes shut and opened the door. Inside the house were her parents, Nikki, Frank and his parents, Mia and Andre. Clive made sure that the group didn't see him until they greeted Rachel. As soon as Rachel was inside she flung herself at Frank. He hugged her so tight that she felt like she was going to pop. \"I missed you, baby,\" she whispered in his ear. \"I missed you more, don't you ever scare me like that again, you hear me,\" he said. \"Hey, we want some love too!\" Andre bursted out. Him and Mia both attacked Rachel and Frank. Someone lost their footing and they all fell to the floor laughing. Frank got up and helped Rachel up while Mia helped Andre up. \"You guys are so goofy,\" Rachel said still laughing. She looked at Herb and Katherine and went over to hug them. \"Katherine, I have been in need of your cooking for the past few days,\" she said. Katherine giggled a little. \"Good because this Sunday I am making you a giant dinner,\" Katherine said. The moment was ruined when Fletcher cleared his throat. \"Rachel, do you know how worried we were, you think you were going to prove something by running away, but you didn't. We were right, you don't have what it takes to make it to the top,\" Alison chided. Any other time, Rachel would have been fuming but all she did was smile. \"I did prove something, I proved myself to someone bigger then you and he knows I can make it,\" she said calmly. Fletcher snorted, \"Who?\" That was when Clive decided to make his presence known. He walked into the house and stood beside Rachel. Everyone's eye grew and Alison's mouth hung. \"Hi, I'm Clive Davis, founder of Arista Records,\" he acquainted. After the shock wore off Fletcher said, \"Oh my God, Clive Davis, it is an honor to be in your presence.\" He stuck his hand out to shake Clive's hand but Clive didn't accept it. \"I bet it is,\" Rachel mumbled. It was low but Clive could hear it and nudged her with his elbow. \"I am here to make sure Rachel got home safely and to explain a few things,\" he said. Everyone in the room was quiet and waited for him to continue. \"First, I heard Rachel sing and she has an amazing voice and I would like to keep it that way so I want her to do those exercises we talked about on the plane. Also, when she finishes high school and turns 18, I am going to sign her that very day. Lastly, Rachel will be moving out of this house.\" \"Hold on, Rachel is not going anywhere, she is my child,\" Alison argued. \"Do you want me to sue for custody? Because for what Rachel told me you have neglected her for most of her life. And you left her here while you were in Atlanta for months. I'm sure a judge would love to hear about that. Rachel does not need to be in this type of environment where she is left alone even in a crowded room.\" \"Well, she has nowhere else to go,\" Fletcher said smugly. \"She always can stay with me and my family, I will sleep on the couch and she can have my room,\" Frank added. He stood on the other side of Rachel and held her hand. Andre stood next to Frank and said, \"Rachel is my baby sister, she can stay with me forever if she wants.\" \"Yeah, me too,\" Mia said. You could feel the tension in the air growing thicker. It was clear that they were Rachel's family now, and Fletcher and Alison couldn't say anything about it. \"Well, if that's what you really want Rachel, then leave,\" Alison said coldly. Rachel couldn't deny the pain she was feeling, being shunned by her parents but this was the way it had to be. Her, Frank, Andre and Mia went to Rachel's room and helped her pack up her. She only took the essentials like her clothes, toiletries and jewelry and the music sheets she had hid under her mattress. When it was time to go Rachel quickly gave Nikki a hug. She was going to miss her the most. Everyone walked out of the door without acknowledging Alison and Fletcher. Rachel had decided that she was going to stay with Andre, since he was the only one with a two bedroom. Frank was going to stay the night since Andre had the nightshift at his job at a gas station. After helping her unpack and assemble her bed, Frank left to his house to get his overnight bag. While he was gone Rachel set up her room for him. She had placed incenses and candles in a couple places. She quickly showered and changed. Tonight was the night that she wanted to give herself to Frank. She had time to evaluate their relationship in Vegas and she knew what her and Frank had was going to be forever. With not seeing him for those few days and missing him made her realize that she wanted him… bad. When he came back Andre had let him in as he was going out. Andre knew what Rachel had planned, of course she would discuss this with her best friend, so he smiled at Frank and said, \"Have fun.\" Frank could only imagine what he meant but he didn't give it much thought. He knocked on Rachel's closed door and announced himself. \"Rachel it's me,\" he said. Rachel took a deep breathe, prayed that nothing would go wrong and said, \"Come in.\" Frank walked in and the sight before him made his jaw dropped and his bag. Rachel was standing in the middle of the room with only her purple lace bra and panties on. The only light in the room was coming from candles and it captured her silhouette perfectly. Her hair was just the way he liked it, wild and natural and she had on a pair of stilettos that made her legs look even longer than they already were. Needless to say, she looked sexy and Frank could feel his blood travel to his southern region. \"Hey baby,\" Rachel said seductively. Her eyes had a mischievous look in them. Frank had no idea what he was feeling but he liked it. \"W-what are you doing?\" he stuttered, as much as he wanted to stare at her some more, his eyes when to the ground. Rachel slowly walked to him and gripped his belt buckle. \"I'm seducing you Frank,\" she whispered in his ear. She leaned in and kissed him, hard and deeply. Frank tried to fight his hormones but fail miserably when he felt her tongue enter his mouth. He grabbed her by the waist and kissed her with everything he had. His hand went to from her back down to her bottom. 'She's so soft,' he thought. He didn't realize that she had taken his shirt off but his brain finally clicked when she started undoing his pants. He released her lips and pushed her away. \"Rachel, what are we doing?\" he asked, breathing heavily. Rachel let out a frustrated sigh and said, \"Frank, I love you, and I want you now.\" Frank kept trying to stay in control but the fact that she was standing in front of him half naked wasn't helping. He wanted her but he didn't want her to do anything she would regret later. \"Rachel, are you sure? I don't want you to do this if you really aren't ready.\" He expected her to back down but she did the exact opposite. She jumped on him and wrapped her legs around his waist. \"I am ready baby, I'm not going to regret anything, but,\" her eyes fell, \"If you don't want to I'm not going to force you, I mean this is your first time too.\" Frank, still trying to think straight, finally gave in. He reached in his pocket and said, \"I'm glad I brought this then.\" He was holding a condom in his hand. She smiled at him and they resumed kissing as Frank moved to the bed. Not breaking the kiss he slid his pants down and pushed them out the way but left his boxers on. He reached behind Rachel to unhook her bra as his lips moved to her neck. It took him a minute but he got her bra off and he marveled at her naked chest. Frank looked at Rachel and she look as if she was embarrassed. She moved her arms to cover her breasts but Frank immediately pried them away and pinned her arms to her side. \"Don't ever hide yourself from me,\" he said roughly. He released her hands and stared at her breasts some more. They looked so mouthwatering to him. 'Oh why the hell not?' he thought. He began to kissing and sucking on her right breast while her played with and massaged the other one. Rachel gasped when she felt his wet mouth on her chest. The things her body was feeling were so foreign to her but it felt so good. Frank's tongue swirled and licked around her hard nipples like they were lollipops. Hearing her soft moans made him wonder if he could get a better reaction out of her. Oh yeah, he was going to try some things tonight. He started moving down her body and paused when he got to the hem of her panties. He looked at her for approval and she nodded for him to continue. He slowly peeled off her undies, making her completely naked in front of him. \"So beautiful,\" he gaped at her glistening lips. 'And all mine,' he thought. He placed her legs on his shoulders and started kissing her inner thigh. \"W-what are you doing?\" Rachel asked. Frank gave her a flirtatious smirk before plunging his tongue into her folds. Rachel literally shot off of the bed with a loud shriek. Frank knew it was a good idea to hold her hips down. He continued to eat her like he hadn't ate in days. She wondered how he was so good at this if he never done it before. It didn't take long before the coil in her stomach started tightening. She tried to move his head away from her but he remained where he was. \"Frank… please stop, it's too much,\" Rachel whimpered. This only made his enter his index finger inside of her and curl it. Rachel couldn't take it anymore. Her legs started shaking and she thought she was seeing stars. \"Frank!\" she hollered as she crumbled around his finger. The feeling of her first orgasm scared her but her brain was so mushy that she didn't linger on the thought for too long. While she was coming down, Frank took off his boxers and rolled the condom on and aligned himself between her legs. Rachel finally calmed down and looked him in the eyes. \"Rachel, this is going to hurt. If you want me to stop at any time you have to tell me,\" he said sternly. \"Okay,\" Rachel said. Frank placed his head in the nook of her neck and slid the tip in. He felt Rachel tense up. \"Just relax,\" he whispered. When he felt her body breaking down he slid in as slowly as possible. He stopped when he felt a barrier in his tracks. \"I love you,\" he said to her and promptly pushed pass her barrier. He let of a sigh of pleasure as her warm tightness enveloped him while Rachel let out a small cry. He connected his forehead with hers and kissed the tears from her eyes. \"It over baby, it's over,\" he said. He didn't want to start moving until her pain had dissolved but he couldn't help it. He slowly started thrusting inside of her carefully. He really wanted to hold on but she felt so good that he couldn't take it anymore. After a few thrust he groaned as he release his self into the condom. He kissed her cheek then her lips. Frank laid down next to her, removed the condom and threw it away in the waste basket next to her bed. Rachel adjusted herself so she could lie on his chest. \"I'm sorry I hurt you, baby,\" Frank said. Rachel looked up at him and smiled. \"It's okay baby, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be,\" she assured him. That made Frank smile. He wrapped his arms around her and they both fell asleep smiling. Sooooooooooo... how was it?

Just Came To Party When Rachel woke up she felt around her bed for Frank but he wasn't there. She instantly got up confused and a bit worried. She got out of her bed and realized that she completely naked. She wrapped her robe around herself and shuffled to the kitchen. She was still sore between her thighs but it didn't really bother her that much. When she opened her bedroom door, the smell of bacon filled her nostrils. As she got closer she heard Frank singing Ray Charles' I Got a Woman. Rachel slowly snuck up behind him and held him at his waist. \"Good morning,\" she said. Frank turned around and kissed her forehead. \"Good morning honey, how'd you sleep?\" he asked sweetly. \"Like a baby, how about you?\" \"I didn't sleep at all; I was too busy watching you. You are so beautiful when you are asleep,\" he leaned in to kiss her but she backed away. \"What about when I'm awake?\" she asked with her hands on her hips. \"You're gorgeous when you are awake, even with crust in your eyes,\" Frank laughed. Rachel gasped and ran to the bathroom to watch her face and brush her teeth. When she got back Frank had set two plates on the table and they ate their breakfast. While eating Rachel noticed Frank's silence and saw that his face looked a little blank. \"What's wrong baby?\" she asked. Frank looked at her but didn't say anything; he just looked her up and down. \"Frank, what's that matter?\" Frank sighed. \"On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did it hurt?\" he asked. Rachel was a little taken back by his question. \"I just want to know so next time I can try and be more gentle,\" he explained. Rachel thought for a minute and said, \"I think next time it won't hurt as bad.\" \"So I did hurt you a lot,\" Frank said and covered his face with his hands. Rachel tried to move his hands but he wouldn't let her so she got out of her chair and sat on his lap. \"Frank,\" she said softly, \"You really need to stop stressing so hard, it was going to hurt whether I did it with you or somebody else.\" She felt him tense up a little with she said somebody else. \"Baby if it makes you feel better, that thing you did with your tongue was very nice, like amazing. I am still trying to figure out how you did it so well,\" she said. Frank couldn't help but start laughing at her. \"I'll do it again if you want me too,\" he said moving his hands. Rachel giggled and moved to get of his lap but he held her at her waist. \"I'm serious, just say the word and I'll do it until you beg me to stop,\" he said. He started kissing and nibbling of her neck making her giggle some more. Before it could get any more heated Andre walked in the front door and burst their bubble. \"Ah sookie sookie now,\" he said. Rachel and Frank groaned and Rachel got up from Frank's lap. \"Morning Andre,\" Frank said. \"Good morning stallion,\" Andre replied with a wink, \"You two can just forget I'm here I'm going to a nap before the party tonight.\" \"What party?\" Rachel asked. \"This girl is throwing a party and we are going so don't argue with me,\" He walked into his room and closed the door before Frank or Rachel could say anything. \"Do you want to go?\" Frank asked Rachel. \"I want to spend the day with you babe, I missed you so much while I was gone, I don't want to share you with other people,\" she said. \"I missed you too but I don't think we can argue with Andre, let's just go and get out of the house for a couple hours,\" he said. Rachel sighed. \"Okay, I guess we could go, but I got shower first,\" she got up and ran to the bathroom before Frank could even argue. After everybody was dressed they all left to go to the party. When they got there you could smell the weed coming from the house and the music was deafening. Inside the house, there were a lot of people there dancing and drinking; most of them were from the school. The gang was soon greeted by the host. She was immediately recognized by Rachel, it was Toni. She tightened her grip on Frank's hand and he knew that Rachel was uncomfortable. \"Hello hello, welcome to my abode,\" Toni said, she looked at Frank and shifted her face into something that was supposed to be seductive, \"I'm so glad you could come.\" Andre saw the way she was looking at Frank and cut in. \"Thanks for the invite, come on honey, show me around,\" he said. Toni looked at Frank some more before taking Andre's hand. When they were out of sight Rachel turned to Frank and put her hands on her hips. \"What was that?\" she asked. \"I have no idea,\" Frank said, he really didn't. \"Good, and you better not get any ideas either,\" she said. Frank smile at her. \"Yes, honey.\" Frank and Rachel couldn't deny that the party was fun, they danced until their feet hurt and sat down. \"Baby,\" Rachel said, \"Can you get me some water, and make sure the cap is sealed.\" Frank nodded and got up and walked to the cooler. While he was getting the drink somebody came up to him. \"Hey handsome, you having fun?\" Toni asked. Frank backed away from her slightly. \"Yeah, it's a nice party,\" he said. Toni looked at the drink in his hand and frowned. \"You know I got liquor, put that water down,\" she said. Frank shook his head, \"This is for Rachel and I don't drink.\" \"Oh,\" she said, \"So you do everything your girl tells you to do? If you were mine, we would have a lot of fun.\" She stepped closer towards him making him back away more. \"Well, I'm not, nor will I ever be yours,\" he tried to walk away but she blocked him. \"Oh baby, don't be like that,\" almost in a blur she planted her lips on his. Frank immediately pushed her away but not before Rachel saw the whole thing. Frank looked and saw her and stepped towards her. \"Rachel this isn't-\" Rachel backed away, \"Don't touch me.\" Tears started coming down her face. The sight she had seen made her sick to her stomach. She ran away before Frank could stop her. He ran after her all the way out the house. \"Rachel, it's not what you think,\" he yelled after her. Rachel kept running until she knew he didn't know where she was and started to walk home. Frank went back in the house and got Andre. \"Andre, come on we got to go,\" he said pulling him away from the crowd. \"Why? What's the matter?\" he asked, \"Where's Rachel?\" \"She saw me kissing Toni and ran out.\" Andre stopped, \"You did what!\" \"She cornered me while I was getting Rachel some water and kissed me and Rachel saw and ran out before I could explain,\" Frank said. \"Well, she is probably going home, come on I'll drive,\" Andre said. Meanwhile, Rachel finally got how by taking the back roads home. She quickly undressed and crawled into her bed and cried in to her pillow. ' How could he do that?' She thought, ' After last night how could he just kiss her?\" She cried until she started to drift off into sleep. Not even 5 minutes after she fell asleep she awoke to the sound of the front door slamming. \"Rachel, honey, you here?\" she heard Andre say. She stayed quiet. Andre knocked on her door. \"Rachel, I know you're not sleep, open the door,\" he said. \"Go away,\" she yelled. \"Rachel, baby, just give me a chance to explain,\" this time it was Frank. Becoming angry all over again from hearing his voice, she got out of her bed and yanked the door open and faced him. \"Okay then explain,\" she snapped at him. Frank looked at Andre and back at Rachel. \"Can I come in and explain?\" he asked. \"No, you are not allowed in my room until you tell me why you were kissing that nasty bitch,\" she said with venom in her voice. Frank gave up and said, \"Baby, she cornered me. I went to get your water and she started talking to me and saying things like if I was hers ya-da ya-da, and I told her that I would never be hers and when I tried to walk away she kissed me and that's what happened. I pushed her off of me and that's when I saw you. Rachel I would never do something like that to you, especially after last night, I love you, I want to be with you and only you.\" Rachel stared at him for a minute, try to see if she believed him or not. She looked into his eyes and could automatically tell that he was telling the truth. \"After you brush your teeth thoroughly, you can come to bed,\" she said. Frank smiled at her and move in to kiss her but she pushed him away. \"And you are not allowed to kiss me until tomorrow, now go brush your teeth before I change my mind.\" Frank laughed at her and said, \"Yeah ma'am,\" and went to the bathroom to scrub his teeth. Sooo, how'd you like it? Or hate it? Tell me in the reviews and I'll see you soon...hey that rhymed.[Chapter 22] The Talk In the morning, Rachel was the first one awake. Frank had his arm around her and was snoring into her ear. She poked him. \"Frank,\" she said. He didn't move. \"Frank, wake up,\" she tried again. This time he stirred a little and pulled her closer to her, still snoring. Rachel let out an annoyed sigh. She noticed that a certain part of Frank's body was poking her lower back. She then thought of something she had wanted to do for a while. 'I can't believe I'm doing this,\" She thought. She carefully moved to her other side to face Frank and slowly reached her hand into his pants and grabbed him gently. She was so nervous that she could hear her heart pounding. She began moving her hand up and down. After a few strokes Frank's body began to react and move his hips to the rhythm of her hand he started letting out soft groans. Rachel had to admit, the face he was making turned her on. When Frank realized this was not a dream he opened his eyes to see Rachel looking straight at him. \"Rachel,\" he groaned, his voice was crackled. Rachel smiled at him and quickened the pace of her hand. Soon Frank's eye started to roll to the back of his head and let out a load groan as his release hit him. Rachel removed her hand from his pants and wipe the off with some wipes she kept by her bed. She looked at Frank with a cocky smile on her face. He was looking at her with an animalistic look on his face. He leaned in and kissed her. It was far from gentle but was more passionate and possessive. Frank adjusted his body so that he was on top of her in between her legs. Rachel's was enjoying every minute of this make out session but she wanted more. She grabbed Frank by his hair and whispered in his ear, \"I want you, now.\" Before Rachel could blink Frank removed every piece of clothing on her body and removed his. He knew Rachel was ready without any foreplay. He slowly entered Rachel and stayed still until her discomfort went away. Rachel took the time to feel everything she didn't on their first time. When she got used to it she realized that it felt really good and moved her hips. Frank wrapped his arms around her and began his rhythm. The more he pumped, the more sounds of pleasure Rachel made. Rachel felt the coil in her belly start to tighten and Frank felt it too. \"Harder,\" Rachel whimpered into his ear. He began thrusting into her a bit harder. Rachel was feeling a bit embarrassed by the sounds she was making but she really couldn't help it. Finally, Rachel climaxed, hard. White dotted had blurred her vison, her body stilled and she couldn't make another sound. Frank soon followed and let go a growl-like sound. He collapsed next to her and kissed her cheek. Rachel was still buzzed from her orgasm; she didn't look at him or even move, she just stared into space. Frank was also in La-La Land but then his buzz crashed. He realized they didn't use a condom. He was about to panic but he remembered that Rachel was on birth control. Then he thought about the mess he made. He reached over Rachel, who was still buzzing, and grabbed the wipes to clean her off. As soon as he touched her, her body jerked and she reached and grabbed his hand. \"Don't do that,\" she said. She was more pleading than asking. \"But Rachel isn't it uncomfortable?\" he asked. Rachel's grip became stronger. \"It's just very sensitive, just don't touch me down there,\" she said. Frank nodded and went back to the top of the bed and wrapped his arms around her. \"I love you,\" he said. Rachel snuggled up against him. \"I love you too.\" And they both fell back to sleep. It was about an hour later when Frank woke up again and got out of the bed. He shuffled to the bathroom and took a shower. When he looked through his bag he saw that he had one more pair of boxer left. He knew he would have to go home and get some more but he did want to leave Rachel. 'I'll just wait for her to wake up and we'll go together,\" he thought. After he got dressed he walked to the living room and saw Andre sitting on the couch drinking coffee and watching Sesame Street. \"Hey Andre,\" he said, sitting next to him. Andre smirked at him. \"Hey lover boy, did you have a nice morning?\" Frank's face turned red. \"Yeah, I heard you guys. 'Oh Frank that feels so good,'\" he said mimicking Rachel's voice. Frank hit him in the arm. \"Be quiet before she hears you,\" he said. Andre just laughed at him and took another sip of his coffee. Soon Rachel woke up and got dressed and joined the two on the couch. \"Good morning,\" she said cuddling up to Frank. Andre looked at Frank who was giving him a warning glare. \"Good morning Chelly,\" he said, snickering. Rachel looked at him confused. \"What's so funny?\" she asked. \"Nothing, Andre is just being Andre,\" Frank said, \"Anyways, we have to stop by my house in a minute.\" \"Why?\" she asked. \"I need some more clothes.\" \"It's not like you need them,\" Andre muttered. Frank shot him another glare. \"Alright let's go, I want to see Katy anyway. Andre you want to ride with us?\" Rachel asked. Andre thought a little. \"Yeah sure I'll go. Mainly because Frank's dad is a hunk,\" he said. Frank threw a pillow at him and hit him in the head. \"Okay boys, stop fighting. Now Andre, you know you will have to get though Katherine first so don't even try anything,\" Rachel said. \"Come on lovebirds.\" \"Mom, I'm home,\" Frank yelled when they got to his house, \"And I brought people.\" They found Katherine and Herb in the kitchen. \"Hey kids,\" Herb said. \"Good morning, are you guys hungry, I was just making us some breakfast,\" Katherine said. Andre was the first to raise his hand, \"I'm starving.\" Katherine smiled at him. \"How about you two?\" she asked Rachel and Frank. \"Katy, I'll eat whatever you cook,\" Rachel said. \"I'm not hungry,\" Frank said; he sat next to his dad who was looking at him suspiciously. \"Frank you okay?\" Herb asked. \"Yeah I'm fine, why you ask?\" Herb looked at Frank up and down, \"You just seem very relaxed, you aren't high are you?\" Frank laughed at Herb, \"Yes dad I just snorted a whole key of coke before I got here.\" Herb started laughing too. \"Don't get smart boy,\" he said. Andre, Rachel and Katherine brought the food to the table, ending the conversation. After breakfast, Andre and Rachel washed the dishes while Katherine sat in the living room reading a book. Frank came up behind Rachel and held her at her waist. \"Frank let go of me, your parents are in the living room.\" \"Give me a kiss and I'll leave you alone,\" he said. Rachel gave him a quick peck on his lips and said, \"There, now go.\" Frank chuckled and turned around to see his dad. \"Frank you having problems with the truck?\" Herb asked, \"I heard you guys coming a mile away.\" \"Yeah, it's needs a tune up,\" Frank said. \"Come on let's go check it out.\" Herb walked out to the parking lot and Frank followed. He popped the hood and started looking around. \"So, how are you feeling?\" Herb asked. \"I'm good.\" \"Pass me a wrench; and how is Rachel?\" Frank passed him a wrench. \"She's good, she's happy to be home.\" \"Hm,\" was all Herb said; after they were silent for a minute. \"I have to get an oil change sometime this week,\" Frank said. \"Yeah, I'll call my guy and tell him to expect you, maybe he can do something about that sound because I can't seem to figure it out,\" Herb handed him back the wrench and closed the hood. Frank went to go put the wrench in the toolbox when he heard his father ask, \"So how long have you and Rachel been having sex?\" Frank immediately stop and accidently dropped the wrench and turned to face his dad. He could feel his face turning red. \"How'd you know?\" he asked nervously. Herb chuckled. \"Because, you are my son and you are like me. I had that same goofy look after my first time.\" Frank hung his head, not wanting to look his father in the eyes. \"Frank, I'm not mad at you, sex is natural; I just want to give you some advice,\" Herb said. Frank nodded. \"First, I want to tell you that you have to be careful. Always wear a condom no matter what.\" Frank's face turned even redder from the thought of what happened earlier that morning. \"Second, don't let it dictate your relationship. And lastly, don't ever pressure her into anything. I get that you are young and you want to experiment and everything but women will not always be comfortable with every idea you have. Do you understand me?\" Frank quickly nodded. \"Good, let's go back inside, it's hot out here.\" They walked in as soon as Katherine had hung up the phone and let out a loud groan. \"Katy, what's the matter?\" Herb asked. \"Your mother is coming to visit us,\" she said agitatedly. Now, you don't know what I know and I'm not going to tell you that Frank's grandmother visit is going to be huge...oops. Review. Review. Review.[Chapter 23] 6 months since I last updated... You have the right to kill me. Honestly I feel like people aren't really feeling this story anymore, that doesn't mean I'm ending it because because it is Frachel for life over her but I have been so busy with things like school and emotions. I want to say this summer will be and update spam but I have a summer job and that is probably going to take up my time. I will still try so bare with me. Anyways, I left off on Katherine saying that Herb's mom is coming to town. Trust me...this woman is a piece of work. See you at the bottom. Color \"What do you mean my mother is coming to visit?\" Herb asked. \"You know the woman that gave birth to you? Yeah, she just called and started saying she wanted to see Frank and she started say it was my fault that Frank hates her-\" \"Wait I don't hate her,\" Frank cut her off. \"Well that's what she thinks and I tried to explain to her that Frank doesn't hate her and he would love to see her so then she just said that she will be here on Monday and she is staying for a week. A week, Herb! I can't handle your mother for a whole week, Herb; I'll end up in a mental institution!\" Katherine hollered. Her face was turning red as a tomato. \"Um, should we go?\" Rachel said awkwardly stand to the side with Andre, both of them looking a tad frightened; they never seen Katherine so angry. \"No,\" Katherine snapped then she took a deep breath and said softer,\" No Rachel, you don't have to go, I'm just overwhelmed, I'm sorry honey.\" \"We'll just go in my room while you guys talk, come on,\" Frank said and took Rachel's hand and lead her to his room with Andre following them. Inside Frank's room Andre sat in the desk chair while Frank and Rachel sat on his bed. \"What's the big deal about your grandmother coming over?\" Rachel asked. Frank sighed. \"It's complicated. Grandma Belle is brutally honest. She always speaks her mind. And she doesn't like my mom at all.\" \"Why not? Katherine is an angel,\" said Andre. \"She thinks my mom trapped my dad into marriage. You see, my mom was pregnant with me when they got married so Grandma Belle thinks my mom got pregnant on purpose even though they found out I was coming after they got engaged. My dad is an only child so she smothers him and after I was born we moved from North Carolina to Oregon. Grandma Belle thinks my mother made my dad move just to spite her.\" \"Wow, that's messed up,\" Andre said. \"Yeah, I feel bad for Katy,\" said Rachel. \"Yeah, my mom tries to be civil but Grandma Belle always finds the wrong in everything my mom does. My dad and I just sit in the background,\" Frank said. Hearing all of this made Rachel nervous. \"So is there a possibility she isn't going to like me?\" she asked. \"That's another thing,\" Frank paused, this was uncomfortable for him to say, \"Grandma Belle isn't really… fond of people like you.\" \"What do you mean 'people like me'?\" she asked. Frank ran his hand through his hair nervously; he knew exactly how Rachel was going to take this. \"I mean, Grandma Belle is… she is a racist. She won't like you because you are black.\" Both Andre and Rachel's eyes widened. \"Are you serious?!\" Rachel erupted. Frank could see in her eyes the anger she was feeling and tried to handle it the best way he could. \"Rachel calm down, she is an 82 year old from North Carolina what did you expect?\" Frank said. \"I sure as hell didn't expect you to say that , oh my God!\" Rachel stood up and started pacing through Frank's room. \"I'm sorry, it's- I don't know what you want me to do,\" Frank said. Rachel stopped pacing and looked at him with her arms folded. \"Well how do you feel about it?\" she asked. \"Feel about what?\" Frank asked. \"About me being black?\" Rachel said. Andre, who had stayed silent, immediately got up. \"Um, I think I'm going to go to the bathroom,\" he said and quickly left the room before it got ugly. \"Well?\" Rachel questioned impatiently. Naturally Frank should be nervous about this situation but he wasn't. He calmly reached out and pulled Rachel toward him. She fought him but he was stronger than her so she was force to give up and sit on his lap but she wouldn't look at him until he answered her question. \"Rachel, look at me,\" he said smoothly. Rachel didn't budge. \"Rachel I'm not going to talk to you if you are acting like you are mad at me.\" \"Maybe I am mad at you,\" she snapped at him. \"Why would you be mad at me?\" he asked softly stroking her hair. Rachel knew what Frank was trying to do and it was working but she wouldn't let him know that. \"You won't answer my question,\" she said. Frank buried his face in the crook of her neck making Rachel squirm. Frank knew she wasn't mad anymore so he talked freely. \"Baby, I really don't think I have to answer that question because I don't care if you are black, it doesn't matter to me. You can be green and I'll still love you. Does that make you feel better?\" \"I mean, I guess I already knew but has me being black ever been a problem for you?\" Rachel asked. \"No, you are perfect,\" he said. \"Not to your grandmother, I won't be,\" Rachel said. \"Rachel, I love my grandmother, I truly do, but I couldn't care less about what she thinks, you are my girlfriend and eventually you are going to be my wife so she is going to have to get used to you,\" he said. Rachel smiled at the thought of being married to Frank; it's something that she really hoped for. She looked into his eyes and she could see the future she dreamed of. She laid her head on his shoulder and planted a kiss on his neck. \"I love you Frank Farmer,\" she whispered in his ear. \"I love you Rachel Marron, I always will no matter who doesn't like,\" he kissed her cheek. Interrupting Frank and Rachel's moment Andre walked back in with more food. \"You guys just can't get enough of each other, can you?\" He said laughing. Frank glared at him and said, \"And you can't stop eating my food, can you?\" Andre kept laughing and sat back in his seat. \"Frank, your mom wants to talk to you,\" Andre said. Frank groaned and held on to Rachel tighter. \"Go on Frank,\" she released herself and stood up, \"Your mom needs you.\" Frank left his room leaving Andre and Rachel. Downstairs Katherine was already tidying up the house and rearranging furniture. \"Um, Mom, Andre said you wanted to see me,\" he said carefully. He knew that her nerves were bad and pushing the wrong button wouldn't make anything better. \"Frank, do you mind staying home for the time that your grandmother is here? I know you want to hang out with Rachel but I really want you to be here,\" Katherine explained. \"No, I don't mind, I wouldn't dare leave you here alone with her while Dad is at work anyways.\" Katherine smiled and let out a sigh. \"Are you going to let her meet Rachel?\" she asked. \"I don't know; you know how Grandma Belle is and Rachel has been through enough already, you know with her parents and everything. I just don't want to overwhelm her,\" he said. Katherine nodded in understanding. \"Well, she is still always welcome whether your grandmother likes it or not.\" \"Well, do you need anything right now because I had plans with Rachel; we are going to window shop in Beverly Hills,\" Frank asked. Katherine shook her head. \"No go have fun, I'm just going to tidy up and maybe make myself a stiff drink or two.\" Frank laughed and headed back upstairs. He knew this week with his grandmother was going to be tough. So how was it? Did you like it? Did you love it? Review, review, review. Review three times a day please! I love reviews so much, they make me tingle. See you next update.[Chapter 24] Well, before you read this chapter please be aware that a very, very offensive word is said. If you don't like hearing bad words PM me and I'll give you a breakdown on what happened. Enjoy the chapter. Smooches! Guess Who Made Dinner It was the morning Grandma Belle was coming and Frank and Rachel were still in bed. Neither of them was happy that Frank couldn't spend the night anymore, especially since they were as active they were. Lately they were like rabbits and couldn't keep their hands off of each other but this morning Frank had to leave and Rachel was still asleep and it was almost noon. Belle's flight was supposed to get in at 1:30pm and Herb was coming to get Frank any minute. Frank got out of bed slowly so he wouldn't wake Rachel and took a shower. When he got out and got dress he woke Rachel up. \"Rachel, come on, it's time to get up,\" he shook her softly. She didn't budge. \"Rachel, baby, wake up.\" Rachel's eyes slowly opened and quickly shut them in agony. \"Can you please turn the light off?\" she asked covering her eyes. Frank shut off the lamp next to her bed. \"Are you okay?\" he asked. Rachel shook her head. \"My head is killing me; can you go see if we have any painkillers?\" Frank got up and went into the kitchen and was greeted by Andre. \"Hey lover boy,\" Andre said. \"Hey Andre, do you have painkillers? Rachel has a headache.\" \"In the kitchen.\" Frank grabbed Rachel two painkillers and poured her a glass of water. When he went back into her room she wasn't there. He set the items on her nightstand and walked out of her room. When he was about to check to see if she was in the living room, he heard an awful sound coming from the bathroom. He opened the door and found Rachel on her knees throwing up into the toilet and it didn't sound pretty. \"Rachel?\" \"Go away *blech* I don't want you to see me like this *blech*.\" Frank left the bathroom and went back into her room and waited on her bed. After about 5 minutes, Rachel finally came out of the bathroom. \"Are you feeling better?\" Frank asked. \"Yeah, I think it was that fish we had last night,\" she said. Frank felt her forehead. \"Well you don't have a fever, maybe you should just rest for today and I'll try to sneak out later so I can take care of you,\" Frank suggested. Rachel shook her head. \"No, your mom needs you, I'll be fine. Me and Andre might come by later. We might as well meet her now just to get it over with.\" \"Yeah, you're right.\" They both heard a car honk, which means it was time for Frank to leave. \"I love you,\" he said, kissing her on her forehead. \"I love you too, now go see your grandma.\" When he was out of the room, she went back into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. She didn't tell Frank but her body was aching so bad that it hurt to even move her neck. 'Food poison is a bitch,' she thought. …. Frank and Herb were inside the airport waiting for Belle to arrive. The arrival list said her plane had landed so she should be walking up any minute. \"Dad, do you think this is going to be a pleasant visit?\" Frank asked. \"Dear God I hope so,\" Herb said. He looked into the crowd once again and finally saw who he was looking for. \"Ma!\" he shouted and hurried over to a little woman in a knitted red shawl and a wooden cane. \"Oh Lord look at my handsome baby boy and my handsome grandson,\" the old woman said with delight in her voice. \"Hi, Grandma Belle,\" Frank greeted her. Belle frowned at him. \"It's been 2 years since we have seen each other and all I get is a 'hi'? I want a hug.\" She wrapped her arms around him and hugged him tightly. When she backed away, she frowned some more. \"You are so thin, your mother not feeding you?\" ' And it starts,\" Frank thought. \"Ma, you promised you'd be nice,\" Herb reminded her. \"I know, but it was an honest question. Don't worry Frankie, Grandma is going to cook you a big meal tonight. Herb get my bags, I want to start cooking as soon as we get to the house,\" she grabbed Frank by his elbow and he walked her to the car. When they arrived at the house Katherine had the house spotless and lunch on the table. When she saw Isabelle she smiled at her sweetly. \"Belle, it's so good to see you,\" Katherine said. Belle chuckled humorlessly. \"Katherine, don't lie to me. And did you even try to straighten up for my arrival, this place is a pigsty,\" Belle criticized. Katherine kept the smile on her face but she couldn't stop her face from turning a hint of red. \"Are you hungry? I have some leftovers from last night on the table,\" Katherine said. \"That sounds like a great idea, it's good to eat now before Andre comes over and cleans us out,\" Herb said. \"Who is Andre?\" Belle asked. \"He's my friend with an appetite of an ogre,\" Frank said jokingly. Isabelle smiled, \"I'm glad you have a friend. Is he going to be here for dinner?\" \"He might,\" Frank said. \"Well there won't be a dinner if I don't start now. Katherine make yourself useful and show me to the kitchen,\" Belle said. \"Don't you want to rest for a minute, Ma?\" Herb asked. \"I will rest when I'm dead but right now I am making my boys something to eat so Katherine where is the kitchen?\" Katherine lead her to the kitchen and was kicked out. ….. After a few hours Belle had made fried chicken, fried okra, mashed potatoes, mustard greens and smothered pork chops. \"Grandma, this is so good,\" Frank said chopping into a drumstick. \"Well that's because you haven't had any real food in years, I saw all of that salad in the refrigerator, that is no food for a Farmer man,\" Isabelle said. Suddenly the family heard knocking on the door. Frank knew immediately who it was. \"Hello? Are there any Farmers in here? Me is hungry!\" Andre yelled knocking on the door. \"Stop yelling you big oof,\" Rachel said. Frank rolled his eyes and went to open the door. \"Andre, you should yell louder I don't think they heard you in Africa,\" Frank scolded. \"Hey lover boy where is Katy? We bought her something while we were shopping,\" he asked. \"We are all in the dining room, my grandmother made dinner-\" Before Frank could finish Andre pushed the bag towards Frank and fled to the kitchen. \"He seems extra flamboyant today, is he high?\" Frank laughed. \"No,\" Rachel said, \"He got this guy's number today so he is smelling himself right now. How is Granny Belle?\" \"She is being quite nice, only made 5 insults in two hours; I think you came at the right time. Come on,\" Frank held out his hand and Rachel grabbed it nervously. When they walked into the room Belle was smiling at a joke that Herb had told. \"Um, Grandma Belle?\" She looked in Frank's direction and her smile dissolved into a tight glare. \"Who are you?\" Belle asked Rachel, venomously. \"Hi, I'm Rachel, Rachel Marron,\" Rachel smiled nervously, \"I'm Frank's girlfriend.\" The room was quiet. The look on Belle's face was pure disgust. Frank knew that what ever kindest Belle had went right out of the window. Belle looked at Herb and said to him harshly, \"I thought I raised you better than this. You know better than to let niggers into your house, Herb.\" I told you. The subject in the next few chapters in very relevant right now. Have you guys heard about the Charleston thing? Right now this story is dedicated to the people in Charleston. Anyway, you know the drill. Tell me how you like it, tell me how you love but don't tell me how you hate it because that's hurts. Smooches![Chapter 25] All I have to say is...It's about to go down. Tense Encounters Everybody's jaws dropped. Frank was red with anger. 'How dare she?' he thought. Rachel's stomach churned like it did that morning. \"Ma, this is my home and I will have to ask you to reframe from using that language in my home; Rachel and Andre are family and you will not call them anything other than their names,\" Herb said sternly. If looks could kill Herb would be dead. \"I don't know who you think you are talking to Herb but they are not family they are the help. Their kind belongs in the kitchen not at the dinner table,\" Belle said menacingly. \"Isabelle, can you please try and get to know them before judging them? We were having a nice dinner why does that have to change?\" Katherine asked. \"Because of that thing clutching onto my grandson's hand!\" Belle exclaimed and she looked at Rachel, \"As long as I'm here, you are not allowed in this house, now leave.\" Rachel tried to leave but Frank wouldn't let go of her hand. \"Don't talk to her like that, you don't even know her,\" Frank said fiercely. \"Frank,\" Rachel said softly, \"I'll just go, I don't want to start any problems.\" \"No, Rachel don't leave,\" Herb said, \"Ma, you are out of line, apologize to Rachel.\" Isabelle looked at her son shocked. \"I am your mother-\" \"And I love you but this is my house and Rachel and Andre allowed here anytime, now apologize,\" Herb said. Isabelle face turned redder and the snarl on her face grew more vicious. \"I'm do not have to take this, I'm going to sleep,\" she pushed her plate away and walked to the guest bedroom. The room was so tense and silent. Tears were streaming down Rachel's face. Frank wrapped his arms around her and let her cry into his shoulder and whispered, \"I'm sorry baby, I shouldn't have let you come. I'm sorry.\" Fortunately, no matter how tense the moment was, Andre involuntarily loosened it. He started loudly eating the chicken that he had on his plate. Rachel pulled away from Frank and scolded, \"Andre, you can't stop eating for 5 minutes.\" \"But it's so good. She might be evil but she can cook.\" Rachel wiped her tears away and sat down at the table. \"Rachel, I am sorry for the way my mom is behaving,\" Herb apologized. Rachel smiled at him, \"It's okay, actually it's not but it happened, I can't dwell. We'll just go back home.\" Andre sadly put his plate down and followed Rachel. \"I'll be over there tomorrow, I'll take you to the movies,\" Frank said to Rachel. Rachel nodded at him and walked out of the house. The next morning after getting dressed, Frank walked downstairs to his kitchen but stopped when he heard Belle talking. \"Herb, I'm trying to do what's best for my grandson, is that so bad?\" she asked. \"Mom, I'm sure in your own way, you have his best interest at heart but this is not one of those times,\" Herb argued. \"He is my grandson!\" \"And he is our son Isabelle, he belongs here not in North Carolina!\" Katherine yelled. \"You stay out of this, it is not of your business,\" Isabelle said. \"None of my business? None of my business?! He is my son not yours!\" \"It's not like you have steered him in the right path, he quit football, he doesn't have a job and you let him have a relationship with that thing.\" Frank felt his blood boil. He walked into the room and made his presence known. \"Honey, hey, how did you sleep?\" Katherine said. Frank looked at Belle and sneered at her. \"I want you to keep Rachel's name out of your mouth, you don't know her and you never will,\" He walked to the front door and slammed it. At Andre's apartment, Rachel is looking in the mirror just staring at herself. ' Ugh, I swear, these bags under my eyes are getting worse and Frank hates it when I were make-up but it is necessary today.' She thought. Suddenly there was banging on the front door. \"Coming Frank!\" Rachel yelled. But the person kept banging on the door. Rachel yanked open the door, \"Gosh is it that serious Fr-\". She looked up and saw that it wasn't Frank it was Nikki sobbing carrying a paper bag. \"Nikki, what are you doing here?\" Rachel asked. Nikki wiped her face. \"I didn't know where else to go. I need your help Rachel,\" Nikki said. Rachel reluctantly let Nikki inside. \"Do you want something to drink?\" Rachel asked. Nikki shook her head. \"Rachel, what I'm about to tell you is strictly between us, okay?\" Rachel nodded. Nikki slowly reached in the paper bag and pulled out three pregnancy tests. \"Oh my God Nikki!\" Rachel exclaimed, \"Are you pregnant?\" Nikki's tears started welling up again. \"I don't know. I missed my period, I never miss my period Rachel.\" Rachel started pacing back and forth. \"Nikki, you are 18 years old, you can't be a mother now! What about your career?\" \"You don't think I've thought about that? I mean I can only imagine what Mom and Dad would do to me if they found out. That's why I'm here Rachel. I don't want to do this alone.\" Rachel sat down on the couch and ran her fingers through her hair. \"What about the father? He should know that he is going to be a dad,\" Rachel said. \"I don't know who the father could be, I mean I can narrow it down to about two guys but I want to see the results first. There is a chance that it's just stress. Mom and Dad have been prepping me for the festival next week. I just want to rule this out.\" \"But Nikki, why do you need me?\" Rachel asked. \"Rachel, you are my sister. We are supposed to be there for each other. If you thought were pregnant, wouldn't want me there to help you?\" \"I would want Frank there. We don't have secrets,\" Rachel said, \"but I guess I would want you there in some way, I mean you are my big sister.\" \"Please Rachel I need you to be the big sister now. Just stand outside the bathroom and read the results. That's all I need you to do.\" Rachel could see how desperate Nikki was. Her whole life could be changing and all she wanted Rachel to do was be there. \"Okay. I'll help you. Just don't pee on the toilet seat.\" \"Thank you so much Rachel, I owe you,\" Nikki grabbed the tests and took them into the bathroom with her. \"So tell me about this festival,\" Rachel said as they waited for the timer to go off. \"It's a community thing, they have a stage for singers who sign up and, well, you know Mom and Dad signed me up. Maybe you could sign up. They wouldn't know what hit them if both of us where on that stage.\" Rachel smiled at thought. \"Nah, I don't know,\" she said. \"Come on, you can invite Clive Davis and Frank's family and-\" Suddenly the timer went off and both of the girls froze. \"I guess this is it? The moment of truth,\" Nikki said. Rachel put her hand on Nikki's shoulder. \"Hey no matter what, I'll have your back.\" Rachel went into the bathroom and read the results. \"What do they say?\" Rachel laughed as she walked out of the bathroom. \"You're not pregnant, you're just fat.\" Nikki sighed in relief. \"Oh my God I can hear my heart pounding. Thank you God!\" Nikki cheered. \"Next time be more responsible Nicole, condoms are your friend,\" Rachel threw a pillow at her. \"You know, you should do the last one. I mean I spent 50 dollars on these might as well use them all and I'm all out of pee,\" Nikki suggested. \"First of all I don't need to know about your urine, and second of all I don't think I'm pregnant,\" Rachel said. \"Who cares, I'm not wasting 50 dollars.\" Nikki handed Rachel the third test. Rachel shook her head and laughed. \"I'm only doing this because you want me too,\" she took the test from Nikki's hand and went into the bathroom. While she waited for Rachel, Nikki made herself at home and walked around the apartment. She had never been inside Andre's apartment. While in the kitchen she heated her up a TV dinner since she hadn't eaten anything that day. As soon as the food was ready Nikki heard someone knocking at the door. \"I'll get it,\" Nikki called out. 'I wonder what's taking her so long time was up for a minute,' Nikki thought. She opened to door and as she thought, it was Frank. \"Nikki? What are you doing here?\" Frank asked surprised. \"Well it's good to see you too Frank, won't you come in,\" she let Frank into the house but he was still confused on why she was here. \"Where's Rachel?\" he asked. \"She is in the bathroom. She'll be out in a minute, I was making something to eat you want anything?\" Meanwhile in the bathroom, Rachel found herself staring in the mirror again, and this time she was paler. \"Rachel, Frank's here,\" she heard Nikki called. She jumped out of her thoughts and threw all of the tests away and covered them with toilet paper. \"Here I come,\" she looked herself one more time and exited the bathroom. When she saw Frank she smiled. \"Hey baby,\" she gave him a peck on his lips, \"Come on let's go.\" \"Yeah, you wouldn't believe what happened this morning,\" Frank said walking out of the door Before stepping out of the door Rachel, looked back at Nikki and asked, \"Uh, before you leave can you take the trash in the bathroom out?\" \"Is everything alright?\" Nikki asked. Rachel looked down at her feet and shook her head, \"No.\" Before Nikki could say anything, Rachel left. Oooooh the suspense, oooh the cliffhanger. And I am just getting started. If you want more soon I suggest you review as much as possible because the last two reviews I got made me want to finish this chapter because I didn't know how obsessed people were with this story. Smooches![Chapter 26] Not about to lie...you guys are going to hate me. And this chapter is short but you will see why I didn't want to write this for too long. Spaced Out Frank took Rachel to go see Fright Night but he noticed that she was lost in her thoughts the whole movie. She wouldn't look at him even when they were talking and when he would touch her she would tense up a little. At one point in the movie he thought he had seen tears. \"Rachel, are you okay?\" he asked, whispering. Rachel quickly wiped her tears. \"I'm fine, I think it's just allergies,\" she lied. Frank could see right through her lie, making him more worried. \"Rachel, you don't get allergies. Tell me what's wrong,\" he said. \"Can you just watch the movie and leave me alone?\" she snapped at him. He was taken back by her tone. Respecting her wishes he continued watching the movie but he was far from letting it go. When the movie was over, he took her to a small Italian restaurant for lunch. She was still distant and she wouldn't talk to him. When the waitress came over was the only time she talked. \"What can I get you too?\" the waitress asked. \"I'll have a shrimp fettuccini and a coke, Rachel, what do you want?\" Frank asked her. She looked at the menu and said, \"I'll have a steak medium rare and a salad with raspberry dressing and water with lemon wedges; and for dessert I want the Chocolate Cake Overload covered in strawberry sauce.\" Frank and the waitress looked at her with widened eyes. Frank was surprised that she actually talk for the first time in two hours, the waitress just didn't want to write down all of her request. When the food arrived, Rachel ate like she hadn't eaten for days; she was done way before Frank. Frank just stared at her like she had two heads; he had never seen her like this before. \"Rachel, don't take this the wrong way but where is all that going?\" he chuckled, nervously. Rachel wiped the chocolate off of her face. \"I haven't eaten in a while. I'm really hungry,\" her face fell, \"You must think I'm a cow.\" \"No, I just never seen you eat like this. I wouldn't mind a little extra weight on you,\" he said, slurping his noodles. \"You think I'm too skinny or something?\" Rachel snapped. \"No, I'm just saying I don't mind gaining weight or anything. I'm just being honest, you have been filling out and I like it,\" he laughed. Rachel crossed her arms and glared at him. \"So I'm fat now?\" \"Baby, you are not fat. If your weight is bothering you then I can help you work it off later on,\" he said smirking. \"You know what Frank; all you think about is sex. It's annoying,\" she huffed. Frank dropped his fork, letting it clink onto his plate. \"Rachel, what's wrong with you?\" he asked. \"It's not me, it's you. All you want to do lately is have sex; you act like you don't even care about anything else.\" \"Rachel, I am a man, I like sex so sue me, but this isn't even about that. You have been moody all day like being around me is the worst thing in the world. Is it what my grandmother said? She'll be gone in a few days and you will never have to see her again.\" \"You know what, being with you if the worst thing in the world right now, take me home,\" Rachel said. \"I'm not taking you home Rachel we are going to talk about this.\" \"Take me home now! I don't want to be with you right now,\" she yelled. The look on Frank's face went from angry to blank in a matter of seconds. \"You want to break up with me?\" he asked quietly. The look on his face make Rachel's heart break but she ignored it. \"I want to go home,\" she said. \"Rachel, are you breaking up with me?\" he asked again. \"I don't know Frank, please just take me home.\" Frank sat still for a minute before leaving 30 dollars on the table and leaving the restaurant with Rachel behind him. After an awkward car ride, they finally arrived at the apartment and Frank turned the car off and looked at her. \"Rachel, will you please talk to me? If you need some space to get over what you are going through, fine but our relationship should be in jeopardy over one argument. I love you,\" he said. Rachel sighed, trying to keep tears from falling down her face. \"Frank, I'm just not feeling it today. I was thinking. We are going to be seniors in high school, maybe we should spend some time apart. I'm your first girlfriend, we don't have to be together forever, and you should go out and experience life and other women. I don't want to tie you down,\" she said. \"Rachel please don't do this? I don't want to have other women, I want you. I want to marry you.\" \"Frank, we are too young to even think about marriage, it's too much.\" Frank couldn't stop the single tear that ran down his face. He could literally feel his heart breaking into two. \"If you feel that way…I just want you to be happy, and I thought you were happy with me, I guess not. I'll give you a break. For as long as you need, but I'm not going to stop loving you, Rachel.\" \"I know Frank,\" she said, \"I just need to get my head straight.\" She got out of the car and as soon as she closed the door he sped away from her. At home, his parents and Isabelle were in the living room. Belle was knitting while Katherine and Herb were talking about something. Katherine looked up and saw Frank. \"Honey, are you okay?\" Katherine asked. His eyes were bloodshot red and he looked like crap. He looked at Belle and said, \"You win. I'm going home with you; I need to get my life together.\" Belle's face lit up in delight. \"Oh Frank, I knew you would see the light,\" she said. Herb and Katherine were shocked. \"Frank, baby, what happened?\" Katherine asked, crying already. \"I just need to get out of here,\" he said and left to his room. Rachel ran into the apartment and dropped to her knees and started sobbing. 'It's for the best,' she thought. Hear her sobs Andre came from his room and panicked when he saw Rachel crying. \"Rachel, what happened?\" he asked trying to pull her up from the floor. \"Andre, it hurts so bad,\" she cried. \"What hurts, Rachel?\" \"I broke up with Frank, Andre, I broke up with him. I told him I loved him and that I would never hurt him and I broke up with him. I feel so numb,\" she could barely talk through her tears. \"Why would you break up with him? I thought you guys were good,\" Andre asked confused. \"I had too; I don't want to trap him. He has his whole life ahead of him, I don't want to ruin it,\" she cried. \"Rachel, come on, baby girl what are you talking about?\" \"Andre, I'm pregnant.\" *dodging pitchforks* Don't kill me! *runs away* Review for the next chapter! Next Chapter might be the last! If you kill me there won't be a sequel, think about it.[Chapter 27] Well...It's about that time. The end of When Fate Decides to Play Matchmaker. So this chapter has been ready for like a week but I decided to choose today, September 27, to post it because today is the day I published this story 3 years ago when I was a freshman in high school (yes I was a noob) and now I'm a senior so I was like that's some real closure. But don't think I'm leaving for good because it's Frachel 4 life over here so I will be working on a sequel. I don't know when I'm going to publish that but I already know how it's going to end so I just have to get there. So anyway... Read on and I'll see you at that bottom. Enjoy. P.S. I suggest listening to I Will Always Love You at the end...just to get the full experience. Take A Bow The next morning Rachel woke up with a bad headache from crying herself to sleep. She slowly turned around and saw Andre resting next to her. After her confession he let her cry into his shoulder for the whole night so Rachel didn't bother waking him. She got out of bed and went to the bathroom. She looked at herself in the mirror and lifted her shirt trying to see a change in her stomach. Even though she couldn't see anything, she still rubbed her belly. 'There is a baby in here,' she thought to herself. Lost in her thoughts, she didn't hear Andre open the bathroom door. \"Rachel, come on out we need to talk,\" he said and closed the door again. Rachel peed, brushed her teeth and left the bathroom. In the living room, Andre was sitting on the couch eating cereal. When he saw Rachel he set his bowl on the coffee table. \"First, you have to make a doctor's appointment later. You know for prenatal stuff,\" he said. Rachel nodded without saying anything. \"Second, you have to tell Frank, Rachel. It's his baby too.\" \"I can't tell him, and you better not either,\" she argued. \"And what do you think will happen when he sees you with a beach ball in your shirt?\" \"I'll tell him I cheated and he'll never want to see me again.\" Andre shook his head at her. \"Honey, you know I will support every decision you make, no matter how stupid it is.\" \"I know it's stupid but, I love him so much. I don't want to ruin his life, he deserves to go out and experience a free life,\" she said. \"And what are you going to do? You don't have a job and you are living with me.\" \"I don't know yet, I just know that this feels right. I want my baby and I want Frank to live the life he deserves and that is not with me and a baby holding him back so I have to do this by myself,\" she said. \"I love you, always have and always will so if you need me I am there.\" Rachel hugged Andre and said, \"Thank you so much for understanding.\" Frank laid on his bed spaced out tossing his football in the air. He was in a bad mood and nothing anyone could say would make him smile, making his parents worried. Katherine slowly opened his door and said, \"Frank, honey. Are you okay?\" \"She broke up with me,\" he mumbled. Katherine gasped. \"What do you mean she broke up with you?\" she asked, shocked. Frank covered his face with his arms so his mom wouldn't see him cry. \"Yesterday, I took her to the movies and to lunch. She was acting very distant and when I asked her what was wrong she said she didn't want to be with me anymore.\" \"Oh, Frank, I'm so sorry, honey,\" she sat at the foot of his bed. \"I've been trying to figure out what I did so wrong that she would just break up with me. I thought she loved me. God, I sound like a girl but I can't help it; it feels like someone took away all of my oxygen,\" he sobbed. Katherine hated seeing Frank like this; it made her want to cry. She had never been so confused in her life. 'Why would Rachel break up with him, she is crazy about him,' she thought. \"Frank? Is this why you want to go with your grandmother?\" she asked. Frank nodded. \"Yeah, I can't stay here. We go to the same school; we would have to see each other eventually. I don't think I could handle it.\" \"There are other schools in LA honey, you don't have to go across the country,\" Katherine tried to persuade him. \"You don't understand!\" he exclaimed jumping to his feet, \"I don't want to be in the same city as her. I hate her for doing this. And I love her at the same time. I love her so much but I hate her. I hate her for breaking up with me; I hate her for being the first girl that ever looked at me like the way she did; I hate her for making me feel like I was her king; and most of all I hate her for making me love her as much as I do! So I am leaving.\" Katherine could feel the pain and anger radiating off of him; she knew that he was hurt. \"If you think that is the best solution, I'm not going to stop you but I am going to lay down some rules. I'm still your mother,\" she said. Frank didn't say anything; he just sat back down and listened. \"I want you to focus on school and apply to colleges. I know your grandmother will try to stop you so she can control you but you have to go; who knows, you might be able to get a football scholarship. I also don't want you seeing anybody while you are still in high school-\" \"I don't want to date anyone else,\" Frank interrupted her. \"You might not now but eventually you will want somebody else. I just don't want to see you hurt like you are now. Do you understand?\" Frank nodded and fell back on his bed. \"Honey, I know that you are hurt, and it kills me because you are still my baby, but this is life,\" Katherine said sympathetically. It had been days since the break up and Rachel was sitting in the living room watching TV, eating crackers since that was the only thing she could eat without throwing up. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door and she turned the TV off and went to see who it was. She couldn't have been more surprised when she saw Frank at her door. \"Frank, what are you doing here?\" she asked. Frank ran his hand through his hair and looked down nervously. \"Can I come in?\" he asked. Rachel reluctantly opened the door and let him inside the apartment. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked again. \"Look, I'm not here to beg for you back but I feel like you deserve to know this.\" \"Know what?\" she asked. \"I'm going to live with my grandmother,\" he said. Rachel heart immediately dropped and her breathing became shallow. \"You are?\" \"Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow night and Rachel, I know that you don't want to be with me anymore but I still love you and I didn't want to leave without a proper goodbye,\" he explained to her. \"I think I need to sit down,\" she said gripping onto the couch. Frank immediately grabbed her before she fell. \"Rachel, what's wrong with you? Are you sick?\" he asked frantically. He sat her down on the couch and sat next to her and felt her forehead. \"Are you leaving because of me?\" she cried. He sighed. \"No,\" he lied. \"Then why?\" \"I need to focus on school and I'm going to start playing football again, maybe get a scholarship,\" he said. Rachel wiped her tears and said, \"I guess I'm happy for you. I know that you are going to succeed,\" she paused and chuckled, \"Maybe you'll be a bodyguard since you like saving people.\" Frank laughed along with her. \"Yeah, maybe I will.\" When the laughter wore off he reached in his pocket and pulled something out. \"Look, I want to give you something. I want leave you to have a piece of me.\" \"Oh you already have,\" Rachel mumbled under her breath. Frank opened his hand and revealed a small enameled cross. \"For me? Frank, it's beautiful,\" she said taking it from his hands. \"It was Joselyn's,\" he said. Rachel practically threw it back into his hands. \"Frank, I can't take that. I'm not your girlfriend anymore,\" she said. \"Rachel, I know but you helped me realized that what happened to her wasn't my fault, you took me from a dark place and I would like you to have it,\" he explained, \"Look, you can wear on a necklace or a bracelet or not at all, I just want you to have it.\" He held it out to her and she hesitantly took it from him. \"Thank you,\" she whispered to try to disguise the crack in her voice. \"You're welcome,\" he said. They sat in an awkward silence for a minute before Frank got up. \"Well, I guess I should be going,\" he said. Rachel sat there staring at the cross without saying anything. \"Goodbye Rachel,\" he began walking out the door. \"Frank!\" Rachel jumped up from the couch. Frank turned around and before he knew what was happening Rachel began kissing him on his lips with everything she had. Even though it confused him, Frank kissed her back and held her tight. They kissed as if it was their last day on earth. This would be the last kiss that they would ever share and they made sure it would count. They didn't know how much time went by when they parted out of breath and with swollen lips. \"Wow,\" Frank croaked. \"Yeah,\" Rachel said chuckled lightly. \"I guess, now is goodbye,\" Frank said. \"Yeah, goodbye Frank,\" Rachel said. \"Goodbye, Rachel.\" He walked out of the apartment and to his truck. \"Are you going to the talent show tomorrow?\" Rachel asked before he got into his truck. \"I wasn't planning on it,\" he replied. \"If I were singing in it, would you go?\" she asked. \"Of course I would,\" he said with a smile. Rachel smiled back at him and waved. With that he got into his truck and drove off. After Frank left, Rachel called Clive Davis and explained her plan to perform in the talent show. She couldn't wait until she graduated to be successful, she needed it to happen now. Clive could hear the desperation in her voice and told her that even though he didn't like the fact that she is pregnant and doesn't want to finish school, he'll work with her. The next day Andre did Rachel's hair and make-up while Mia looked for a band to back her up. Once again, she found herself looking in the mirror and smiling at her belly. \"Mommy is going to be a star after tonight,\" she said out loud, \"Your daddy will be there too. I know that he doesn't know about you yet and it's for the best, but I promise one day I'll tell him the truth and he'll probably hate me for it but I know he will love you. I love you my little pumpkin seed.\" She was interrupted by a knock on the door. Mia poked her head in and said, \"I got some kids from the school band together. We have to get going now.\" \"I'll be right out,\" Rachel said. She wrapped her black cape around her body and followed Mia out. The talent show was at the high school's Creative Arts Building and could fit at least 5,000 people. The show had started at 12:00pm and Rachel got there at 1:00pm, right after Nikki got off stage. She spotted her parents and Nikki backstage. \"Now, Nikki, remember how bad we need this,\" Alison said, \"There are very important people out there and you need to make sure you come home with a record deal or don't come home at all.\" Nikki nodded and breathed to calm her nerves. She looked around at the different talent and began to feel nervous. Among the people, she was surprised to see her little sister. \"Oh my God, Rachel!\" she exclaimed, running over to her and hugged her. \"Hi, honey,\" Rachel hugged her back. \"How are you feeling?\" Nikki asked. \"Like a million dollar bill,\" Rachel said smiling. Doing what they do best, Fletcher and Alison interrupted the moment. \"Rachel, have you come to see your sister?\" Alison asked. \"No, actually, I'm performing,\" Rachel said. Fletcher rolled his eyes at her and said, \"Rachel, when are you going to just accept that you will never be like Nikki. You don't have to embarrass yourself.\" Usually, Rachel would be offended by that comment but all she did was smile at her father. \"I have accepted that I will never be like Nikki a long time ago but I have also accepted that I am better than Nikki, no offense,\" she looked at Nikki. \"None taken,\" Nikki said. Before Alison or Fletcher could say anything else the announcer got on stage. \"We have a last minute entry to the show. Everyone give it up for Rachel Marron.\" Rachel took off her cape and revealed a gold sequin dress that made both of her parents stare at her in awe. \"I have a show to do. See you around,\" she excused herself. \"Knock 'em dead Chelly,\" Nikki cheered before Fletcher and Alison dragged her away to their seats. On stage, Rachel slowly walked up to the microphone. The claps silenced and everyone just stared at her. Even though this wasn't the first show she performed, she was still nervous. She looked around and saw her parents glaring at her on one side and on the other side she saw Clive Davis and her friends smiling at her, but she didn't see Frank. \"What will you be performing for us, Rachel?\" A judge asked. Rachel cleared her throat and said nervously, \"I, uh, will be singing a song.\" \"And what song will that be?\" That's when she saw the door in the back of the building open and saw Frank and his family including Belle enter the building. Rachel's eyes followed them all the way to their seats in the front row. \"Ms. Marron?\" the judge asked, \"What song are you performing?\" Frank's eyes connected with Rachel's and he smiled at her. Rachel smiled back and said, \"I will be singing 'I Will Always Love You' by Dolly Parton.\" The judges wrote it down and said, \"When you're ready.\" Rachel turned around and looked at her band and smiled. \"Come in at the beginning of the chorus,\" she whispered. They looked at each other confused but nodded at her. She turned back to the crowd, took a deep breath and sang: If I should stay I would only be in your way So I'll go but I know I'll think of you every step of the way And I... will always love you, ooh Will always love you You My darling, you... Mmm-mm She smirked at Frank who was glassy eyed. Bittersweet memories – That is all I'm taking with me. So good-bye. Please don't cry: We both know I'm not what you, you need And I... will always love you I... will always love you You, ooh [Instrumental / Sax solo] I hope life treats you kind And I hope you have all you've dreamed of And I wish you joy and happiness But above all this I wish you love And I... will always love you I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you I will always love you I, I will always love you. She stared straight at Frank. You. Darling, I love you. I'll always... I'll always love you. Ooh Ooh As the music faded out Rachel came down of her musical high and looked at the crowd. It was silent. People were staring at her with their jaws to the floor. Rachel started to feel nervous until she heard one person clapping, Nikki. This caused a roar of applause and cheering from the entire crowd; she even got a standing ovation from the judges. Tears of joy started coming down Rachel's face as she smiled and blew kisses at the crowd. This was where she was meant to be. Onstage in front of people that loved her. She stepped away from the mic and took a bow. So how'd you like it? Or love it? I know you guys might be mad that I broke them up but you know...I don't know. Anyways thank you for reading my fic it means a lot and I will be posting the sequel as soon as I can. Before I go, I have a request.
