Before getting the Inception job, Arthur says he\\'s going to the States and he told Ariadne Mal was lovely. I doubt Cobb was the only one on the team who was hurt when she died. I also bet he\\'s closer to the family then we may think. This is set before Inception. Please leave a review. Compared to most of the jobs they had taken on over the years, this one was one of the more tamed jobs. They were hired by the CEO of a security company to go into the dreams of an employee who was suspected of selling customer\\'s personal information to their rivals. They got in and out without alerting the target that they were dreaming. Cobb and Arthur were able to go their separate ways with little to no hassle, Cobb planned to lay low somewhere in South Africa and Arthur was heading to the states. \"Give my regards.\" Cobb said before they went their separate ways at the airport. When Arthur settled into his seat on plan, he pulled out his phone to check his messages before switching to airplane mode. He saw he had a missed call and a voicemail. Smiling when he saw the name, he put the phone to his ear, his smile growing when one of his favourite people started talking. \"Hi uncle Arthur. Granma says you\\'ll be on the plane soon. We miss you and can\\'t wait to see you.\" There was a pause. \"James come say hi… Hi Arthur get here soon. We love you and Granma let us help make a cake for you. See you soon.\" Then the message ended. Arthur put his head phones in and prepared himself for the long flight. When the plan finally landed Arthur eagerly made his made to baggage claim and made his way through customs. Before he even had a chance to look around, two little blondes attached themselves to his legs. \"Oh my god, look at you two, you\\'re so big.\" Arthur crouched down and hugged them both tight. Mile\\'s wife, Lucile came and hugged him, kissing both his cheeks. Lucile had an aura of motherly love and compassion, she was one of those old ladies who would stuff you would food as soon as you entered her house. Arthur was not going to leave that house the same weight he was when he arrived. \"It\\'s good to see you.\" She said with a sweet smile, her French accent softened by her time in the States. \"You too, thanks for letting me stay with you.\" Arthur picked up James and sat him on his hip. \"We wouldn\\'t have it any other way.\" Lucile assured him, she had always made him feel welcome. The four of them made their way to the car. All the way home, Phillipa and James told Arthur about school, their friends, all the cakes they had baked with their Granma and they told him about all the plans they had for his stay, which involved a lot of trips to the park and tea parties. Arthur listened intently to them and answered all their question with great detail. He only stumbled when they asked about their father. \"He\\'s trying really hard to come home to you guys, but work is pretty busy right now.\" Arthur tried to explain. He caught Lucile\\'s eye in the rear-view mirror, her expression seemed tense, but Arthur knew it wasn\\'t directed at him. Miles never kept anything from his wife, so she knew all about cream sharing and Cobb\\'s role in her daughter\\'s suicide. She wanted Cobb to come home, what worried her was how long it would take. It was dangerous for children to get used to having no father. How long would it be before the damage couldn\\'t be fixed? \"How come you can come but he can\\'t? I thought you worked together.\" Phillipa asked. \"Well we work together but we do different jobs, so I have an easier time coming to see you.\" Arthur explained, he felt better since this wasn\\'t technically a lie. Before the children could say anything else, Lucile announced that they were home. As they climbed out the car, Lucile told the children to get the cake they made Arthur. Arthur moved to take his bag out the trunk, but Lucile grabbed it before he could, Arthur tried to take it from her, but she wasn\\'t having it. \"I\\'m old yes, but fragile, no. Those children keep be young.\" She assured him. \"I\\'m sure they do, and you don\\'t look a day of sixty- five.\" Arthur smiled, it fell when he remembered her eyes when he talked about work. \"About Cobb…\" \"We\\'ll talk tonight. Right now, your adorable niece and nephew have a cake for you.\" Lucile headed to the house, with the point man close behind her. The cake was Victoria sponge covered in icing and every colour of sprinkles. As they ate, James and Phillipa bombarded Arthur with new drawings which he praised and said belong in a museum. Lucile watched in silence as her grandchildren interacted with the young man she saw as her son. Once the cake was eaten and the kitchen cleaned, they retreated to the living room and played board games. When it got closer to dinner, James asked if they could have pizza. \"You have had cake today, that\\'s not too healthy.\" Lucile pointed out. \"But Uncle Arthur is here, it\\'s a special occasion.\" James argued. \"Please Grandma.\" Whined Phillipa. \"Please.\" James whined \"Please Granma.\" Arthur joined in. Lucile looked at him. \"I thought I had two grandchildren.\" Arthur shrugged and the children copied him. Lucile signed dramatically and went to find the take-out menus. When her back was turned, Arthur gave each of them a high- five. The end of the day came too quickly, and it was bedtime. James and Phillipa argued over which one of them Arthur would tuck in first. They finally settled on Phillipa going first and James going first the next night. Arthur tucked her pink blankets around her like a cocoon and read her a story. \"Okay, so tomorrow we have the park and then we try that new ice cream place, deal?\" Phillipa asked, making sure he knew the plan. \"Deal. Now you had better get to sleep so you have enough energy.\" Arthur kissed her head and moved off her bed, but Phillipa grabbed his hand. \"Wait I have to ask you something. You know my friend Lucy and how her uncle is getting married, so she is getting a new aunt?\" Phillipa said in a rush. Arthur raised an eyebrow at her, she didn\\'t wait for him to respond. \"So, when are you getting us an aunt?\" Arthur paused and thought very carefully. \"Well, it takes time to find someone you want to marry, and I work a lot, so I don\\'t meet many woman.\" Arthur explained. \"Granma says you too handsome to be single and I agree.\" Phillipa smiled. Arthur kissed her head again and decided he should talk to her grandmother about his dating life (or lack of). \"Well if I do meet someone, I\\'m going have to make sure you two get along. Can\\'t have my favourite girl not get along with her aunt.\" \"You will and when you do, she is going to be so pretty and cool and she\\'s going to love us.\" \"Just like I do. Now goodnight.\" Arthur tucked the covers in one last time and turned on her night light (she insisted she wasn\\'t scared. She just liked to look at it). Arthur moved to James\\'s room and waited for Lucile to finish reading his story. Once she was done, leaving the two alone, Arthur sat on his bed. \"So how is the little man doing with two girls?\" \"Okay I guess, my friends come over a lot so it\\'s not like I don\\'t have any guy time.\" James explained. Arthur nodded his head. \"Well I\\'ll make sure we have some quality guy time.\" Arthur promised him. \"Can we play soccer?\" \"Absolutely. Anything else going on?\" \"I miss Daddy.\" \"I know and he misses you too, but I promise he\\'s working really hard to come home.\" \"I really miss Mommy, but she can\\'t come back can she?\" James whispered. \"No, she can\\'t but she loved you so much and if it was possible, we\\'d bring her back, but that\\'s not how it works.\" Arthur explained. \"I\\'m okay, we\\'ll have fun while you\\'re here right?\" James asked. \"I promise. Love you little man.\" \"Love you. Good night.\" Arthur made his way to the kitchen and saw Lucile making something to drink. He sat down and she passed him a mug. They drank in silence until Lucile broke it. \"Does he talk about her?\" \"It hurts too much.\" \"You loved her too.\" \"She was his wife, mother of his children.\" \"She was your best friend first, you introduced them.\" \"She doesn\\'t haunt me like she does him. I remember her as she was.\" Lucile said nothing. She knew all about how her daughter\\'s memory was preserved in her son in law\\'s mind. How she would sabotage them, how she wouldn\\'t hesitate to shoot either of them and how she prevented Cobb from building anything in the dreams. It disgusted her that her daughter\\'s memory had been twisted into something so dark, but she was thankful Arthur remembered her as she deserved to be. The day her daughter brought home this skinny American boy that she had met at collage, Lucile adopted him as her own. He quickly became known as her best friend. Introduced her to Cobb. He was more help to her in planning her wedding than any bridesmaid could ever be. He patiently waited outside the waiting room while both children were being born and happily took the tile of Uncle. Before Mal died, he was there every weekend, every holiday. This was his family as well. Arthur was not in love with Mal, but he did love her. Cobb wasn\\'t the only one hurting. \"Phillipa said you said I was too good looking to be single.\" Arthur said, attempting to change the subject. Lucile laughed. \"Miles was telling me about this student he has, Ariadne. One of a kind, better than Cobb he says. She\\'s sweet, cheeky and very driven.\" Lucile said. \"And it breaks my heart to see a catch like yourself remain single. A waste even.\" \"Ariadne, like the lady of the maze?\" \"King Arthur and Princess Ariadne. Think of the beautiful grandchildren you could give me.\" \"I think two is enough.\" Arthur tried. This wasn\\'t the first time Lucile talked about children and marriage to Arthur. \"I disagree.\" \"Maybe I\\'ll let you introduce us.\" Arthur tried. \"Let me, my dear boy you will meet her whether you like it or not. I expect to be mentioned in your speech when you marry her after seeing how perfect for you she is.\" Lucile bid him goodnight and headed to bed. Arthur sat there in the quiet, thinking about what Lucile said. Settling down didn\\'t sound so bad. A legal job where he could come home each night. Ideally, they would leave close to Phillipa and James, but a normal job would make it easier to travel so that wasn\\'t an issue. Giving up dreaming would not be easy, but he liked to think if he had a good enough reason then he could do it. A chance at a life and a family seemed like a good enough reason. Maybe he should talk to Lucile about Miles\\'s student. ","Summary":" Author\\'s note: I don\\'t own Inception because if I did there would be a sequel.

To be half of a whole? One craved order, the other revelled in chaos. One lived in a world of predictable numbers and the other inhabited a world of rubbed out pencil lines and eraser shavings. Three-piece suits pressed and stored immaculately. Scarves covering every available surface in her apartment. He prided himself on knowing the details, whereas she created the details. The predictability of structures such as the Penrose steps met the surprises of cathedrals. Two halves that others would have expected to repel but in fact attracted. Some were surprised. Cobb did a double take when he saw them walk into the warehouse, holding hands. He didn\\'t say anything at first, just watched them go about their work. They continued as they always did, except Arthur had a small smile that would grow each time he caught her eye. Ariadne would give him a quick kiss before leaving for coffee and would then sit at his desk while they drank. Cobb heard bits and pieces of their conversation. It was rare that he ever heard Arthur talk about something other than work, but here he was talking about seeing a movie and checking out this new restaurant after work. Eames and Yusuf on the other hand were not surprised at all. In fact, when the two of them walked in that morning, Eames stuck his hand out and Yusuf handed him a twenty-dollar bill with a scowl on his face. When the happy couple left for lunch, Cobb turned to the remaining team mates. \"When does Arthur go for lunch? There have been jobs when I have had to force him out of the door when he goes so deep into his work.\" Cobb exclaimed. \"You\\'re kidding right?\" Eames said. \"It was so obvious. It was only a matter of time.\" Yusuf explained. \"I would have preferred it if they had waited another week but oh well.\" \"I warned you, the tension was getting thicker every day. Don\\'t be so hard on yourself Darling, it\\'s my job to read people.\" Eames turned to Cobb who still looked clueless. \"What did I miss?\" Cobb asked. \"For starters; he smiles more and that stick up his arse doesn\\'t seem to be in so deep anymore. That day Ariadne couldn\\'t come in because she had a project for collage, he spent the day glued to his phone texting her rather than his computer as normal.\" Eames began. \"Last week when he was sick, and she raced to his bedside to look after him all day.\" \"He paid her back with the flowers, her desk looked like a florist\\'s display window for a week.\" \"They always seem to be look for an excuse to talk to each other or touch each other.\" \"The other day, Arthur moved his laptop to her desk and worked next to her all day. I tried to do that once and she threw paper balls at me.\" \"She makes him laugh and she tried Korean food because of him. You\\'ve known Arthur for years, how have you not noticed?\" \"Well I\\'ve been distracted with the job.\" Cobb defended himself, as he thought back to all the times Arthur and Ariadne\\'s attraction to each other was apparently so obvious. \"I just didn\\'t see it coming.\" \"They\\'re kind of perfect for each other.\" Eames mused with a smile. \"Opposites attract.\" There can be no chaos without order, and what is order without chaos? Notes books full of in-depth personal information with little stick figures doodled in the margins. Rough drafts of whole cities filed away rather than being hastily stuffed into text books. Suits hanging up alongside colourful band shirts. A loaded dice and a bishop, standing side by side. A game of chance and risk made reliable. A game of strategy and endless possibilities made predictable. One chose a symbol of a game full of risks and unpredictability. The other, one from a game of prediction and calculating moves. Opposites attract but there was always a piece of one in the other. They knew what it meant to be a lover, to be half of a whole. Author\\'s note: Unfortunately, I do not own Inception, because if I did, we would have had a sequel by now. I\\'m currently in Sweden as an exchange student and having the time of my life. I\\'m recovering from a headache after going out last night for an early birthday celebration (I\\'ll be 20 on Tuesday, getting old haha). I\\'ve been wanting to write for these two for ages after seeing all the other amazing work out there, and who doesn\\'t love them together. He knew that kiss wouldn\\'t work, he just really wanted to. I bet he tracked her down after the movie. Please leave a review. ","Summary":" Do you know what it is to be a lover?

Sleek and perfect looking bastard. A few names came to mind that she might call him, when he had averted his head and risen from the bench after he had just … tricked me. Tricked me into a kiss. „T\\'was worth a shot\", he had said. Something is definitely going on. She could not help but smile slightly, she was confused. Her lips tingled a little where they had met his. There was no time to think about this properly though, because there were definitely other things going on right now. More important things. Ariadne had to concentrate on the task that was before them, especially with all the unexpected complications. Quickly she stood up and hurried after Arthur\\'s slim figure in just as long strides as her tight skirt would permit. How she hated costumes. Her aunt Ella used to wear them on almost every occasion, and she was the kind of person that probably sometime forgot the meaning of the word \"comfortable\". „Might have to wait a bit for them, Fischer looked like a scared rabbit. Hope he won\\'t do anything stupid\", Arthur said when they entered the lift. „Well, the dream doesn\\'t look like it\\'s collapsing, does it? Cobb knows what he\\'s doing, right?\" Ariadne sounded nervous even to her own ears, when she pressed the button for the fifth floor and the doors closed. „He doesn\\'t, but we can only hope it\\'s gonna work anyway this time.\" She did not know what to respond, so she said nothing and folded her hands in front of her, trying to appear calmer than she was. Especially when she became fully aware that they were alone in a lift and he was standing behind her. He had just kissed her, for god\\'s sake! What had that been for, what was he up to? She had known him for a few months now, they had worked together, shared plans and dreams with each other. Well, that sounded more romantic than it really was, but they had gotten to know each other to some extent. Yet she never knew why he did some of the things he did. And it vexed her greatly, but she could never predict what he was going to do next. He was much different from her fellow students - their minds revolved around a few simple things, and those things tended to be even simpler when she was around, just because she had a pretty face. Thinking this way, he might not be so different from them after all … When the doors of the lift opened with a high pitched ding and Arthur cleared his throat, Ariadne was ripped from her musings and called herself to order again. They stepped out into the corridor. The sound of their feet was instantly muffled by the carpet all over the floor and the walls and ceiling too. It looked posh, like the rest of the hotel downstairs, but Ariadne could not help but think that she might not hear instantly when someone would be approaching them. This silent floor was almost more creepy than the staring projections downstairs. In order not to let on that she was feeling uneasy she walked ahead in quick steps to the end of the corridor and was about to turn around the corner, until she heard Arthur several paces back say: „This is it\". Embarrassed she turned around, and looked at the number of the room: 528. Of course he was right. She had not been paying attention. „Er, sorry, yes. So … we just wait?\" He had lowered his head and seemed to be smiling to himself. Now he looked up. „Yeah, and we hope Fischer buys the Mr. Charles story enough not to question that there is a pretty young woman on his team when, usually, there\\'s only supposed to be men.\" Seeing her incredulous look, he added: „Mind you, I\\'m not sayin\\' you can\\'t be dangerous, but that\\'s not how the extractors\\' training works. So just … look like you know exactly why you\\'re here and what you have to do.\" Ariadne swallowed some retort about how somebody should have told her about this. She had not even known how they were taking a risk with her here, in this position. Also, she got a little angry at herself because she had trouble to ignore he had just called her pretty. After a small pause she said: „Well, figures. After all, there\\'re mostly men in the busin…\" She got interrupted by the sound of the lift. The man in a grey suit inside started firing at them instantly, but missed two times, until a shot out of Arthur\\'s gun hit him right in the chest. Ariadne felt her heart pounding very quickly. She looked at Arthur from the side, he seemed absolutely cool apart from the tight set of his jaw. They had been chased before, in the other dream, and guns had been fired at and from them, but it felt different somehow on this quiet hotel floor. She wondered whether he felt it too. Probably not. How many times has he had to kill projections? A thought struck her. Has he ever killed someone outside of a dream? For real? Does that even feel much different? She wondered whether he would even tell her if he had. And somehow she simply wanted to believe that yes, it would feel much different, and no, he had not killed anyone outside of a dream. He turned his head and caught her staring at him. The look he shot her seemed almost apologetic. Then, the sound of a different lift and and two male voices could be heard from around the corner. Ariadne stiffened, but when they came closer, she could make out that one of them was definitely Cobb\\'s and she relaxed a little. Arthur positioned himself on front of room 528, so she went to stand beside him and tried to look - as much as she could - as if the belonged there. In a professional way. Author\\'s Note: please let me know whether this is to your liking! If no one shows any reaction I\\'m not sure I\\'ll find it in me to pursue this further ... it\\'s the first of my own writing I ever published and I\\'m a bit nervous ;) ","Summary":" Oh, that … smart son of a bitch.

Następnie dorabia się poszczególne detale, dokładne wyliczenia informują, czy taki schemat będzie korzystny, czy lepiej zrezygnować z jednych upiększeń, stosując inne. Kreacja snów wygląda podobnie. Zamiast papieru, jest jednak umysł, umysł, który potrafi stworzyć kształty widziane z innej perspektywy, przetwarza obraz i odbija go, jak w krzywym zwierciadle, zaginając scenerię na potrzeby sytuacji, jednocześnie tworząc wizję na wzór rzeczywistości. Każdy sen tworzy się inaczej, poszczególne etapy wymagają precyzji i sumienności, a końcowy efekt może zniszczyć najdrobniejsze niedopatrzenie, detal, do którego w rzeczywistości poza snem nie przywiązałoby się uwagi. Najważniejsza jest jednak oprawa - bez niej nie powstanie miejsce zakwaterowania, bez niej żadna projekcja nie będzie istotna. Musi powstać szkielet, aby powstała sceneria, gotowa do zaludnienia wyimaginowanymi jednostkami. Szkielet ten natomiast powinien posiadać początek i koniec - nie istnieje sen, bez osiągalnych granic; bariery te muszą być ukryte, niewidoczne na pierwszy rzut oka, mamiące umysł swą niedostępnością. - Jak stąd wyjść? - krzyczy Eames, czując na skórze pęd niecelnych naboi, mijających jego czaszkę o milimetry. - Gdzie są drzwi, do cholery? Wysokie mury miasta i odór kociego moczu przytłaczają go, przyprawiając o duszności ściskające się płuca, jakby ktoś oplótł wokół nich ciasny węzeł, wyciskając z ciała zbawienny tlen. Jeden z pocisków zakrzywia tor lotu i godzi w ramię mężczyzny, przechodząc na wylot i zatrzymując na ścianie odrapanego muru wznoszącego się po firmament za jego plecami. Mimo że już dawno powinien do tego nawyknąć, ból za każdym razem jest dla niego zaskoczeniem. Rozlewa się wzdłuż kości, promienieje szalonym ogniem nieznającym litości. - W snach nasze odczucia stają się odrębne od normalności - mawiał Cobb, spoglądając w oczy swym rozmówcom; jego źrenice przesiąknięte powagą zdawały się rzucać nieme wyzwanie (Eames nie wie, czy w tych znajomych, szarych oczach istotnie istniały stalowe nuty oceny, której poddaje on ludzi w swoim otoczeniu, czy są one efektem jego szeroko sięgającej wyobraźni) - Jednym, co smakuje tak samo zarówno we śnie, jak i w rzeczywistości, jest ból. Czysto fizyczne cierpienie doznane na płaszczyznach podświadomości okazuje się głęboko zakorzenioną, psychiczną drogą krzyżową, która istnieje jedynie w naszej głowie. Udręka tkwi w umyśle, a umysł jest niebezpieczną bronią w rękach wprawnego ekstraktora, posiadającego wiedzę o tym, jak należy się po nim poruszać. Eames staje przed wysokim murem i bije w niego pięściami, rozdrapuje paznokciami, kopie z całej siły, gotów uczynić wszystko, aby wydostać się z pułapki, w którą sam wkroczył. Zagroda nie ustępuje jego zapałowi, pociski ślizgają się po niej, rozsypując u stóp mężczyzny, jak krople deszczu, szczerbią niewielkie wnęki, pozostawiają głębokie zadrapania, ale nie przyczyniają się do upadku solidnej struktury zagradzającej mu drogę do bezpieczeństwa. Eames chce poznać odpowiedzi, które dręczą go od miesięcy, które ściągają sen z jego powiek, sen pełen niepojętych niepokojów, które mnożą się i dzielą, sypią pod czarne, znaczące podłoże przebarwieniami, grube podeszwy, a następnie składają się nieporadnie, jak układanka z puzzli, której poszczególne fragmenty zaginęły gdzieś na pograniczu świadomości - zanadto konstruktywne, by wypłynąć na powierzchnię, za bardzo płynne, by zatopić się w otchłani niewiedzy, oscylując pomiędzy zrozumieniem a niezrozumieniem, jak wykres odpowiedzi skokowej regulatora, w którym tłumienie nie istnieje. Arthur ukrył odpowiedzi głębiej, niż Eames mógł przypuszczać. Arthur, który w realnym świecie szkicuje nieistniejące kształty, zamknięte spirale i niemożliwe przejścia, jakie nie mają prawa powstać w architekturze krajobrazu, które przeczą wszelkim prawom natury, kpiąc z ogólne przyjętych zasad, Arthur bawiący się leniwie ołówkiem, co chwila wypadającym mu spomiędzy palców, krusząc grafit na mozaikach zdobiących kafelki w jego nieprzestronnej kuchni, Arthur bujający się na nogach krzesła, jak dziecko z podstawowej szkoły, nucący pod nosem melodię starych, francuskich piosenek, dawno zapomnianych przez resztę świata - ten Arthur tworzy we śnie fortece nie do zdobycia, mury nie do przejścia, błądzące ślepo korytarze, labirynty zwijające się, jak kłębowisko węży zjadających własne ogony, do których jest wejście, ale z których wyjście, na pozór niedalekie i osiągalne, nie istnieje. Architekt - perfekcjonista, architekt - majstersztyk, architekt - satyrysta. Ołowiana kula trafia w swój cel nie prędzej, niż mężczyzna zrozumie swoje położenie - dla świata może być osobą poruszającą się bez przeszkód po obszarach snu pospolitego cywila, ale przy Arthurze nie zajdzie dalej, niż tam, gdzie zostanie świadomie dopuszczony i Eames przez chwilę rozważa kapitulację; ale Eames rozumie też, że nie potrafi śnić bez Arthura, że nie potrafi żyć bez snów Arthura, ponieważ to Arthur jest jego snem, bez względu na to, czy igła PASIV przeszywa jego skórę. -VVV- - Niebezpiecznie jest poruszać się po snach, których się nie rozumie - śmieje się Arthur, znad opasłego tomu trzymanego na kolanach; ‚ Z architektur ą poprzez wieki ' - czyta Eames i myśli, że jeśli chciał zostać zaskoczonym, to nie powinien szukać ku temu powodów na tej płaszczyźnie świadomości. - Cobb ostrzegał, żeby nie tworzyć z pamięci - przypomina Arthur'owi, myśląc, że niepotrzebnie strzępi sobie język, ponieważ Arthur - zawsze ułożony, dystyngowany i ociekający klasycyzmem w snach, trzymający się schematów, jakby były kołami ratunkowymi - zrobi, tak, jak określi to sobie we własnych zamysłach i żadna przestroga nie odwiedzie go od własnych planów. - To nie szkice, tylko zarysy. Sugestie, jeśli łatwiej ci to zrozumieć innymi słowy. To nie do końca tak, że nie opiera się na elementach większych, niż pojedynczy detal, bo Arthur tworzy sen na podobieństwo rzeczywistości i choć twierdzi inaczej, Eames coraz częściej widuje wpisane w scenerię spiralne schody ciągnące się w nieskończoność w górę, niebotycznie przywodzące mu na myśl te, które prowadzą na piętro jego własnego domu i zastanawia się, czy powinien doszukiwać się w tym jakichś podtekstów, czy zrzucić to na karb przypadkowości. - Jeśli masz ochotę mi coś zarzucić, proszę bardzo, nie obrażę się, tylko określ jasno, co tak naprawdę ci zawadza. Arthur wzdycha i odkłada opasły tom na miękkie obicie kanapy, zaznaczając strony, na których się zatrzymał - Eames marszczy brwi i wytyka sobie impulsywną bezpośredniość, zakładając z góry, że Arthur weźmie to za mechanizm obronny i zacznie rozgrzebywać jego umysł, w poszukiwaniu odpowiedzi - Eames boi się tego, co architekt może w nim znaleźć. - Przypuszczam, że obawiasz się śnić własnymi snami, dlatego przejmujesz cudze. - W ustach Arthura brzmi to naturalnie i przez moment Eames pragnie obrócić tę rozmowę w żart; nie może się skupić, nie może zmusić swojego serca do spowolnienia swej pracy, nie kiedy Arthur patrzy i ocenia, patrzy i kalkuluje, źrenice przeciągają się leniwie po twarzy towarzysza - Arthur zawsze obserwuje, rzadko jednak dociera do słusznych konkluzji - to Cobb był zawsze tym, który studiował poszczególne sceny z życia, jakby oglądał film, klatka po klatce, a potem dochodził do logicznych wniosków, często nieodbiegających znacznie od rzeczywistości, z jaką przyszło im się zmierzyć. - Jestem aktorem, skarbie, nie złodziejem. - Eames posiada w swym zawodowym dorobku jedną, znaczącą zaletę - potrafi kłamać nie lepiej, niż zmieniać we śnie konfigurację własnego ciała, które przekształca, jak twór z modeliny; Eames, trzeba przyznać, afiszuje się własną umiejętnością, potrafiąc zrzucać skórę, jak wąż, dostosowywać się do tła jak kameleon; Arthur nieraz spogląda na jego zacierające się we śnie kontury i zastanawia się, jak to możliwe, że nie kłóci to się z jego poczuciem humanitarności. - Wszyscy jesteśmy złodziejami, póki działamy jako zespół w tej rzadkiej profesji - stwierdza Arthur tonem znawcy, a Eames przewraca oczami, bawiąc się fałszywym żetonem, podrzucając nim w powietrzu, jak szczęśliwą monetą. - To tak jakbyś namiętnie szukał kłamcy w dziennikarskim gronie, jak igły w stogu siana, podczas gdy roi się tam od krętaczy, jak od much plujek wokół rozkładających się zwłok. - Zawsze musisz sprostować moim słowom, Arthurze? - Eames kręci głową, czując niesmak rozchodzący się po jego ciele, jak trucizna; architekt zdaje się kuriozalnie zadowolony z kapitulacji swego rozmówcy - Czasami boje się, że zapomnisz, że jesteś zwiadowcą, nie filozofem. - Ja mam czasami wrażenie, że to ty zapominasz, że jesteś fałszerzem, nie kłamcą. Eames, całkowicie nie przejąwszy się rzuconą mu w twarz obelgą, chowa do kieszeni swój fałszywy żeton i podnosi wzrok na Arthura. - To, kim jesteśmy, nie jest czarno-białe - mówi Eames wzruszając ramionami. - Przeważnie objawia się w wielu odcieniach szarości; Sądziłem, że usłyszę od ciebie coś w ten deseń, skarbie. Zawodowy zwiadowca spogląda na Eames'a jakby do tej pory patrzył jedynie poprzez niego i teraz kiedy wreszcie zwrócił ku niemu swój wzrok, ujrzał coś, na co nigdy nie zwracał większej uwagi - doświadczenie - bije z fałszerza, jak fala ultradźwiękowa, razi intensywnością, jak błyskawica na tle czarnego nieba. Artur wpija w kompana oskarżycielskie spojrzenie, czując irytację, łaskoczącą jego układ nerwowy, jak seria iskier padających z zimnych ogni. - Ludzie rozumieją potrzebę ochrony snów. Ludzie wiedzą, że są indywidualną własnością śniącego i że nie zawsze mają do nich prawo. Eames uśmiecha się, jak dziecko z gangu młodzieżowego i zaciera ręce, jakby szykował się do największego spisku ostatniego stulecia. - Ja nie - oznajmia, przysiadając się na drugi skraj elegancko obitej kanapy, a Arthur, bardziej z poczucia osaczenia, niż z czegokolwiek innego, cicho i spokojnie stwierdza, że nikt ze śniących nie obchodzi go tak bardzo, jak on sam. Eames śmieje się w odpowiedzi, mimo iż Arthur nie potrafi doszukać się w swej wypowiedzi niczego zabawnego i spogląda Zwiadowcy prosto w oczy. - Ależ obchodzą cię - mówi Fałszerz z figlarnym błyskiem w spojrzeniu. - I to o wiele bardziej i o wiele dłużej, niż miałbyś odwagę się do tego przyznać. -VVV- Kiedy w pewien mroźny, zimowy wieczór rozpalają ceglany kominek, Eames otwiera wino i Arthur - konserwatywny, formalistyczny Arthur - pije zbyt dużo. - Jestem kłamcą - przyznaje, patrząc w sufit, który faluje mu przed oczami. - Kradnę ludziom sny. Eames wychyla resztkę szkarłatnego alkoholu migającego do Arthur'a z przeźroczystego kieliszka. - Taki jest twój sposób na życie, złotko. Arthur układa głowę na ozdobnej poduszce, przymykając powieki. - Twoje oczy - mówi; jego wzrok błądzi gdzieś daleko, ale słowa nie lepią się do siebie i nie tworzą niepojętego trajkotu zalanego pijaczyny - są wyraźne i dźwięczne jak nigdy przedtem. - Są niezgłębione. I odbija się w nich ogień. To jakaś sztuczka wprawnego aktora? Eames uśmiecha się szeroko, tłumiąc salwy rozbawienia, które uparcie próbują wydostać się dźwięcznie z głębin jego gardła. - Żadna sztuczka. Efekt wizualny. Wrażenie optyczne. - Refleksy światła na rogówce. Tęczowe miraże. Bezkształtne zwidy - wtóruje sennie Arthur. - Lepiej bym tego nie ujął, skarbie. Zwiadowca przeciąga się i uchyla jedno oko. - Zaprojektowałem nowy labirynt. Jest lepszy od poprzedniego. Nieprzystępny. Uśmiech schodzi z ust Eames'a, kiedy kręci głową i unosi dłonie w obronnym geście. - Nie zamierzam być więcej twoim królikiem doświadczalnym, złotko. Arthur uśmiecha się niewyraźnie, a ciążące powieki ponownie opadają na oczy. - Nie narzekaj. - Słowa poprzedza przeciągłe ziewnięcie. - To ciekawe miejsce. Przyjazne. Eames sięga nad głową Arthur'a po gruby koc leżący na oparciu kanapy i przykrywa opadające z sił ciało. - Twoje konstrukcje architektoniczne z samej definicji nie bywają przyjaznymi miejscami. Niezmierzonymi? Monumentalnymi? Błyskotliwymi? Owszem - ale nigdy przyjaznymi - skarży się na wizje architekta, ale nie uzyskuje już żadnej odpowiedzi - gruby koc faluje równomiernym rytmem pod dyktando głębokich oddechów przemierzających korytarze dróg oddechowych śniącego, pierwszy raz od miesięcy własnymi snami, Arthur'a. -VVV- - Nie powinieneś tu wracać. To niebezpieczne miejsce - mówi Arthur z przyganą, chociaż nie musi. - To twoje miejsce - odpowiada Eames, niewzruszenie rozglądając się po wysokich wieżowcach sięgających chmur. - Chciałem tu wrócić. - Miałem zamiar ukazać ci całkowicie inny poziom snu. - Arthur krzywi się, gdy podłużna limuzyna przejeżdża obok nich i znika pospiesznie za najbliższym zakrętem - srebrne światła odbijają się na ciemnym asfalcie. - To faza REM. Nie panuje nad nią. Eames prostuje palce, by rozruszać stawy - ten gest zdaje się zupełnie obcy na jego dłoniach, nieistniejący w prawdziwym świecie. - Wobec tego może być ciekawie, nieprawdaż? - podchwytuje natychmiast Aktor, gotów na przechadzkę po podświadomości Zwiadowcy. Zanim zdąży zrobić krok, czuje lodowaty chłód metalu w ustach i orientuje się, że stojący naprzeciw mężczyzna wpycha mu właśnie zimną lufę do gardła. Eames patrzy w oczy Arthur'a - te chłodne, nastawione na bilans zysków i strat źrenice. Arthur - myśli Eames - w snach tak bezwzględny, pełen zdecydowania Arthur, który uśmiecha się uśmiechem szakala i patrzy oczami zwierzęcia mroku; Arthur - za dnia oficjalny, układny biznesmen, w ukryciu sennych urojeń niebezpieczny drapieżnik nieznający wahania. - Nie kradnij moich snów - ostrzega, jego głos wibruje, jak warkot dzikiego zwierzęcia. - Nie masz do nich prawa. Eames spodziewa się szumiącego w uszach huku wystrzału, jednak kula nie nadchodzi, a zamiast tego znika posmak lodowatego metalu. Lufa zostaje przyciśnięta do jego szyi. - Nie masz do nich prawa - powtarza Arthur, jego oczy migoczą, jak rozbłyski sztucznych ogni. - Tak, jak Cobb nie miał prawa do wizji swojej żony. Eames uśmiecha się sceptycznie, palce sięgają po broń trzymaną przez Artura, ale on zręcznie unika przechwyceniu pistoletu. - Rozumiem, że w tym śnie, jesteś sędzią, skarbie? Bez obrońcy staniem sami - któż zlituje się nad nami? Kyrie elejson! - Co tu robisz? - pyta Arthur, ignorując gładki przytyk kompana - jego oczy tak blisko - płynne srebro wlewa się w źrenice Eames'a przyprawiając o zawrót głowy. Lufa pistoletu napiera na jego skórę. Eames milczy; zimne pęta ściskają jego wnętrzności. Eames patrzy i widzi; przez kilka chwil - Arthur o prawdziwej twarzy, przez kilka sekund - Arthur bez maski. Zwiadowca przeładowuje magazynek, a Aktor uśmiecha się ponuro. - Wiesz co? - mówi Eames niemalże obojętnym tonem - niemalże, ponieważ zdradza go lekkie drżenie głosu na złączu poszczególnych sylab. - Lubię cię takim. Zwiadowca uśmiecha się chłodno, ale ręka trzymająca broń nie opada ani o milimetry. - Jesteś absurdalny - ocenia; jego oczy odwracają się na moment i Arthur obserwuje kilka długich chwil spiralne schody ciągnące się (całkowicie absurdalnie) wokół jednego z nowocześniejszych, przeszklonych wieżowców, przez którego szyby połyskujące w słońcu widać rzędy eleganckich biur krzyczących innowacyjnością. Aktor podąża za jego spojrzeniem i unosi wymownie brwi. - Nigdy nie lubiłem tych schodów - przyznaje Eames. - Po większej libacji alkoholowej stają się przeszkodą nie do pokonania. Arthur wzrusza ramionami. - Wydawały mi się nieprzystępne - oznajmia gładko, lecz za jego słowami kryje się coś więcej. Eames, wiedziony nagłą chwilą natchnienia (choć Arthur powiedziałby, że to zdecydowanie przypomina kretynizm), wyciąga rękę i chwyta Zwiadowcę za nadgarstek. Arthur spogląda na palce Eamsa, jakby w jego skórze skryty był szyfr, na którego rozwiązanie zostało mu niewiele czasu. - W snach możemy spróbować - proponuje nieśmiało (gdzież się podziała twoja brawura, niezłomny kuglarzu?); Zwiadowca podnosi wzrok i zaciska wargi tak mocno, że jego skóra blednie w okolicach ust. - Spróbujmy. Arthur - rozważający najdrobniejsze detale, Arthur - dbający o prawidłowość w konfiguracjach sennych, Arthur - kierujący się zawsze rozsądkiem mówi nie i nie wiadomo skąd wyciąga swojego Glock'a; dwie lufy - jedna większa, druga mniejsza - celują w pierś Eames'a, jak świetliste, neonowe wskaźniki. Aktor zamyka oczy. Pociski dziurawią jego piersiową klatkę, jak materiałowego manekina, pozostawiając po sobie dymiące, ziejące pustką otwory. -VVV- Jest kłótnia. Jest opanowanie, które chwieje się i kruszy, a potem roztrzaskuje na podłogowych mozaikach. Jest trzask zamykanych drzwi. Eames stoi w bezruchu i patrzy na schody - błahą, kuriozalną zgubę Arthur'a. Jest dźwięk tłuczonego szkła, gdy para przeźroczystych kieliszków gwałtownie zderza się ze środkowymi stopniami. Są bordowe krople skapujące na podłogę, jak krew. -VVV- - Czego się boisz? - pyta Arthur własnego odbicia. Mężczyzna z lustra patrzy na niego sceptycznie i chłodno. Arthur zastanawia się, czy takim właśnie widzi go Eames. - Czego się boisz? - powtarza ostrzej, ale odbicie pozostaje nieme. -VVV- Arthur przystępuje do tworzenia nowego labiryntu. Zamek z kamienia o wysokich kondygnacjach i jeszcze wyższych wieżach pnie się pod nieboskłon jak odzwierciedlenie perfekcji. Jaskrawe witraże mienią się kolorytem tęczy, a rozłożyste żyrandole rozrzucają ciepłe światło po kątach eleganckiego wnętrza. Arthur zasiedla przestrzeń licznym tłumem dystyngowanych projekcji - rozglądając się wokoło, słysząc zewsząd stukot wysokich obcasów i szmer poprawianych krawatów nie potrafi pojąć, dlaczego czuje się wśród nich tak bardzo samotnie. -VVV- - Wolisz wino włoskie, czy francuskie? - Eames przechodzi przez drzwi, jakby był u siebie i na domiar złego nie ściąga butów - śnieg lepiący się do podeszwy moczy Arthur'owi podłogę. Zwiadowca patrzy krytycznie na plamę roztapiającego się, białego puchu, ale nie komentuje barbarzyństwa swojego gościa. - Wole whisky z lodem - odpowiada, spoglądając na etykiety przyklejone do butelek. - Ale Chardonnay'em nie pogardzę - dodaje, a Eames uśmiecha się, jakby wygrał główną pulę na loterii. Arthur - zawsze opanowany Arthur - spogląda w twarz Eames'a z gorącym wyrzutem. - Wydawało mi się, że już nie wrócisz. - Oskarżenie ześlizguje się z jego języka jak kostka lodu. - Wydawało mi się, że nie będziesz chciał mnie widzieć. Eames mruga kokieteryjnie do Zwiadowcy i podaje mu wskazaną przezeń butelkę. - Pozory mylą, skarbie. Arthur idzie za Eames'em do własnej kuchni i patrzy, jak ten opiera się leniwie o blat. - Więc zostajesz? - pyta, marszcząc czoło, a Aktor śmieje się ciepło i szczerze; Arthur czuje, jak to ciepło wsiąka w jego ciało i rozlewa się po jego żyłach, jak płynna czekolada. - Tak łatwo się mnie nie pozbędziesz, Arthurze. Zwiadowca przygląda się przez chwilę drugiemu mężczyźnie, po czym podchodzi do szafek i sięga po kieliszki do jednej z górnych półek. Eames jest tutaj i Arthur ma nadzieje, że ten stan rzeczy nie ulegnie szybkiej dekonstrukcji. - Jest pan całkowicie kuriozalny, panie Eames - mówi Zwiadowca z zawodowym drygiem w tonie głosu, wygładzając ruchem dłoni nieułożone włosy, po czym wyciąga z jednej z szuflad korkociąg i otwiera pękatą, barwioną butelkę. - Bez kuriozalności nie istniałyby sny, słońce - mówi Aktor poprzez dźwięk wpadającego do kieliszków, szkarłatnego wina. - To wyjątkowe szczęście, że ty, tak bardzo interesujący się złożonością niemożliwego, trafiłeś właśnie na mnie. Śmiem twierdzić, że nie poradziłbyś sobie beze mnie na łamach sennych. Arthur uśmiecha się pod nosem i podaje Eames'owi kieliszek z winem. Eames unosi szklane naczynie w geście toastu. - Za łamanie konwenansów - składa toast, mrugając do Arthura zza pełnego kieliszka. - Za osiągnięcie niemożliwego - spokojnie dopowiada Zwiadowca, unosząc naczynie do ust. -VVV- W snach Arthur stoi wraz z Eames'em gdzieś w centrum wielkiego miasta przepełnionego szklanymi wieżowcami i krętymi ulicami ciągnącymi się po horyzonty jak odgałęzienia rzeczne. Na niebie świeci gorące słońce, grzejąc przyjemnie długimi promieniami ich łaknące ciepła twarze. Budynki stoją tuż nad brzegiem rozległego oceanu, którego końców nie widać - zacieranie granic jest specjalnością Arthur'a - myśli Eames, ruszając wraz ze Zwiadowcą szeroką, dwupasmową ulicą, na której brak jakichkolwiek samochodów. Gdzieś na wschód od nich wznoszą się do nieba długie, stabilne, kręcone schody. ","Summary":" Schody Dzieło architektoniczne najpierw powstaje na kartce papieru jako szkic.

Wpatrzona w świat oczyma młodego architekta kreującego wizję na imaginacji, na skąpym podobieństwie do rzeczywistości, zafascynowana salwą barw i kształtów, które swe istnienie zawdzięczają przeważnie wygórowanej wyobraźni. Nie dostrzegając ryzyka, jakim jest naginanie cudzego umysłu pod własne dyktando, nie rozumie, że nie wszystko może zostać stworzone bezkarnie, że czasem architektowi przychodzi zapłacić srogą cenę za własną omyłkę. Arthur spogląda w jej ciemne oczy i widzi w nich ten sam dreszcz fascynacji, który odczuwał on sam, projektując sny mające się stać ich labiryntem Minotaura po opuszczeniu powiek i otwarciu umysłu i ten sam strach, czający się w głębi podświadomości, strach przed nieznanym, przed zatraceniem się w nierzeczywistości i zapomnieniem o realnym świecie. Arthur widzi to wszystko i milczy, kiedy pewność na twarzy Cobb\\'a wzbudza w nim niepojęte wątpliwości co do celowości najnowszego zlecenia. A potem ukrywa twarz w dłoniach i myśli, że są zgubieni. -VVV- „Nieskończone schody. Widzisz? Niemożliwość. Pętla jak ta tutaj pozwala ukryć granice tworzonego snu\". poziom pierwszy Ariadne ma otwarte sny. Nie istnieją w nich ograniczenia, droga przez iglastą połać lasu światła ciągnie się daleko w głąb, prosta, niezawiła, prowadząca gościa za rękę w najdalsze czeluści fantasmagorii. Arthur, idąc wzdłuż ścieżki, nie czuje najniklejszego muśnięcia wiatru na swojej skórze, jakby znajdował się w głębokiej próżni, słońce wiszące wysoko razi go w oczy i mruży powieki, czując palący żar promieni. Sny Ariadne są bezludne. Arthur rozgląda się za najmniejszym drgnięciem ludzkiego cienia, lecz niczego nie dostrzega. Marszczy chude, eleganckie brwi, zastanawiając się, jak bardzo można być samotnym wśród ludzi, skoro w zamknięciu czterech ścian własnego zacisza wypiera się z umysłu ich istnienie. Środkiem lasu biegnie rzeka, która wcale nią nie jest, płynie bezszelestnie pasmami srebra i bieli, jakby była stworzona z morskiej piany, z płatków śniegu i tysiąca małych pereł, iskrzących się w słońcu jak krople rosy otulającej trawę. Na rzece kołysze się łódka, będąca powiększoną kopią połówki łupiny od orzecha. Arthur muska opuszkami palców jej ścianki i cofa pospiesznie rękę, gdy odkrywa, że wyglądająca na gładką i niezarysowaną strukturę, skorupa ma w rzeczywistości niespodziewanie chropowatą powierzchnię. Zanim mężczyzna zdąży uczynić coś więcej, rzeka rozstępuje się na poły, połykając małą, bezbronną szalupę, zalewając ją połaciami płynnego złota. Łódka przez chwilę walczy z niszczycielską siłą, zanim odda się z rezygnacją przestrzeniom lepkiej, gęstej cieczy. Arthur patrzy w milczeniu w miejsce, gdzie jeszcze przed chwilą istniała materialna antymateria i opuszcza rękę, gdy powłoka rzeki zakrywa się pajęczyną kruchego lodu, rozciągającego się po połaciach srebra z szybkością rozprzestrzeniającej się zarazy. Kiedy czuje palącą, jak ogień, kroplę padającą na jego dłoń, unosi palce do oczu z obojętnym zainteresowaniem i przygląda się, jak wypala ona dymiącą ranę na jego bladej skórze. Arthur spogląda w górę na czerwony deszcz siarki, który roztapia go tak, jak płomienie liżące twarz woskowego manekina. Uśmiecha się gorzko i myśli, że wolałby raczej szybką kulkę wycelowaną we własną czaszkę. To nie bolałoby nawet w najmniejszym stopniu tak, jak ten powolny, ostry jak ukłucie setek igieł, powrót do realu. -VVV- „Każdy poziom ma odniesienie do obszaru podświadomości, który zinfiltrujemy\". poziom drugi Arthur spada. Leci w czarną toń nieprzejrzystej wody, a pęd świszczącego w uszach powietrza, poraża jego zdolność postrzegania i tworzenia jednocześnie. Zanim jednak uderzy w powierzchnię oceanu jak w beton, wstęga srebrnego aksamitu rozkłada się pod jego ciałem i zaciska wokół jego nadgarstków jak kajdany. A potem wzlatuje wraz z nim, rozkładając się na powierzchniach wiatru niczym ogromne skrzydła drapieżnego ptaka. Mężczyzna nie zauważa momentu, w którym jego stopy stykają się z trwałym gruntem. - Jestem architektem własnych snów, Arthurze. - Chłodne usta Ariadne muskają jego czoło, ciemne oczy mienią się odblaskami technikoloru. - Nauczę cię śnić własnymi snami, jeśli tylko pozwolisz mi się poprowadzić. Ariadne chwyta jego dłoń, a on spogląda na nią z niepewnością dziecka, jakby to ona była nauczycielem, a on uczniem. Kobieta z lekkością dobiera ścieżki, wodząc Arthura z łagodnością łabędzia i zdecydowaniem lwa poprzez korytarze labiryntu. Prowadzi go ku dębowej szafie, która otwiera się na lekkie skinienie jej palców na połaciach przestrzeni. Dłonie suną po zakurzonych półkach, wzbijając w powietrze obłoki pyłu, które majaczą w smętnym świetle chwiejącej się na samym kablu żarówki jak iskry tańczące koło ogniska. Podaje mu kryształowy flakonik, a chłód naczynia kuje palce Arthura jak scyzoryki. Mężczyzna powolnym ruchem odkorkowuje buteleczkę i patrząc w piękne, ciemne oczy Ariadne, przytyka ją do ust. Gorzki posmak trucizny pali mu gardło; przez moment ma wrażenie, że rozżarzone węgle atakują jego tchawice. Opiera się o kamienną ścianę, która okazuje się mieć niepojęcie miękkie obicie. Ariadne podchodzi do niego i wspina się na palce. Ostatnim, co pamięta Arthur, są słodkie usta zbierające czarne krople trucizny z jego suchych warg. -VVV- „Przychodzą tu, żeby się obudzić\". poziom X Jest środek balu. Orkiestra uderza w powolne nuty, a zmęczone tłumy usuwają się z parkietu, aby odpocząć. Otwarty sufit uwidacznia wysoki firmament gwiazd, które śmieją się melodyjnie jak słowiki. Ariadne podchodzi do samotnie sączącego whisky, eleganckiego mężczyzny, stojącego przy wysokim oknie, zapatrzonego w dal zamyślonym, nieobecnym wzrokiem. Kobieta podąża za jego spojrzeniem, dostrzegając majestatyczne pasma górskich szczytów zalanych bladą poświatą księżyca w pełni. - Co tam widzisz? Arthur uśmiecha się delikatnie i nie spoglądając w jej stronę, szepcze miękko: - Labirynt. Ariadne przygryza wargi i opuszkami palców dotyka jego ramienia. - To nie jest fikcja, Arthurze. Mężczyzna śmieje się cicho, wygładzając mankiety rękawów śnieżnobiałej koszuli. - Wszystko jest fikcją. Cała materia, która cię otacza. Jest wykreowana przez ludzką wyobraźnię. Co ją odróżnia od snu, moja droga? - Brak symbolizmu. Życie. Bicie mojego serca. - Ariadne zerka na niego spod kaskady rzęs, rzucających drżące cienie na jej policzki. - Twoja podświadomość tworzy własne projekcje. Mają one swój kształt, swoje cechy, swój charakter, w większości nawet swoje imiona. Mimo to tak naprawdę są pustą skorupą wypełnioną twoją własną osobowością. Nie można całego życia spędzić jedynie z samym sobą, Arthurze, bo przyjdzie człowiekowi oszaleć. Arthur uśmiecha się do Ariadne. - Jesteś gotowa podjąć własną działalność. Jesteś gotowa samoistnie tworzyć i przekształcać to, co już stworzone. Jesteś wykwalifikowanym, zdolnym architektem, Ariadne. Nie zapominaj o tym. Muzyka płynie powoli jak krople deszczu po szybach, poświata księżyca tworzy niebiesko-białą aureolę na szerokim parkiecie. Arthur wyciąga dłoń w stronę kobiety, jej długa suknia szeleści, oplatając się wokół kostek, gdy odwraca się, by na niego spojrzeć. - Zatańcz ze mną - szepcze Arthur. - Zatańcz ze mną po raz ostatni. Oboje wiedzą, że to pożegnanie. Ariadne czuje kującą stratę gdzieś w głębi gardła, jej oczy promienieją żalem. Wkłada drobną dłoń w jego własną i przymyka powieki. - Z wielką radością, Arthurze. Ariadne jest planetą, a Arthur jej jedynym księżycem. Jej zwiewna suknia obija się o ich kostki jak cień, jak wiatr. Mężczyzna wplata palce w długie, ciemne włosy kobiety i wdycha jej zapach, jakby jedynie nim pragną oddychać już zawsze. Kobieta płynie jak rzeka poprzez parkiet, prowadzona przez zdecydowane drgania palców Arthura. Jakby była dla niego instrumentem, którego dźwięków uczy się na pamięć, szarpiąc delikatnie za struny. Mężczyzna pochyla się nad jej przepełnioną smutkiem twarzą i scałowuje łzy z jej kości policzkowych. Ariadne puszcza jego dłoń. Muzyka cichnie. Ariadne odchodzi w pośpiechu niczym księżniczka uciekająca z balu. Arthur patrzy na mignięcie czerwonej jak płatki róży, jak usta dokładnie pokryte szminką, sukni znikającej jak rzeka z ich wspólnego snu, z ich wspólnego raju. Kiedy zamyka oczy, pod powiekami widzi przebłysk brązu jej miękkich włosów i kłujący błysk jej ciemnych oczu. Muzyka zanika.

It was just a few days, and Arthur had a hard time turning down anywhere warm, so he agreed, and left the planning to Eames. Eames decided on St. Vincent, in a place more village than town where he\\'d landed by accident once before. The people there were kind and not too curious, the weather was perfect, the sea was smooth, and he\\'d always been fascinated by the black sand. They stayed in what Eames swore to Arthur was an AirBnB, but was really an abandoned fishing shack. He figured it wouldn\\'t matter that they didn\\'t have deluxe accommodations, as they\\'d mostly lay on the beach and have sex-hard even for Arthur to find fault with that. The trip went exactly as Eames envisioned. For four days, they slept late, kissed ridiculously often, and were always sticky with breadfruit and carambola. Arthur\\'s slavish devotion to SFP 70 kept him from burning, and Eames\\' skin took on a dark golden glow. They drank Harouin beer all afternoon. On the first day, Arthur abandoned his pomade. By the third, he let his laptop battery die. On their last night on the island, Eames insisted they join a small party of locals having a bonfire on the beach. They cooked fish over the open flames and ate it with their hands, and a bong went around the small circle again and again. Eames was fairly neutral on the subject of marijuana-he\\'d smoke when it came up, but never really sought it out. He was surprised to see Arthur hesitate for a moment, then grab the bong, rather than waving it past. As he sputtered around his first awkward hit and handed the bong to Eames, Eames couldn\\'t help the sudden wave of affection that washed over him. This infuriating, brilliant, beautiful man, smoking pot on a beach with him. He wanted to laugh, but that may have just been at Arthur\\'s choking on the smoke. Hours later, the party long disbanded, Arthur and Eames were still on the sand, watching the dark ocean. They\\'d both smoked more than they\\'d intended, and neither of them felt inclined to move anytime soon. Arthur was sitting with his knees pulled up, his arms wrapped around them, like a child. Eames lay on this back, facing the sky, mindless of the sand in his hair. They\\'d been quiet for quite a while, their conversation dying down naturally and comfortably. Eames thought he should say something, tell Arthur what a fun trip it had been, and how much he appreciated being trusted with the planning, and Arthur being willing to be flexible about what he considered a vacation. He didn\\'t say anything, though. He could tell Arthur tomorrow. When Arthur spoke, his voice was quiet and melodic, matching the gentle lapping of the waves. \"Was Polly the first time you ever fell in love?\" It wasn\\'t a question Eames expected. Arthur hadn\\'t mentioned Polly at all on this trip, which seemed a blessing. Still, if he wanted to talk about her now, Eames wasn\\'t going to refuse him. After everything she\\'d tried, and the ways Eames fucked up, Arthur had a right to ask his questions. He tried to concentrate on his answer, though his head was still clouded. \"No,\" he said, thinking back. \"I was in secondary the first time I fell in love.\" \"High school love doesn\\'t count,\" Arthur snorted. \"Oh, but it does,\" Eames said. \"Nothing will break your heart like love that early. That\\'s when you still believe in fairy tales.\" Arthur shook his head. \"That wasn\\'t what I was asking…\" Eames laughed. \"Do you want to hear this story, or not?\" Arthur sighed. \"Sure. Yes. Tell me about your high school sweetheart.\" Eames made a displeased noise, but continued. \"His name was James. He was a completely unremarkable lad. Average height, sandy haired, freckled. He was quiet and a good student and no trouble…\" \"The opposite of you, then?\" \"Precisely. And I adored him. Being gay was more of a problem then, of course, but he was always just sort of fine with it. We were both inexperienced, but we figured it out.\" \"What happened?\" Eames groaned. \"I happened. Fought with my parents, ran away to the city, didn\\'t look back. Never so much as a phone call.\" \"Jesus, that\\'s cold.\" Eames was pleased that Arthur at least sounded surprised. \"Yeah. I regret it to this day. But young and completely self-centered, you know? I loved him, but nothing was as important to me as getting out and becoming somebody else.\" Arthur nodded. After a moment, Eames began again. \"Next, I fell in love with Stella. I was in London, running short cons, picking pockets, getting into trouble. She was older-seemed a lot older then, but I think she must have been about the age I am now. She was a fence and a bookie, connected to one of the big outfits, but I\\'m not sure how.\" \"Wait, how old were you?\" \"Seventeen, maybe eighteen?\\' \"And she was forty?\" \"Near there, anyway.\" \"Good God. OK, go on.\" \"I was head over fucking heels. She was amazing. She taught me everything I ever learned about how to please a woman, and I was completely, utterly devoted to her.\" He sighed, remembering. \"God, she was a viper.\" \"What happened with that?\" \"She got bored. I think she enjoyed playing teacher, but I was a kid. I didn\\'t hold her interest.\" Eames glanced over at Arthur, who was watching him seriously. \"I was fucking heartbroken. Absolutely crushed. Looking back, it was pathetic, but at the time,\" he shook his head, \"it was everything.\" \"And then?\" Arthur prompted. \"Then I learned to fuck around and not get so attached, for a while,\" Eames said. \"When I joined up, started traveling, I had a lot of fun. But I met someone, an officer, when I had just been promoted to Corporal. Completely in the closet. Married, kids, the whole thing. And it was Stella all over again, only this time with a lot more getting my ass pounded.\" Arthur laughed. Eames was grateful for the sound. He wasn\\'t terribly keen on going this far into his memories. \"His name was Daniel-Danny. It didn\\'t last too long. It was a dead end and we both knew it, but once again, I learned a lot and was completely devoted. I was still young, and so full of myself. I thought I could give him some kind of ultimatum.\" \"Like, ask him to leave his wife?\" Eames chuckled. \"Yeah. Can you believe that? Needless to say, that ended it.\" He sat up so he could meet Arthur\\'s gaze. \"Not the greatest history, I guess.\" He paused, considering. \"Much later, there was a girl, in Mombasa. A Kenyan girl. I could have fallen in love with her. She was too young, and too sweet. And I was still to broken.\" He shrugged. \"Polly?\" Arthur asked. \"Polly,\" Eames confirmed. \"Though I was obsessed with her before I knew she was Polly. And there were lots of others, in between. But nobody really stuck. Lots of two week whirlwinds.\" Arthur tilted his head back and looked at the sky. Eames waited for him to ask another question, but he didn\\'t seem inclined to do so for quite some time. Finally, he looked at Eames again. \"It\\'s always been easy for you, then? Falling in love?\" Eames thought about it. \"Yeah. I mean, I\\'ve never done it on purpose. It\\'s always just happened. It\\'s like an auto accident I see coming, but can\\'t avoid. Easier to get in than to get out, anyway.\" Arthur nodded quietly. \"What about you?\" Eames asked. It was unlikely Arthur would tell him much of anything, but since they were here, and sharing secrets, it was worth a try. \"When was the first time you fell in love?\" \"It\\'s just been the one time,\" Arthur said, looking for a moment as if he\\'d intended to say something else but decided against it. \"I was...22, I think? In the Marines, but before dreamshare. His name was Shane.\" He spoke quickly. \"This was during Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell. It was a big secret with a lot of drama. I\\'d been with people before, of course, but this was so much more...intense.\" Eames nodded. \"What happened?\" Arthur shrugged. \"It was too much. All the worry and sneaking around. I called it off. It would have ended badly anyway.\" \"Ever practical,\" Eames mused, lying back down on the sand. \"I guess. In your terms, I saw the accident coming, and I swerved.\" Arthur shrugged. \"After that?\" \"I\\'ve had boyfriends, but nothing that wasn\\'t easy to let go of. Once I got started in dream share, it seemed like so much work to hide it.\" Arthur shrugged. \"I wasn\\'t sure it would ever be worth it.\" Eames noticed how small he looked in this position, his shoulders hunched over his knees. For a long time, they both went quiet again. Eames wasn\\'t sure what Arthur was thinking, but he felt unspoken words in the air. He wasn\\'t going to say it-he might never say it. Though he didn\\'t often think about Stella or James or Danny, he still thought about Polly and what she\\'d done to him far too often to invite it back into this life. Still, looking at Arthur next to him, and thinking of the last days, and of the last weeks, and even of the months before that, he wasn\\'t sure he was going to be able to resist it. The accident was in front of him once again, and he knew he could jerk the wheel, he still had time, but he didn\\'t want to. Maybe it would be different this time, with this man. If he stayed the course, he had faith that Arthur would stay it with him, would ride with him wherever it took them. ","Summary":" The beach vacation was Eames\\' idea.

Starry Night It was about four in the morning, judging by the hint of light at the very edge of the sky. Arthur had woken up needing a glass of water and had taken the time to peer past the curtains, taking in a view of the city at night. London was still alive, if somewhat quieter in the early hours. On his arm his soulmark shone brightly, Ursa Major twinkling upon the pale skin. The stars closest to the bedroom outshone the others, but it was still vibrant, as alive as the city lights. Arthur smiled to himself, finished the water, and slipped back into the bedroom. Eames was sprawled across the mattress, snoring lightly. Aquila, his soulmark, ran across his shoulders, the tail of the bird settled just above his right hip. The stars closest to Arthur glowed in the darkness of the room and he was tempted to trace every inch of his mark on Eames. But it was late and they were both worn out from earlier exertions. He satisfied himself with a long look and thoughts of what they\\'d do when they were both awake once more. Arthur grabbed the sheets from where they\\'d fallen to the floor and crawled onto the bed, settling himself in the curve of Eames\\' body. Eames was a furnace, but Arthur liked to cover them both, at least pretend at dignity. He ran his hand over the curve of Eames\\' arse before pulling the sheet up, the cotton cool against his skin. \"Mmm, Arthur?\" Eames murmured, shifting restlessly. \"Right here,\" Arthur replied, brushing his lips across Eames\\' cheek. Eames grumbled and wormed his way closer, arms folding around Arthur\\'s body and pulling him near. He settled his face upon Arthur\\'s shoulder, pinning Arthur to the bed with his body, and sighed. \"Night,\" Eames said and his breathing evened out, appearing to fall asleep once more. It was probably for the best, because Arthur couldn\\'t keep the smug smile off his face. He closed his eyes, enjoying the warm glow of Eames\\' love and affection, and let himself drift off, content.

He lay in bed, listening to the bleeping of the alarm for a moment, before reaching over, ripping it from the wall and chucking at the door. It fell to the floor with a satisfying crash. Arthur rolled over, buried his head beneath the pillows, and tried to get back to sleep. Perhaps he\\'d wake up and it would no longer be the miserable Thursday he\\'d been living on repeat. He didn\\'t hold out much hope, however. Half an hour later, his phoned buzzed. Without checking, Arthur knew that it was a text from Eames. Good morning, darling! Usually, he ignored it. Today was meant to be the day he was destined to meet his soulmate; he didn\\'t want to spend it answering text messages. Scientists still weren\\'t sure why \\'fate\\' or \\'destiny\\' chose that one particular day for a person to relive, waking up the same morning again and again until they encountered their \\'one true love\\'. The closest they\\'d come was an assumption that it meant a person had matured emotionally, and was in the right mind set to meet their soulmate, or some such rubbish. Today was his fifty-third repeat. He\\'d still not had any damn luck actually meeting his soulmate, and honestly, he\\'d grown weary of it. After all, he\\'d keep on reliving these twenty-four hours until he found them, whoever they were. Frustratingly, it could be anyone – someone that Arthur knew intimately, or someone that he\\'d never met before. Fifty-three times was a long time to live a day in which he ultimately achieved nothing. Arthur yawned and curled the sheets around him further, stretching out one hand to snap up his phone. As he\\'d done every morning since realising that he was living his day on repeat, he bought a lottery ticket with the winning number and placed several bets. Was it truly gambling if he knew what the outcome would be? One day, he hoped, he\\'d break free from the loop, and when he did he planned on being wealthy. Well, wealthier. Frankly, he was surprised that more people didn\\'t do this. Technically, it was illegal, but Arthur operated in quasi-legal territory at best. Bets made, Arthur checked the news. It was exactly the same as yesterday and the fifty or so days before. There was a car bombing in Yemen, a missing painting in the Louvre, and yet another social media website was being thrown under the bus for using their member\\'s data without their permission. His phone buzzed again and Arthur bit back a smile. Undoubtedly it would be Eames, following up his initial greeting with the same picture he\\'d sent each morning; an image of the sea, the sun glinting off it, white sand and palms trees. An idyllic scene, not one unlike what Arthur saw when he looked out of the window of his hotel room. He tapped on the message and there they were, Eames\\' initial text and the following photo. Some things never changed. He rolled out of bed and padded over to the desk, powering up his laptop. As the software loaded he placed a call down to room service, ordering coffee and French toast. He sipped coffee as he plugged in his phone, tracing Eames\\' number. Why the hell not? Eames was close… suspiciously so. He was in St. Lucia, a pretty, if touristy Caribbean island. Arthur had holed up in the Dominican Republic, treating himself to a stay at Amanera. Perhaps it was a coincidence, perhaps not. It was enough of an excuse for Arthur to charter himself a jet. He dressed for the weather in a pale linen suit and didn\\'t bother packing a suitcase. Chances were, he\\'d wake up back exactly where he\\'d started the day. He did take a gun, tucked into a shoulder bag. The journey to St. Lucia was dull, with five hours of flight time that Arthur killed reading through various crime novels he\\'d been gifted and picking holes in the plot. He bribed his way through security and caught a taxi up to Jade Mountain, the hotel Eames was staying in. It was a luxurious, five star resort; it seemed that Eames was treating himself as well. Of course, Eames wasn\\'t the room booked under one of his less obtrusive alibis. Arthur hadn\\'t really expected him to be. He followed the path down to the beach, ignoring the honeymooning couples that seemed to be sprawled upon every flat surface. There was Eames, one of the few lone travellers. He was basking in the sun, a mojito on a table next to him, headphones in his ears likely pumping out some dreadful pop music. Arthur snorted and stood in Eames\\' sunlight, his face falling into shadow. \"Non, mesi*,\" Eames said without opening his eyes, his Creole accent perfect. \"Mwen byen**.\" \"Hello Eames,\" Arthur replied, allowing amusement to lace the tone of his voice. \"Nice to see you too.\" Eames\\' eyes snapped open and he rolled off the sun lounger, sprawling into the sand in his shock. \"Arthur?\" he hissed, rubbing at his eyes. He was dressed in navy swim shorts with little pink flamingos dotted about them. Ink curled across his chest and upper arms, a bead of sweat tracing the wing of a bird before dropping to the sand. He ran a hand through his hair, gaze darting about as if he expected Arthur to have brought an army with him. \"The one and only,\" Arthur said dryly. Eames recovered himself, a wide grin slowly spreading across his face. \"Arthur, you little devil,\" he said. \"Who\\'d have thought? Well, well, this is an unexpected change.\" There was something wary in Eames\\' gaze that Arthur struggled to interpret. He tucked a hand into his pocket and shrugged. \"I was in the area, thought I\\'d drop by,\" he said. \"And how long have you been in the area?\" Arthur hesitated. He\\'d arrived so long ago, it seemed impossible to quantify. \"Three days,\" he answered, but knew Eames had caught the lie. They watched each other for a long moment. Eventually, Eames sat back down on the lounger, digging his toes into the sand. \"I\\'ve been here since last Friday.\" He looked up, gaze calculating. \"But it feels like I\\'ve been here for months. Easy to lose track of time, in resorts like these.\" Arthur felt his heart skip a beat. This was something he\\'d not considered, but what if Eames was the one he\\'d been looking for all along? He found he wasn\\'t adverse to the idea at all. Lazily sweeping Eames\\' body with his eyes, Arthur stepped forward so that he was standing just between Eames\\' knees. Eames swallowed, tilting his head back to look up at Arthur, hands planted on the seat behind him in order to keep his balance. \"I know exactly what you mean,\" he said. \"In fact, every day seems to be exactly the same.\" \"Arthur,\" Eames murmured, so quietly the light breeze almost swept the sound of his voice away. \"Fifty-three days, Mr Eames,\" Arthur said, aiming for exasperated and coming up with fond. \"Did you leave the resort once? It seems that I\\'ve been looking for you.\" Eames smirked. \"But I knew you\\'d find me, darling, if I just waited long enough.\" He reached up, settling his hands on Arthur\\'s hips and tugged him forward, biceps flexing beneath golden skin. Arthur allowed himself to tumble forward and knelt one leg on the lounger for balance. \"I\\'m fairly certain this is illegal, here,\" he said, settling his hands on Eames\\' broad shoulders, digging his fingers into the rippling muscles. Eames grinned, gazing up at him with eyes that twinkled, a roguish quirk to his lips. \"And when has that ever bothered you, dear Arthur?\" Eames said. Arthur leaned forward to silence him with a kiss, sighing softly in contentment. He suddenly wished he had brought a suitcase, because he was absolutely certain of one thing; it wasn\\'t his bed he\\'d be waking in when the sun rose the next morning. \"We\\'re going to have so much fun,\" Eames murmured, still talking even as he kissed, drawing Arthur closer. \"I\\'m not sure the world is ready for us.\" Perhaps the world wasn\\'t ready, but Arthur was.

Working It Out Arthur bit back a yawn and extended his hearing, wondering if Dom was going to be back any time soon. Half a mile away the only notable sound was the click of a camera as tourists took pictures of the Chicago skyline two blocks down and the sound of a man approaching, letting himself into the warehouse. Not Dom, or certainly not Dom\\'s breathing patterns, however. The closer the man drew, the quieter his footsteps became. At first Arthur thought it might have been his power - some kind of ability to walk or move silently. But the man was humming to himself, obviously not trying to be quiet. \"Who are you?\" Arthur snapped, annoyed by the mystery interruption and he turned to face the intruder. The man jumped nearly a foot into the air and stared at Arthur, jaw gaping. \"Are you a robot?\" he asked, clutching at his chest as if Arthur had given him the fright of his life. Arthur had been sitting in the middle of the warehouse they were working from, waiting for both the architect and the forger to turn up. This was likely the forger, going by Dom\\'s description of him. \"No,\" Arthur said, mildly offended. He turned back to his research, determined to ignore the other man. To his utmost shock and horror, the man manage to sneak up upon him and poke him in the side. Arthur reacted instinctively; that is to say, he growled, drew his gun, and shot the space the other man had been occupying half a heartbeat ago. Neither Arthur nor Eames made a good impression upon the other. Unfortunately, Eames was the forger they\\'d been waiting for, and they had to work together. Eames, it seemed, had recovered quickly from his near death ordeal. \"Darling!\" he called as he entered the warehouse at the entirely unacceptable time of 10.05. Arthur had specified that they were to be meeting at 10.00 and had expected the entire team to be fifteen minutes early. They were not. Again, Eames was strangely quiet. Arthur, a man who could hear the sound of a gunshot from the other side of a city the size of Chicago and identify the type of gun within seconds, could not even hear Eames\\' heartbeat from across the room. \"Are you wearing a tinfoil hat beneath that slicked back do?\" Eames asked. Arthur stared at him. \"What?\" he said, then held up his hand. \"Stop. I don\\'t want to know. You\\'re late, Eames.\" Eames snorted. \"I\\'m early compared to Dom and Alexus.\" In Arthur\\'s mind, that was beside the point. Toward the end of a day filled with unproductive bickering and little else, Dom took him aside. Despite the fact that Arthur knew that Dom had the power to imbue a sense of trust in anyone that he spoke with, he allowed the man to speak. Dom would never abuse his ability. \"What\\'s going on with you and Eames?\" Dom said. Arthur wanted to throw his hands into the air. \"He\\'s infuriating. He\\'s rude and lazy and I can\\'t hear a single thing he does!\" Dom\\'s brow creased. \"You can\\'t hear him? As in, your power doesn\\'t affect him?\" \"Yes! No!\" Arthur pinched the bridge of his nose, staring down at the floor. \"Maybe. He\\'s not my soulmate Dom, don\\'t even say it.\" After a long pause, Arthur looked up. Dom narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. \"Not your soulmate, hm? Are you sure?\" Arthur wasn\\'t sure. \"Shit,\" he said. Dom patted Arthur on the shoulder. \"I\\'m sure it will work out.\" Eames came in the next day looking extraordinarily smug. \"It\\'s funny, you know,\" Eames said when Dom had gone for lunch break and Alexus had joined him after glancing at the two of them and blanching. \"Nothing\\'s funny,\" Arthur snapped. He wondered if he could get away with drawing his gun and shooting Eames by \\'accident\\'. \"I can\\'t hear you either, darling.\" Arthur froze. He did drew his gun, happy to have it\\'s reassuring weight in his hand. Maybe he\\'d just accept that no one would believe it had been an accident and shoot the man anyway. \"Explain,\" he growled. Eames eyed the gun with wary disdain. \"Cobb didn\\'t tell me, you little twit. I read his mind. Just like I can read Alexus\\' mind, and every single other person\\'s in a three mile radius.\" Arthur\\'s jaw dropped. He thought he might be sick. The idea of someone intruding on his thoughts like that... \"Apart from yours,\" Eames said with a scowl. \"Although I wish I could, because you\\'re bloody infuriating.\" Arthur felt as if he could breathe again. He reholstered his gun. \"You\\'re bloody infuriating,\" Arthur replied upon a childish whim. Eames arched a single eyebrow. It was an attractive look on him, one that Arthur had been trying to ignore. \"Fuck you, Eames,\" Arthur growled and drew the other man close for a kiss. \"Maybe in ten minutes,\" Eames answered, mumbling against Arthur\\'s lips just loud enough for him to hear. Arthur smiled. Word Count: 843 Romance Awareness Day 7 - Everyone has superpowers, but when soulmates are together their powers are nullified by each other.

With it, the heat\\'s actually bearable, unlike during the day. Who\\'d have thought he\\'d be sweating like a pig in England, of all places? The heatwave seems endless – but he loves it. He\\'s not complaining, not really. In the distance, Arthur steps out of the warehouse they\\'re working from. He\\'s either not seen Eames, or is pretending he can\\'t. Arthur is a bit funny like that. Arthur\\'s stressed; the job is dull and the architect is a disaster. However, Eames only knows this because he sees Arthur pull a packet from his front pocket and light a fag, the red cherry a soft glow in the distance. He only ever smokes when he\\'s trying to keep his hands busy, cupping them around the cigarette instead of someone else\\'s throat. Eames jams his hands into his trouser pockets and saunters over. Arthur glances up when he nears, resignation in his eyes, but not surprise. \"Eames,\" he grunts in greeting and then takes another long drag. \"Darling,\" Eames replies. As always, a flicker of irritation crosses Arthur\\'s face before he schools it blank. Eames\\' watch is heavy on his left wrist. It\\'s a gaudy gold Gucci timepiece that he lifted from some wanker at Heathrow Airport. It covers a name on his wrist that he\\'s 90% certain is Arthur\\'s real name. That remaining 10% is why Eames has kept his mouth shut, however. It\\'s a dangerous game he plays, forging and forgery, and dangerous people he plays with. The name on his other wrist is a man that squeezed Eames for all he had and then left him for dead. Eames hates him with a passion. Enemy on one wrist, mate on the other, and often impossible to tell which is which. Eames wonders what names Arthur wears beneath the cuff of his sleeves. Does one of them say William Eames in his lazy, frivolous scrawl? Arthur flicks the cigarette to the ground and steps on it with the toe of one well-polished, black brogue. A jolt of lust spikes through Eames. Arthur\\'s neat, compact, efficient… everything Eames isn\\'t, really. \"Ready to go back in?\" Arthur says. He sounds weary. Eames wants to step forward, sweep him into a hug, take him away from these miserable people and this rubbish job. \"I was born ready,\" Eames says instead. He smirks at the sceptical expression on Arthur\\'s face, turns on his heel and enters the warehouse. Havana, then Los Angeles 2013 Eames is lying on a beach lounger when his phone rings, soaking up the rays. \"Yes,\" he snaps, annoyed that his sunbathing has been interrupted. \"I\\'ve got a job for you,\" says the voice on the other end of the phone. It\\'s Arthur. \"Darling!\" Eames cries, immediately perking up. He sits, staring out to sea. The ocean gets hazier the further out he looks, until it merges with the horizon and the pale blue sky. After a pause indicating that Arthur is distinctly irritated by Eames\\' chosen greeting, he says, \"LA – two days.\" He hangs up. \"Lovely speaking with you too,\" Eames mutters to empty air. He digs his toes into the sand and thinks about how long this leaves him to catch a flight. He bloody hates LA. There\\'s something niggling in the back of his mind about why exactly he hates LA and it\\'s not until he arrives at the warehouse that he realises what it is. Dobb Cobb lives in LA. Right now, however, Cobb is busy pining Arthur to the wall, their faces too close for it to be anything but intimate. Eames feels as if he\\'s been struck by lightning. Was this happening during the Fischer job? No – Eames definitely would have noticed. That means it\\'s new. Perhaps this is how Cobb kept Arthur by his side when Arthur no longer felt obligated to get him home safe to his children. Cobb brushes his thumb over Arthur\\'s left wrist. Both wrists are bare, the first time Eames have ever seen him so unbuttoned. He\\'s too far away to see the names, more fool him. Eames fishes the phone Arthur called him on and places it silently on a table by the side. They\\'ve not yet noticed him and he doesn\\'t want them to. Arthur tilts his head, leaning closer to Cobb. Eames watches them exchange a chaste kiss. He turns and walks away. He bloody hates LA. Prague 2018 Rumours and half truths travel hard and fast through the dream-share grapevine. Apparently, Cobb has the same name on his left wrist as he does on his right. Apparently, he\\'s been lying about it. Apparently, there\\'s truly no one left in the business who will work with him now. Eames could have told them all that without having looked at either of Cobb\\'s wrists. He\\'d bet anything that Mal was the same. However, he\\'s not said a word. After all, who would believe him? Someone else has blabbed the truth. His minds spins as he thanks Mindy for the gossip. He returns to the apartment he\\'s renting for the night, kicking off his shoes at the door and tossing his jacket on the couch. \"Eames,\" Arthur says from the darkness of the room. Eames jumps nearly a foot in the air and barely holds back his shout. It\\'s embarrassing. He\\'s been caught with his metaphorical pants down. He flicks on the light and freezes. There\\'s a gun on the table beside Arthur and his expression is as inscrutable as ever. \"Come here, Eames,\" Arthur says. Eames takes a step then shakes himself. He plants his feet. \"What are you doing here, Arthur?\" Arthur purses his lips and places a hand on the gun, a single finger curling around the trigger. The threat in his gaze is unmistakable. Eames continues forward until he\\'s standing just between Arthur\\'s spread legs. Even though he\\'s taller and broader and looming in a menacing manner, Arthur is the more frightening of the two of them. Arthur reaches forward, delicate fingers curling around Eames\\' wrists. He unbuckles the watch on Eames\\' left arm, a battered Christopher Ward this time, revealing the name Michael O\\'Davies. Eames had taken a knife to it several years ago and Arthur traces the outline of the pale scar with a fingertip. Then he turns to Eames\\' other arm and unwinds the leather wristband that conceals his second mark. Eames holds his breath. \"Giovanni Antico,\" Arthur says aloud, his Italian accent perfect. He says the name with the kind of disdain only a man who\\'s lived with it all his life would know. His lip curls and then he jerks away. In a hasty, perhaps rash manner, he turns back his own cuffs. Dominic Cobb graces one wrist, while William Eames graces the other. \"Ah, pet, did you fall for him?\" Eames says, sorrow in his heart. He should kill Cobb for this. Arthur\\'s gaze is distant, so Eames returns to tracing the patterns of his own handwriting on the other man\\'s wrist. He can\\'t look away from his name, written there on Arthur. He feels giddy, like perhaps he ought to take up poetry again, and write the nineteenth sonnet. He thinks this might explain all the pent up anger and confusion inside Arthur, and so, so much more. He hopes he can sooth away that pain. \"Eames,\" Arthur says eventually, choking around a sob. He stands abruptly, clutching at Eames\\' wrist, so tight it hurts. His eyes are bright, his lips tightly pressed together. \"Oh, darling,\" Eames says, pulling him in and holding him close like he\\'d wanted to all those years ago. \"I\\'ve got you.\" Word Count: 1299 Romance Awareness Day 5 – you have the name of your mortal enemy on one wrist and your soulmate on the other Auction Day 5 - (word) Expression [1299 words = 130 coins] ","Summary":" Day 5 – you have the name of your mortal enemy on one wrist and your soulmate on the other Sonnet 1"},{"Movie":"Inception","Title":"Love is blind, friendship closes its eyes","Author":"CoffeeWithConsequences","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12854071","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ariadne knew she should be mad. After everything she\\'d been through-everything THEY had been through-mad was the very least she should be. She should be mad at Arthur, who had been such a gentle teacher at the beginning of this escapade, but had let details that could have killed them slip. She should be made at Eames...well, actually, Eames was probably in the clear. But she could be mad at him just for existing. She should be mad at Cobb, for dragging them down into dreams they might never have woken up from without their consent, for putting them all in danger. She should absolutely be mad at Yusuf, who had drugged them in dangerous ways without their knowledge or consent. That part really got to her-she\\'d been slipped a mickey once, her first year in college. Thanks to good friends, she\\'d come out unscathed, but the feeling of betrayal and invasion she had now was the same one she\\'d had then. Mostly, though, she wasn\\'t mad. She was elated, because they\\'d done the impossible, and they\\'d all come out the other side. She was glad for Cobb, much as she\\'d be fine with never seeing his smug face again. She was beyond thankful to find herself awake and with all her facilities intact. More than anything else, she was tired. She was bone-tired, the stress of not just the flight, but the last weeks of preparation, finally hitting her all at once. It was all she could do to drag herself to baggage claim. Ari\\'s original plan had to be to immediately book another flight and head back to Paris-she still had a semester to finish. By the time she\\'d loaded her luggage, though, she knew that wasn\\'t going to happen. She needed some time to rest, some time to think about everything that happened, and some time alone. After spending nearly every waking moment (and a lot of her sleeping ones, too) for weeks with these strange, intimidating, dangerous men, she needed a break. Instead of going to the counter to book a ticket back, she hailed a cab and instructed the driver to take her to whatever decent hotel was closest. When she got to her room, Ari didn\\'t even take her clothes off-much as they were uncomfortable and not at all her style. She hit the big bed, face down, and was asleep within minutes. When Ariadne woke up, it was dark and she was disoriented. The time change would have been enough to do it, without the whole being-asleep-but-in-mortal-peril aspect of the flight, and her intense post-flight nap. Until she checked her phone, she wasn\\'t actually even sure what day it was. \"OK,\" she muttered to herself, after learning it was early evening and she\\'d been asleep all afternoon, \"now I get my shit together. Shower.\" As she pulled off her suit-she\\'d like to burn the damn uncomfortable thing, but figured she\\'d better keep it, as it might be useful for a job interview down the line-Ari flicked through her messages. Arthur hadn\\'t insisted they ditch their phones or anything high intrigue like that-when Ariadne asked if that was necessary, he actually laughed. \"We\\'re criminals, but not that kind of criminals. You don\\'t need to go into hiding.\" She was glad for it-her iPhone was new and she\\'d hate to have to replace it, no matter how much money she\\'d just earned. Most of the texts were expected stuff-her mom, a classmate asking where the hell she\\'d been. The last one, though, was a surprise. It was a new number. can\\'t get over what we pulled off. dinner? Ariadne frowned, pulling her stockings off as she tried to decide who the text had come from. Not Dom, obviously, he\\'d be with kids. Not Arthur, who texted with capitalization and would never use multiple question marks. She considered Eames for a moment, but it just didn\\'t sound like him, and she had the distinct impression he was headed straight back to Mombasa after the job, with some other con on the horizon. So that left Yusuf. As she showered, Ariadne considered how to respond. She\\'d like the opportunity to talk about the job, to tell someone about what happened in the last level, about her fear and what she\\'d seen and how it all felt. She knew none of it was going to be something she could ever share with her family-they\\'d be unlikely to believe her even if weren\\'t confidential-so it would probably be a good idea to take advantage of having someone to talk to now. She also wouldn\\'t mind giving Yusuf a piece of her mind about the shit he\\'d pulled with the drugs, now that she was calmer. They may have all survived intact, but what he\\'d done was still in no way acceptable, and he should know that. By the time she was drying off, Ari decided to accept the invitation. She texted back. Starving. Where? It took only a minute for his reply, a link to a restaurant a few blocks from the hotel. From it\\'s website, the restaurant looked moderately fancy, so Ari pulled a short dress and sandals out of her bag. Might as well make the most of being somewhere warm. She twisted her still-wet hair up and put on only lip gloss-the heavy makeup she\\'d worn on the plane had been to make her look older and more convincing as a business traveler, and she was happy to be rid of it. She felt more like herself now. Yusuf was waiting in front of the restaurant when Ari got there. He was dressed differently than the plane, too, in trousers and a button-down shirt, no tie or jacket. He seemed more comfortable and casual than he ever had during the job. When he smiled at her, Ari took notice of his dimples right away-she\\'d never really noticed them before. To her surprise, he took her arm in a courtly manner and led her into the restaurant. The meal was nice. As Ari had hoped, they talked about every aspect of the job. Yusuf told her all about the chase in the van, and how anxious he\\'d been that it wouldn\\'t hit the water in time. In turn, Ari told him about the time crunch in the snow, about Mal, and Fischer getting shot, and Saito bleeding out. She told him about how cool and calm Eames had been, and how terrifying it was to go into Limbo. Before she realized it, Ari had been talking for nearly an hour, their plates long since cleared. \"Let\\'s get dessert,\" Yusuf said, brown eyes sparkling in the low restaurant light. \"And talk about something that we didn\\'t think would end in death.\" Ari agreed. Over chocolate mousse, they talked about their families. Ari explained how close she was with her parents and sister, and how much she missed them while she was in Paris. Yusuf told her the story of his family\\'s immigration to England when he was very small, and his parents\\' quiet disappointment at his choice to make his home in Africa. \"Do they know what you do?\" Ari licked the spoon, then reached for her espresso. They\\'d split a bottle of wine and she felt just right, the comfortable, pleasant buzz of the alcohol and the rich chocolate and coffee all combining in a warm feeling inside her. \"No, they think I\\'m a chemist. Um...a pharmacist, to you, I think?\" Yusuf shrugged. \"Which is technically, true, I guess.\" Ari nodded. She\\'d already been thinking a lot about whether she would do dreamshare work again, and what she could possibly tell her parents if she did. As if he knew what she was thinking, Yusuf continued. \"Stay out, if you can, Ariadne.\" She looked at him with surprise. \"You seem to like it.\" Yusuf frowned, trying to decide what to say. \"It\\'s what I do, and I wouldn\\'t change it now. But...your life will be easier if you don\\'t\\'t. Become a legit architect. Make beautiful buildings. Stay on the right side of the law. Don\\'t lose your people.\" Ariadne was quiet for a moment. She could see where the advice was coming from, but it still irritated her to be talked to like a child who didn\\'t\\' know better. \"Well, we\\'ll see,\" she finally said. \"I don\\'t exactly think I\\'ll be overwhelmed with job offers, anyway.\" Yusuf\\'s eyes widened. \"Are you kidding? The minute anybody hears what you can do, you\\'re going to have your pick. The work you did on this job…\" he trailed off, then picked back up. \"It was exceptional. Amazing. Much as I advise you not to do it, you\\'re a natural.\" Ari felt her face grow warm at the compliment. \"Thank you,\" she said, finally putting her spoon down after admitting she had scraped every bit of the mousse from her plate. Yusuf looked at her intently across the table. \"There\\'s something else I want to ask you,\" he said. \"It\\'s something personal.\" Ari nodded. \"OK,\" she said. \"Shoot.\" She wasn\\'t sure what he could ask that would be too personal to share with someone who had literally shared her dreams. \"Do you like men?\" Ari nearly choked on her last sip of espresso. \"Do I like men?\" she repeated. \"Like, sexually?\" Yusuf nodded, seemed unperturbed both by having asked the question and by her shocked reaction. Ari shook her head slowly. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I like men. And women.\" She shrugged. \"I don\\'t have much preference-or much experience-either way.\" Yusuf looked intrigued. \"Why not?\" He reached out and ran one finger over the back of her hand. \"You\\'re beautiful.\" Ari wasn\\'t wholly comfortable with the conversation, or with the touch, but she still felt like talking, and it didn\\'t really hurt anything. \"I\\'m not...outgoing. I keep to myself, and that kind of thing doesn\\'t just fall in your lap that often.\" She shrugged again. \"I\\'m not a virgin or anything. I just haven\\'t slept with many people. It\\'s not some conscious decision, it\\'s just the way it\\'s been so far.\" \"Do you want to?\" Yusuf\\'s face was still calm, as if he asked people these questions every day. \"Do I want to sleep with more people?\" Ari considered it. \"Sure, I guess. It\\'s just not really a priority.\" Her eyes narrowed slightly. \"Why are you asking?\" \"Because you are beautiful and exceptional and I want to seduce you.\" He was still calm, but his eyes had widened. \"And I didn\\'t want to waste my time trying if you were actually a lesbian.\" At this, Ari really was shocked silent. Never before had someone told her flat out that they wanted her. She had no idea what to say. Seeing she wasn\\'t going to speak, Yusuf continued. \"If you\\'re not interested, that\\'s fine-totally OK. But I wasn\\'t going to go back to Mombasa without having a go. You\\'re too amazing for that.\" His smile was so open, so friendly. \"I...I don\\'t know,\" Ariadne finally murmured. \"I like you. This has been really fun, and I\\'m glad you asked me to dinner. But I don\\'t trust you. I don\\'t know if I could ever trust you.\" \"Because of the job?\" \"Yes.\" Ari\\'s anger, which she\\'d put out of her mind for most of the evening, returned. \"You had no right to do that to us. We deserved to know what we were getting into. Drugging people without their knowledge is invasive and disgusting.\" Her voice pitched higher and she spoke louder as she ramped up. \"It was like being roofied.\" Yusuf\\'s eyes widened in horror. \"No, no, I would never…\" She interrupted. \"But you did. You gave us drugs without our consent, with potentially unthinkable consequences.\" She glared hard at him. \"Look, I like you. I could maybe have seen something happening with you, at some point. But if you think I\\'m going to ride the adrenaline of this job into your bed, while knowing that less than 24 hours ago, you drugged me and could have gotten my brain fried? That\\'s not going to happen.\" Yusuf slowly nodded. \"I understand.\" He looked ashamed. \"I am really very sorry, Ariadne. I truly didn\\'t think of it that way. I went along with Dom\\'s plan, because he was so very desperate, and I didn\\'t think about what it meant to subject you and the others to the mix without your knowing what it could do.\" Ariadne\\'s mouth tightened. \"OK,\" she said. There was no way she was going to tell him it was fine-it wasn\\'t fine-but she did appreciate his apologizing, and she believed he truly hadn\\'t thought through the potential consequences of his actions. She moved to get up from the table. \"This has been very nice, thank you for dinner.\" Yusuf rose as well, taking her arm again and walking her outside. \"May I walk you back to your hotel?\" Ariadne thought a minute. \"Yes, but you\\'re going to leave me outside.\" \"Fair enough.\" They walked in silence for a few blocks. When they reached the hotel, Ariadne reached for Yusuf\\'s hand, holding it between both of hers. \"I want you to know, regardless of whether I\\'m ever interested in you romantically, I hope we can be friends. I really do like you. And I\\'m glad you asked.\" Yusuf smiled. He didn\\'t look too discouraged. \"I\\'d like that. You should visit Mombasa. It\\'s a whole new world. Recreational dreaming, great food, great weather.\" Ariadne nodded, smiling back. \"I\\'ll think about it,\" she promised. For Ari, the next few months were full of changes. She struggled to make up what she\\'d missed, but was able to successfully finish her semester. She thought often about the Fischer job, and whether she\\'d want to do something like it again. As Yusuf predicted, she started getting offers of other jobs-not a ton, as they were all vetted through a tremendously particular and protective Arthur, but a few. She turned them down, wanting to focus on finishing school. One of the new constants in Ari\\'s life was Yusuf. He texted near daily, and emailed regularly. They spoke on Skype occasionally, and kept up on one another\\'s lives. He made no more advances of any kind of sexual or romantic nature-they simply became friends. Ari didn\\'t actually have that many friends, and she didn\\'t realize how much she\\'d been missing out on. At the end of the semester, Yusuf repeated his offer to host Ari\\'s visit to Mombasa. The first time he mentioned it, via text, she didn\\'t reply. One part of her very much wanted to go-she\\'d love to see the things Yusuf described, and she\\'d also like to spend time with him. The other part of her, though, was trepidatious. She\\'d come to some realizations about herself over the past months, hadn\\'t told Yusuf about them yet, and was unsure how he\\'d react. She didn\\'t want to lose his friendship. Finally, Yusuf cornered her during a Skype chat, so she could no longer evade the invitation. Taking a deep breath, Ari steeled herself to the tell the truth. \"I\\'d really love to come visit,\" she began. Yusuf interrupted. \"Great! When can you get out of there? Let\\'s make a reservation!\" \"Wait, Yusuf, I\\'m not finished.\" Through the screen, Ari saw him wrinkle his forehead, hearing in her voice that the rest of what she had to say might not be good. \"Before I come to visit you, there\\'s something I need you to know,\" she continued. \"OK?\" He looked at her as intently as was possible through two computer monitors. \"I\\'m...I\\'m not interested in a romantic relationship. Or a sexual one.\" Yusuf nodded. If he was disappointed, he didn\\'t let it show. \"I had figured,\" he replied. \"But that\\'s OK. We\\'re friends, right?\" He smiled. \"If you\\'d rather be with someone else, then I am happy for you. I won\\'t bring it up again.\" \"No, Yusuf, it\\'s not exactly that,\" Ari said. This was the part she wasn\\'t sure about. It was still a strange thing to say, even to herself. She thought her friend would understand, but it was hard to be sure. \"I\\'m not interested in a romantic or sexual relationship with anybody. When you asked me, after the Fischer job, if I liked men? I answered the best way I knew how, because I\\'m not a lesbian, and I don\\'t like men any less than I like women.\" Yusuf looked confused, but said nothing. \"The thing is,\" Ari continued, feeling stronger the more she spoke. \"I thought my lack of experience with sex and relationships was just because I am shy and I never really put myself out there. But I\\'m realizing now, it\\'s not that. I\\'m just...not interested. I don\\'t want those things. They don\\'t appeal to me. With men or women.\" \"What are you saying?\" Yusuf didn\\'t look angry, or disappointed, or any of the things Ari had been afraid of. He mostly just looked confused and a little concerned. \"You just want to be alone?\" \"No,\" Ari shook her head. \"I think I\\'m asexual. I want to have friends-I love having you as a friend-but I don\\'t want another kind of relationship. I just want that.\" Yusuf was quiet a moment, then nodded. \"OK,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think that changes anything between us, does it? I love you, and I love being friends with you, and I already had figured out that\\'s what we are and that\\'s how it\\'s going to stay. My interest in you is in no way contingent upon you ever wanting to date me, or sleep with me.\" Ari smiled. That was exactly what she\\'d hoped he would say. \"But what if I never date or sleep with anybody else, either?\" she asked. \"Then that is your business and I support your choices,\" he answered, without a pause. \"I don\\'t think I know anybody else who is asexual, Ari, but I it seems to me that it\\'s just another point on the spectrum, and there is no reason I should have any more judgment of it than I do anything else on that spectrum. You not wanting to fuck anybody is no different to me than Eames wanting to fuck everybody.\" Ari laughed. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I have been wanting to tell you, but I haven\\'t been sure how you\\'d react.\" \"You\\'re my friend,\" he replied, his voice warm. \"There was no other possible reaction. Now, let\\'s plan your trip.\" ","Summary":" Ariadne knew she should be mad.

As if finals weren\\'t bad enough, it was snowing. Snowing hard, with a wind chill in the single fucking digits. For what had to have been the thousandth time that semester, he asked himself what on Earth had motivated him to accept a scholarship in this frozen fucking wasteland. If he wasn\\'t very lucky, he was going to end up stuck here, as the three hours between his chemistry final and his flight home for the holiday break were likely to coincide with the worst of the storm. But that was a worry for after the final. Which was in four hours, and for which he did not feel prepared. It was his last of four this week, and he was on fumes, subsisting on nothing but Red Bull and anxiety. \"What\\'s that, pet?\" Someone had come up behind Arthur and heard his grumbling. He had to quicken his pace to match Arthur\\'s, and then his face appeared next to Arthur, grinning. He was wearing a ridiculous hat, the kind with ear flaps. \"Just complaining about the weather,\" Arthur said shortly, barely glancing at the other student. \"This? Just a bit brisk is all. How are your finals going? I\\'m Eames, by the way.\" Arthur shook his head. \"Yeah. I know. I\\'m Arthur.\" Everybody knew Eames. Or knew him by reputation, anyway. He\\'d slept his way through most of the girls in Arthur\\'s dorm during the first few weeks of classes, and then about half the boys. Though he was an upperclassman, Arthur actually had a class with him-some art history nonsense his advisor had foisted off on him-but Eames had never before paid him the least attention. \"We had art history!\" Eames said, his voice triumphant. \"Barely recognized you under all your gear.\" He gestured to Arthur\\'s thick coat, scarf, and hat. \"What\\'d you think of that final? Bit of a lark, right?\" Arthur had actually found the art history exam the day before to be unexpectedly difficult. He\\'d been worried about it since. But it wouldn\\'t do to admit that, so he just shrugged. Academics were cutthroat here in a way he\\'d never have predicted-it was no good to show weakness. \"Where you headed now?\" Eames asked, either oblivious to or ignoring Arthur\\'s terse replies. \"Library,\" Arthur said. \"I have a chem final this afternoon.\" \"That\\'s a pisser,\" Eames replied. \"You headed home after?\" Arthur couldn\\'t help but wonder why Eames, with his outsized campus reputation, was suddenly so interested in him. He\\'d spent an entire semester blending in to the woodwork, keeping his head down, studying. He didn\\'t dislike Oberlin, but it hadn\\'t clicked for him the same way it clearly had for some of his classmates. He didn\\'t really feel a part of it. He never felt comfortable joining their activities, whether they were early fall lawn games of Ultimate Frisbee or the more recent parties his dorm had been having, centered around a gravity bong made out of a residence hall trash can. He just wasn\\'t social like that-the exact opposite of what he\\'d seen of and heard about Eames. \"Yeah,\" he finally said, hating the caution he heard in his own voice. \"If my flight isn\\'t canceled.\" \"Mine was,\" Eames replied. \"I was meant to be out this morning, but everything\\'s shut down until at least tomorrow.\" He shrugged. \"I\\'m sorry,\" Arthur said automatically. \"Don\\'t be. In no rush to get home anyhow.\" He raised his eyebrows until they disappeared under brim of his ridiculous hat. \"I\\'m a bit more popular here than there. Good enough to stick around for another night of merry-making. I think this is you.\" Arthur looked up to realize they were standing in front of the library. Eames\\' distraction had kept him from feeling the cold as he finished his walk across campus. \"Well, Merry Christmas,\" he said, still sounding awkward. To Arthur\\'s surprise, Eames grabbed his arm before he could walk away. \"Listen, if your flight doesn\\'t go, come on over tonight. The boys and I are having a Christmas party, since we\\'re stuck here. You know the house?\" Of course Arthur knew the house. Everybody on campus knew the house. Eames lived just off the edge of campus, with an indeterminate number of roommates, in a house that hosted gatherings once a month, if not more. The parties were reputably wild, often resulting in calls to the police and citations issued. Like frat parties on a campus with, blessedly, no frats. Arthur had both never been invited to one and never had any desire to attend. \"I don\\'t know,\" he said. \"I\\'ll probably be at the airport. But thanks for the invitation.\" Eames grinned again and let go of his arm. \"If you aren\\'t at the airport,\" he said. \"Promise you\\'ll come by. Finals have you all wound up. You could use a party.\" To his surprise, Arthur found himself nodding. He wasn\\'t really agreeing to anything, he told himself. His flight would go out and neither of them would think anything of it again. \"OK,\" he said, \"I\\'ll do that.\" Eames\\' smile seemed brighter in the increasingly shitty weather. Arthur walked into the library feeling warmer than he had in quite some time. The chem final wasn\\'t as bad as Arthur had feared. There were a few sketchy questions, but overall he was fairly confident in his performance. As he left the lecture hall, he pulled out his phone and was met immediately with a text message alerting him to his canceled flight. At least he didn\\'t have to find out at the airport, he thought sourly. As he trudged back across campus to the residence hall, he felt sorry for himself. He\\'d been looking forward to getting off the plane in L.A. and being warm, finally. His family didn\\'t celebrate Christmas, and Hanukkah was nearly over, but his mother would be cooking for an army anyway, fussing over him and feeding him and giving him an endless stream of encouragement until his grades came in. \"It\\'s just one more day,\" he told himself as he opened the dorm door. \"You can wait one more day.\" Unbundling himself, Arthur was thankful, again, that the dorm heat was always too high. In the middle of the night, when he had to strip off his blankets to stop sweating, he cursed it, but it was awfully nice when coming from being outside. Leaving his outerwear in an untidy pile, Arthur threw himself on his bed. God, he needed to sleep. He hadn\\'t had more than a couple of restless hours per night all week. Once finals started, finals were all there was, with all other concerns, including the basic ones-like sleeping and eating and showering-shoved out of his mind. It was a great nap. Arthur slept for maybe two hours, but he woke up feeling as if he\\'d slept all night. His head was much clearer now that there were no more exams hanging over it. It was all out of his hands now-he\\'d done everything he could. Peeking out his window, he saw that the snow was still coming down outside, drifting up against buildings and cars. Much as it was a pain in the ass, he had to admit it was pretty. He could also hear the sounds of revelling starting. With so many students stuck on campus after the last finals were done, parties were inevitable. As he took a much-needed shower, the invitation from Eames returned to Arthur\\'s mind. Surely it had just been a polite thing to say, not a real desire for him to attend? That said, there had been no reason at all for Eames to even talk to him that morning, much less walk him all the way to the library and then invite him to a party. It could be that, with some people already gone, Eames was concerned about not having enough guests? That didn\\'t seem terribly likely, either. Maybe he\\'d meant it when he said Arthur looked like he needed to blow off some steam? Arthur wasn\\'t against the idea of blowing off steam. Quiet as he was, he wasn\\'t conservative or prudish, and did his share of drinking and \"light\" drugs, both in high school and since he\\'d been in college. The idea of a few mind-loosening drinks did sound like a good way to clear the last vestiges of finals stress from him before he headed home. So, returning to his room after his shower, Arthur decided to go ahead and check out Eames\\' party. If it was uncomfortable, he could always leave. The dorm was getting loud, so it wasn\\'t as if he was just going to be able to sleep the night away anyway. Plus, he realized suddenly and with a rush of relieved joy, for the first time in months, he honestly had nothing for which he should be studying. When Arthur arrived at Eames\\' house, things were in full swing. A few dedicated and chilly smokers loitered on the porch. There was nobody Arthur recognized in their number-probably all upperclassmen-but they smiled and said hi as he walked through their group. Inside, probably thirty people were crowded into a smallish living room and kitchen, talking loudly and drinking from Solo cups. Trip hop played from a speaker connected to an iPod, and multi-colored Christmas lights wrapped their way around the ceilings and bannister. It felt festive and comfortable. Arthur smiled as he took off his coat and added it to the pile by the door. \"Arthur, you made it!\" As Arthur was taking in the room, Eames appeared at his elbow, much as he had earlier in the day. \"Let\\'s get you a drink.\" He steered Arthur toward the kitchen. \"Your choices are rubbish beer,\" he made a face and gestured toward the fridge, \"or this delightful concoction.\" He nodded his head toward what appeared to be plastic bag lined trash barrel. The liquid inside was of an indeterminate color, and slices of questionable looking fruit floated on the top. \"What in God\\'s name is that?\" Arthur asked, looking at Eames. He\\'d been trying to avoid looking directly at Eames, thinking it was something like looking at the sun and should probably be avoided. \"That, my good friend Arthur, is wop.\" \"Wop?\" \"Yes. Wop. So called for the sound one\\'s body makes when it hits the floor after drinking too much of it!\" Eames grinned and reached toward a stack of cups. \"I don\\'t know if that\\'s a good idea,\" Arthur began. Eames made a face. \"C\\'mon, it\\'ll do you good. Celebrate the end of all this exam business.\" He dipped the cup directly into the trash can, then handed it to Arthur with a triumphant smile. \"Down the hatch.\" It tasted better than Arthur had imagined. The alcohol in it was strong, but the mix of juices and something fizzy-Sprite?-made it easy to drink. Far easier than it should be, probably. He\\'d definitely have to be careful how much he had. For an hour or so, Arthur moved about the two rooms. He joined in a few conversations, noticing a couple of people from his French class, and one girl who was dating someone in his dorm. The party was small enough not to be overwhelming, and seemed likely to stay on the mellow side. Eames moved in and out of Arthur\\'s peripheral vision, playing the host and moving easily between groups, clearly in his element. Though he tried to keep it subtle, Arthur couldn\\'t help but watch him. In truth, Arthur had spent a large chunk of the semester watching Eames. After a brief and embarrassing tangle with another upperclassman, a guy named Tyler who had slept in his dorm bed a few nights and then decided he was bored, Arthur had decided to keep his dick in his pants while he got used to college. That said, Eames was impossible not look at it. For Arthur, who wasn\\'t newly gay, but was fairly new at being comfortable with it, and at admitting what attracted him, Eames was like something plucked directly from a fantasy. The well-built body, the sparkling gray eyes, the thick, full lips...and the fucking accent. It was the accent that really did it. Every time Eames spoke in class, Arthur felt his cock jump. It had only been his extreme finals-related stress and exhaustion, Arthur realized as he slowly drank his \"wop\" and moved about the room, that had kept him from freaking completely out over Eames\\' talking to him earlier. He\\'d been so wrapped up in exam mode that he hadn\\'t even had time to properly obsess. Now, though, he could do nothing else. After another glass of the punch, Arthur started thinking it might be time to leave. It wasn\\'t particularly late, but he didn\\'t want to do anything foolish, and his rescheduled flight was early in the morning. As he started to look through the pile of coats for his, Eames reappeared. \"Leaving already?\" If Arthur wasn\\'t mistaken, Eames actually stuck his bottom lip out in a pout. \"Thanks for having me,\" Arthur said. His manners were so well instilled it was impossible to turn them off. \"It was nice.\" Eames chuckled. \"Nice? Are you going to shake my hand now?\" He reached out and took Arthur\\'s coat from his hand and returned it to the pile. \"Come on, Arthur. Stay a while longer.\" Arthur was surprised, and not wholly sure how to react. Eames hadn\\'t spoken much to him since their conversation upon his arrival. Why did it matter to him if Arthur left? \"My flight is kind of early,\" he began. Eames shook his head. \"No excuses.\" He looked, for just an instant, unsure. \"There\\'s something I want to tell you, anyway.\" \"OK?\" Arthur frowned. What could Eames possibly have to tell him? Eames nodded his head toward the stairs. \"Come up with me, it\\'s too loud down here.\" Arthur followed Eames uncertainly upstairs. His mind whirled. Was Eames taking him to his room? Why? What could he have to say that required being away from the party? Eames stopped at the second door on the right. When he opened it, there was a half-naked couple on the bed, so into each other that they didn\\'t even notice the intrusion. \"Oi!\" Eames yelled, getting their attention. \"This is my room! Out!\" As the couple split apart, Arthur recognized the girl who hung around his dorm with her boyfriend. He also noticed the guy she\\'d been into it with was not his dorm mate. Wanting no part of knowing any of that, Arthur looked at the floor until the two of them gathered their clothes and scurried away. \"Come on in,\" Eames said, ushering Arthur forward and closing the door behind him. Looking around, Arthur saw that the room was surprisingly neat, with a ton of sketches and drawings pinned to the walls. The bed was rumpled, and there were a few books lying around and a couple of pairs of shoes on the floor, but overall it was, by the standard of a college room, quite tidy. Eames sat down on the bed. \"Sit, if you want,\" he said. \"I\\'m not going to bite you.\" Arthur struggled not to blush at the mental image the words brought up, but was unsuccessful. He sat down anyway, about as far away from Eames as he could while still remaining on the narrow bed. \"OK,\" Eames said, looking down at his hands. \"So, first, how drunk are you?\" Arthur frowned. What an odd question. \"Not very,\" he said, honestly. \"I wouldn\\'t drive or anything, but my facilities are intact. Why? How drunk are you?\" Eames looked up and grinned. \"Not very.\" He licked his lips and Arthur couldn\\'t help tracking the motion. There was a silence that was just long enough to be uncomfortable, and then Eames spoke again. \"I\\'m glad I ran into you today,\" he said. His gaze had returned to his hands. \"I\\'d be trying to think of how to approach you, and then finals started and everything was tits up.\" Arthur was confused, both because \"tits up\" wasn\\'t a term he heard often, and because he still had no idea why Eames would want to approach him. \"OK…?\" he said. Eames looked up, clearly forcing himself to meet Arthur\\'s gaze. \"I want you to know I am not telling you this now because I want to sleep with you.\" He stammered for a minute, looking as if he\\'d said something he didn\\'t want to. \"Not that I don\\'t want to sleep with you. I do. But that\\'s not why I am telling you this now.\" Arthur was so taken aback by the \"sleep with you\" part that there was no way he could parse out the rest of the sentence, but it didn\\'t matter, as Eames continued. \"I\\'ve been watching you all semester. Not, like, creepy stalker watching you. Well, maybe a little. But just watching you because I am interested in you. You\\'re very smart. And you\\'re always kind of by yourself. Cautious. Checking things out.\" He paused, but went on before Arthur could be expected to say anything. \"I just...I haven\\'t been able to stop wanting to know more about you. I even drew you.\" \"What?\" Arthur\\'s mind was spinning so fast he couldn\\'t keep up. Maybe he\\'d had more to drink than he thought. Eames stood up abruptly and crossed the room to the desk, grabbing a sketchbook. Flipping a few pages, he thrust it toward Arthur. On the page, Arthur saw a series of quick pencil sketches, mostly showing an arm, a tensed shoulder, steepled hands. One included a face, which was undeniably his, but even the sketches that were just torso were familiar, clearly depictions of how Arthur held himself while he was sitting in class. \"Please don\\'t be creeped out,\" Eames said, his face completely devoid of its usual cheerful mischief and looking concerned. \"I\\'m not expecting anything from you. It has just gotten to the point where it felt weird not to let you know.\" Arthur was silent, his eyes wide and his mind, for just a moment, blank. When he spoke, what he said wasn\\'t remotely what he\\'d intended to say. \"I want to sleep with you, too.\" As soon as the words came out, Arthur blushed furiously. \"I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean to say that.\" Eames laughed. It was such an open, beautiful sound. \"That\\'s quite alright, that\\'s good to know.\" \"It\\'s…\" Arthur trailed off, still not sure he\\'d heard what he thought he\\'d heard. \"It\\'s...not just you. I\\'ve been watching you, too.\" He paused, then stumbled on. \"But everybody watches you.\" Eames sat back down on the bed and smiled in a way that didn\\'t quite make it to his eyes. \"Everybody does,\" he agreed. \"That\\'s what happens when you\\'re a clown.\" \"It\\'s not just that,\" Arthur said, knowing that everything coming out of his mouth was ridiculous, but unable to stop it. \"Everybody wants you. You slept with half my dorm!\" \"Ah….yeah.\" Eames sighed. \"I was afraid that might be...a sticking point.\" He was quiet, his mouth quirked as if he was deep in thought. \"Look, all I can say is this: I don\\'t want to be that guy anymore. I\\'ve been that guy, for a couple of years now. And it\\'s not...I don\\'t feel good about it. It\\'s not enough.\" \"There\\'s nothing wrong with it,\" Arthur countered. \"Lots of people sleep around in college.\" \"You don\\'t.\" \"Well, no. But I\\'m not really...friendly.\" Eames laughed again, seemingly taken by surprise. \"No, I suppose you\\'re not.\" Arthur took a deep breath. He was smart enough to know that this wasn\\'t a chance that was likely to come up again, and he was just going to have to gather his guts and do it. \"I would, though...with you.\" He held Eames\\' gaze, though he could feel his ears burning. \"Now.\" He didn\\'t make a move toward Eames, but felt his own body brace, expecting Eames to move toward him. Eames didn\\'t budge. He looked at Arthur for a long, slow moment. Arthur started to panic. Had he somehow misunderstood? Was Eames not coming on to him after all? Finally, Eames spoke. As he did, he reached out, closing the distance between them with his hand, running his fingers very lightly along the side of Arthur\\'s jaw. \"Not now,\" he said. \"Much as I want it to be now. You\\'ve been drinking, you haven\\'t slept properly in days, you\\'re finals buzzed.\" Arthur shook his head, disbelief and confusion warring with arousal and excitement. \"I don\\'t understand. I...I\\'m saying yes. I am here in your bedroom and I\\'m saying yes. I thought you wanted…\" \"I want you,\" Eames said. \"I\\'ve wanted you all semester. But I want you for real. You seem the type of person who thinks about things-I want you to have thought about it. I want you to be sure.\" He grinned ruefully. \"And lest you think this is not a sacrifice, I can already tell you I am going to be kicking myself for the entire vacation for this.\" \"So this is about...consent?\" Arthur wished he could make himself stop talking, but he had to understand. \"This has been kind of a rollercoaster of a conversation, Eames.\" \"Yeah.\" Eames frowned. \"It is about consent. What I said before, about being that guy who sleeps with everybody and not wanting to be that guy anymore-I meant that. I want something more with you. I want to try to see if you and I can...make something of a relationship, I guess? If you\\'re interested in that?\" That unsure look was back on his face, but he didn\\'t look down at his hands. \"I mean, don\\'t get me wrong-if you come back after break and say you just want to have sex with me, I\\'m not going to tell you no. But I want you to be sure. And I want to be sure that I did this right.\" Slowly, Arthur nodded. He was, at some level, disappointed. Just hearing Eames talk for this long had him half-hard, much less the things he was saying. But he had to respect the position Eames was taking. In truth, he was drunk, and he was exhausted, and he was overwhelmed. Though he very much doubted he\\'d regret it if he and Eames did have sex, he could admit he wasn\\'t at 100%, so far as decision-making was concerned. \"How about this, then,\" Eames said. \"You give me your number, and we will talk over the break-texts or Facetime or whatever works for you. And then, when we get back in a few weeks, we\\'ll have decided where we\\'re going with this. And hopefully I\\'ll have convinced you that I\\'m good enough to give a go.\" He grinned, that rakishly charming smile so convincing it was as if it had never left his face. \"OK,\" Arthur said slowly. \"But I think it\\'s going to be me convincing you.\" Oddly, he felt excited more than daunted by the prospect. Impulsively, he leaned forward, catching Eames by surprise as he met his lips. The kiss was brief. Both of them were clearly struggling to maintain control of themselves, and it didn\\'t allow for a lot of passion. It was full of promise, though. Full of pent-up energy and wonder and hope. Eames pulled away, his cheeks slightly flushed. \"That was a really good start.\" Arthur nodded, mute for the moment. It certainly was. He stood awkwardly. \"I\\'m going to go now, then,\" he said. He nodded toward Eames\\' phone, sitting on the desk. \"May I?\" Eames nodded enthusiastically, so Arthur grabbed the phone and put in his number. \"I\\'m going to be texting you every five minutes,\" Eames warned. Arthur didn\\'t try to keep himself from smiling. \"I hope you do.\" Eames walked Arthur to the door. The party was still in full swing, the guests noticeably drunker and noisier than they\\'d been when Arthur and Eames went upstairs. A few people spoke to Eames as the passed, but he answered them only in short phrases, his attention squarely on Arthur. At the door, he helped Arthur find his coat and then stood close to him, watching, as he buttoned it up. \"Be careful out there,\" Eames said. \"I\\'ll see you in a few weeks.\" Eames was true to this word-he texted continually over the break. Arthur\\'s family teased him mercilessly, but he didn\\'t care. Every day, he and Eames learned more about each other, and seemed to have more to talk about. Eames clearly avoided his own family as much as possible, so he was available for texting or chatting or Skype sessions nearly whenever Arthur pinged him. By the time they returned to campus, they didn\\'t need to make any decisions about a relationship-it was clear one had already been established. As soon as he landed and shoved his bags into his room, Arthur headed to Eames\\' house. When Eames opened the door, Arthur didn\\'t even speak to him first, just kissed him, hard, insistent, with weeks worth of desire. When he finally broke this kiss, Arthur spoke quickly. \"I have not been drinking. I have slept, eaten, showered, shaved, and done fucking nothing but think about you for weeks. This is the most vigorous, active, enthusiastic consent you are ever likely to get. Let\\'s go upstairs. Now.\" Eames grinned. \"Well said. Let\\'s go.\" Hours later, Arthur thanked Eames for his insistence on waiting. While he had no doubt they\\'d have had fun that night before the winter break, this had been something better. Unworried, unhurried, already comfortable with each other, and with the benefit of several weeks of consideration and anticipation, it felt nothing like a one-off encounter, no matter how hot. It felt like a beginning. ","Summary":" \"I should have gone to UCLA.\" Arthur complained aloud, scowling as he walked across campus.

Ils étaient dans une ville aux rues étroites et bondées, le soleil les écrasant de sa chaleur. Le dos appuyé contre un mur entre la sortie d'un bar et un vendeur ambulant, Arthur ne lâchait pas d'une seconde la foule qui s'agitait dans tous les sens. Eames parut faussement déçu avant d'imiter la pose du brun. Il plaça ses lunettes de soleil sur son nez et croisa les bras, un léger sourire accroché aux lèvres. « Que fais-tu ici ? » Reprit-il. « Je travaille. » Répondit sèchement Arthur, ses yeux derrière les verres teintés inspectant avec attention les alentours, cherchant sa filature. Le sourire de l'autre homme s'élargit un peu plus. « Est-ce que ce ne serait pas moi que tu cherches ? » Demanda-t-il. Arthur ne répondit pas, d'ailleurs il ne savait pas vraiment quoi répondre. « Je suis content que tu sois là. » Continua Eames. Arthur s'essuya le front avec la manche de sa chemise. Il s'autorisa ensuite un rapide regard sur son collègue qui lui offrit un sourire chaleureux avant de reporter son attention devant lui. Il le trouvait toujours aussi beau, charmant et follement sexy dans sa chemise aux couleurs extravagantes. Il sentit Eames se rapprocher jusqu'à toucher son épaule avec la sienne. « Tu m'as manqué tu sais. » Arthur ferma les yeux en soupirant discrètement, Eames ne lui facilitait pas la tâche. Il les rouvrit quand il sentit un baiser piquant contre son cou. « Eames... » Il posait sa main sur l'épaule du blond pour le repousser doucement quand il cru apercevoir Cobb dans la foule. Il se redressa, cherchant un instant son ami au milieu du bruit, des couleurs, de ce capharnaüm, mais Cobb ne pouvait être ici. Lui au moins avait réussi à rentrer chez lui, à retrouver sa réalité. Celle d'Arthur se résumait à errer de ci de là, voyageant au gré du travail qu'il pouvait trouver, l'esprit souvent embrumé par l'image d'un homme. D'ailleurs, celui-ci s'était rapproché et avait posé ses mains sur ses hanches. « Je sais que tu es là pour moi, alors reste. Je suis là. » Eames enfouit une nouvelle fois sa tête dans le coup du brun pour s'imprégner de son odeur et gouter sa peau. Arthur fit glisser la main qui était sur l'épaule musclé de son collègue jusqu'à sa nuque, froissant sa chemise colorée en soupirant. « Je ne peux pas. » Répondit-il du bout des lèvres. La chaleur déjà bien élevée augmenta encore quand le corps massif d'Eames se colla au sien et qu'il enroulait ses bras autour sa taille. Arthur l'entoura doucement à son tour, il ne pouvait s'empêcher de le toucher, le sentir, se faire bercer par son accent mélodieux. « Dis-moi que tu m'aimes. » Soupira Eames entre deux baisers, remontant petit à petit vers la joue rasée de près. Arthur se contenta d'agripper le vêtement de son collègue, son autre main passant dans les cheveux moites de celui-ci. Cette situation semblait presque irréelle, tout ce temps passé loin l'un de l'autre. « Dis-moi à quel point tu m'aimes. » Il le rendait fou, son souffle brulant caressait sa peau perlé de sueur, son odeur l'enivrait. Doucement, leurs corps se pressaient de plus en plus, les mains s'agrippaient à l'autre, ne voulant plus se lâcher. « Tellement, tellement… » Souffla Arthur. Eames n'attendit pas plus et embrassa le brun aussi doucement que possible, leurs yeux se fermèrent et leurs langues se trouvèrent rapidement. Il n'existait plus d'espace entre eux, se serrant autant que possible, désespérés et passionnés sous la chaleur du soleil. Puis leurs bouches se séparèrent lentement, savourant ce moment suspendu dans le temps, oubliant tout à part eux. Arthur ouvrit les yeux tandis qu'Eames butinait ses lèvres un instant avant de retourner dans son coup, le gardant tout contre lui. Alors que ce dernier lui murmurait des choses réconfortantes, le regard d'Arthur fut attiré par quelqu'un dans la foule, la seule personne qui les observait. Ariadne. Il sursauta violemment, les yeux largement ouverts et le souffle court. Il pris un instant pour se calmer et regarda tristement son bras dans lequel l'aiguille était plantée. Il la retira mollement avant de se laisser tomber contre le matelas. Le temps s'étira, implacable, puis il pris son dé truqué entre les doigts, le regardant durement avant de le balancer à travers la pièce. L'éco de sa rage mourrait lentement dans le silence pesant, il faisait froid et il était seul. Seul, perdu avec ses rêves. Merci d'avoir lu jusqu'au bout! Ma première fic sur ce fandom et j'avoue, c'est pas très gai et pas très long, mais j'ai bien aimé l'écrire! J'ai essayé de faire un style un peu abstrait dans la partie rêve, et ne parler que de ce qu'Arthur pourrait sentir et voir à ce moment, puisque c'est son rêve mais je ne sais pas si c'est vraiment réussi.

My thanks to brooke, my fabulous kiwi beta, for the quick squizz! \"No, it was a good one. A good job,\" Arthur clarified and threw back two more fingers of the Johnnie Walker Blue he\\'d been drinking, although he was clearly past the point where he normally stopped. Eames watched, fascinated, and wondered how far he\\'d go, now that it was just the two of them sitting at the bar. Arthur was starting to sway on his stool. \"Not half bad, not half bad,\" Eames agreed. \"You know,\" Arthur said, shaking a finger at Eames, \"I\\'ve always been a fan of your work.\" Eames grinned at him and toasted Arthur with his own tumbler. \"And I\\'ve always been a fan of your tight trousers, darling.\" Arthur hummed with a sloppy smile. \"And I\\'ve always been a fan of your… words.\" \"My...words? Arthur,\" Eames chuckled, \"I think you may be drunk.\\' \"No, nononono. Your wooords, Eames,\" Arthur said, licking his lips and trying to enunciate. \"I like the way you say them with your mouth .\" \"Well, God help me if I start saying them with something else.\" \"I don\\'t like Toby\\'s words,\" Arthur continued, scowling. \"No?\" Eames smirked. \"Tell me more, dear Arthur.\" Eames was sick to death of the Australian extractor they\\'d been working with while they were in the country. He was tanned and poncy and smarmy with perfect too-white teeth, and he\\'d barely stopped hitting on Arthur the whole bloody job. Arthur had never given him the time of day, but then, he never gave Eames the time of day either. However, Arthur had never frowned and told Eames that he \"had all the help he needed, thanks,\" like he\\'d told Toby yesterday, and Eames would clutch that one to his chest for quite a while. But Eames was certainly willing to listen to Arthur talk about what he didn\\'t like about Toby-the-Bastard for as long as he wanted to talk about it. \"Toby\\'s words lay down in his mouth when he talks,\" Arthur said, matter-of-fact. Then in a perfect Melbourne accent, he said, \"I dunno, mate. We\\'re gonna have ta try it out. We do things a bit different down here.\" He made a face. \"Blugh. His mouth makes them all fall sideways.\" Eames blinked. \"Your words stand up, Eames,\" Arthur slurred, pointing a finger into Eames\\' chest. \"No? Tell me more, dear Arthur,\" Arthur said in a pretty spot-on imitation of Eames\\' accent. \"They stand up tall in your mouth,\" he continued, \"cuz you\\'re a stand-up guy.\" Eames\\' mouth was suddenly dry as Arthur stared up at him, wide-eyed and honest. \"Eames. You are. The stand-uppy-est guy I know.\" Arthur had leaned forward into Eames\\' space, and Eames could feel Arthur\\'s warm breath on his face. He smelled like whiskey, and Eames wondered if he\\'d taste like it too. \"Well,\" Eames said, clearing his throat and hopefully the air, \"sounds like you should have been a Forger, darling. Can you do any other accents?\" Arthur\\'s brow furrowed as he looked at Eames in confusion. \"Accents? Psssshhhhhhh, I can\\'t do any accents. What are you talking about?\" Eames blinked away the whiskey breath blown in his face and grunted with the weight of an Arthur tipped too far forward. \"Okay, darling, let\\'s get you home. I think it\\'s time to call it a night.\" \"It\\'s a night,\" Arthur said with a nod and slipped into a semi-standing position, as Eames fumbled a few bills onto the counter, then with a glance at Arthur\\'s glass, a few more. He wrapped an arm around Arthur\\'s waist to keep him upright and steer him towards the door. \"Hey!\" Arthur gasped. \"We should go dancing!\" Eames scoffed in amazement. \"Arthur, now I know you\\'re proper pissed. You\\'re going to a hotel room before you fall on your face.\" Arthur scowled at him. \" \\'m not gonna fall on my face. I\\'m drunk, not unskilled at walking.\" They stepped onto the sidewalk, the warm air washing over them. \"I can do all kinds of things when I\\'m drunk,\" Arthur continued, still scowling at him. \" \\'m pretty sure I can do more things when I\\'m drunk.\" \"Mm hmm,\" Eames hummed as he searched in vain for a cab to flag down. \"I\\'m sure that\\'s true.\" \"It is true,\" Arthur insisted loudly. \"Here, hold my jacket.\" He was shrugging out of it even as Eames tried to protest. \"No, Arthur, I\\'m sure you, oh...kay.\" He accepted the heap of pinstripe which probably cost more than two or three of his outfits. \"Just don\\'t do anything—\" \"I\\'m going to run up the wall.\" \" — stupid.\" Arthur took off at a full run, straight at the side of the building. Then, at the last second, he kicked off the wall and did a perfect round off. He landed on his feet, his hands hovering in the air for a second before he looked back at Eames. \"Ha!\" Eames closed his mouth. \"Um.\" \"Wanna see it again?\" \"I mean,\" Eames swallowed, \"I… no, no you shouldn\\'t probably do it aga-okay…\" he said in a daze as Arthur took another runup to the wall and did it again. \"Whoooo!\" he said, laughing as he landed it perfectly. \"Damn, it\\'s been a long time since I did that! You didn\\'t think I could do it.\" \"I…\" Eames said helplessly. \"I\\'ll know better than to doubt you next time, Arthur.\" Arthur grinned at him, both dimples on full display, and Eames marvelled at the man with flushed cheeks and tousled hair who had replaced the straight-laced pointman listing off his barstool from inside. \"Want to see what else I can do?\" Just then, a cab pulled to the curb and Eames flagged it down. \"Honestly, Arthur?\" Eames said, holding the door open for him, \"I really, really do. But maybe tomorrow, hmm?\" He held out Arthur\\'s jacket, and Arthur slid his arms into the sleeves, smiling. \"Okay,\" he said happily enough. \"Remind me, okay?\" \"Oh, I definitely will,\" Eames grinned as Arthur got into the cab. \"You know who has a great accent?\" Arthur said, crawling across the back seat of the taxi. \"Hmm?\" Eames asked, slightly distracted by the way Arthur\\'s trousers really were sinfully tight. \"Karl Urban.\" Eames ducked in after him and leaned forward to give the cabbie the address for Arthur\\'s hotel. \"What was that?\" he asked Arthur. \"Karl Urban. The actor?\" Arthur settled himself against the door, then as the taxi pulled away from the curb, tried to take his jacket off again. Eames tried to help and keep from being hit in the face at the same time. \"Arthur, darling, you just…\" he sighed. \"It\\'s really round,\" Arthur said, narrowly missing Eames\\' nose and not getting any further out of his jacket. \"Round?\" \"Yeah, the Kiwi accents are rounder.\" Eames grabbed Arthur\\'s arm and held the sleeve. \"Pull,\" he commanded and helped Arthur tug one arm out of the jacket. He watched Arthur try to twist around to get out of the other one, and Eames managed to catch it and pull. What he ended up with was a lap full of Arthur. \"But you know what?\" Arthur asked, his face inches from Eames\\' own, and his voice low and soft. \"What?\" Eames asked, frozen, and staring into brown eyes with flecks of gold in them. \"I like your accent best.\" Eames didn\\'t want to move, ever again. \"Well, I do have great, stand uppy words. From my mouth,\" he said, trying for a smile. \"Because I like you best,\" Arthur said, earnest and unblinking. Eames couldn\\'t breathe. \"Arthur…\" Then Arthur threw up on his shoes.

No matter the job, he found that unprofessional, and his specific circumstances made it flat-out stupid. But, after months on the run with Cobb, away from everything he knew and in increasingly nerve-wracking situations, he started to lose his cool. He needed something to take the edge off, and, more than that, he needed something that was just his. He\\'d given up everything to keep Dom Cobb alive and out of jail, with very little in return-Cobb barely spoke to him most days. Arthur wasn\\'t someone who craved attention or affection often, but even he had needs. On the second job he and Cobb worked with the young architect, Arthur took Nash to bed. He\\'d intended it to be a one-time thing, just something to release the pressure for a couple hours, let him feel something good for the first time in weeks. But once he\\'d had a taste of that feeling, Arthur couldn\\'t give it up. Not now, not when everything else was so awful. So he kept doing it. The first complication was hiding the relationship from Cobb. Cobb had turned so paranoid about everything, there was no way he\\'d react well to learning Arthur was banging the best architect they\\'d found who would work with them. The risk was too great. Arthur could just imagine the combined disappointment and anger in Cobb\\'s eyes if he confessed. Even before their first night together, Arthur swore Nash to secrecy. Nash didn\\'t seem to mind. The second complication was Nash himself. Arthur was surprised by how much he liked Nash-not just his trim, pliant body, or his willingness to give almost indefatigable head, but spending time with him. He was quiet and anxious, but, when given the chance, softly funny and oddly affectionate. When they spent time together, typically in snatches and bursts in the middle of the night, Nash slowly drew Arthur out, asking him questions that didn\\'t feel invasive, but instead gentle and curious. Most of them, Arthur answered. He told Nash about his childhood. He told him about his college years, and about the Army (with significant portions redacted, but still). He told him a million silly things that nobody had bothered to learn about him in years-the movies he liked, the first girl he\\'d kissed (and then the first boy), the way he liked his eggs and took his coffee. Over the course of one job, and then the next, it slowly became clear that as Arthur took care of Dom-as Arthur took care of everything-Nash was beginning to take care of Arthur. Sometimes, when he wasn\\'t with Nash, Arthur worried about what he was getting himself into. He knew how much any sort of personal attachment could cost him when he and Dom were taking more and more dangerous jobs. He knew that Nash was taking a risk by even working with them. But he couldn\\'t find it in himself to care enough to stop. He so rarely did things for selfish reasons, but this was selfish. There was no other justification for it: Arthur kept on with Nash because he wanted to. \"Why are you here, with me?\" It wasn\\'t typical for Arthur to be the one who initiated the conversations they often had in bed, but tonight he felt particularly relaxed. They\\'d just ended a remarkably well-executed job, with no sign of the ghost of Mal. They\\'d been paid and split up. Arthur (and Nash, though Dom didn\\'t know that) holed up for a few days in a nondescript hotel in Nice, while Dom headed to South America to look for a new job. For the first time in months, Arthur had a break. He and Nash had spent the first day of it sleeping, eating mediocre room service, and having a lot of sex. They were lounging in bed in their boxers; Nash was flipping channels on the TV. \"What do you mean?\" Nash looked at Arthur with a furrowed brow. \"You asked me to come with you to France.\" \"No, I don\\'t mean here in France. I mean, why are you...seeing me?\" Arthur wasn\\'t sure how to characterize their relationship, but he had an inclination that describing it as \"fucking\" would be insensitive. \"Because you\\'re gorgeous, and brilliant, and I have fun with you?\" Nash shook his head, indicating the answer was an obvious one. \"I\\'m also on the run and constantly getting shot at,\" Arthur pointed out, reasonably. Nash shrugged. \"Don\\'t mind a little danger.\" Arthur knew it wasn\\'t true-the dangerous aspect of their work weighed far heavier on Nash than it did on him, or even on Dom. Nash was an artist. He\\'d gotten into dream architecture for the sake of creation, building worlds with a palette of pure imagination. The high stakes were just an unpleasant side effect, like the needle scars and dreamlessness left by the Somnacin. Nash wasn\\'t even all that interested in the money. Seeing that Arthur didn\\'t buy his response, Nash continued. \"You\\'re right. I don\\'t like the danger. But it\\'s worth it.\" He ran a hand up Arthur\\'s bare thigh. \"You\\'re incredible. You\\'re so fucking far out of my league. But I\\'m the one who is here, now. That\\'s worth a risk.\" Arthur frowned. He didn\\'t like the inequality the answer implied. He was terrible with responding to declarations like that, though. Should he tell Nash that he, too, was incredible? Would that sound trite or forced? \"I\\'m not out of your league,\" he said, finally, after waiting longer than he should. Nash smiled, clearly seeing how difficult this was for Arthur and kindly giving him a way out. \"OK,\" he said, \"but the rest stands. I\\'m here because I want to be. Because I like to be. Because I like you.\" As Arthur thought on that, Nash returned to the television, trying to find something in English, because he spoke no French. \"I like you, too,\" Arthur finally said, again later than was really reasonable as a response. \"I know.\" Nash smiled. It would all go to hell eventually, Arthur reasoned. Everything did. But life was going too fast and looking too much like it might end early for him to worry about eventually. Things with Cobb went from bad to worse. They were in Moscow, and it was bitter fucking cold, and Cobb was nearly catatonic. Arthur was planning the job on his own, doing the best he could to guide Nash through the architecture with almost no input from the extractor. Previous high tension levels were pleasant memories now, and every day felt like a balancing act on an electrified tightrope. For several nights, Arthur didn\\'t invite Nash into his hotel room after they finished, choosing instead to work alone into the night, then drop to sleep for a few hours in his clothes. It was sometime in the second week of the job when Cobb informed Arthur and Nash that he was going to be gone for the day. As usual, there was no explanation, just a gruff order to \"keep working.\" After the door swung shut, Nash fixed Arthur with an inquisitive look. \"I have no fucking idea,\" Arthur said, not bothering to hide his irritation. \"That\\'s enough, then,\" Nash replied. His voice was soft, as always, but it sounded firm. \"You need a break.\" Arthur shrugged. \"No time for a break. Too much to do.\" Nash walked toward him and put his hands on Arthur\\'s tense shoulders-he didn\\'t squeeze, just held them there. Arthur was immediately uncomfortable-this was the first they\\'d ever touched outside a completely private hotel room-but he didn\\'t shrug away. \"You need a break,\" Nash repeated. \"You can afford a few hours. I know you\\'ve been staying up all night. You\\'re going to make yourself sick. Or crazy.\" He chuckled, quiet and bitter. \"The last thing we need is another fucking crazy around here.\" True, Arthur thought. He took a deep breath, and Nash began to dig his fingers gently into the knots in his shoulders. \"What did you have in mind?\" He turned his head to look at Nash. Nash looked briefly mischievous. \"I have an idea,\" he said. \"Get your coat and stuff.\" Thirty minutes later, Arthur found himself at Hermitage Garden, watching Russians of all ages skate around the ice. He hadn\\'t realized it was Christmastime. He was Jewish, so it wasn\\'t as if he celebrated, but he\\'d been so involved in what they were doing he hadn\\'t even noticed the lights. It was picturesque, though freezing. He felt silly doing it, but Arthur moved his body closer to Nash\\'s, seeking out his heat. Nash responded immediately, taking a small step closer to Arthur. He didn\\'t put his arm around him or anything pushy like that, but he kept close. Arthur smiled. \"Do you ice skate?\" Arthur asked. Nash had grown up in California, like him, so it seemed unlikely. \"No,\" Nash confirmed. \"Never even tried. You?\" Arthur shook his head. Nash pointed. \"There\\'s a skate rental place, over there. Want to try it?\" Arthur surprised himself by nodding. Given the frequency with which he\\'d been beat up, shot at, and in car chases recently, what harm could trying ice skating possibly do? They were both awful. After about an hour, they could just make it around the ice, leaning heavily on each other and laughing. Little kids pointed at them and giggled. The cold bit into Arthur\\'s face, but he was smiling more than he had in months. His eyes filled with tears when the wind started up, and his ass hurt from his many falls, but he didn\\'t care. This was fun. He\\'d forgotten about fun. Finally, they turned their skates in and left the ice. \"Holy shit, I am frozen,\" Arthur groused, shoving his fists into his coat pockets. \"Stay right here for a minute,\" Nash replied. \"I\\'ll go over to that kiosk and grab us a coffee.\" It was on the tip of Arthur\\'s tongue to say that he could go himself, but he didn\\'t feel like navigating through the crowd. It wouldn\\'t hurt, just for today, to be the one who was waited on. \"OK,\" he said. \"Thanks.\" It took quite a while for Nash to return-everything was so slow in Moscow. Arthur checked his phone while he waited, but after seeing nothing pressing, he shoved it back into his pocket and returned to watching the skaters. Relax, he told himself sternly. This is good for you. You need this. It wasn\\'t something he could do on demand, of course, but at least he was trying. He attempted to breathe deeply, then regretted it, as the freezing fucking air burnt his lungs. Finally, Nash returned, holding two steaming paper cups. As he got closer, Arthur could tell they weren\\'t coffee. He smelled chocolate. Hot chocolate? What was he, five? \"What did you get?\" Arthur asked, his brow furrowing. \"I thought you were going for coffee.\" \"Coffee is the last thing you need,\" Nash said, smiling shyly. \"Besides, you told me about these, remember?\" As Nash handed him the cup, Arthur saw the top of the cocoa was covered in an explosion of tiny marshmallows. He thought for a moment, then remembered: It was months earlier, maybe only the second or third time he and Nash had slept together. Afterward they were making idle conversation in bed. Arthur could tell Nash was trying to figure out whether he was invited to stay the night, but he wasn\\'t sure how to broach the subject without being awkward. The conversation was about guilty pleasures, the things you know you shouldn\\'t eat but you love. Nash had just confessed to an extreme fondness for Cheetos. \"You know what I love?\" Arthur asked, looking at the ceiling. \"Marshmallows. But not the big puffy kind-the weird little freeze-dried kind. The kind in Lucky Charms. Or, you know what\\'s even better? The kind in Swiss Miss hot chocolate. Those little tiny ones that aren\\'t really marshmallows at all, they\\'re like something made for NASA. I used to eat that shit straight out of the packet.\" Nash had laughed-maybe not even answered. It had been a tiny, inconsequential thing. Now here Arthur was, in Moscow, on a job he hated, with a man he was growing incredibly fond of, and a cup of hot chocolate in his hand full of those little marshmallows. He hadn\\'t seen them in years. \"You...you remembered that?\" Arthur couldn\\'t sort out what he was feeling. It had been so long since someone had taken that kind of effort for him, had remembered a tiny detail for no other reason than to make him happy. So long, in fact, that he wasn\\'t sure it had ever happened at all. \"Sure,\" Nash said easily. \"I remember everything you tell me.\" Arthur was quiet a long time after that, returning his eyes to the skaters, sipping his cocoa, and feeling lucky. It did go to hell eventually, just like Arthur knew it would. A few months later, Nash made a mistake anybody could have made, but the stakes were too high, and Arthur lost his temper. Then Nash did what he needed to do to protect himself. Arthur could neither fault him for this, nor forgive him. Nash had every right in the world not to go down with the sinking ship of Dom Cobb. But Arthur was committed, and so they were on opposite sides. After that, there was another job, a miracle job, and finally Arthur found himself unshackled from his burdens, with no idea where to go next. He thought of looking Nash up-he\\'d heard Nash made it out alive after all. But by then it was too late, and then there was another man, and then another. Years later, finally, there was the man that stuck. That man took care of Arthur, in a way nobody had before Nash, and nobody had since. Arthur knew how to let him do it, because he\\'d learned, at least a little bit, from a quiet, creative man who gave him more than he knew he needed during one of the worst times of his life. If he hadn\\'t already learned, he may never have been able to open up, to be given to, to learn to take. Once again, Arthur was thankful. Years after that, there was a little girl. Arthur\\'s little girl. She liked hot chocolate with tiny little marshmallows. Arthur tended to be strict about nutrition, but he gave in often to that request. They drank it together, and Arthur told her a bit about Russia, and the cold, and ice skating, and knowing, for one perfect afternoon, that somebody would take care of him. ","Summary":" Arthur never intended to begin an affair with a coworker. No matter the job, he found that unprofes"},{"Movie":"Inception","Title":"Lucidity","Author":"BlueNeutrino","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13172943","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: This is your recent Tom Hardy convert reporting in. It\\'s been a while since I wrote a multichapter fic so I\\'m oiling my gears. This fic will be ensemble cast but mostly Eames-centric, plot-heavy, featuring OCs and mostly ship-free (excepting Eames x Arthur BrOTP. Maybe a little Arthur/Ariadne.) Can\\'t believe I didn\\'t get into this movie sooner because it ticks so many of my boxes. I. Eames is wearing a black tuxedo and a flirtatious smile that doesn\\'t quite reach his eyes. Among the gamblers, strategists and chancers laying chips upon green felt, or watching with hawk eyes while roulette wheels spin and dealers trade diamonds and reveal hearts, he feels perfectly at home. That doesn\\'t mean he\\'s quite at ease, but he certainly gives the impression of it as he leans back against the bar with the air of a man surveying his empire. He could play at being James Bond if he wanted: dream up a gun inside his jacket to go with the vodka martini he\\'s drinking, but he\\'s not here for pleasure. Not that being an international superspy landing himself right in the middle of danger feels so far removed from reality right now. \"Could I tempt you with a high stakes wager?\" he murmurs, leaning closer to the woman sat next to him as he slips a playing card out of his sleeve and slides it over the bar towards her. Even she looks like she could be a Bond girl, deep auburn hair elegantly tied up in a complicated Chinese knot that accentuates a long, graceful neck, while her black dress is cut low enough to reveal sharp collarbones before cloaking the rest of her body like a shadow. Her eyes are pale blue. Too pale, almost. Hard like sapphires. Those eyes glance up at him coldly from beneath black lashes before she reaches out to rest a fingertip on the back of the card, tapping once before a lacquered fingernail hooks beneath the edge and turns it over. Seven of spades. There\\'s a slight misprint on the suit in the upper corner, leaving off the stem so that it more closely resembles an inverted black heart. It takes her a moment to consider, then she decides the symbol is proof enough of who he is. \"What kind of wager?\" Even hailing as he knows she does from Moscow, there\\'s barely a trace of an accent in her voice. \"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t have the password, so you\\'re going to have to gamble on whether or not to trust me. Get it right, and we\\'re both in the money. Get it wrong, and you risk being shot on the way out of here.\" Her eyes narrow, fixing him with a scrutinising stare. He knows he\\'s the real gambler in this situation, needing her to co-operate, but nor is he the type to take unnecessary risks. They\\'ve played their cards right. She\\'ll trust him. A beat passes, then the woman looks away and takes a sip of her drink. When she speaks, her tone is cold and businesslike. \"I\\'m told you have something for me.\" It worked, then. Eames leans closer, letting his eyes flit up briefly to glance at Arthur watching from across the casino, then returns his attention to their mark. \"Let\\'s not discuss it here. Somewhere more private.\" \"Your hotel room?\" She looks at him with a skeptically raised eyebrow that says \" in your dreams.\" Well, he thinks, where else? \"Elena.\" It\\'s his first time using her name, and he sees her bristle, caught off guard. \"Allow me to explain the situation…\" \"Let me guess,\" she cuts him off. \"We\\'re sleeping.\" The words die in Eames\\' throat. He abruptly freezes, almost forgetting to breathe. \"This is your dream,\" she continues, clearly enjoying the sudden deer-in-headlights look on his face. \"Inside your friend\\'s dream, inside another friend\\'s dream. And you\\'ve brought him—\" Her head turns to gaze towards the exact spot where he\\'d seen Arthur just moments before, and it\\'s a fight for Eames to suppress his panic as he realises the projections around them have all gone still. \"And him along for the ride.\" Her head turns again, this time fixing on Cobb standing over by the blackjack table, shock and panic on his own face as two of her subconscious bouncers close in to keep him from trying to run. \"Dominic Cobb. He has quite the reputation. I\\'m actually surprised he isn\\'t the one I\\'m sat here talking to.\" When Eames looks back at Elena again, she\\'s smiling. It takes him a moment to gather his thoughts, fighting back the instinctive oh shit reaction at realising they\\'ve been made and trying to keep up the calm facade. \"They said you were exceptionally skilled at evading extraction,\" he remarks, and suddenly realises just why all teams that had attempted this before them had failed. \"They downplayed it.\" Elena sips at her cocktail again, insufferably smug. \"I\\'ve known exactly what was happening since the first level of the dream, Mr Eames. Set up to perfectly replicate my hotel room in the real world so that when I wake inside it, I\\'ll believe I\\'m no longer dreaming. That\\'s why you needed three levels. The level after that, you pretend to be my boss, give me an assignment, establish a contact. On this level, you pretend to be that contact. How am I doing so far?\" He grits his teeth, knowing she has them figured out. \"Almost entirely accurate.\" \"I won\\'t ask what my errors are. It doesn\\'t matter. See, here\\'s what actually happened, Mr Eames.\" Her smile widens as she leans closer, savoring her triumph. \"The minute after your people put us all under, my people stormed the room you\\'re holding me in, captured your chemist, took control of your PASIV unit, and established a means of communicating with me inside the dream. At the signal from me, one of my men will inject a chemical into your veins that will stop your heart. From that point, they\\'ll have five minutes in which to revive you before brain damage begins to set in. Eight minutes, you\\'re a vegetable. Ten minutes, you\\'re dead. So, to be on the safe side, let\\'s say you\\'ll want them to revive you within four minutes. First level of the dream, that\\'s an hour. Second level, twelve hours. This level, five days. And if you want me to send the signal for them to do that, you are going to tell me everything you know about the CIA\\'s plans to come for me.\" Eames\\' mind is racing. He blinks, and the sudden panic he\\'d earlier felt quickly turns to outright fear. \"You\\'re bluffing. There\\'s no way for you to communicate with the real world from inside the dream.\" Oh, but she\\'s enjoying this. \"Rapid eye movement. They attach sensors to my skull, I can send signals that my people know how to interpret. Don\\'t believe me?\" \"Not at all.\" He doesn\\'t sound as confident as she\\'d hoped. Elena only shrugs. \"Well, unfortunately for you, I don\\'t have to prove anything. I already did it. In the real world, I\\'d say...about a minute ago. Right now, your heart is making its final beat. Check if you don\\'t believe me.\" She holds out a hand to him, and in it he can see a stethoscope has materialised. Eames ignores it. \"I don\\'t have the information you want,\" he says, voice hushed as if fearful he\\'ll be overheard even in his dreams. \"The American government hired us off the books. I\\'m not a spy; I\\'m a forger. They told us the barest minimum we needed for this job. I don\\'t know anything.\" \"Sure you do.\" She says it with absolute confidence, and Eames begins to feel a dreadful certainty that this isn\\'t a bluff. A disconcerting inability to sense his own heartbeat while sleeping doesn\\'t help. \"They briefed you on this. You\\'ve been to their offices, spoken to their people. You know something . It\\'s all buried somewhere in your head, and you\\'ve got five days to find out where.\" \"Even if I did know something, if they find out I not only failed to extract what they wanted from you but actually handed over classified information to a foreign agent, I\\'d be spending the rest of my most likely shortened life in Guantanamo Bay.\" \"Not my problem.\" It\\'s accompanied by another shrug. \"See, here\\'s what\\'s going to happen if you don\\'t get me what I want: you die, this dream collapses, and so we fall back to the next one. In the head of your architecture graduate, I believe. Tiny little thing, isn\\'t she? Don\\'t imagine she really knows what she\\'s gotten herself into.\" Eames clenches his jaw at the mention of Ariadne. \"We try this again, and if that fails, then we fall back to the first level. Chemist with the beard, am I right? That fails, he dies too.\" Shouldn\\'t have gone to Yusuf, either. Their contractors could have found someone else capable of stabilising a three-level dream, but it\\'s too late. \"I guess I wake up with nothing gained, nothing lost. But the three of you don\\'t wake up at all. Worth a try at least, don\\'t you think, Mr Eames?\" Eames says nothing. He doesn\\'t know what he could say. The lights in the casino flicker. Paying it no heed, Elena flags down another bartender for a refill and sips at the cocktail with a sadistic glee. \"You need to work on the design of your drinks,\" she remarks, shooting him a taunting glance. \"This one tastes like fear.\"[Chapter 2] II. For a split second longer, Eames doesn\\'t move. A roulette wheel spins behind him, refusing to stop like the whirring cogs in his mind as a plan refuses to form. He glances down at the items on the bar: his own cocktail glass, with half its previous contents and less than half its former appeal; the stethoscope, and the playing card. Its suit has changed, he notices. Four of hearts. \"Take it,\" Elena remarks in response to his silence. \"In case you need a reminder. I\\'ll be waiting.\" He considers, then snatches up both that and the stethoscope, turning away from her as his eyes search in the crowd again for Arthur. \"Elena.\" His voice is hard. \"I\\'m not the one making the drinks.\" An unconcerned eyebrow raises. \"Then pass the message onto your friend.\" Movement begins to start up around them again as Eames hurries back to Arthur, Elena\\'s projections turning their attention away from him and back to their games, yet moving among them feels no less threatening now that he knows how well she has them controlled. The bouncers have eased up to let Cobb pass, and he rushes to join them with the same look of confusion and panic that Eames is sure is on his own face. \"What the hell was that?\" \"We\\'re made and I\\'m dying. I think that about covers it,\" Eames says dryly, eyes darting round for the exit. This is supposed to be his own dream, yet already his memory is failing. \"What do you mean you\\'re dying?\" Arthur\\'s eyes have widened. \"She\\'s got her own team. They know this is my dream, and they\\'re going to kill me up there for real if I don\\'t give her what she wants.\" His eyes finally find the fire escape. \"We need to get out of here. Somewhere safe.\" He begins to stride towards it, the two of them keeping pace as they cast wary glances at the projections around them. It appears that they\\'re being ignored, but Eames knows the truth is anything but. \"Wait, what? How does she know and what does she want?\" Eames can hear the panicked confusion in Arthur\\'s voice, but doesn\\'t dare look at him in case his own face shows something even worse. \"How, I have no idea. But she knows, and she wants intel on how the CIA are coming after her.\" They duck through the fire exit, but it doesn\\'t lead outside. Instead, there\\'s a long white corridor, strangely devoid of features like an incomplete level of a video game, save for the elevator at one end. \"We don\\'t have that intel,\" Cobb says, glancing the opposite way down the corridor and realising it\\'s endless. \"She thinks we do.\" \"Regardless. We\\'re made. Abort mission; time to pull out. The kick will be coming in a couple of hours if we can hold out that long.\" Cobb turns back to face the elevator, begins to hurry down the corridor towards it as all three of them instinctively know it\\'s their only choice. Elena\\'s projections haven\\'t followed. Yet. \"There isn\\'t going to be a kick, Cobb,\" Eames says, voice terse. \"Her people must have followed us into the dream. You think they\\'re going to let Yusuf and Ariadne wake us up?\" Cobb has gone pale, hurriedly recalculating. \"Alright. Then we just need more time. Where\\'s the most secure place in here you can get us?\" \"Downstairs. The vault.\" They\\'re at the elevator, and Eames drags open the grill with a metallic screech as he glances back along the corridor and wonders why they still haven\\'t been followed. \"The vault? You\\'re sure?\" Arthur follows him inside, but still looks hesitant. \"You build a vault, you\\'re mind\\'s going to put sensitive things inside. It may be fortified, but if she follows us…\" \"Well, if revealing my secrets to her is what keeps me alive, just maybe I\\'ll let her,\" Eames snaps, jaw clenched tight as the white floor recedes above them and the elevator descends with a groan. He refuses to look at either of the others, knuckles whitening as he grips the stethoscope still clutched in his hand. Arthur glances down at it and swallows. \"Eames, why do you have that?\" If he says it, even trapped in a made-up reality, it\\'s going to feel all too real. \"She says she already did it,\" he manages to choke out, reaching up to undo the ridiculous black bow tie and unpop a couple of buttons. It\\'s getting harder to breathe. \"Up there, a minute or so ago. They injected me with something and stopped my heart.\" Arthur and Cobb exchange nervous glances. \"You believe her?\" Cobb ventures anxiously. \"You think it\\'s even possible she could know from down here?\" \"Well, I guess I can find out, can\\'t I?\" May as well get this over with. Eames grits his teeth and puts the end of the stethoscope in his ears, then hesitates just a moment before pressing the other end to his chest. His silence and the look on his face says it all. Arthur and Cobb look at each other again. \"Eames, it doesn\\'t mean anything,\" Arthur is quick to say. \"This level of the dream, time\\'s distorted. You only have one heartbeat every ten, fifteen minutes. If you\\'re hearing nothing, you just haven\\'t timed it right.\" \"Well, that\\'s a nice theory, Arthur, but you know as well as I do that the brain is constantly aware of the heartbeat. It just filters it out from your consciousness so as not to drive you mad. But if it were there, and I listened for it, I\\'m sure my brain would let me know. So maybe the reason all I can hear is fucking silence is that she isn\\'t bluffing and I\\'m already dead.\" He snaps the final sentence and wrenches the stethoscope from his ears just as the elevator reaches its destination, clunking into position on the very bottom floor. Cobb drags back the grill, moving quickly towards the steel door and brass dial of the casino vault in front of them even while staring worriedly at Eames. \"You aren\\'t dead yet. The dream integrity\\'s holding.\" \"For now.\" Eames\\' mouth has gone try as he turns the dial to let them in. \"This level of the dream, she\\'s given me four days before I\\'m beyond hope of revival. So, if you can come up with a new plan, Cobb, think fast.\" They enter the vault: a stunningly bright room with no apparent light source and a floor carpeted in rich burgundy, the walls lined with shelves of stacked bills in no obvious currency or denomination any of them recognise. In the middle of the vault, there\\'s a table laden with a large pile of silver coins, and against the back wall, a row of safety deposit boxes. The door clangs shut behind them. A heavy thunking sounds as the mechanism buried inside turns and the locks slide into place. Eames hopes it will last. \"Alright, plan of action,\" he mutters, leaving the stethoscope on the table and crossing to one of the safety deposit boxes as the keys materialise in his hand. The playing card he\\'s put in his breast pocket: resting over his heart as an ominous reminder of his remaining days until times runs out. \"Eames,\" he hears Arthur\\'s voice behind him, infuriatingly logical yet just barely calm. \"She\\'s got us all spooked but we still don\\'t know anything for sure. You have a theory, but it\\'s testable. Someone listens to your heart for twenty minutes, at most, then we know.\" \"I\\'ve got four days to live, Arthur. I don\\'t have twenty minutes to spend just waiting.\" Eames turns back to them with the contents of the box in hand, and Arthur recognises the shining chrome case of a PASIV unit. Cobb steps forward, wary. \"Eames, what is it you\\'re thinking…?\" \"She wants to know what the CIA\\'s plans are regarding her,\" Eames says, placing the briefcase down on the table and opening it up. \"You\\'re the one they came to about this job. That\\'s in your head, Cobb. Not in mine.\" Apprehensive eyes watch as he starts spooling out the IV tubes. \"Eames, we\\'re already three levels down. Another dream isn\\'t going to hold.\" \"It doesn\\'t have to. I need to wake up again before this level collapses, which will take, what? Twenty, thirty minutes up here if I go one level deeper. It just has to stay stable long enough that I\\'ll know everything you do, then I actually have something to give her.\" Cobb starts. \"No. We can\\'t...I can\\'t do that.\" He grits his teeth, then pinches the bridge of his nose as he contemplates how could this go so badly wrong. \"Is your plan really to just give her what she wants in the hope that it saves you?\" \"My plan is to survive. \" Eames\\' face has turned to a glare. \"So, I intend to give her something she\\'ll believe .\" Arthur glances between the two of them, the oh shit realisation truly beginning to sink in. Cobb stares at Eames, opens his mouth, then turns away and begins to pace as he gives a huff of frustration. \"I can\\'t do what you\\'re asking, Eames! This is exactly why we didn\\'t have me be the dreamer in the first place. I know too much. If I let her have that information, I go to prison for the rest of my life, and I have children to think of. They\\'ve already lost me once. I can\\'t let it happen again.\" When Eames speaks again, his voice is uncharacteristically cold. \"You know if I die, her next target is Ariadne,\" he says, and Arthur could swear there\\'s a palpable chill in the air. \"You realise that, Cobb? Then Yusuf. Then I suspect she\\'ll make some last ditch effort to get what she wants out of you and Arthur anyway, and kill you for good measure. You notice she hadn\\'t followed us?\" His eyes flit to the their surroundings. \"That\\'s the thing about vaults. This may be my dream, but I\\'m not the only one who can populate them. She wants to get to my secrets, she has to come here, but she risks revealing hers too. I said I intend to give her something she\\'ll believe.\" His gaze on Cobb is imploring. \"Help me do that, Dom.\" A beat passes, realisation passing over Cobb\\'s face as he seems to realise what Eames his saying. Then he nods. \"Alright,\" he agrees. \"This is worth a shot.\" He strides to the PASIV unit and takes a needle, sitting himself on the floor as he begins to search for a vein. Exhaling heavily, Eames follows suit and tries to find space to lie down beside the pile of coins on the table. \"Put us under, Arthur,\" he says, offering his wrist to his friend, and just for a moment Arthur sees the look of unbridled fear that passes over his face. In what may be a vain effort to comfort, Arthur takes over trying to insert the needle. \"That\\'s your test,\" Eames says, and his eyes are almost pleading. Arthur swallows, understanding. \"I\\'ll listen. I promise.\" \"Twenty minutes, wake us up.\" \"How?\" \"Well, you have my permission to shove me off the table.\" Eames glances down at Cobb on the floor. \"Do what you like with him.\" Needles inserted, the both of them lie back, and Arthur lets his finger hover over the button to administer the somnacin. \"Alright, good luck, and work fast. I can\\'t guarantee there won\\'t be some subconscious Russian constructs working to blow that door off its hinges at any second, so Cobb, whatever\\'s in your memories he needs to see, get to it fast.\" He presses the button. The effect isn\\'t quite immediate, but it is swift. Two pairs of eyelids flicker, both bodies going slack, and then Arthur hears the quietest of sighs as Eames and Cobb slip deeper into unconsciousness. With a nervous glance at Eames\\' chest, he wonders if, having abandoned consciousness on this level, will he even appear to be breathing? Arthur briefly checks on Cobb on the floor, confirming that the unit is functioning even though the sedative isn\\'t designed to take them this deep. Twenty minutes. That\\'s all it has to hold for. If it doesn\\'t...well. Arthur isn\\'t sure that limbo is a worse fate than what might otherwise be waiting. He crosses to the table, deciding it\\'s worth a try to check the pulse in Eames\\' throat, then immediately regrets it as he feels the clamminess of his friend\\'s skin. Whether he\\'s actually dying or just believes that he is, it\\'s hard for Arthur not to be convinced of it, too. Arthur puts on the stethoscope, unfastening another button on Eames\\' shirt to let the chestpiece slip underneath, then holds up an arm to stare at his watch. The second hand counts on, and Arthur waits.[Chapter 3] III. Ariadne finds herself reminded of a painting that, no matter where you wander or how you turn, its eyes will follow you around the room. The barrel of the gun peers at her like an unblinking black eye, and however she shifts in her seat, dares to try inching further away, she always finds herself staring straight down it. The woman sat behind the weapon gives her a hard stare. \"Stop squirming.\" It\\'s said in a thick Russian accent, the glare on her sharp, angular face made more severe by the way her blonde hair is scraped back from her forehead into a tight bun. The black pantsuit she wears is similar to Ariadne\\'s own, albeit sitting on a taller frame, and coupled with the severity of her ice blue stare, it lends her an air of refined, menacing elegance. The uzi in her hand seems all the more brutish for the contrast. Ariadne swallows, and casts a glance around the train car one more time. Through the windows, the pitch black of the tunnel rushes by, granting Ariadne a reflected view in the glass of faces she can\\'t quite see. Cobb and Arthur are in seats beside each other the opposite side of the aisle, IV cables stretched across the gap, while Eames is slumped one row down. Elena is in the seat beside the woman, electrodes attached to her forehead, while the PASIV device lies on the table between them. Propped up by the Russian\\'s elbow, the gun hovers a foot or so above it. \"You don\\'t want to fire that,\" Ariadne says, and is relieved that it comes out with the confidence she intended. \"You shoot me, this dream collapses and drops them all into limbo. Including your boss.\" \"I\\'m aiming at your shoulder.\" Ariadne could swear she isn\\'t, but who\\'s to say where a bullet would go in a dream. On the table in front of Elena\\'s unconscious form, there\\'s a coffee cup bearing the logo of the Eurostar First Class. Barely drunk, the latte foam boasts a neat spade-shaped pattern, the stem smudged by Elena\\'s first sip of the drug-laced drink. A small, pager-like device lies beside the saucer, wires running from various ports to the electrodes mounted on Elena\\'s head. Ariadne doesn\\'t recognise it. \"You\\'re real, aren\\'t you?\" Ariadne says to the Russian. \"Not a projection.\" No answer. It doesn\\'t matter. Ariadne can tell. Whatever happened up in the real world, they\\'ve been followed. A beeping sounds from the device resting beside the coffee. Ariadne watches closely as the woman picks it up and studies the screen, though the angle is slanted too far for her to tell what it says. All she sees is the reaction, expressionless, but then the woman puts the device down and rises from her seat. The gun stays on Ariadne. \"Don\\'t move.\" Taking care to avoid the cables, she takes a step down the car towards Eames and reaches out with her free hand to touch his neck, checking his pulse. A frown forms on Ariadne\\'s face as she watches, and then the door at the end of the coach slides open. A man with a beard and brandishing a submachine gun strides in. \"Ana.\" It\\'s followed by something in Russian Ariadne doesn\\'t understand. \"Artem.\" The woman glances back at him and they exchange a few more words. Neither seem stressed, confident that things are going their way, and taking her attention at last from Ariadne, Ana strides a few more steps in his direction. For the first time, her weapon\\'s aim falters. Ariadne hesitates just a moment. If she\\'s to attempt this, she has to commit. She ducks beneath the table. The train hits a kink in the track. The resulting rumble sends a jolt through all of them, and Ana stumbles, clutching at the top of one of the empty seats for support. Her eyes widen, wondering if that was the accidental result of something one level up or the deliberate design of the architect, and then harden as they search for the architect in question. \" You. \" Too late. The train car is stretching. It comes as naturally to Ariadne as it had that first time warping the streets of Paris to fold earth into sky. Ana tries to run for her, but the gap between them is widening faster. Instead, she and Artem heft their guns, letting off a burst of fire, but as the car elongates a ripple flurries through the structure. New seats spring into place, emerging from the floor and folding down from the ceiling in a way that forms an effective barricade against the fire. Ariadne stays crouched on the floor, close to Arthur\\'s leg as she watches the Russians receding into the distance, and braces herself. Split. Like a bacterium, the train car divides. A metal shield curls itself around the gap rent in the middle of the coach, forming a new end until all that\\'s left is the gap of the doorway through which Ariadne sees the reforming car ahead rushing along the track into the dark. Throw the switch. Come on, concentrate. There\\'s another sharp jolt as the railroad switch shifts. The car occupied by Ariadne and the sleepers briefly rocks, and then the lights of the rest of the train vanish as the solitary coach hurtles off down a new branch of the tunnel. Shakily, Ariadne gets to her feet. She has no idea where they are. This place wasn\\'t part of her design. As the train begins its rolling stop, she checks briefly on the others: most have emerged unscathed, though Arthur\\'s arm is bleeding from where a bullet clipped him. He\\'ll live. We need to wake up, is the thought pressing urgently at the front of Ariadne\\'s head. Cheat the sedative. We have to get out of here. She\\'s grasping at the tops of seats to support her trembling legs as she makes her way towards the end of the coach where the door remains propped open, granting full view of the blackness beyond. There\\'ll be no running the train off the end of the track for a kick now, like they\\'d planned. Without the engines, the car will be stopping soon. Ariadne comes to stand in front of the doorway, braces herself against the frame, and thinks: Corkscrew. The track shifts. The lights by the wheels are just enough for her to see as the rails and sleepers begin to climb the tunnel\\'s cylindrical walls. The train car follows. Arthur feels the first jolt as a sharp tug at the base of his spine while the lights in the vault give a flicker. Breaking concentration just for a moment, he glances upwards, abstractly wondering what\\'s going on up there. \"No, not yet,\" he murmurs, gaze returning anxiously to Eames\\' face. \"We need more time.\" It\\'s been thirteen minutes, by his count. The stethoscope hasn\\'t left Eames\\' chest for a moment and Arthur still hasn\\'t heard anything. By now, he no longer expects he\\'s going to. There\\'s no avoiding the truth any longer: his friend is dying. By the absence of Eames\\' breathing and the coolness of his skin, Arthur could almost think he\\'s already dead. A sudden ache interrupts his thoughts as it blooms without warning just beneath his left shoulder. Arthur blinks, looking down to see a trickle of dark red oozing through his sleeve. Shit, he thinks. Ariadne\\'s in trouble. She might need him. So does Eames. \"Just hang in there,\" Arthur mutters, pleading with them both to hold on. For the next seven minutes at least, unless Eames is going to open his eyes right there alongside him, Arthur doesn\\'t intend to wake up. He doesn\\'t get a choice. The next jolt comes as a sharp wrench that lifts him clean off the ground, and then he\\'s falling. Ariadne doesn\\'t manage to hold on as the carriage completes its loop. She hadn\\'t really expected that she would. As the wheels reach the ceiling she feels herself wrenched off her feet, car barely clinging to the track as centripetal force fights gravity and the sleepers are launched into momentary freefall. Then the train comes down again. The wheels screech, clatter back onto the flat, and the track buckles. Sparks fly from the axles as the carriage grinds to a stop. Gingerly, Ariadne picks herself up from where she\\'s landed in the aisle, praying she hasn\\'t inadvertently caused any snapped spines as she gazes at the crumpled forms of the sleepers strewn across the carriage. \"Oh, come on,\" she exclaims, seeing no movement. \"You can\\'t all have slept through that.\" It takes a moment longer for her to realise they haven\\'t. There\\'s a groan, followed by signs of life as one of them begins to stir. \"Arthur!\" He blinks in confusion as she reaches him, finding himself slumped half in the aisle and half under the seats. Cobb is still lying unconscious across his legs. \"Ariadne? No, I can\\'t be here...I need to go back…\" She helps him sit up as he tries to recover from his daze and tugs the cannula from his wrist. \"Elena\\'s men followed us. We\\'re made. We have to pull out now. \" \"No, we can\\'t.\" Like a switch has flipped in his head, Arthur suddenly fixes his gaze on her with perfect focus. \"She has Eames.\" \"What?\" \"Her people injected him with something to stop his heart. She won\\'t revive him until he gives her what she wants.\" \"Wait, what? How? And what does she want?\" He\\'s no longer looking at her as he scrambles to his feet, wincing from the pain in his arm, and rushes to find Eames lying several feet away on the floor. Hands sweep carefully over the forger\\'s body, checking for damage, but the real damage is far better hidden and far more sinister. \"Classified information,\" Arthur explains hurriedly, \"She\\'s got some means of communicating with her team in the real world. Interpretation of rapid eye movement.\" As he works to get Eames propped up against the seats, something clicks in Ariadne\\'s mind. She crosses to Elena lying haphazardly over the tabletop, electrodes still stuck securely to her head. Her expensive suit is drenched in coffee. \"You mean something like this?\" Ariadne snatches up the pager-like device from where it\\'s dangling over the edge into the aisle and holds it out to him. Arthur glances up, and his eyes widen as if he\\'s suddenly scored bingo. \"What does it say?\" \"It\\'s in Russian.\" Arthur looks like he wants to swear. \"Doesn\\'t matter. What\\'s important is I get down there now to wake him up before the dream collapses.\" He tugs off his tie, then begins to fasten it crudely around his bicep in an effort to stem the bleeding. \"Why hasn\\'t he woken up already?\" \"Him and Cobb went into Cobb\\'s dream to pull out the information Elena wants. They\\'re in too deep. If I\\'m not there to wake them, Eames\\' dream will crumble and they\\'ll both end up stuck in limbo.\" \"Then...what about Elena?\" Arthur looks up, following her uneasy gaze to where the redheaded Russian is lying still very much asleep. He swallows. \"I don\\'t know.\" It doesn\\'t get much further thought as he starts spooling a fresh IV line from the PASIV device, safely intact inside its chrome case. His priority right now is getting back down there where there\\'ll be time enough to figure it out. \"Arthur, wait.\" Ariadne has begun to struggle with shifting the much larger Cobb into a more comfortable position, blood trickling from his own forehead where he\\'d cracked it against the table. She gets as far as lying him flat on his back in the aisle when a thought occurs to her. \"This train isn\\'t moving and Elena\\'s team are still out there somewhere. You go back down there, how am I meant to wake you again?\" Arthur hadn\\'t planned that far ahead. Nothing about this had been part of a plan. \"You think you can manage to wake Eames? It\\'s his dream. It collapses all the way, hopefully that will be enough to pull me and Cobb with him.\" Assuming it doesn\\'t just send us both crashing back into limbo. Ariadne bites the inside of her cheek, thinking. \"Remember the Fischer job? He was shot in the dream. We used a defibrillator to bring him back.\" \"The difference being Fischer wasn\\'t actually dead.\" \"Well, neither is he.\" She jerks her head at Eames. \"Not yet. He\\'s here. His body is his own projection of himself. I\\'m not imagining him, or you.\" She\\'s right, Arthur realises, and hearing her say it fills him with a sudden rush of hope. Eames isn\\'t dead yet. \"Alright. You got a defibrillator?\" She\\'s one step ahead of him, pulling it from an overhead compartment beside the emergency stop button. \"Got it.\" Arthur slides the IV needle into a vein and resets the somnacin pump while Ariadne fumbles with the buttons on Eames\\' shirt. \"I didn\\'t realise he had so many tattoos,\" she comments, and Arthur glances up. \"Oh yeah.\" He sounds unsurprised. \"He does.\" Ariadne sticks the pads into place and turns the machine on. On the screen where she\\'d expect to see a readout of Eames\\' heart rate, there\\'s nothing. She feels a chill. \"Alright, I\\'m ready.\" The reality of their situation is beginning to sink in. \"How long do you need?\" \"He has four days down there. At this level? Give us ten hours.\" \"Provided Yusuf doesn\\'t have other plans.\" She glances in the general direction of upwards and wonders what\\'s happened to the chemist. The look on Arthur\\'s face says he\\'s wondering the same thing. \"He\\'s smart, like you. He can handle himself.\" His finger hovers over the red button on the PASIV. \"Arthur?\" Ariadne meets Arthur\\'s eyes one final time before they close. \"Good luck.\" ","Summary":" A/N: This is your recent Tom Hardy convert reporting in.

Arthur/Eames. 01_Bad Dreams A gasp. Too loud, much too loud, don\\'t want to wake the others… Arthur practically fell out of the cot he\\'d been sleeping in, stumbled to his feet and shakily felt his way towards the door, gently lifting the latch in shaking hands before collapsing through the opening into the night air. He pushed the door closed and slid down its frame, his slight form curling in on itself, forehead to knees, arms over his head, panting for breath, bare toes spread on the cold concrete of the balcony, trying to ground himself in tactile sensations. Real sensations. He shook uncontrollably, and desperately spread his fingers into his hair, struggling to consciously focus on the temperature of the night, the feel of his scalp, the fabric of his pants against his face… Don\\'t think, just feel… This is real, this is real, this is real… again and again. Someone had told him once that the more he got into this business, the more he would lose his ability to truly dream. Well they were full of shit. He still dreamed, but it wasn\\'t places, it was just feelings… As if by pushing the architecture of the place into his work all he was left with was formless content – sometimes it was gentle, most times it was forgettable, but sometimes it was all terror and anxiety and running and dying and pain. Tonight was one of those nights. He tried to convince himself it was mind over matter. Stay in the moment, don\\'t think about how fast your heart is beating, don\\'t think about if this is still the dream, don\\'t think at all, just ground yourself in now; the grit of the floor, the push of a hinge in your lower back, the sound of traffic in the distance, the push of your hand on your temple… The door pushed open, slowly, but enough to unbalance him, and Arthur sprung to his feet, backing away to the edge of the balcony and gripping the metal handrail like a life line. He turned to face the door, still shaking, but straightening his back and hoping the darkness would hide the worst of it. A tall figure stepped carefully through the opening, turned and quietly shut the door before turning to face him, now that his eyes had adjusted to the dark Arthur could just make out the questioning look on Eames face. \"Go away, Eames.\" He spat out, wrapping his arms tightly around himself before turning away, leaning against the edge of the balcony, pressing his lips together and closing his eyes, still trying to get his breathing under control, but somewhat proud the shaking had reduced to little more than a quaver. Eames probably wouldn\\'t even notice. Just breathe in and out, Arthur thought to himself, this is the last person you want to show any weakness to, just focus and get through this… His train of thought was abruptly interrupted by the weight of a hand between his shoulder blades, the warmth of it felt through the thin fabric of his shirt, and then a second hand on his elbow. He opened his eyes and tried to pull together an angry retort, but was stopped short… \"Arthur, darling – are you alright?\" Involuntarily he took a shaking breath in, looking down, \"Honestly, …no.\" He turned out of Eames hands, sliding down the guard and back to the ground, once more curling up and wrapping his arms around his knees. Eames followed him down and sat beside him, keeping his distance but within reach should he need help – Arthur shook his head, disbelieving – shouldn\\'t Eames have thought up about four ways to mock him by now? But instead he let him be, sitting in a companionable silence, Arthur curled in on himself, gaze forward, Eames in more of a slouch, head back against the guard rail, looking up at the orangey-glow of the urban sky. Arthur slowly got his breathing under control, and the shaking slowed, he focused on the sensations; the grit of the floor under his feet, the sound of the wind, the fold of his shirt fabric around his elbows, the radiating warmth of Eames beside him. Eventually, after what seemed like hours, but was probably only a few minutes, he took in a long breath, exhaling slowly as he came back to himself. At the sound, Eames turned to face him, \"Better?\" Arthur nodded, still disbelieving at this sympathetic behavior. \"Well cheers to that. Can\\'t have the brains of the operation coming apart, now can we?\" Eames reached over and patted him mockingly on the cheek before raising the hand to ruffle his hair. Before Arthur could retaliate, he\\'d pulled out of reach, rising to his feet and the offering a hand. Reluctantly he took it and let Eames help him to his feet. \"Not one word about this.\" Arthur said quietly, avoiding Eames\\' eyes. Eames reached forward, pushing Arthur\\'s chin upwards to face him, \"About what, love?\" Then dropped his hand, reached for the door and with a bow, waved mockingly towards the opening. \"After you.\" tbc? who knows.[Chapter 2] 02 Another night, another freaking nightmare. It was always worse when they were prepping for a complicated job, all the planning, the in and out of dreams, the sleeping in chairs, falling asleep in a suit, none of it could be good for him. At least this time most of the team was out, only Yousef and Eames were in the apartment that was the team\\'s workshop tonight. Arthur woke suddenly, throwing the light blanket on to the floor and huddling on the edge of the battered couch he had ended up in, once again curling forward and focusing on sensations, he tried to get his breathing under control. Maybe it was worse that he couldn\\'t remember any images – he was such a visual/tactile person, it was more terrifying for the dreams to lack any shape. It made things hard to remember, and left him shattered and possessed of disjointed feeling that was hard to shake. He heard the squeak of a chair being pushed back in the next room, the quiet padding of footsteps coming towards him, then the couch shifted suddenly as another body sat beside him; close but not invading his space, a gentle hand ending up on the back of his neck before shifting to rub slow circles on his back. Arthur\\'s breath hitched as he tried to mutter something to the obviously-not-Yousef sitting beside him, but the whisper became a light sob without his permission… He was so fucking tired. Tired of not sleeping (not really), tired of waking up in strange places with a mind full of unknown terrors, just… tired. He never cried, he tried to remember as he shook his head in frustration, a silent tear running past his cheek, but what the hell, you\\'re already way past being mortified that this is being witnessed. Eames shifted closer, slowly and without his hand leaving Arthur\\'s back, then pushed his arm over the smaller man\\'s frame and pulled him back towards his chest, entwining his arms around him and cupping his hands around his shaking fingers. \"Shhh…. Just breathe, c\\'mon then…\" he whispered, twining his callused fingers around Arthur\\'s thin digits. Arthur closed his eyes and shifted his focus away from the lingering feelings of the dream, away from his growing embarrassment and anger at his own weakness, away from thinking and focused on touch: Eames\\' chin above his head, the warm hands exploring his own, the warmth of a thigh against his knee, the motion against his back as he breathed. And he breath slowed down to match the motion. His heart beat settled. The shaking dissipated, and the quiet sobs stopped. As they did, Eames relaxed his grip a bit, less cradling, and more just lingering in a shared space, less urgent, more comforting in his presence. Arthur opened his eyes, still facing forward, and lifted his hands to run them down his face, letting lose a deep exhale before dropping them back to his lap. \"…Thanks.\" Eames made no move to relocate, but moved a hand back to run fingers along Arthur\\'s wrist. \"Anytime.\" Arthur huffed slightly, \"lately seems to be all the time. How did you know?\" \"I always know.\" Arthur didn\\'t question, he could tell Eames wasn\\'t done. Eames paused, shifting his weight to a more comfortable slouch behind him. \"Your architecture,\" his hand stopped moving as he tried to describe it, \"all those clean lines, perfect patterns, geometric forms, it gets sloppy – like its running away from you on the days this happens. Not a lot, mind, but enough to notice if you pay attention to details. As you know, darling,\" Arthur shifted, annoyed by the off-abused term of endearment, but Eames didn\\'t let him go, \"I pay attention to details.\" Arthur had no reply for that. They sat in silence for a few minutes, Eames still with his arms on either side of Arthur, the smaller man still slouched against his chest. They breathed in unison, a slow in and out the was comforting, and warm. Arthur stared ahead out the window overlooking the city, feeling Eames relax behind him, then jerk slightly as his head bobbed up. Arthur had to smile at that, \"have you even slept tonight?\" he asked. Eames shook his head, \"you caught me. No.\" \"Wait… You weren\\'t waiting for …this?\" Eames didn\\'t answer, which was telling. Arthur turned to look at him, curious, his dark eyes searching. \"You did… you were… you knew….? How long have you known?\" Eames looked away before answering, \"for a while. But it wasn\\'t until the other night I realized you might appreciate some… assistance?\" Arthur chuckled slightly at that, more the hesitation, uncharacteristic from Eames, \"Well I appreciate that.\" He replied with a small smirk, raising an eyebrow. He raised a hand to rub at his eyes, \"We both could use some rest.\" Arthur rose, and Eames let him, he walked out into the common area for a moment, before dragging one of the reclining work chairs into the room, placing it, and then motioning to Eames to relocate. \"I claimed that couch fair and square. Now move.\" Eames pouted, \"I think we could both fit…\" Arthur cut him off with a look. \"But you\\'re so little?\" \"Don\\'t push it, Mr. Eames.\"[Chapter 3] 03 Arthur ran his hands slowly across the polished wood of the guard rail, its smooth finish wrapping around the clean modern lines of the metal stair as he glanced down towards the rest of the team, pausing to examine the quality of the light, not too bright as to be uncomfortable, but with a slightly harsh angularity as if to emphasize the \\'busy office tower lobby\\' efficiency of the space. In many ways dream architecture was never 100% accurate to reality, details were often added to emphasize the feel of the place versus what it would actually look like. This place was meant as a staging ground, to push occupants through to other locations with a business-like speed, not to linger. Arthur adjusted a cuff-link before descending the stair, if this were really accurate, a few of the high ceiling lights would be out, a janitor would be emptying bins or watering plants, and poorly designed day-to-day signage would be out, pined to glass with haphazard tape, directing groups to meetings, or apologizing that an elevator was down. Reality wasn\\'t perfect, but there was no cause to be distracted with making things \\'too real\\'. As he descended off the last step, Eames sidled over his way, ready and prepped with snide remark, \"Arthur darling, could you make this place feel any more sterile? And fluorescent… really?\" Arthur just shook his head giving the other man a look, honestly, it didn\\'t matter what he designed Eames never considered it adventurous enough, but the designs got the job done, that was what mattered. He walked past him without a comment, wanting to hear what the group was discussing, but pulled short as Eames reached out to touch his arm briefly. \"Not blurry though –,\" Eames took a glance around the room, \"looks fine.\" \"Good.\" Arthur managed, \"Let\\'s get back to the others.\" A/N: apologies so short :)[Chapter 4]  ","Summary":" A/N: not sure where this is coming from, and no promises on it going anywhere.

Życzę miłej lektury! :) Pierwszy raz zdarzyło się to, gdy czekali na lotnisku. Cobb i Mal zniknęli w tłumie, a reszta członków drużyny poszła w tylko sobie znanych kierunkach, zostawiając Arthura i Eamesa samym sobie. Arthur nie cierpiał Eamesa i miał dosyć współpracy z nim do końca życia, co wcale nie przeszkadzało mu w gapieniu się na jego tyłek, niemal przewiercając go na wylot. Ale chyba mógł zrobić wyjątek, prawda? To nie tak że Eames zrobił coś nadzwyczajnego, po prostu dzielili razem sen. - Chcesz się stąd urwać? – Eames łypnął na niego kątem oka, uśmiechając się szeroko. Arthur wykrzywił usta w charakterystycznym dla niego grymasie wzmocnionym przez uniesienie brwi. To był ten wyraz twarzy jasno mówiący: „Co jest z tobą nie tak?\", którego Arthur używał setki razy na swoich ofiarach. Jeszcze nigdy go nie zawiódł. - Skarbie – odparł Eames szczerząc się swoim szelmowskim uśmiechem kompletnie nie poruszony groźną miną – Nie jestem chyba aż tak odrażający. Zanim jednak Arthur miał szansę się odgryźć, Eames go pocałował, muskając szybko jego wargi i lekko się pochylając, by zrównoważyć różnicę wzrostu i nie zmuszać Arthura do unoszenia głowy. Miał ręce zajęte bagażami, wyszło im to niezgrabnie i niepewnie, byli ciągle potrącani przez śpieszących się przechodniów, a całą sprawę pogarszał głupi, durny przyśpieszony puls Arthura. Eames był lekko spocony, trudno było mu złapać oddech, kiedy na przemian mocno i niepewnie muskał wargi Arthura i w sumie to wszystko powinno być naprawdę żenujące. Zamiast tego było niesamowicie cudowne. -Ach – Arthur westchnął, gdy oderwali się od siebie. Eames próbował zamaskować swój wściekły rumieniec beztroskim uśmiechem, jakby nie był w najmniejszym stopniu poruszony tym co się właśnie wydarzyło. W tej chwili Arthur miał naprawdę ochotę go zabić za bycie tak cholernie nieobliczalnym. Wiedział, że sam musiał wyglądać, jakby został potrącony przez pociąg i nienawidził tej bolesnej świadomości, że był mniej opanowany niż jego przeciwnik w tym pojedynku. Ponieważ to właśnie był pojedynek. - Muszę iść – wymamrotał zamiast powiedzieć „pieprz się\" lub „czy to wszystko na, co cię stać?\" albo „może powinniśmy się jednak stąd urwać \" – To była… owocna współpraca, panie Eames. - Uważaj na siebie, skarbie – Eames mruknął, mrugając do niego w porozumiewawczy sposób i sprawiając, że nawet taka drobnostka zabrzmiała nieprzyzwoicie. Zniknął, przedzierając się przez tłum, a Arthur nabrał ochoty by upić się do nieprzytomności. Za drugim razem byli w Londynie. Od kiedy Arthur dostał wiadomość od Cobba o kolejnej akcji wiedział, że Eames będzie również brał w niej udział. Mimo usilnych prób nie potrafił przestać o tym myśleć. Arthur nie miał w zwyczaju pozwalać swoim emocjom przejmować kontroli w trakcie zadania, tym bardziej że cała sprawa była idiotyczna i niewarta jego uwagi. To była drobnostka. I miała taką pozostać. Jednak Eames, będąc Eamesem, miał inne plany. Arthur opuścił hotel piętnaście minut przed czasem z zamiarem skoczenia na kawę, zanim wsiądzie do metra, kiedy za swoimi plecami usłyszał znajomy głos wołający: „Skarbie\". Zmroziło go, czuł jak każdy mięsień w jego ciele napina się i niemal zmusił swoje płuca do wzięcia kilku głębszych oddechów, nim się odwrócił. Eames siedział w zaparkowanym przy krawężniku szarym sportowym samochodzie. Jego włosy były rozwiane przez wiatr, miał na nosie okulary przeciwsłoneczne i zdecydowanie zbyt szeroko się uśmiechał. Arthur tak bardzo chciał go w tym momencie zastrzelić. - Cóż – mruknął zamiast tego, unosząc brwi – to było do przewidzenia. Eames nie przestawał się szczerzyć, a Arthur poczuł, że nagle zaschło mu w ustach, jednak było to na pewno spowodowane widokiem samochodu. Przyjrzał się mu uważniej i aż zagwizdał z wrażenia. - Czy to jest…? - Lotus Elise – potwierdził Eames, posyłając mu uśmiech tak pełen samozadowolenia, że Arthurowi aż zrobiło się niedobrze – Nie mogłem się jej oprzeć. - Boże broń, byś zaczął wydawać pieniądze jak normalny człowiek – mruknął nonszalancko, udając, że właśnie nie wodzi palcami po lakierze auta. - To inwestycja – odparł – Inwestycja w moją osobistą przyjemność. Poza tym została wyprodukowana w Wielkiej Brytanii. Nie mógłbym postąpić już bardziej odpowiedzialnie. - Twoja definicja odpowiedzialności jest wypaczona – odpowiedział Arthur, wgapiając się w skrzynię biegów i zastanawiając, jakby to było wypuścić się tym cackiem na drogę, usiąść na siedzeniu kierowcy wciąż ciepłym od ciała Eamesa… - Uważaj, skarbie, bo jeszcze roztopisz tapicerkę swoim gorącym wzrokiem – uśmiech Eamesa był makabrycznie szeroki i tak pełen samozadowolenia, że doprowadzał go do szału. Arthur zmrużył niebezpiecznie oczy, gdy ich spojrzenia się spotkały, co okazało się być błędem. Eames spoglądał na Arthura znad okularów spuszczonych na czubek nosa, a iskierki rozbawienia w jego oczach były więcej niż rozpraszające. - Co ty tutaj robisz? – Arthur zapytał, próbując zamaskować zażenowanie – Jestem przekonany, że uda mi się samemu trafić do magazynu. - Nastąpiła zmiana planów – Eames wzruszył ramionami – Mam tutaj dom, bez sensu wydawać pieniądze na wynajem. Cobb i Mal przyjechali dzisiaj rano, ale pomyślałem, że ty i ja możemy zrobić sobie małą wycieczkę. Mrugnął do niego porozumiewawczo. Dłoń Arthura niemal nieświadomie zacisnęła się na pistolecie. - A zatem wykonujemy tę misję… w twoim domu – powtórzył bezmyślnie, powoli odzyskując równowagę. Eames kiwnął głową na potwierdzenie i przez ułamek sekundy Arthur pomyślał, że jeżeli on nie będzie mógł go zabić, to powinien zrobić to ktoś inny, bo takie zachowanie nie powinno być dozwolone. Ludzie, którzy całowali cię na lotnisku, nie odzywali się przez następne trzynaście miesięcy, a potem wjeżdżali w twoje życie Lotusem Elise i zabierali cię nim do domu byli ewenementem. Ludzie, którzy całowali cię na lotnisku i nie odzywali się przez następne trzynaście miesięcy nie mieli prawa istnieć, nie wspominając już o wyprawianiu takich rzeczy z sercem, jakie Eames robił z sercem Arthura. Takie były zasady, do cholery. - Arthur – głos Eamesa wyrwał go z zamyślenia – Wsiadasz, czy nie? Arthur posłusznie spełnił prośbę Eamesa. Nie był szalony, dlatego kiedy Eames wspomniał, że „to będzie kawałek drogi\", zapiął pasy, zanim jeszcze opuścili Londyn. Łapiąc ciekawskie spojrzenia przechodniów, Arthur zaczął się intensywnie zastanawiać, co zrobi Eames, gdy wjadą na wiejskie drogi. Jechali po krętych prowincjonalnych dróżkach. Sposób jazdy Eamesa… pozostawiał wiele do życzenia. Arthurowi przeszło przez myśl, że był naprawdę nierozważnym kierowcą. Był tak samo nierozważny również we wszystkich innych rzeczach, które robił i zdecydowanie nie powinien się już rozpędzać, bo jego wchodzenie w zakręty było niezdarne, dzikie i niebezpieczne, jechali cały czas na granicy katastrofy. Jednocześnie Arthur wiedział, że jego towarzysz nie był złym kierowcą, widoczne było jego absolutne panowanie nad kierownicą, najwyraźniej zwyczajnie lubił jeździć w ten sposób. Jednak to było złe, mogło go zabić, a poza tym szkoda byłoby zniszczyć tę ślicznotkę. - Zawsze tak prowadzisz? – zapytał, próbując przekrzyczeć wiatr. - Czyżby to było dla ciebie zbyt wiele? – Eames odpowiedział drwiąco, a na twarz Arthura wypłynął złośliwy uśmieszek. - Wręcz przeciwnie. Zatrzymaj się – rozkazał. Gdy Eames posłusznie wyłączył silnik, Arthur wysiadł z auta, obszedł je i otworzył drzwi po stronie Eames w geście mającym przypominać ukłon, czując nagły przypływ szaleństwa, którego nie czuł od bardzo dawna. - Kluczyki, panie Eames – poprosił, wyciągając rękę. - Co? - Teraz ja prowadzę. Eames mrugnął kilkukrotnie w jego stronę, jakby chciał zaprotestować, potem jednak uśmiechnął się lekko i wzruszając ramionami, wyszedł z auta. - Spróbuj jej nie zrujnować – poradził, moszcząc się na miejscu pasażera. - W żadnym wypadku – mruknął Arthur, przejeżdżając palcami po desce rozdzielczej i kierownicy. Boże, to było naprawdę świetne auto – Powinieneś jednak zapiąć pasy. Dokładnie trzy minuty zajęło Arthurowi oswojenie się z samochodem, zanim zaczął zachowywać się jak wariat. Rozwijał prędkość do stu jedenastu na godzinę na drogach, gdzie dozwolone było co najwyżej czterdzieści pięć, ku radości Eamesa. Włosy Arthura były w nieładzie, czuł, jak z każdą sekundą coraz bardziej rujnuje swoją staranną fryzurę. Mógł zostać w każdej chwili aresztowany, a mimo tego, śmiał się tak szeroko, że rozbolała go twarz. Ścinał zakręty tak precyzyjnie i szybko, że Eames w dzikiej radości uderzał w drzwi, wydając okrzyki zachęty, dyktując kierunki i Bóg jeden wie, co jeszcze. -Tutaj! – wykrzyknął w końcu jego pasażer, łapiąc oddech – Zaparkuj tutaj! Arthur posłusznie to zrobił, kręcąc nagle kierownicą. Samochód zatoczył koło na pustym parkingu i Eames niemal zakrztusił się ze śmiechu, gdy Arthur wreszcie wcisnął hamulec i się zatrzymał. Oparł się o siedzenie i wziął kilka głębszych oddechów, próbując pozbyć się uśmiechu ze swojej twarzy. Nie udało mu się. - Gdzie nauczyłeś się tak jeździć? – zapytał Eames, łapiąc oddech. - Mal mnie nauczyła – wydyszał w odpowiedzi, wciąż drżąc od adrenaliny, zapominając o swoim zwyczajowym opanowaniu i sarkazmie – W trakcie mojej pierwszej misji powiedziała mi, że będę musiał rozwinąć pamięć mięśniową do mojej roli, ale pewnie zrobiła to tylko, dla zabawy. Przy okazji – nigdy nie pozwól jej prowadzić tego cacka. Ona naprawdę by je zrujnowała. - Mówiąc szczerze, zastanawiam się, czy nie oddać go tobie – odparł, ściągając okulary i przecierając twarz – Nigdy nie udało mi się jej tak rozruszać. - Byłoby to strasznym zmarnowaniem inwestycji – odpowiedział, obdarzając go przebiegłym spojrzeniem i obaj się roześmieli. Arthur przymknął oczy i pozwolił sobie na chwilę odpłynąć. W tle szumiał odgłos zapomnianego silnika. Właśnie wtedy Eames przechylił się niezdarnie nad skrzynią biegów i ich usta spotkały się. Naparł na niego mocno, przygryzając jego wargi i Arthurowi przyszło do głowy, że powinien otworzyć usta, odwzajemnić pocałunek, ponieważ bardzo mu się to podobało, nawet jeżeli nigdy by się do tego nie przyznał. - Moja kolej – odezwał się nagle Eames z drugiej strony samochodu. Arthur zamrugał. Nie dostrzegł zniknięcia Eamesa, nawet nie otworzył oczu w oczekiwaniu na coś więcej. - Co? – wykrztusił. - Chcę prowadzić – odparł Eames, lekko się rumieniąc i wyglądało na to, że znowu nie będą rozmawiać o tym, co między nimi zaszło. Momentalnie uśmiech zniknął z twarzy Arthura, a jego palce znowu zaczęły go świerzbić, by sięgnąć po broń – Łatwiej będzie jeśli ja poprowadzę, nie umiem dawać wskazówek z miejsca pasażera. - W porządku – Arthur prychnął, wysiadając z auta i obchodząc jego maskę. Spiorunował wzrokiem Eamesa, kiedy się mijali i ledwo powstrzymał pokusę, by go nie uderzyć. - Skarbie – Eames spojrzał na niego z wyczekiwaniem, gdy usiedli na swoich wcześniejszych miejscach i tłumiąc irytację, Arthur zaczął go uczyć sztuki prawidłowego kierowania autem. Za trzecim razem znajdowali się dwa poziomy pod ziemią i Eames trzymał w objęciach rannego Arthura, który nieustannie pluł krwią z przebitego płuca. - Cholera – podsumowała sytuację Mal. Wystrzeliła jedną kulę, w dodatku pod zbyt dużym kątem, by zabić na miejscu, ale ta jedna kula wystarczyła, by przebić pierś Arthura na wylot i dosięgnąć Eamesa. Nieznośny ból zdawał się nie mieć końca, nogi Arthura ugięły się pod nim i upadł pociągając za sobą Eamesa. Wylądowali na ziemi, Mal zdążyła już zniknąć, Arthur wciąż słyszał jej kroki i czuł, że umiera. Wtedy Eames uniósł głowę i mrucząc niezrozumiałe przekleństwa, pocałował go. Arthur poczuł na ustach krew Eamesa. Czuł jej metaliczny, gorzki posmak i chociaż wiedział, że powinien zamknąć oczy i się obudzić, nie potrafił tego zrobić. Może wynikało to z bólu lub bliskiej śmierci, ale naprawdę nie chciał, żeby Eames przestał. Wziął płytki oddech i pierwszy raz naprawdę odwzajemnił pocałunek. Usłyszał urywany oddech Eamesa i poczuł jeszcze więcej krwi na języku, zdając sobie sprawę, że mógłby umrzeć w tej chwili. Eames wydał okrzyk pełen bólu i Arthur mógł czuć jego drżący oddech na swoich ustach, gdy wszystko wokół nich płonęło. Nie przejmował się otoczeniem, muzyką coraz silniej rozbrzmiewającą w jego uszach ani oszalałym biciem jego serca, łapiąc ostatnie chwile czułości przed powrotem. Gdy otworzył oczy, mimowolnie zacisnął rękę na piersi i poczuł na sobie wzrok Eamesa, gapiącego się na niego z otwartymi ze zdumienia ustami. Arthur przymknął oczy, próbując przypomnieć sobie, jak się oddycha i wtedy dotarły do niego przekleństwa Cobba o spapranej robocie. Za czwartym razem ich pocałunek był katastrofą. Cobb wysłał Arthura, by zwerbował Eamesa do ich następnej misji. Normalnie sam mógłby się tym zająć, ale za bardzo obawiał się opuścić Mal, której stan coraz bardziej się pogarszał. Arthur wiedział, że wykłócanie się w tej chwili byłoby samolubne, dziecinne i bardzo nieprofesjonalne, dlatego bez szemrania wypełnił polecenie. Naprawdę niepokojąco łatwo przyszło mu znaleźć Eamesa, dlatego siedział teraz na starej kanapie w jego zapuszczonym mieszkaniu, popijając zaskakująco dobre wino i czekając na to co nieuniknione. Już wkrótce, jutro, za miesiąc, a najlepiej teraz – będą się pieprzyć. To było tylko kwestią czasu. - Tęskniłeś za mną – Eames powiedział już po raz trzeci tego wieczora, przekładając między palcami już drugą wypitą przez nich tego wieczora butelkę wina. Była prawie pusta, resztka płynu migotała na dnie – Widzę to. - Bzdura – zaprotestował, biorąc od niego butelkę i dopijając z niej resztkę wina. Nigdy nie pozwalał sobie na takie niechlujne, nieeleganckie zachowanie, ale w tej chwili nie miało to żadnego znaczenia. Eames uporczywie wpatrywał się w ruch jego gardła, gdy przełykał i odstawiał butelkę. I właśnie wtedy ujął jego twarz w swoje duże dłonie, ścierając kciukiem kropelkę wina z kącika ust. - Fakt że się do tego nie przyznajesz, nie znaczy, że tego nie czujesz – powiedział. W jego głosie nie było słychać typowej dla niego pewności siebie i Artur wpatrywał się w niego jak zahipnotyzowany. Obezwładniony przez wzrok Eamesa jeszcze usilnie próbował przypomnieć sobie, dlaczego to był zły pomysł, jednak nie był w stanie. Wziął głęboki oddech i… zadzwonił telefon. - Cholera – mruknął Arthur, spoglądając na telefon – to Cobb, muszę odebrać. Eames posłał mu spojrzenie, które bardzo wyraźnie mówiło, co o tym wszystkim myślał, po czym westchnął i wstał. - Pójdę po kolejną butelkę – mruknął, po czym poszedł do kuchni. Chwilę później jednak wystawił z niej głowę i dodał – I przy okazji mógłbyś przekazać mu, żeby spieprzał, z wyrazami szacunku, oczywiście. Arthur uśmiechnął się kącikiem ust, gdy znowu zniknął, po czym westchnął i odebrał telefon. - Lepiej, żeby to było ważne, Cobb. - Misja nie jest już aktualna – odezwał się Cobb zduszonym głosem. Arthur zmarszczył brwi. - Co? -Misja nie jest już aktualna. Została odwołana. Nie wykonujemy jej. - Czy ty masz pojęcie, ile czasu zajęły przygotowania?! - Arthur – powaga w jego głosie odebrała na chwilę mowę Arthurowi. - Co? - Mal. Nie musiał mówić nic więcej, ponieważ Arthur jeszcze nigdy nie słyszał tyle smutku w jego głosie i nie miał wątpliwości, co do jego znaczenia. Przełknął głośno ślinę. - Jak to się stało? – spytał, bo nie potrafił inaczej. - Nie mogę… – wyszeptał i Arthur zdał sobie sprawę, że Dom płakał. Dom nigdy nie płakał. Bełkotał niezrozumiale i Arthur nie miał kompletnie pojęcia, co robić. – W porządku – odezwał się po chwili – W porządku, wszystko jest w porządku, Dom, przepraszam! - Muszę… Muszę iść. Czy mógłbyś… ogarnąć ten bałagan? Odwołaj misję i przyleć do… Paryża. Za trzy dni. Tam gdzie zwykle – głos Cobba był nadal smutny, zduszony i przepełniony żalem i Arthur był gotowy zrobić wszystko, byle go pocieszyć. - Jasne – odparł i usłyszał, jak Cobb po drugiej stronie westchnął z ulgą i się rozłączył. Było cicho, a on wciąż siedział na tej starej kanapie w zapuszczonym mieszkaniu Eamesa i nagle wszystko przestało być takie jak wcześniej. - Mam nadzieję, że przekazałeś mu moją wiadomość – odezwał się wesoło Eames, wychodząc z kuchni. Zatrzymał się, gdy zobaczył wyraz twarzy Arthura. - Co się stało? – jego głos był spokojny, opanowany. Arthur potrząsnął głową, mrugając wściekle. To było okropnie nieprofesjonalne, jednak nic nie mógł na to poradzić. Dwa tygodnie po tym, jak został wypuszczony z wojska, ta piękna dziewczyna z melodyjnym akcentem usiadła obok niego i pokazała mu świat. Wszyscy myśleli, że to Cobb go odnalazł, prawdą jednak było to, że zrobiła to Mal, która wzięła go pod swoje skrzydła. Mal, która nauczyła go prowadzić samochód ze sprzęgłem, gotowała mu obiad o czwartej nad ranem i wyciągała na zakupy po dziecięce ubrania, gdy była w ciąży z Philipą. Mal, która powiedziała, że „wszystko się jakoś ułoży\", kiedy kompletnie pijany wyznał jej, że „chyba zakochał się w Eamesie\" jakieś cztery lata temu i to nie mogło być prawdą, ona nie mogła umrzeć. - Arthur – zapytał Eames napiętym głosem i Arthur zdał sobie sprawę, że musi wyglądać naprawdę okropnie, skoro ten użył jego imienia – Co się stało? - Mal – wyszeptał, i wiedział, że brzmi jak przerażony, głupi i roztrzęsiony małolat, dlatego zakaszlał i spróbował jeszcze raz – Mal nie żyje – powtórzył i tym razem było jeszcze gorzej, bo już nie potrafił opanować drżenia w swoim głosie i Eames zamrugał parę razy zszokowany i jeszcze nigdy nic nie było tak okropne. - Pójdę po wódkę – odezwał się w końcu. Nie był to najlepszy dobór słów, ale milczenie byłoby jeszcze gorsze. Arthur nie miał prawa słyszeć kondolencji, ponieważ Mal nie była jego matką ani siostrą. Była po prostu jego przyjaciółką w chwilach, gdy nie miał nikogo. Czuł, jak ból rozsadza mu klatkę piersiową, co było złe, ponieważ nie miał prawa i istniała hierarchia tego, kto powinien cierpieć najbardziej. Dlatego kiedy Eames wrócił z wódką w ręce, wyrwał mu ją i wziął dużego łyka. - Spokojnie – zaprotestował Eames, chociaż sam również wypił sporą ilość, gdy Arthur oddał mu butelkę. Pili i podawali ją między sobą w ciszy, nie komentując w żaden sposób ilości alkoholu, którą wlewał w siebie Arthur. - Cholera – Eames schował twarz w dłoniach – Jasna cholera! Wiedziałem, że jest z nią źle, ale nie że aż tak. - Cobb brzmiał okropnie – Arthur wycharczał, biorąc kolejny łyk. Zapadła między nimi cisza. Eames uniósł głowę i spojrzał na niego z troską wymalowaną na twarzy. I to było takie dziwne, że coś mogło być między nimi szczere, że Arthur niemal się zakrztusił. - Sam również nie brzmisz za dobrze – Eames odparł i mimo sprzeciwu Arthura wyciągnął mu butelkę z dłoni, po czym położył na nich swoje własne i pieścił skórę Arthura swoją ciepłą dłonią. – Myślę, że masz dosyć na dziś, skarbie. - Pieprz się – wysyczał, zdając sobie sprawę, że miał faktycznie wszystkiego dosyć. - Arthur… - Ty głupi… Czy ty myślisz, że mi się polepszy, jak będziesz udawać dla dobra nas obu?– Arthur pojął, że to nie miało sensu. Spróbował jeszcze raz – Rozumiem, że nie masz problemów z prowadzeniem tej gry cały czas, ale ja tak nie potrafię, nie jestem taki jak ty i nie radzę sobie z ludźmi twojego pokroju. - Kto powiedział, że prowadzę grę? – wyszeptał Eames, a Arthur był tak bardzo pijany, zszokowany i nieszczęśliwy, bo kochał w swoim życiu tak niewiele osób, a teraz jedna z nich odeszła. Nie mógł znieść sposobu, w jaki patrzył na niego Eames. - Ja – odparł, przymykając oczy. Miał wrażenie, że minęła tylko chwila, gdy ponownie je otworzył. - Ciiii… – usłyszał szept Eamesa i zdał sobie sprawę, że zmienili pozycję i teraz siedzieli obok siebie na kanapie. Arthur zaczął wydawać zduszone dźwięki, które nie były, ani szlochem, ani niczym innym, gdy poczuł silną i ciepłą dłoń Eamesa na swoich plecach. Zastanawiał się, jak długo już trwali w takiej pozycji, nie mogąc sobie przypomnieć, kiedy to się właściwie stało. Włożył z nadzieją dłoń do kieszeni, gdzie znalazł swój totem i podrzucił nim w powietrzu. Nie przejmował się, że Eames go obserwował, kiedy kostka wylądowała na trzech oczkach, potwierdzając, że to nie sen. - Czy to przez szok czy przez to, że jestem pijany? – wybełkotał po chwili. - Prawdopodobnie obie rzeczy naraz – przyznał Eames, gładząc go po plecach – Myślę, że powinniśmy zostać przy winie. - Nie jestem w szoku, jestem w rzeczywistości– odparł, biorąc drżący oddech – I jeszcze, ta druga rzecz, och, cholera… – zatrzymał się na chwilę, próbując zebrać myśli – Cholera – wysyczał z irytacją. Eames zakrył sobie oczy dłonią, próbując ukryć łzy i Arthur naprawdę nie mógł się nadziwić, że z nich dwóch w tej sytuacji to on był tym dojrzałym. Arthur został poprowadzony przez Eamesa do sypialni i pchnięty na łóżko. - Nie mogę tego zrobić – wyszeptał. - Jeśli myślisz, że mam zamiar cię wykorzystać, kiedy jesteś pijany i cierpisz – odparł spokojnie Eames – to możesz iść diabła, skarbie. - Nie, nie o to mi chodzi – jęknął, machając dłonią. – Mam na myśli to, nie potrzebuję tego, to nieprofesjonalne i słabe… Eames przerwał mu wpół zdania, przykrywając jego usta dłonią. Chciał go spiorunować spojrzeniem, jednak nagle całe pomieszczenie zaczęło się kręcić, co było bardzo rozpraszające i już dawno ugryzłby Eamesa w rękę, gdyby ufał sobie na tyle, by jego gest nie przerodził się w coś dwuznacznego. Ponieważ nie potrafił ani go ugryźć, ani zaufać samemu sobie siedział na łóżku, wpatrując się szeroko otwartymi oczami w smutną twarz Eamesa. - Arthur, skarbie, najwyższy czas, żebyś się zamknął. Arthur powoli skinął głową, a Eames westchnął, puszczając jego usta i wdrapując się na łóżko obok niego. Arthur walczył chwilę z samym sobą, jednak po chwili zapomniał o swojej ostrożności, przyzwoitości i zdystansowaniu, i ułożył się obok, ukrywając twarz w zagłębienie szyi Eamesa i biorąc głębokie, powolne oddechy. Dłoń Eamesa głaskała go uspokajająco po plecach, a gdy Arthur na niego spojrzał, ten musnął jego wargi delikatnie, niemal przepraszająco. Usnął w jego objęciach. Gdy się obudził, Eames wciąż spał z ręką na jego plecach, a on sam wtulał się w jego klatkę piersiową. Obrzydzony samym sobą wysunął się z jego objęć, niemal wybiegając z mieszkania, by wsiąść do pierwszego pociągu i znaleźć się jak najdalej, próbując zdusić w sobie żal, że nie potrafił należycie się pożegnać. Za piątym razem znajdowali się na lotnisku. Cobb zniknął ze swoimi dziećmi, Ariadne spotkała się ze swoim znajomym z liceum, Saito poszedł prawdopodobnie wydawać pieniądze, a Yusuf swoim zwyczajem wyparował, pozostawiając Arthura i Eamesa samym sobie. - To praktycznie rocznica – Eames mruknął z tajemniczym uśmiechem. Arthur spojrzał na niego znacząco i uśmiechnął się lekko. - Chcesz się stąd urwać? – spytał. Poszli więc na kolację, ponieważ byli niemiłosiernie głodni, nie jedli od dziesięciu godzin i nikt im tego nie miał prawa zabronić. Eames zamówił za dużo wina, a Arthur był zbyt zmęczony, żeby się kłócić, więc zostali do późna, delektując się alkoholem, jedząc fikuśne przekąski, o których Arthur nigdy wcześniej nie słyszał i relaksując się. Po opuszczeniu lokalu błąkali się bez celu po mieście, podczas gdy Eames próbował sobie przypomnieć, czy miał wciąż wynajęte mieszkania w L.A. i gdzie mogłoby się ono znajdować. Arthur był bardziej pijany niż byłby skłonny przyznać, dlatego gdy rozpętała się nagła ulewa, ani trochę się nie przejął, tylko zaciągnął Eamesa pod jedną z markiz sklepowych. - „El Nino\" – Arthur przeczytał szyld i zaśmiał się – Tyle starań, a zapomniałem o cholernym „El Nino\". Naprawdę oczekiwał, że Eames zacznie się śmiać, tym histerycznym pijackim śmiechem, którym śmiałby się każdy po takiej misji jak tamta. Zamiast tego chwycił Arthura za szczękę z poważnym wyrazem twarzy, przyciągając go trzema palcami za kark i przytrzymując kciukiem, by nigdzie nie uciekł. Arthur momentalnie przestał się śmiać. Eames ze stoickim spokojem przechylił jego twarz i go pocałował. Był przy tym precyzyjny, metodyczny – dotykał lekko rozwartych warg Arthura delikatnym muśnięciami. Właśnie wtedy Arthur odwzajemnił pocałunek, pozbywając się wszelkich resztek wątpliwości. Otworzył szerzej usta i poczuł na sobie oddech Eamesa, którego zarost zaczął go drapać i który smakował jak chleb czosnkowy zjedzony przez nich podczas kolacji. Arthur wydał z siebie jęk, do którego nie wiedział, że był zdolny i przyparł Eamesa do okna wystawowego całą mocą swojego ramienia. Rozsunął kołnierz jego koszuli, przygryzł jego dolną wargę i przycisnął mocniej niż zamierzał, ponieważ to był Eames i mógł to wytrzymać. Zgodnie z jego oczekiwaniami ten mruknął nisko, chwycił jego włosy i przyciągnął go do siebie delikatnie, aby całować go pod innym kątem. Arthur czuł jak wszystkie włoski stanęły mu na ciele, gdy został lekko popchnięty. - Cóż – wysapał Eames, łapiąc oddech – Wreszcie nam się udało. Arthur spojrzał na niego oszołomiony. Zdał sobie sprawę, że dłoń Eamesa nadal zaciskała się na jego szczęce, przejeżdżając powoli kciukiem po kościach policzkowych. Arthur mógł usłyszeć jego urywany oddech, sam również ciężko dysząc. O Boże, i był twardy, obaj byli i nie mieli żadnej misji do wykonania, budzenia, umierania, nic ich nie dzieliło i zaraz miało nastąpić nieuniknione. - Skarbie – odezwał się Eames półżartem – Wiesz, że cię lubię, ale jeśli nie skończysz z tym uciekaniem, to cię własnoręcznie uduszę. Arthur mimowolnie prychnął. - Chciałby to zobaczyć. Sposób w jaki spochmurniała twarz Eamesa był tak subtelny, że gdyby nie lata obserwacji, Arthur nigdy by tego nie dostrzegł. W chwili gdy to zobaczył, zrozumiał, że dzieliła ich jeszcze jedna bariera, którą on sam wyznaczył i on sam jeden był jej winny. Nie namyślając się, Arthur przyciągnął do siebie Eamesa za kołnierz koszuli tak blisko, że ich usta niemal się dotykały w powolny, delikatny sposób. Arthur bardziej czuł, niż widział jak wargi Eamesa wykrzywiły się w uśmiechu i sam zrobił dokładnie to samo, niemal namacalnie czując zapach chleba czosnkowego, jego okropnych fajek i swój własny, durny puls. - Muszę cię rozczarować, ale nie jesteś nawet w połowie tak groźny, jak ci się wydaje. To było jedno wielkie kłamstwo. Eames był najbardziej przerażającą osobą, jaką kiedykolwiek spotkał i pewnego dnia na pewno miał przyczynić się do śmierci Arthura. Umarłby jednak z uśmiechem na ustach, bo Arthur wiedział, że Eames był tego wart. Z punktu, w którym się znaleźli nie było odwrotu. Wszelki dalszy opór był bezcelowy. - Wcale nie jestem rozczarowany, skarbie – mruknął, po czym dodał – Muszę jednak zapytać , czy my czekamy na coś konkretnego? Mamy wypełnić jakiś rytuał? Powinienem ci coś zaśpiewać i zatańczyć? Mogę to zrobić, wiesz w zasadzie znam parę nieprzyzwoitych piosenek i… - Och, przymknij się – Arthur sapnął i pocałował go, nie przejmując się padającym deszczem i jutrem, które nagle wydało się takie realne i bliskie.[Chapter 2] Oryginał: this life looks good on you Autor: Gyzym Zgoda: Jest Źródło: /works/135875 Tłumaczyła: Minnoroshi Betowała: elly23 Cześć! :D Przedstawiam drugie tłumaczenie z serii \"Mój dom jest tam, gdzie ty\". Jak zwykle należą się wielkie podziękowania za betowanie dla elly23 z 3 Twoja pomoc jest nieoceniona, dziękuję Ci z całego serca za wszystkie poprawki i rady! :) Jednak muszę niestety zaznaczyć, że w związku z nadchodzącym wielkimi krokami rozpoczęciem roku akademickiego, nie wiem, kiedy pojawi się kolejne tłumaczenie z tej serii. Tłumaczenie takich długich tekstów zajmuje mi sporo czasu i energii, a jako że jestem z natury perfekcjonistką potem je jeszcze uważnie sprawdzam i pilnuję, by wszystko było zapięte na ostatni guzik. Aczkolwiek jeśli mimo tego gdzieś czegoś nie zauważyłam, będę bardzo wdzięczna za zwrócenie uwagi. Na pewno w wolnych chwilach będę próbowała tłumaczyć, jeśli nie z tej serii, to coś innego, pewnie krótszego. Tym czasem zostawiam Was z tym tłumaczeniem i mam nadzieję, że się Wam spodoba! ;) Życzę miłej lektury! :) W domu Arthura obowiązywały tylko cztery zasady, które spisane na papierze wisiały na lodówce tuż pod listą numerów alarmowych i zwariowanym magnesem Eamesa. Trzy pierwsze były zapisane czystym, wyraźnym charakterem pisma i głosiły: 1) Żadnego strzelania w domu, dopóki nie wymaga tego sytuacja. 2) Wszystkie genitalia muszą być zakryte przed wyjściem z domu po gazetę. 3) Palenie uznaje się za aktywność wyłącznie na świeżym powietrzu. Chociaż Arthur przestrzegał tych zasad od lat, nigdy nie czuł potrzeby spisania ich i wywieszenia, dopóki Eames nie pojawił się w jego życiu. Czwarta zasada nie była napisana w czysty, czytelny sposób i Arthur nie był jej autorem. Została odręcznie nagryzmolona na dole kartki czerwonym, grubym flamastrem i głosiła: 4) Skarbie, nie dotykaj niczego poza mikrofalówką. Ogólnie rzecz ujmując, wszystkie te zasady sprawiły Arthurowi więcej kłopotu niż się spodziewał. Tak jak większość par, oni również mieli swoje nawyki. Ulubionym Arthura, nie licząc polityki „na zewnątrz nie jest jeszcze ciemno, ponieważ się nie pieprzyliśmy\", która, mówiąc szczerze, byłaby uwielbiana przez każdego, był zwyczaj jedzenia razem posiłków. Chodziło o to, że Arthur nie potrafił gotować. Była to jedna z tych umiejętności, której zawsze Arthurowi brakowało, a której zawsze pożądał. Wiedział jednak, że był w tym do niczego, dlatego się nie próbował tego zmieniać. Każda z niewielu prób ugotowania czegoś zgodnie z przepisem, których się podejmował w przeszłości, kończyła się wyprodukowaniem przez niego sadzy i dziwnie wyglądających, galaretowatych mas, dlatego uznał sprawę za przegraną. Przez wszystkie lata ich znajomości Arthur nigdy nie widział, aby Eames kiedykolwiek otworzył książkę kucharską. Nie widział nawet, aby kiedykolwiek Eames w jakąkolwiek zaglądał. Swoją drogą widział Eamesa krojącego cebulę maczetą, co powinno być przerażające, zamiast tego było jednak niesamowicie atrakcyjne. Chodziło o to, że Eames był niewytłumaczalnie fantastyczny w kuchni w przeciwieństwie do Arthura, który był chodzącą katastrofą kulinarną, dlatego to Eames zajmował się gotowaniem. Kiedy wracali wieczorami do domu, Arthur zawsze zdejmował marynarkę, wyciągał dwa piwa z lodówki i odchodził, pozostawiając jej drzwi otwarte. Wtedy Eames grzebał w jej wnętrzu, dopóki nie wynurzył się z rękoma pełnymi podejrzanie wyglądających składników, które stawiał na blacie, pomrukując wesoło do siebie. - Co dziś na kolację? – Arthur zawsze pytał, rzucając mu piwo. Eames tylko do niego mrugał i kazał mu się przebrać w coś wygodniejszego. Kiedy Arthur wracał w bokserkach i jednym z podkoszulków Eamesa, coś zawsze pachniało niesamowicie dobrze i Eames zawsze wtedy odkładał to, co akurat trzymał w dłoniach, jajka, szpatułkę, i całował Arthura, po czym wracał do przerwanej pracy. Zawsze jedli na tackach, nie zawracając sobie głowy zastawianiem stołu i zawsze jedzenie było przepyszne. Narzekali na klientów, dzieci Cobba i inne rzeczy, a gdy kończyli Eames rzucał „Olać zmywanie naczyń\" i przechodzili do części wieczoru „wcale-nie-jest-ciemno-dopóki\". Jakkolwiek idiotycznie to brzmiało, właśnie dzięki tym zwyczajom Arthur czuł się jak w domu. Naprawdę nie potrafił zrozumieć dlaczego. Właściwie to tak naprawdę wcale nie mieszkali razem. Technicznie rzecz biorąc, był to dom Arthura. Kupił mały domek w stylu rancha w Południowej Pasadenie za pieniądze z pracy dla Saito. Był w nim przytulny salon, ogromny gabinet, przestrzenna kuchnia, dwie sypialnie i cudowny widok z ogromnych okien, a co najważniejsze, było tam cicho, czasem nawet bardzo cicho. Arthur to uwielbiał. Po tym jak Arthur kupił dom, Eames wynajął mieszkanie w Silver Lake, które było małe, zapuszczone i kompletnie do niego nie pasowało. Arthur stwierdził, że zrobił to w imię niepisanej umowy zespołu, aby zawsze być blisko Cobba, by ten mógł zostać ze swoimi dziećmi, ale czasem ośmielał się wierzyć, że Eames chciał być blisko również z innych powodów. Nie było to zupełnie nieprawdopodobne. Eames robił wiele szalonych rzeczy. Poza tym sypiali już ze sobą trzy miesiące, kiedy Eames zaczął zostawać na noc, ponieważ dom Arthura był przyjemniejszy i łatwiej było z niego dojechać do pracy. A potem w zasadzie to było bez sensu, aby Eames musiał wracać się do Silver Lake za każdym razem, kiedy potrzebował świeżej bielizny lub dokumentów do pracy, a Arthur i tak miał za dużo wolnego miejsca, dlatego kolejne rzeczy Eamesa pojawiały się i już zostawały. Potem ulubiony fotel Arthura się połamał, a Eames miał identyczny i nie było sensu wydawać pieniędzy na nowy, a że i tak nikt nie używał drugiej sypialni, nie było powodu, dla którego nie mieliby zamienić jej w drugi gabinet. Dlatego teraz znajdował się w salonie dywan, którego zakupu Arthur sobie nie przypominał, Eames nie spał w swoim własnym mieszkaniu od miesięcy, a szafa w sypialni mieściła zarówno garnitury Arthura jak i kolekcję dziwacznych strojów Eamesa. Arthur był prawie pewny, że Eames się do niego wprowadził, jednak nie na tyle pewien, by o tym wspomnieć. To byłoby szalenie niezręczne, gdyby nie miał racji. - Mogę ci pomóc? – zapytał Arthur pewnego wieczora, siadając na blacie i pijąc piwo. Eames spojrzał na niego z nad pieczeni, którą przypiekał i uniósł brew. - To zależy. - Od czego? - Od tego czy chcesz zjeść wieprzowinę po burgundzku czy węgiel na obiad – odparł ze złośliwym uśmieszkiem, po czym zajrzał do patelni. Arthur spiorunował jego plecy wzrokiem i zeskoczył z blatu. - Nie jestem tak tępy by nie zrozumieć prostych instrukcji. - Czy powiedziałem coś takiego? – odparł ugodowo Eames – Nie przypominam sobie, ale jeśli chcesz mogę ci pokazać nagranie z… - Eames, przymknij się – warknął Arthur, przewracając oczami. Eames posłał mu przeciągły uśmiech i Arthur oparł się o lodówkę z ramionami skrzyżowanymi na piersi, próbując powstrzymać uśmiech. - Jestem poważny. Mógłbyś mnie nauczyć, na pewno w końcu by się udało. Przeszkadza mi, że nie potrafię gotować. - Albo – wyszczerzył się Eames – przeszkadza ci, że jestem dobry w czymś, w czym ty nie jesteś. - Nie pozwala mi to spać po nocach – Arthur przewrócił oczami – Tylko się wiercę i przewracam z boku na bok. - Nieprawda, nie kiedy razem zasypiamy – Arthur spiorunował go wzrokiem, a Eames wybuchł w końcu śmiechem, odłożył szczypce i go objął. - Gotowanie wymaga wyobraźni, skarbie – wymruczał Arthurowi do ucha – I tak się składa, że nauczenie cię nie jest w moim interesie. - Dlaczego? Eames uśmiechnął się przebiegle. - Nie mam za wiele przydatnych umiejętności, skarbie, poza tymi nielegalnymi. Nie potrafisz gotować, a ja tak. Jaki inny powód miałbyś, aby mnie tu trzymać? Żartował. Arthur wiedział, że żartował. Nie dodał nic więcej jakby nie było to nic niezwykłego, cmoknął Arthura w policzek i odwrócił się do piekarnika i to nie powinno mieć znaczenia. Naprawdę nie powinno. Jednak smutna prawda była taka, że Eames być może tak myślał. A jeszcze smutniejsze było to, że Arthur go wcale za to nie winił. Potem ich zwyczaj jedzenia razem posiłków przestał go już tak cieszyć. W pewnym momencie Arthur zaczął płacić wszystkie rachunki. Oczywiście, sam zawsze za siebie płacił, to nie było dziwne. Ale gdzieś pomiędzy poznaniem prawdziwego imienia Eamesa a odnalezieniem w salonie dziwnego dywanu, Arthur odkrył beznadziejną ocenę kredytową Eamesa i porozmawiali o tym. - Przecież masz pieniądze – zapytał zdziwiony – Czy ty nigdy nie płacisz rachunków na czas? - Nie – Eames odparł wesoło, czerpiąc wielką radość z tego, że Arthurowi to przeszkadzało – Mam tak wiele fałszywych tożsamości, skarbie, że nigdy nie zaprzątałem sobie tym głowy. - To najgłupsza rzecz, jaką kiedykolwiek od ciebie usłyszałem. Eames wzruszył ramionami, wpychając sobie kawałek zapiekanki z kurczakiem do ust i odparł: - W takim razie ty się tym zajmij. Arthur nie był pewny, czy Eames mówił poważnie, jednak był przekonany, że straszliwa ocena kredytowa Eamesa pociągnie go za sobą na dno przez jedno spojrzenie. Pracowanie jako absurdalnie wysoko opłacani złodzieje umysłów było naprawdę wygodne i świetne, ale Arthur miał założone konto w systemie oszczędności emerytalnych w wieku 15 lat i poważnie podchodził do wszystkich obowiązków. W następnym tygodniu przez własne zaufane źródła odszukał całą historię finansową Eamesa i zaczął porządkować jego sprawy najlepiej jak potrafił. - Eames! – odezwał się pewnego wieczoru – Kiedy ostatnio płaciłeś podatki? - W którym kraju? – odrzekł Eames, pojawiając się z wypchanymi policzkami – Ach, czekaj. Nigdy. - Nigdy? – powtórzył w niedowierzaniu. Eames wykorzystał sytuację i wsadził łyżkę w szeroko otwarte usta Arthura. Ten przełknął automatycznie i momentalnie stracił wątek, kiedy jego kubki smakowe zostały zaatakowane niezwykłym doznaniem– Niech to, to jest naprawdę dobre. Eames uśmiechnął się promiennie. - Jestem poszukiwany za gorsze przewinienia niż niepłacenie podatków, skarbie – Arthur wyrwał mu łyżkę z ręki i oblizał ją dokładnie – Zdarzyło mi się płacić podatki, od czasu do czasu, jeśli to cię w jakiś sposób pocieszy. - Ani trochę – westchnął, ale wstał i podążył za Eamesem do źródła pyszności. Okazało się, że było to risotto, które zjedli z patelni na blacie, dyskutując o prawie podatkowym. - To nie jest śmieszne!– wybuchnął w końcu Arthur– Będziesz musiał nauczyć mnie podrabiać swój podpis i liczyć na to, że cię nie oskubię do ostatniego grosza. Eames nawet nie mrugnął. Arthurowi zajęło niemal godzinę, by nauczyć się jego zamaszystego podpisu. Pierwsze trzy zasady zostały przyczepione do lodówki, po tym jak Eames złamał je wszystkie na raz pewnego poranka. Śmiał się z tego i pokazał Arthurowi środkowy palec, na co ten przewrócił oczami, desperacko próbując powstrzymać uśmiech. Czwarta pojawiła się trzy tygodnie później, kiedy Arthur prawie spalił ich dom. Pokłócili się. Zaczęło się od niewinnej sprzeczki, która broń była lepsza, by przerodzić się otwartą kłótnię o ekstrakcję, którą Arthur zawalił trzy lata temu, jednak tak naprawdę chodziło o fakt, że w obecności Arthura tego wieczoru Eamesowi zaoferowano misję w Kairze, gdzie miał spędzić sześć miesięcy i żaden z nich nie wiedział, jak o tym porozmawiać. Arthur wykrzyczał szereg okrutnych słów, które miały znaczyć: „Myśl o mieszkaniu tutaj przez sześć miesięcy bez ciebie jest cholernie przerażająca\", a Eames wypowiedział szereg okropnych rzeczy, które znaczyły: „Cóż, szczerze mówiąc, mnie to również nie pasuje, ale nigdy nie dałeś mi do zrozumienia, że masz coś przeciwko temu\" i cała sytuacja była bardzo nieprzyjemna. W końcu Eames wybuchnął. - Pieprzyć to – wykrzyknął, po czym wybiegł z domu, a Arthur poczuł, że Eames już nie wróci – ani tego samego wieczoru, ani za sześć miesięcy, ani w ogóle – i zdecydował się zrobić obiad. Niby jak trudne mogło się to okazać? Przepis głosił: „Podgrzej dwie łyżki stołowe oliwy z oliwek na wolnym ogniu\". Arthur posłusznie odmierzył oliwę i włączył kuchenkę, jednak nie zauważył leżących obok patelni papierowych ręczników, dopóki jeden z nich nie zaczął się palić. - Cholera – warknął, machając ręką i próbując go zgasić, przez co jednak ogień rozprzestrzenił się na całą rolkę i rękaw jego koszuli. Uznając, że najlepiej w tej sytuacji byłoby zacząć od zgaszenia samego siebie, pobiegł do zlewu i wsadził rękę pod strumień wody dopóki nie zniknęły wszystkie płomienie, po czym wypełnił szybko jeden z kufli do piwa Eamesa wodą i rzucił nią w płonącą rolkę papieru. Był tak zdenerwowany, że chybił i zamiast w rolkę wylał wodę na rozgrzany na patelni tłuszcz. Płonący tłuszcz, jak się okazało, był bardzo trudny do ugaszenia. Arthur siedział na tylnym zderzaku jednego z wozów strażackich, wykłócając się, że potrafi opatrzyć własne oparzenia, gdy Eames wbiegł na podjazd. Arthur już się nie gniewał, od początku nie był zły, jednak coś zaczęło go piec w klatce piersiowej, gdy zobaczył wyraz absolutnej paniki na twarzy Eamesa. Nie bez znaczenia był również sam fakt, że Eames w ogóle wrócił. - Arthur! – krzyczał, rozglądając się dookoła jak szaleniec – Arthur! - Tutaj – zawołał, kaszląc. Chciał wstać, ale nie był pewien, czy jego płuca były na to gotowe. Zamiast tego podszedł do niego Eames, a w jego oczach panika zamieniła się w wyraz błogiej ulgi, kiedy go całował, ściskając za ramiona. Artur zakasłał w jego usta, co było naprawdę obrzydliwe, jednak Eames zdawał się tym nie przejmować. Odsunął się, by pozwolić Arthurowi złapać oddech, dotknął jego włosów i przejechał po jego policzku ubrudzonym sadzą. - Chryste, skarbie – mruknął – Co ty sobie zrobiłeś? - Zgłodniałem – odparł Arthur, wzdychając i znowu kaszląc. Eames wydał dźwięk, który można by było uznać za śmiech, gdyby nie był tak zbolały i usiadł na zderzaku obok Arthura, obejmując go ramieniem. Arthur położył głowę na jego ramieniu, czując się lepiej niż kiedykolwiek i przymknął oczy. - A kim ty właściwie jesteś? – zapytała Eamesa jedna z kobiet w mundurach parę minut później. - Jestem Eames – odparł, gładząc delikatnie, uspokajająco ramię Arthura, a w jego głosie było coś takiego, co sprawiło, że się wycofała. Zniszczenia nie były aż takie wielkie. Sufit był lekko przypalony, musieli wymienić kuchenkę i część szafek, jednak w gruncie rzeczy mieli sporo szczęścia. Wietrzenie zajęło strażakom kilka godzin, zanim opuścili ich dom i Eames położył Arthura do łóżka, uciszając jego gorący sprzeciw, że wszystko z nim w porządku. Następnego ranka pojawiła się na lodówce czwarta zasada napisana czerwonym markerem i podkreślona pięć razy, a Eames szczerzył się do niego nad kubkiem kawy i bułek z piekarni na rogu. Mimo usilnych prób spiorunowania go wzrokiem, Arthur uśmiechnął się, a kiedy obejrzeli wiadomości, śmiali się już razem, gdy ich pożar dostał minutę czasu antenowego. Eames nie przyjął misji w Kairze. Urodziny Ariadne wypadły podczas trzymiesięcznego okresu, gdy wszyscy pracowali w innych bazach i zdecydowali się wyjść drużyną do restauracji na obiad zamiast na popijawę barze. Zjawili się wszyscy poza Eamesem, który był zajęty śledzeniem celu na jakimś przyjęciu, dlatego Arthur życzył Ariadne wszystkiego najlepszego w imieniu ich obu, a potem zamówił coś, co smakowałoby o niebo lepiej, gdyby zrobił to Eames. Byli w trakcie posiłku, kiedy jego telefon zadzwonił. - Dobrze się bawisz beze mnie? – spytał Eames z uśmiechem w głosie. Arthur przygryzł wargi, żeby powstrzymać uśmiech i wziął łyk wina. - W zasadzie to tak – odparł – Powinieneś przyjść. - Ktoś musi pracować, gdy wy się bawicie – poinformował go Eames – Przekaż im to. - Eames mówi, że jest okropnym leniem i zasłużył sobie na tę karę – powiedział zgromadzonym przy stole. Wszyscy wybuchnęli śmiechem, kiedy Eames zaczął przez telefon głośno okazywać swoje oburzenie, a Arthur wziął kolejny łyk wina i rozsiadł się na krześle, szczerząc. - Szczerze, Arthurze, prawie pomyślałem, że mnie nie lubisz – mruknął. - Wcale nie. Ty myślisz, że wszyscy cię lubią – zrewanżował się Arthur. - Bo tak jest – odparł – Czy złożyłeś życzenia Ariadne ode mnie? - Oczywiście, że tak – odparł, gdy nagle coś mu się przypomniało – Hej, chcesz, żebym wziął coś dla ciebie na wynos? Mogę zamówić w tej chwili, jeśli nie masz zamiaru tam jeść. - Nie – westchnął Eames, brzmiąc przy tym na bardzo zmęczonego – Muszę jakoś przecierpieć bankietowego kurczaka, nie mam do ciebie zaufania, jeśli chodzi o jedzenie na wynos. Jest tyle sposobów, abyś zrobił krzywdę sobie i innym, będąc w pobliżu przygotowywania go. - Nie myślałeś tak w zeszłym tygodniu, kiedy kazałeś mi pójść po chińszczyznę – Arthur wytknął mu, umieszczając telefon między uchem a ramieniem i próbując swojej potrawy. Nadal nie była tak dobra jak wersja Eamesa i odchylił się na krześle, kołysząc na dwóch nogach, całkowicie tracąc zainteresowanie jedzeniem – Jedzenie tutaj i tak nie jest fantastyczne. - Rozpuściłem cię – zbeształ go Eames. - No, cóż – odparł, ponieważ to była prawda – Na pewno nie chcesz, żebym coś kupił, kiedy jestem na mieście? Mógłbym pójść gdzieś indziej. - Nie wygłupiaj się. Zresztą i tak będę w domu przed tobą – obiecał – Jednak, jeśli nie byłby to problem, to nie mamy mleka i kończą mi się papierosy. - Mleko i papierosy – powtórzył, robiąc w głowie notatkę – Niedaleko jest elegancki sklep z papierosami. - A Ty nie jesteś niczym innym jak uosobieniem elegancji, skarbie – odparł Eames. Arthur niemal słyszał jego mrugnięcie – Muszę już iść, zauważą moją nieobecność, jeśli zniknę na zbyt długo. - A tak właściwie to po co dzwoniłeś? – zapytał Arthur rozbawiony. Eames prychnął. - Być może chciałem usłyszeć twój głos – odparł, i chociaż był sarkastyczny, to w jego głosie pobrzmiewało coś szorstkiego i szczerego, coś co zmusiło Arthura do pochylenia się do przodu na krześle znowu na cztery nogi – Nie próbuj prowadzić samochodu pijany, skarbie, nie jesteś w tym nawet w połowie tak dobry jak ja. - Pojadę metrem – zaoferował, zamiast obietnicy nieupicia się, co byłoby zresztą wierutnym kłamstwem – Nie daj się przyłapać. - Nigdy nie daję się złapać – roześmiał się Eames i rozłączył. Arthur lekko się uśmiechnął do ekranu telefonu, po czym go schował, a gdy uniósł wzrok wszyscy się na niego gapili. Prawie zapomniał, że tutaj byli i w zamian spiorunował każdego z nich wzrokiem, mrużąc przy tym oczy. - Co? – warknął. Nikt nic nie powiedział, ale Ariadne posłała mu rozczulone, dziwne spojrzenie, Yusuf wyjął telefon, by napisać do swojej dziewczyny, a Cobb okręcał obrączkę na palcu, uśmiechając się przy tym smutno. Nagle Arthurowi zaschło w ustach. Nie wrócili już do tego, pijąc tyle wina, że Arthur zdecydowanie nie byłby w stanie usiąść za kółkiem tego wieczoru, a wszyscy zostali dłużej, niż początkowo planowali. Arthur czuł jakby coś dziwnego działo się z jego klatką piersiową, jednak nie był pewny dlaczego. Kiedy wreszcie wyszli, Arthur przytulił Ariadne na pożegnanie, wciskając jej w dłoń prezent od nich. - Eames powiedział, że masz tego używać tylko i wyłącznie do czynienia zła. A ja prawdopodobnie powinienem powiedzieć coś przeciwnego, ale to tylko zestaw do rysowania, więc wątpię, jak mógłby być użyty do czegokolwiek innego poza oryginalnym przeznaczeniem. Ariadne otworzyła torebkę. - Prawdopodobnie mówił o wibratorze, który tu wsadził – odparła, lekko się rumieniąc. Arthur mógłby unieść brew i udawać zszokowanego, ale wydawało się to głupie. Zamiast tego westchnął. - Wiedziałem, że powinienem sprawdzić zawartość torebki jeszcze raz, zanim zabrałem ją rano. Ariadne uważnie znowu posłała mu rozczulone, dziwne spojrzenie, po czym cmoknęła go w policzek. - A zatem Eames miał rację, że chcesz wibrator – odparł oschle. Rumieniec Ariadne znacznie się powiększył i spiorunowała go wzrokiem. Arthur był niemal pewny, że to od niego się tego nauczyła. - Wybacz, że cieszę się, że jesteś szczęśliwy – odparła i przewróciła oczami, jakby była nim niesamowicie znudzona i tym razem Arthur wiedział, że musiała się tego nauczyć od niego. Dziwne uczucie w jego klatce piersiowej się nasiliło. Strasznie padało, gdy Arthur wsiadł do metra i nadal wściekle lało, kiedy z niego wysiadł, dlatego postawił kołnierz płaszcza, by chociaż odrobinę ochronić się przed deszczem, próbując jak najszybciej dojść do domu z papierosami Eamesa w kieszeni i mlekiem w lewej dłoni. Kiedy dotarł do domu, był przemoczony do suchej nitki i odkrył, że Eames rzeczywiście był pierwszy, co potwierdzały porozrzucane po całej kuchni części smokingu. Arthur znalazł go w salonie stojącego nad stolikiem do kawy, który się tutaj pojawił kilka miesięcy temu, kontemplującego rozłożone na części M-24. Podniósł głowę, gdy Arthur wszedł. - Chryste, skarbie, wyglądasz jak przemoczony szczur. Arthur gapił się na niego. Eames, miał na sobie żółty podkoszulek z napisem „Złap rytm\" – poważnie gdzie on nawet znajdował takie rzecz – dwie różne skarpetki i parę bokserek, które na 95% nie były jego i mieszkał tu, naprawdę tu mieszkał, nawet jeśli mieli o tym nigdy nie rozmawiać. Przepełniające go uczucie osiągnęło punkt kulminacyjny i wybuchło. Arthur zrobił trzy kroki do przodu, kopnął stolik do kawy i chwycił Eamesa za kark. Przycisnął swoje usta do jego, a Eames wydał z siebie bardzo kuszące zduszone mruknięcie i Ariadne miała rację, był szczęśliwy jak jeszcze nigdy w życiu. Arthur nigdy nie był dobry w okazywaniu uczuć, ale to mógł zrobić, dlatego potarł swój język o język Eamesa i pchnął go na ścianę, przenosząc pocałunki niżej, by zatrzymać się w zagłębieniu jego gardła. Spodziewał się, że Eames coś powie, coś w stylu: „Cóż, ciebie również miło widzieć, skarbie\" lub „O rany, widzę, że robimy się podekscytowani, kiedy jesteśmy pijani, co?\" albo nawet „Poważnie, skarbie, gdybym wiedział, że masz ochotę, moglibyśmy obaj odwołać kolację\", jednak ciągle zapominał jak niesamowite są umiejętności Eamsa w czytaniu ludzi. Zamiast rzucać żartobliwą uwagę Eames przyciągnął twarz Arthura blisko tak by ich oczy się spotkały i uśmiechnął się jednym z tych krzywych, szczerych uśmiechów, które zawsze tak bardzo rozpraszały Arthura i powiedział: - Skarbie. Eames rozebrał Arthura powoli z jego mokrych ubrań, a potem kochali się na podłodze w salonie. Eames był nad nim przejęty i cichy, miał poważny, skupiony i surowy wyraz twarzy i Arthur miał świadomość, że jego oczy wyrażały wszystkie skłębione głęboko emocje, których dotąd nie chciał ujawniać, ale mimo to nie zamknął oczu tylko patrzył wprost, kiedy Eames wchodził coraz głębiej, doprowadzając Arthura każdym małym pchnięciem do ekstazy. Eames syknął coś, gdy doszedł, ale Arthur tego nie dostrzegł. Dostrzegł za to jak Eames gładzi jego biodro w zamyśleniu i ukrył uśmiech w zagłębieniu ramienia. Rano obudzili się cali obolali od spania na dywanie. Eames pocałował go w szczękę i poszedł robić naleśniki. - Coś tutaj skisło – stwierdził Eames pewnej nocy z głową schowaną w lodówce – Jakieś przypuszczenia? - Też mi się wydawało, że coś śmierdzi – odparł Arthur otwierając swoje piwo i zastanawiając się – Prawdopodobnie śmietana. Nastąpiła chwila ciszy. Potem Eames wyciągnął głowę z lodówki, krzywiąc się strasznie i trzymając mały pojemnik jak najdalej od siebie. - Jasna cholera, to obrzydliwe. - Mówiłem ci, żebyś tego nie kupował – odezwał się Arthur i roześmiał, gdy Eames wyrzucił odrażającą rzecz do śmieci – Ale mówiłeś „Nie, nie mogę zrobić właściwego sosu bez tłustej śmietany, skarbie\" - Wcale tak nie brzmię – oburzył się Eames, zamykając drzwi lodowki – Kompletnie nie umiesz wymawiać samogłosek. To jest „skarbie\", a nie ta zniekształcona podróbka brytyjskiego akcentu, która wyszła z twoich ust. Skarbie - Skarbie – powtórzył Arthur, marszcząc brwi. Eames uśmiechnął się szeroko i potrząsnął głową. - Jesteś beznadziejny, kochanie – odparł, po czym wrócił do poszukiwania składników. I nagle wszystko było takie, jak Arthur lubił najbardziej, z tyłkiem Eamesa wystającym prowokująco z lodówki, delikatną atmosferą kpiny, a wkrótce mieli zjeść coś pysznego, zapłacić rachunki i mieć absolutnie fantastyczny seks. - Eames – odezwał się Arthur. - We własnej osobie. - Chyba nie myślisz, że zostawiłbym cię, jeśli nauczyłbyś mnie gotować ? Eames uderzył głową w sufit lodówki, przeklinając i posłał Arthurowi bardzo przenikliwe spojrzenie. - Oczywiście, że nie –odezwał się w końcu – Nie mieszkałbym tutaj, gdybym tego nie wiedział. Chociaż dobrze wiedzieć, że ty tak nie myślisz. Arthur uniósł brew i przygryzł wnętrze policzka, by się powstrzymać się od szerokiego uśmiechu. - A zatem tu mieszkasz – odezwał się tak niezobowiązująco, jak tylko potrafił. Eames zamrugał i wziął kwaśną śmietanę. - Wiedziałem, że w końcu zauważysz, kochanie – odparł i zamknął lodówkę. Arthur przestał udawać, ponieważ to był Eames, który potrafił dostrzec jego uśmiech, nawet wtedy gdy Arthur nie pozwalał mu wypłynąć na usta. Wyszczerzył się więc bezwstydnie, rozciągając usta do granic możliwości i po raz pierwszy od dawna był absolutnie szczery w swojej radości. Eames oparł się o blat, odwzajemnił uśmiech i stali tak przez długi moment przy akompaniamencie głośnych świerszczy z ich ogródka. - A zatem – odezwał się w końcu Arthur – co dzisiaj jemy? Nastąpiło lekko zauważalne milczenie. Potem Eames powiedział: - Strogonowa – po czym uśmiech Eamesa przemienił się w grymas pełen pogardy dla samego siebie – Miałem zamiar zrobić stek Salisbury, ale śmietana raczej zrujnowała ten plan. - „Ponieważ nie mogę zrobić właściwego sos bez tłustej śmietany, skarbie – Arthur znowu go przedrzeźniał, tym razem szczerze nawet nie próbując mówić z poprawnym akcentem. Eames warknął groźnie i popchnął go na lodówkę,a Arthur roześmiał mu się w usta, ponieważ to była ich kuchnia, ich kolacja i ich życie. - Ty – mruknął Eames, pochylając się w końcu do przodu – Jesteś naprawdę kawałem drania, skarbie. Jednak uśmiechał się, gdy to mówił, a jego dłonie błądziły przez chwilę, zanim się odsunął i pozwolił Arthurowi pokroić cebulę.[Chapter 3] Cześć! :) Wracam po przerwie z tłumaczeniem kolejnej części \"mój dom jest tam, gdzie ty\". Miło jest wrócić do tłumaczenia historii z Arthurem i Eamesem, uwielbiam panujące między nimi relacje.

Cóż, miał ku temu powód – absurdalnie wyprasowane marynarki. Dziwaczna efektywność. Żel na włosach. „Musi wstawać równo z cholernym świtem\"myślał Eames we wczesnych dniach ich znajomości, kiedy nic o nim nie wiedział i wszystko, co mógł dostać od Arthura to skradziony pocałunek. Mógłby rządzić światem przed śniadaniem. Rzeczywistość była zdecydowanie mniej czarująca. - Niech go szlag – wymruczał Arthur w ramię Eamesa. Eames wyszczerzył się do sufitu i przesunął dłonią delikatnie i żartobliwie wzdłuż pleców Arthura. - Kogo? - Budzik – odparł, chowając twarz w jego ramieniu. Jego miękkie i rozczochrane włosy były wszędzie, łaskocząc podbródek Eamesa. Miał czerwony ślad w miejscu, gdzie wcześniej usnął na jego dłoni. Gdyby Eames nie miał pewności, że Arthur by go za to nie zabił, powiedziałby, że to urocze. - Niech go trafi szlag. Niech umrze. Musi zginąć. - Przestaniesz być w takim zabójczym nastroju, kiedy napijesz się kawy, skarbie – wymruczał. Arthur pokazał mu środkowy palec i uderzył lekko w pierś. - Jeszcze pięć minut. - Oczywiście, nie mam zamiaru wyciągać cię z łóżka – odparł Eames, wplatając nutę dwuznaczności w swój ton głosu – Chociaż zdaje mi się, że wczoraj mówiłeś, że jeśli nie obudzisz się przed 7.45, to… - Wiem - wyjęczał Arthur – Wiem, do cholery, Eames, pozwól mi udawać przez sekundę. Kurwa. - Mmm – wymruczał Eames. Uniósł się lekko, by Arthur mógł się na nim wygodniej oprzeć, wystukując powolny, uspokajający rytm na jego karku, wyłączył budzik, kiedy ten znowu zasnął. Po czym wyplątał się z pościeli i zrobił dzbanek kawy, wypalając w międzyczasie papierosa na ganku. Arthur obudził się cholernie wkurzony o 8.15, poświęcając minutę, by wykrzykiwać mordercze groźby przez drzwi łazienki , zanim wskoczył pod prysznic. Było jednak warto to zrobić dla jego źle skrywanego uśmiechu, kiedy Eames wręczył mu hermetyczny kubek kawy, dla chwili, w której się zatrzymał w swoim gorączkowym pośpiechu, by przycisnąć Eamesa do drzwi samochodu i pocałować go na pożegnanie. Czasami zajmowali się jeszcze ekstrakcjami. Incepcja była grą zespołową, czymś, czego nie mogłeś zrobić sam, ale była cholernie ciężka i nie było powodu, aby od czasu do czasu nie podjąć się jakiegoś projektu na boku. Arthur i Eames mieli niepisaną umowę, że żaden z nich nie podejmował się roboty trwającej dłużej niż sześć tygodni, chyba że obaj byli do niej zaproszeni. („Ponieważ nie potrzebujemy kolejnego pożaru domu\" wytłumaczył Eames, kiedy Yusuf bezmyślnie go o to zapytał. Wyglądał na zaskoczonego odpowiedzią, ale Arthur się lekko zarumienił i prychnął z przeciwnej strony magazynu, co Eames uznał za zwycięstwo.) Eames dostał telefon z robotą w Istambule we wtorek. W środę, Arthur zarezerwował lot do Buenos Aires. W piątek dzielili taksówkę w drodze na lotnisko i nawet jeśli Eames czuł bolesny ucisk w klatce na widok na widok Arthura, spokojnie odchodzącego w stronę swojej bramki, nie miał zamiaru o tym mówić. Wykonywał swoją pracę, obserwując ofiarę, stawiając teorie, próbując różnych twarzy i generalnie będąc zirytowanym jak cholera na wszystko. Arthur czasami pisał, drwiąc z pisowni zdecydowanie częstszych wiadomości wysyłanych przez Eamesa, oferując radośnie jadowite komentarze na temat jego współpracowników i tak to jakoś zazwyczaj leciało. Ósmego dnia, Eames siedział na porannym zebraniu, kiedy jego telefon zadzwonił. Od: Arthur, wysłane 9:21 Twoje chęci wykupienia mnie z więzienia w Południowej Ameryce w skali od jednego do dziesięciu, gdzie jeden to „całkowity brak chęci\", a dziesięć to „będę tam jutro\" Do: Arthur, wysłane 9.22 1 ale tylko dlatego, że nigdy nie zniżyłbym się do wykupienia cię, gdybym mógł cię stamtąd wykraść i byłbym tam przed jutrem. zostaliśmy aresztowani, zgadza się? Od: Arthur, wysłane 9.22 Jeszcze nie. Ale będę, biorąc pod uwagę morderstwo, którego popełnienie rozważam. kurwa, nienawidzę tej roboty. W tym momencie Eames zdał sobie sprawę z paru rzeczy. Pierwszą było to, że Arthur zapomniał pisać dużą wielką literą, co w przypadku jego zazwyczaj nienagannej gramatyki prawdopodobnie znaczyło, że był pijany. Drugą było to, że Arthur powiedział coś kompletnie nieprofesjonalnego i oskarżycielskiego przez wiadomość tekstową, co zdecydowanie znaczyło, że był pijany. Trzecią było to, że była 9.22 rano w Istambule, a to oznaczało 3.22 nad ranem w Buenos Aires. - Przepraszam – powiedział Eames, starając się głupio nie uśmiechać – Ważne sprawy biznesowe, kontynuujcie – I wyszedł na zewnątrz. Arthur odebrał po dwóch sygnałach. - Tak naprawdę nie mam zamiaru nikogo zabić, Eames – wymamrotał Arthur, potwierdzając „pijacką\" teorię. - Mówisz, jakbym w ogóle cię nie znał – odparł uroczyście Eames, za co został nagrodzony słabym, zmęczonym śmiechem. Nie powiedział tych rzeczy, których Arthur się po nim spodziewał – „Tęsknisz za mną, skarbie?\" – ponieważ pomimo wszystkich swoich wad, nie był okrutnym człowiekiem i znał prawdę. Jeśli niespodziewanie sentymentalny Arthur wypełnił go dziwnym, ciepłym uczuciem – cóż, trudno. - Nienawidzę tej roboty – wybełkotał Arthur, zniekształcając lekko słowa. Eames mógł usłyszeć przytłumiony dźwięk telewizora i szelest pościeli – Ludzie są tak cholernie głupi i nie powinienem tutaj być, bo, bo, bo mam pracę, i pieprzyć tę głupią Argentynę i to łóżko. „To nie jest jego najlepsza tyrada\" – pomyślał z rozbawieniem Eames. - Zawsze mógłbyś wrócić do domu, skarbie. Nie sądzę, aby ścigali cię za opuszczenie dnia wypłaty. - Nie – Arthur westchnął – W domu byłoby jeszcze gorzej. To tak naprawdę nie chodzi o łóżko. Eames wiedział, co to znaczyło, nawet jeśli nie potrafił uwierzyć, że Arthur to powiedział, nawet jeśli nigdy nie sadził, że Arthur upije się wystarczająco, by rzeczywiście przyznać się do tęsknoty za jego obecnością. Uśmiechnął się do ziemi tak szeroko, że zaczęła go boleć twarz, po czym odchrząknął. - Cóż, zatem – powiedział – jedynym rozwiązaniem było oczywiście urżnąć się małymi buteleczkami Jacka, hmm? - W barze hotelowym – odparł – to mniej żałosne. - Jesteś człowiekiem o wyszukanym guście i klasie – roześmiał się Eames – Zatem, kogo planujemy zabić? - Wszystkich. - Konkrety, skarbie. - Och, pieprz się – westchnął Arthur z uśmiechem w głosie – To cios poniżej pasa. - Wszystkie chwyty dozwolone – odparł Eames i nie dokończył, by oszczędzić Arthurowi ataku serca. Tak czy siak, nastąpiła cisza, w której słyszał tylko słaby oddech Arthura i szmer nadawanych wiadomości. - Nie masz pracy? – zapytał w końcu Arthur. Eames powstrzymał westchnienie. Jeden krok wprzód, dwa kroki w tył. - Tak – odparł – Ale w zasadzie potrzebuję twojej opinii na temat… Mówił przez dziesięć minut niskim, uspokajającym głosem. Jeśli Arthur wiedział, co robił, a najprawdopodobniej tak było, nie dał tego po sobie poznać i już wkrótce słyszał jego wyrównany oddech. - Śpij dobrze, skarbie – powiedział cicho i wszedł do środka. Nie dostał żadnych wieści od Arthura przez dwa następne dni, czego powodem był wstyd po wytrzeźwieniu jak przypuszczał Eames, ale zaczęli ze sobą więcej rozmawiać, dzwoniąc do siebie, kiedy mogli wysłać wiadomość, pisząc, kiedy mogli stłumić całkowicie tę myśl. Do czasu aż Eames uwinął się w Istambule upłynęło trzy i pół tygodnia i nigdy nie chciał niczego tak bardzo, jak przejść przez próg domu, zdjąć buty i wypieprzyć Arthura. Udało mu się wykonać dwa pierwsze kroki, kiedy znalazł Arthura śpiącego na kanapie z walizką opartą o ścianę i niedojedzonym kawałkiem pizzy w lewej ręce. Nadal był w garniturze, nie kłopocząc się zdjęciem czegokolwiek poza marynarką i miał sińce pod oczami. Eames wiedział po sposobie, w jakim mówił, że robota okazała się trudniejsza niż oczekiwał, ale nie zdawał sobie sprawy, że aż tak bardzo go wykończyli. Eames gapił się. Bardziej niż niepokojące było to przezabawne, absurdalne, jak przyłapanie lamparta desperacko próbującego przemalować się w tygrysie paski. Przez chwilę kusiło go, aby zrobić mu zdjęcie i wysłać Yusufowi, był to jednak naprawdę bardzo krótki moment. Najwyraźniej zaczynał emocjonalnie dorastać. Zamiast tego, odłożył swoją walizkę i pochylił się, by uratować resztę pizzy z dłoni Arthura. Arthur lekko drgnął na ten gest, jego powieki delikatnie zadrżały i Eames naprawdę nie mógł wytrzymać. Pocałował Arthura zdecydowanie, łącząc ich usta i kładąc dłoń na jego karku, by go podtrzymać. - Mmm – Arthur wymruczał w jego usta, wydając na wpół rozbudzony dźwięk zadowolenia. Eames usiadł okrakiem nad Arthurem, pogłębiając pocałunek i czując, jak Arthur się pod nim budził, ospale się poruszając. Teraz dłonie Arthura były na jego plecach, ciągnąc go za koszulę i przekręcając głowę pod innym kątem, wydawał dźwięki, które zamiast westchnień coraz bardziej przypominały zdesperowane jęki. - Cześć – wyszeptał bez tchu, kiedy Eames odsunął się, by przenieść pocałunki na jego gardło – Wcześnie wróciłeś. - W zasadzie to późno – wyszeptał Eames w jego szyję – Jest środek nocy, skarbie, zasnąłeś. - Ach – powiedział Arthur, przechylając jego głowę i zaciskając pięść w jego włosach, przyciągając go odrobinę w stronę swojego obojczyka. Eames walczył z guzikami Arthura i jego koszulą, by poprawić swoją trajektorię. Został nagrodzony sykiem przyjemności i uśmiechem – Tak, byłem zmęczony. - Cóż – Eames odsunął się na chwilę, by się z nim podroczyć – Jeśli jesteś zbyt zmęczony na… - Dupek – sapnął Arthur - Nie widziałem cię od cholernego miesiąca, nie waż się przestać, inaczej, o cholera, Eames… - Nngh – Eames wymruczał w jego obojczyk, kiedy zgrabne dłonie Arthura sięgnęły do jego rozporka. Och, dobry boże, zawsze udawało mu się zapomnieć, do czego były zdolne cholerne nogi Arthura, dopóki nie owinęły się wokół niego, póki Arthur się o niego nie ocierał, próbując złapać równowagę. Pozbawił Arthura jego koszuli samą siłą woli i popchnął go na kanapę. Gwałtowanie, a Eames nigdy nie jest był pewien, kiedy to się działo z Arthurem, kiedy sprawy z powolnych i spokojnych przechodziły w terazterazteraz tak niesamowicie szybko – Arthur ściągnął spodnie, a Eames oznaczył jego pierś lepkimi pocałunkami, ciągnąc go za włosy i się o niego ocierając. - Cholera, Eames – westchnął po paru minutach – Jeśli mnie zaraz nie wypieprzysz… - Cierpliwości, skarbie – wycharczał Eames, chociaż sam był twardy i miał problemy z panowaniem nad sobą. Arthur wyszczerzył się do niego z szeroko otwartymi oczami, włosami na twarzy i strużkami potu na skroniach. Eamesowi przeszło mu przez myśl, że Arthur był niemal idiotycznie atrakcyjny. - Jesteś cholernym idiotą – powiedział – Jeśli myślisz, że nie widzę jaki jesteś zdesperowany, jak bardzo chcesz wsadzić swojego kutasa w… - Czy jest coś w wodzie w Argentynie – wysapał Eames – Czy ty zawsze byłeś taki sprośny? Arthur przygryzł mocno jego ucho w odpowiedzi i Eames uznał, że to najwyższy czas ogłosić porażkę. Wymacał na ślepo to, czego szukał pod stolikiem („Och, Arthur był zawsze na wszystko przygotowany\" pomyślał Eames z rozczuleniem) i rozerwał zębami kondom zębami opakowanie kondomu, kiedy Arthur wyrwał mu z rąk nawilżacz. - Pieprzony miesiąc – warknął, kiedy Eames posłał mu pytające spojrzenie. I wtedy, o boże, Arthur nawilżył swoje własne palce i zaczął siebie rozciągać, ponieważ nie chciał czekać aż Eames to zrobi. Eames zamrugał i po prostu… Gapił się, zahipnotyzowany. - No… dalej… - wysapał Arthur, przywołując go do rzeczywistości. Tak też Eames zrobił, naciągnął prezerwatywę, pochylając się, by obscenicznie polizać penisa Arthur od dołu do góry. Arthur zarzucił głową do tyłu i wydał stłumiony krzyk, wyciągając z siebie palce i siadając na kutasie Eamesa, by dać upust przyjemności. - Podniecony, skarbie? – wysapał Eames. Arthur spojrzał na niego, jakby poważnie rozważał uderzenie go, ale zamiast tego go pocałował, gryząc go w usta. I Eames zaczął się w nim poruszać, czując, jak dłonie Arthura zaciskają się na jego plecach i słysząc desperacką litanię „taktaktakEameskurwatak\", którą Arthur recytował mu to ucha. Arthur doszedł pierwszy, znacząc pierś Eamesa długimi, klejącymi śladami i właśnie jego widok, wygiętego do tyłu, wydającego syk i sapiącego, doprowadził Eamesa do jego orgazmu. Oparł głowę o ramię Arthura i spuścił się, czując drżenie swojego kutasa od nacisku i kciuk Arthura kręcący małe kółeczka w jego włosach. - Jasna cholera – to wszystko, co był w stanie powiedzieć parę minut później. Arthur roześmiał się pod nim, nadal próbując złapać oddech. - Tak – zgodził się, po czym dodał – Wiesz, że będziemy musieli się umyć, nie mam zamiaru spać we własnej… - Tak, tak, wiem. Twoje pogawędki na dobranoc jak zwykle pozostawiają wiele do życzenia – roześmiał się Eames w jego szyję. Arthur roześmiał się. - To nie tak, że pozostawiłeś mi wiele sprawnie działających komórek w mózgu – odparł swoim oskarżycielskim tonem, którego używał, kiedy chciał powiedzieć komplement i nagle Eames znowu nie mógł nad sobą zapanować. - Chryste – powiedział – Ale za tobą tęskniłem. Arthur znieruchomiał pod nim i Eames zaczął rozpatrywać wszelkie możliwości wycofania się z tego, kiedy ten znowu się rozluźnił, zaciskając mocniej dłonie na we włosach Eamesa. - Mmm – wydał cichy pomruk, graniczący niemal z czułością – Tak, to… Tak – Odepchnął Eamesa i zmarszczył nos, kiedy zdał sobie sprawę jak bardzo obaj są brudni – O boże, zdecydowanie musimy się umyć. Eames gapił się za nim, kiedy ten wstał, po czym sam się wygramolił i dołączył do niego, gdy otrzymał niecierpliwe, przyzywające spojrzenie. Zatrzymał się tylko na chwilę, by sprawdzić swój totem i był naprawdę zaskoczony, kiedy odkrył, że to rzeczywistość. Czasem zdarzały się trudności, ponieważ każda para je napotykała. Eames miał zwyczaj zostawiać mokre ręczniki na podłodze, co doprowadzało Arthura do szału, a Arthur za żadne skarby świata nie potrafił kupić wystarczająco dużo jedzenia w sklepie. Miewali głupie kłótnie o to, co będą oglądali w telewizji, lub kto powinien pójść po gazetę, drobnostki, które z czasem się kumulowały, kiedy próbowali ominąć to, co naprawdę istotne. Bywały poranki, kiedy Eames budził się rozdrażniony, a zrzędzenie na wpół śpiącego Arthura było bardziej irytujące niż urocze. Noce stawały się ich polem bitwy, by wyrzucać sobie nawzajem głupoty związane z pracą, a których nie powinni przynosić do domu. To było normalne, w zasadzie nie kłócili się nawet tak często, jak Eames się tego spodziewał, ale nadal się to zdarzało, było to nieuniknioną częścią ich związku. Były jednak również rzeczy, którym inne pary nie musiały stawiać czoła. Armia odcisnęła na nich piętno w nieoczywistych miejscach, co nie zmieniało faktu, że tam były, widoczne tylko w odpowiednim świetle. Arthur zawsze kręcił nosem na sposób ścielenia łóżka Eamesa, a on nie potrafił pić kawy rozpuszczalnej i raz na parę miesięcy mieli nieprzewidziane nawroty bezsenności. Nie znali się, kiedy wstępowali na ścieżkę przestępczości, ale pewne znaki z tamtego okresu pozostawały w nich widoczne. Pewnej nocy, dźwięk odblokowanej broni obudził Eamesa, a jego oczom ukazał się Arthur trzymający swojego Glocka wycelowanego w stronę drzwi. Zamrugał, usiłując się rozbudzić i syknął. - Co, u licha? Arthur nie odrywał wzroku od drzwi. - Coś usłyszałem. Zamknij się. Eames tak właśnie zrobił i nasłuchiwał. Słyszał jednak tylko świerszcze, a alarm również się nie włączył, co jednak nie znaczyło, że nikt się nie włamał. Ponieważ ufał instynktowi Arthura i było ciemno, dopiero po minucie dostrzegł, że jego źrenice były podejrzanie rozszerzone. „O, cholera\" pomyślał Eames, czując niebywały przypływ zgrozy. - Arthurze, daj mi broń – powiedział swoim najostrzejszym, władczym tonem. - Dlaczego? - zaciśnięta szczęka Arthura tylko podkreślała jego przerażenie, mimo że nie chciał tego po sobie pokazać. Eames pamiętał, że w SAS nazywano to „nocnymi koszmarami\",czyli ubocznym efektem używania Somnacyny. Znał trzech facetów, którzy zginęli z ręki swojego współlokatora przez ten „efekt uboczny\" i jednego, który sam się zabił, przekonany, że wciąż znajduje się w konstrukcie. Nieszczególnie chciał dołączyć kogokolwiek do tej listy. - Mam lepszego cela – wysyczał i dzięki bogu, że został wytrenowany, by zachować spokój w sytuacjach paraliżujących ze strachu. - Arthur! Oddaj mi ten cholerny pistolet. Powoli, jakby poruszał się pod wodą, Arthur oddał mu broń. Eames zabezpieczył ją, rzucił na koniec łóżka i przytrzymał go za nadgarstki, by powstrzymać od ponownego chwycenia za nią. Jego puls przyśpieszył. Poczuł ukłucie furii i dzikości w piersi, ale zignorował to, próbując przybrać spokojny ton głosu - Skarbie – wyszeptał – Śnisz, słońce, obudź się. - Oni tutaj są – warknął Arthur – Oni zaraz... - Nikogo tutaj nie ma – wymruczał Eames, w duchu cały czas mówiąc sobie, że musiał zachować spokój – Poza nami nikogo tutaj nie ma, śni ci się to. Niby jak się tutaj dostałeś, hm? Pamiętasz? - Oczywiście, ja... - zaczął Arthur z wściekłością. Po czym zamrugał – Ja... Ja byłem... Eames wydał westchnienie ulgi, kiedy po trzecim mrugnięciu Arthur spojrzał na niego trzeźwo – Arthur? - Ta... - mruknął oszołomiony – Cholera, nie miałem nawrotów od lat. Czy w coś strzeliłem? - Nie – westchnął Eames – Nie strzeliłeś. Ale było blisko. Arthur westchnął sfrustrowany, a Eames puścił jego ręce. Przejechał dłonią po twarzy. - Przepraszam... - wymruczał, jakby naprawdę żałował. Przepraszający Arthur był czymś tak nierzeczywistym, że Eamesa na chwilę zatkało. - Och, skarbie, to nie jest twoja wina. - Powinienem cię uprzedzić – zaczął, a że Eames nie chciał się w to zagłębiać, uciszył go pocałunkiem. Arthur jęknął cicho, a Eames zacisnął zaborczo dłoń na jego biodrze. - Kawa? - zapytał, odsuwając się od niego, bo znał Arthura wystarczająco dobrze, by wiedzieć, że już nie zasną. - Tak – odparł, wysuwając się z łóżka – Brzmi nieźle. Usiedli na ganku oparci o drzwi i wypalili prawie całą paczkę papierosów Eamesa. W pewnym momencie, Arthur zaczął mówić szorstkim i zaspanym głosem o wojsku, o tym jak we wczesnych testach PASIV-u sprawdzano, ile bólu może znieść śniący nim się obudził, jak używano maszyn generujących sytuacje wymagające walki na śmierć i życie. Eames zrewanżował się opowieściami o SAS-ie, oszczędnie zbudowanych snach, w których spędzał uwięziony godziny, zanim jeszcze ktokolwiek wiedział o otchłani i o tym, jak łatwo było w nie wpaść. Opowiadał o powodach, dla których stamtąd uciekł, historiach, które słyszał w barakach, kiedy Arthur wyciągnął tłumik i zaczął z zaciśniętą szczęką strzelać na ślepo po ogrodzie. - Powinienem cię ostrzec – powtórzył, kiedy pierwsze promienie słońca zaczęły pojawiać się na horyzoncie. Eames westchnął, pokonał dzielący ich dystans i położył mu dłonie na ramionach. Arthur lekko drgnął pod jego dotykiem, ale go nie odepchnął. Milczeli przez pewien czas. - Wiesz, że to niczego nie zmienia – powiedział w końcu Eames – Czasem ja je również miewam... Kiedyś przeraziłem tym jedną dziewczynę w Kabule. - Moja zazdrość nie zna granic – odparł Arthur cierpko i pozwolił swojej głowie opaść na ramię Eamesa, przyglądając się wschodzącemu słońcu. Cobb opierał się pomysłowi Saito, by wysłać ich na akcję do Nowego Jorku, aż został skutecznie przekupiony łapówkami. Właśnie tym sposobem skończyli w letniej chatce w Hamptons upici bardziej niż to było wskazane, świętując powodzenie misji. - Nadal uważam, że powinniśmy mu się postawić. Lambhorgini. - wybełkotał Eames, opierając się o ścianę w salonie. Arthur roześmiał się do niego z kanapy. - Ty już masz śmiesznie drogi samochód – powiedział. - Mogłem mieć jeszcze jeden – wybełkotał – Mogłem mieć cokolwiek, facet był zdesperowany. - Jesteś za bardzo zmyślony, żeby być pijanym – odparła Ariadne, machając na niego palcem – Ups, nie to chciałam powiedzieć. - Czy ty nie jesteś w ogóle za młoda, by pić? - Yusuf zapytał już po raz piąty, ściskając swoją butelkę niczym talizman – Bo nie chcę wspierać nieletnich w... - Nadal uważam, że mam rację – powiedział szybko, bo Ariadne wyglądała, jakby miała śmiertelnie zdzielić Yusufa. Miał problem ze skupieniem się na czymś innym poza białą szyją Arthura wystającą zza jego poluzowanego krawata. Zdumiewało go, jak Arthur mógł rozluźnić się w małych częściach, tu i tam, jakby rozsiewał okruchy siebie. - Jesteś jak Jaś – powiedział mu – Wiesz, jak z tej bajki. Cobb prychnął źle skrywanym śmiechem, a Arthur przyglądał mu się, rozbawiony i z uniesionymi brwiami. - Myślę, że wypiłeś już wystarczająco – powiedział, pochylając się, by zabrać mu butelkę. Eames, który i tak przez większość czasu nie wiedział, co to obciach, chwycił go za nadgarstek i pociągnął, a fakt, że ten spadł z kanapy, udowadniał jak pijany Arthur musiał być. - Uff – jęknął w jego klatkę piersiową. Eames wyszczerzył się. - Masz je wszędzie – powiedział. - Ale co? - Okruszki z chleba – westchnął szczęśliwie Eames, opierając się o ścianę i przymykając oczy. Arthur uniósł się lekko z jego kolan, był jednak nadal wystarczająco blisko, by Eames słyszał jego śmiech. - Jesteś szalony – powiedział, podejmując kolejną nieudolną próbę przedrzeźniania jego akcentu. - Nigdy nie zostaniesz Brytyjczykiem, skarbie – odparł Eames, przyciągając go do siebie – Przestań próbować. - Zęby Arthura są zbyt równe, by mógł zostać Brytyjczykiem – wybełkotał Cobb. Oczy Eamesa otworzyły się szeroko w wyrazie dumy narodowej i dziwnej, nieuzasadnionej zazdrości. - Hej! - Zerwał się – Lepiej żebyś wiedział, że... - Zachowaj spokój i rób swoje, panie Eames – wymruczał Arthur i kiedy Eames na niego spojrzał, ten właśnie wykończył jego butelkę wina. Oczy Eamesa się rozszerzyły, przypominając sobie, pomimo tego, że znajdowali się w zupełnie innej sytuacji, kiedy ostatni raz Arthur to zrobił. Arthur dotknął jego szczęki, obdarzając go ciepłym spojrzeniem, na co Eames ukrył twarz w jego szyi. - Oooo – zapiszczała Ariadne, próbując złapać równowagę na stojąco – Jesteście tacy słodcy. - Raczej obrzydliwi – powiedział Yusuf z uśmiechem. Arthur dał kuksańca Eamesowi, śmiejąc się. - Eames, o mój Boże, Eames, złaź...! - Posłusznie odchylił się, by móc zobaczyć zarumienione policzki Arthura i niedorzeczną radość w jego oczach. - Czas spać – powiedział Cobb, słusznie odczytując spojrzenia, które między sobą wymieniali – Nie wiem, jak wy, ale chcę stąd pójść, nim sprawy pójdą za daleko. - Ale dajemy takie wspaniałe przedstawienie – zaprotestował Eames, znowu chowając twarz w szyi Arthura, za co został przez niego uderzony – Wszyscy są mile widziani. - Nie, nie są – powiedział Arthur stanowczo – Wszyscy powinni... odpocząć. A my, hm, streścimy wam rano, czy coś. - To była moja kwestia – powiedział ponuro Cobb. Mimo to wstał i przeciągnął się, po czym razem z Yusufem wynieśli Ariadne do jej sypialni. - Jesteście słodcy! - wykrzyczała, po czym dało się słyszeć jej chrapanie. Arthur przewrócił oczami i wstał, niezdarnie pomagając Eamesowi. - Chcesz wiedzieć, co myślę – spytał Eames, poruszając brwiami. - Nie jestem pewien, czy chcę wiedzieć – odparł Arthur przewracając oczami. - Myślę... - Eames pochylił się do przodu, wydając dźwięk pomiędzy szeptem i burknięciem – Że to ty powinieneś się streszczać . Teraz, o ile to w ogóle możliwe. - Eames – Arthur zganił go, mimo że drżał – Żadna ilość alkoholu nie usprawiedliwi tego okropnego kalamburu...! - Jestem okropny w wielu rzeczach – zgodził się – Chcesz się o tym przekonać? Uprawiali chaotyczny, żywiołowy seks w ich wypożyczonym łóżku tej nocy, a Arthur gryzł poduszki, ubranie i Eamesa, by powstrzymać krzyk. Słońce wstało zdecydowanie za wcześnie tego poranka, a Eames obudził się z okrutnym kacem i wtulonym okrutnego kaca i z wtulonym w niego Arthurem śliniącym się lekko na jego piersi. - Och, skarbie, ohyda – mruknął. - Spieprzaj – wymamrotał Arthur. Eames roześmiał się i wplątał z pościeli, ponieważ wszelkie próby zaśnięcia byłyby bezsensowne. Jak na kogoś tak przyzwyczajonego do przejmowania zwyczajów od innych, było niewiele miejsc, w których czułby się naprawdę wygodnie. Powędrował do kuchni i wziął cztery Advile, a potem z czystego kaprysu, włamał się do wynajętego samochodu Cobba i pojechał do miasta. Kiedy wrócił, Arthur ledwo co się obudził. Jego potargane włosy odstawały na wszystkie strony, miał na sobie dresy Eamesa i gapił się na kubek kawy jak na przesłuchiwanego, który mimo że opierał się torturom i tak w końcu się wygada. Posłał Eamesowi delikatny uśmiech i spojrzał na trzymaną przez niego torbę. - Hej, przyniosłeś bajgle? - zapytał. - I gazetę – Eames potwierdził, ciesząc się widokiem rozpromienionej twarzy Arthura – Oraz... Sięgnął do torby, wyciągnął mały bryłkowaty okrąg białego papieru i rzucił go Arthurowi, który otworzył go z pełnym szacunkiem. - To Nova Boy – powiedział, mrugając zaskoczony. - Tak - zgodził się, krojąc swój bajgiel i badając twaróg – Wiem, że nie dbasz o swoje żydowskie dziedzictwo, ale uznałem, że w tej sytuacji się do niego przyznasz. - To Nova Boy – powtórzył, wgapiając się w kanapkę – Mam kaca, jesteśmy w Nowym Jorku, a ty przyniosłeś mi Sunday Times i Nova Boy. - Właśnie tak – wyszczerzył się Eames bezwstydnie – Problem? Zabawną rzeczą w Arthurze było to, że pomimo swoich kolców, bardzo łatwo było go uszczęśliwić. Nic nie powiedział, tylko wstał i ucałował namiętnie Eamesa. Żaden z nich się jeszcze nie golił, Arthur jak zawsze miał okropny poranny oddech, a Eames pomyślał, że już nigdy nie zagra w karty, ponieważ zużył całe swoje cholerne szczęście. Nikt prawdopodobnie nie miał się obudzić przez najbliższe cztery godziny, dlatego zabrali talerze i przenieśli się do salonu. Arthur rozciągnął się na kanapie z nogami na kolanach Eamesa i bez słowa podał mu krzyżówkę i sekcję biznesową. Eames wyciągnął z kieszeni długopis i zaczął rozwiązywać pierwszą, opierając drugą na kolanach Arthura. - Do jasnej cholery – wymruczał Eames nim upłynęło jeszcze dziesięć minut. Hmm? - Nisko rosnący, jadalny, jasno ubarwiony kwiat często dodawany do sałatek – wyrecytował, piorunując krzyżówkę wzrokiem – Kto niby mógłby... - Ile liter? - spytał Arthur, odkrywając wzrok od wiadomości ze świata. Eames posłał mu pełne niedowierzania spojrzenie. - No bez jaj... - Eames. - Dziesięć – westchnął z niedowierzaniem. Arthur wydął usta na moment. - Nasturcja – zadecydował, wracając do czytania gazety. Eames spojrzał na krzyżówkę ogłupiały, gdy okazało się, że pasuje. - Jest w tobie coś niepokojąco robotycznego – odparł, zapisując – Tak tylko mówię. - Mmm – zgodził się Arthur. Wydawał się być wystarczająco rozproszony, dlatego Eames dyskretnie sięgnął po talerz leżący na jego udzie. - Jedenastoliterowe słowo na to, co ci zrobię, jeżeli tkniesz mojego bajgla – odparł Arthur, nawet nie podnosząc wzroku. - Wypatroszyć – roześmiał się Eames – Warto było jednak spróbować, racja? - Nie – odparł Arthur, próbując ukryć za gazetą wkradający mu się na twarz uśmiech. - Sam go dla ciebie przyniosłem – odezwał się Eames po chwili, przebiegając wzrokiem sekcję biznesową – Byłoby uczciwie, gdybyś się podzielił. - Nigdy nie stawaj między mężczyzną i jego bajglem – zaintonował. Eames się do niego wyszczerzył. - Szczerze, skarbie, będę cię męczył, dopóki się nie poddasz. - Samolub – poskarżył się Arthur, ale podał mu go z jękiem. Eames oparł się ręką na ramieniu Arthura, pochylił się i wziął gryza, zostawiając już tam dłoń. Przeżuwał radośnie, kiedy zobaczył Ariadne, w za dużym podkoszulku i spodniach od dresu, opierającą się o framugę drzwi. Nie miał pojęcia, jak długo tam stała, ale w jej spojrzeniu było coś takiego, co sprawiło, że Eamesowi zaschło w gardle. - Kawa? – zapytał niczego nieświadomy Arthur. Eames podał mu ją bez słowa ze stolika, rozważając możliwe reakcje na ten rozwój wydarzeń i wyszczerzył się w uśmiechu pełnym samozadowolenia. - Dzień dobry, Ariadne – powiedział, czując, jak Arthur zesztywniał obok niego. - Jestem zaskoczony twoim widokiem wśród żywych po wczorajszej nocy. Wykrzywiła usta w przyjacielskim grymasie. - Żadnego drażnienia przed poranną kawą – rozkazała, szurając nogami. Siedzący obok niego Arthur nadal był sztywny, jednak uniósł wzrok znad gazety i wtedy Eames zobaczył najpiękniejszy widok w swoim życiu. Kompletnie trzeźwy, zawsze opanowany Arthur dostrzegalnie pojął, że nie miał czego się wstydzić. Znowu się odprężył, znowu przewracając stronę w gazecie i posyłając Eamesowi ukradkowo delikatny uśmiech. - Czy my kiedykolwiek cię drażniliśmy przed poranną kawą? - zapytał – Przy okazji, ta koszulka stanowi poważną konkurencję dla Eamesa w konkursie na najgorszą w tym pokoju. Może jeszcze nadrobi. - Jesteś dupkiem – poinformowała Arthura, kiedy Eames roześmiał się i wykonał obraźliwy gest – Jesteś dupkiem i cię nienawidzę. - Czy ja wiem – powiedział Eames, posyłając Arthurowi oględne spojrzenie – Nie jest taki zły. - Dla ciebie – odparła Ariadne, ruszając w stronę kuchni – Ale nie wszyscy możemy być zakochani w Arthurze. Napięcie było tym razem tak nieznaczne, że sam Eames by go nie zauważył, gdyby go nie szukał. Ciało Arthura zesztywniało, zacisnął szczękę, a wzrok wbił stanowczo w gazetę. - Wielka szkoda – odparł Eames beztrosko, wracając do swojej krzyżówki. - Co takiego? - Pomyśl tylko, co mógłbyś zrobić, gdyby wszyscy byli w tobie zakochani – wymruczał Eames i jedynie latom treningu zawdzięczał fakt, że jego głos nie zadrżał. Potem przypomniał sobie o zamiłowaniu Arthura do konkretów, dlatego dodał – Zamiast tylko mnie? - Mógłbym zawładnąć światem przed śniadaniem – odparł oschle Arthur. Jednak Eames, który wiedział jak wyszukiwać detale, dostrzegł lekki rumieniec na jego policzkach, czuł delikatne muśniecie ust o swoją dłoń na jego ramieniu i wiedział, że nie istniała na świecie gazeta, za którą mógłby skryć swój uśmiech.[Chapter 4] Cześć! :) 22 sierpnia rok temu, opublikowałam tutaj moje pierwsze tłumaczenie z \"Incepcji\". Z okazji pierwszej rocznicy tego wydarzenia, postanowiłam przetłumaczyć kolejny teksty z \"Incepcji\". Niestety, wakacyjny wyjazd i praca skutecznie rozpraszały moją uwagę i sam tekst tłumaczyłam \"na raty\", dlatego publikuję go ponad miesiąc po owej rocznicy xd Niemniej jednak mam nadzieję, że się spodoba, gdyż pomimo opóźnienia, włożyłam w tłumaczenie całe serce. Chciałabym również podziękować Wam wszystkim komentarze, dodania i followy, które zagrzewały mnie przez ten cały czas do dalszego tłumaczenia. Jestem wdzięczna za słowa otuchy i wszelkie rady, które pomogły mi uwierzyć w moje zdolności tłumaczeniowe, gdyż rok temu stawiałam moje pierwsze kroki w tej dziedzinie, i były, i są dla mnie ważne. Sporo się przez ten czas nauczyłam, a wszystkie teksty, które tłumaczyłam nie raz zmusiły mnie do zadania sobie pytania \"jak to samo wyrazić po polsku?\", dały mi wiele radości i satysfakcji. Wiem, że muszę i chcę jeszcze się wiele nauczyć w dziedzinie tłumaczenia i mam nadzieję, że zostaniecie ze mną, by zobaczyć efekty mojej pracy :) Jak zawsze mam nadzieję, że czytanie mojego tłumaczenia sprawi Wam tyle radości, co mnie praca nad nim i do zobaczenia w przyszłych publikacjach! Miłej lektury! :) Tytuł: szczerze mówiąc, wolę cię, kiedy jesteś najgorszy Oryginalny tytuł: to tell you the truth i prefer the worst in you Autor: gyzym Fandom: Inception (2010) Zgoda na tłumaczenie: Jest Język: Polski Link: /works/135879 Tłumaczyła: Minnoroshi szczerze mówiąc, wolę cię, kiedy jesteś najgorszy Na samym początku dnia Eames usiadł na papierosach. To był już i tak paskudny dzień, ale poważnie, cała pieprzona paczka, którą po prostu wsadził do tylnej kieszeni na niej, kurwa, usiadł . Kiedy zdał sobie sprawę ze swojego błędu, wszystkie papierosy były, albo zniszczone, albo zgniecione na miazgę i pomimo próby ich naprawienia, nie nadawały się już do palenia. Westchnął i zadzwonił do Artura. -Jestem zajęty - Arthur ostrzegł, gdy tylko odebrał. Eames wyszczerzył się do sufitu, czując, że poprawił mu się odrobinę humor. - Ciebie również miło słyszeć, skarbie - odparł - Dzisiaj czuję się dużo lepiej, dziękuję, że pytasz. - Kłamca - odpowiedział Arthur - Miałeś trzydzieści dziewięć i pół*, kiedy wychodziłem, nie wymigasz się od tego. - Mogłem od tego czasu sprawdzić jeszcze raz - zaprotestował Eames. - Ale tego nie zrobiłeś. - Oczywiście, że nie. Chodzi mi o to, że mógłbym. - I tak nie miałoby to znaczenia. Twoje zdolności krasomówcze do szermierki słownej jest beznadziejna i wyglądasz, jak śmierć na talerzu. Nikogo nie oszukasz, panie Eames. - Przyznałeś, że mam zdolności krasomówcze - powiedział uradowany Eames, okazując swoje zadowolenie bez krępacji - Arturze! Jestem wzruszony. Nastąpiła przerwa, podczas której Eames był niemal pewien, że Artur rozważał korzyści z werbalnego wypatroszenia Eamesa a wspomnieniem jego mdlejącego wczoraj w magazynie poprzedniego wieczoru. - Nie schlebiaj sobie - w końcu odpowiedział, a Eames się wyszczerzył. - Nie śmiałbym - Odparł, nie mogąc powstrzymać ziewnięcia - W zasadzie nie dzwonię, by wrócić do pracy, chociaż jestem ciekawy jak udało ci się zmierzyć mi temperaturę, kiedy spałem, skarbie, schowałem termometr i jestem również gotów uznać to za przekroczenie pewnej granicy... - Eames! - Arthur wybuchnął - Do rzeczy! - Co z nimi? - on naprawdę sam się podkładał. - Przejdź do rzeczy. - Ach, racja - powiedział Eames współczująco. Biedactwo tak szybko się denerwowało - Miałbyś coś przeciwko pojawieniu się tutaj z paczką papierosów, skarbie? Obawiam się, że sam sprawiłem, że moje są niezdatne do użycia. Nastąpiła kolejna cisza. Ta jednak byłą dużo bardziej wymowna. - Pytasz, czy przejadę przez całe Los Angeles w godzinach szczytu, aby przywieźć ci paczkę papierosów, byś mógł palić, kiedy masz grypę? - zapytał gładko. - Przekonałbym Ariadne, aby mi je przyniosła - zaoferował. - Nie, wracaj do łóżka - powiedział Arthur i się rozłączył. To zostawiło Eamesa w rozterce. Z jednej strony był palaczem i było coś bezbożnego i jednocześnie pełnego szacunku w zapaleniu papierosa tuż po przebudzeniu. Nadawał rytmu całemu dniu, smakował lepiej niż inne, i naprawdę mógłby zmienić nawyk albo rzucić, poza tym jednym cholernym papierosem z rana. Potrzebował go. Nie miał zamiaru go sobie odmawiać. Z drugiej strony Arthur na pewno zdążył ukraść kluczyki od jego samochodu. Eames uśmiechnął się do siebie, włożył drugi sweter, wziął telefon i wyszedł do garażu. \"Nie ma nic lepszego niż zaczęcie dnia od włamania się do własnego samochodu\" - pomyślał. Udało mu się go otworzyć, ledwo zdążył chwycić za kierownicę, kiedy zadzwonił mu telefon. - Dzień dobry, Beatrice - przywitał się Eames, trzymając komórkę między uchem i ramieniem, by mógł rozmawiać w trakcie pracy - Uroczy mamy poranek, prawda? - Był uroczy, zanim dostałam powiadomienie z twojego konta, panie Eames - powiedziała cierpko - Mam obowiązek poinformować, że nasze systemy bezpieczeństwa... - Zauważyły włamanie do mojego Lotusa, tak, tak, już to słyszałem - westchnął Eames. System bezpieczeństwa był prezentem gwiazdkowym od Arthura, zakupionym i danym, by działał mu na nerwy. Trochę mu się jednak nie udało - Eames lubił Beatrice - To tylko ja, moja droga. I wątpię, żeby kiedykolwiek był to ktoś inny. - Mam silne przeczucie, że jesteś publicznym zagrożeniem - powiedziała. - Zaufaj temu przeczuciu - Powiedział Eames z uśmiechem. Wyciągnął śrubokręt ze schowka na rękawiczki i wcisnął go ostrożnie tak, aby nie uszkodzić panelu - Tak się składa, że mam przeczucie, że jesteś spokrewniona z Arturem. Jesteś, zgadza się? - Odpowiedź nadal brzmi nie - westchnęła - Zadzwonił do mnie dzisiaj rano. - Och, doprawdy? - zapytał, trzymając w zębach drut - Jakie to uroczo irytujące z jego strony. - Powiedział, abyś wrócił do łóżka - powiedziała. Eames prychnął, mimo niemiłosiernego bólu zatok. - Nie zrobił tego - powiedział, tłumiąc kaszel - Nie przekrzywiaj jego słów na moją korzyść, jest zbyt elokwentny, kiedy chce mnie wkurzyć. - Dobra - Beatrice westchnęła, a jej ton głosu sugerował, że Eames zawsze był najgorszą częścią jej dnia. Wyszczerzył się - Powiedział, że jesteś idiotą i jeśli myślisz o prowadzeniu tego pieprzonego samochodu, wróci do domu, by udusić cię twoimi własnymi wnętrznościami, dlatego powinieneś wrócić do łóżka. Zadowolony? Wyszczerzył się. - To takie słodkie, kiedy się martwi. - Czasami - odparła Beatrice - Muszę naprawdę zgłosić wasze kompetencje moim przełożonym. Nie powinieneś w ogóle uruchomić Lotusa, zwierając kable. To niemożliwe. - Chyba ktoś marzy tutaj z niewystarczającym rozmachem - powiedział Eames. Połączył dwa kable i został nagrodzony cichym mrukiem silnika - Ach, wspaniale. Zatem się żegnam i całkowicie zwalniam cię z obowiązku dzwonienia, kiedy dzisiaj znowu pojawię się na twoim radarze. - Bogu niech będą dzięki za małe błogosławieństwa - powiedziała cierpko Beatrice. - Naprawdę jesteś spokrewniona z Arthurem, no nie? - Nie, do widzenia, panie Eames - po czym rozległo się ciche odłożenie słuchawki. Eames otworzył drzwi do garażu i zrobił sobie na chwile przerwę na godny podziwu i równie nieprzyjemny atak kaszlu i odjechał. Stacja gazu była swojego rodzaju testem. W kolejce stało piętnaście osób, to po pierwsze, co było po prostu niesprawiedliwe - ten jeden jedyny raz, kiedy Eames postanowił kupić papierosy o normalnej porze dnia i od razu został za to ukarany. Ponadto kiedy dotarł do kasy, odkrył powód, dla którego kolejka również się bardzo wolno poruszała do przodu. - Dowód osobisty - powiedziała sprzedawczyni. Eames zamrugał zaskoczony. Uśmiechnął się swoim najbardziej czarującym uśmiechem, chociaż wnioskując po jej wyrazie twarzy w obecnej sytuacji nie był tak czarujący jak zazwyczaj. - Nie zostałem wylegitymowany od lat - powiedział, rezygnując z użycia którejś ze swoich sześciu fałszywych dowodów i dając jej prawdziwy - Schlebiasz mi. - Pan Eames, tak? - spytała, ignorując go i przyglądając się dowodowi. - We własnej osobie - powiedział radośnie - Skoro udowodniłem, że ukończyłem 18 lat, prosiłbym paczkę papierosów... - Nie mogę panu ich sprzedać - powiedziała, oddając mu dowód - Wybacz. Eames zamrugał. Czuł, że był na skraju cierpliwości, był zmęczony, bolały go kości, a jego gardło płonęło i nadal nie zapalił tego pieprzonego papierosa, ale wiedział, że byłoby to kontr produktywne. Wziął głęboki wdech, który tylko trochę był nierówny, wziął swój dowód i znowu sie uśmiechnął. - Czy mógłbym wiedzieć dlaczego? - zapytał opanowanym głosem. - Jakiś koleś zadzwonił 15 minut temu - wymamrotała - Powiedział, żebym nie dawał pany niczego, co mógłby pan palić. Był bardzo przekonujący. - Co takiego zrobił Artur? - zażądał, czując jak opuszczał go jego spokój. Było to na swój dziwaczny sposób urocze, cóż, przynajmniej jak na Artura, ale poważnie .Kolejka za nim zaczęła się gniewnie poruszać, dlatego westchnął i spróbował jeszcze raz - I co takiego powiedział, hmm? Zaoferował ci pieniądze czy ci groził? - Dlaczego chce pan wiedzieć? - zapytała, mrużąc oczy. Eames spiorunował ją wzrokiem, wiedząc, że gdyby by chciał, mógł odpuścić sobie granie twardziela, nawet jeśli efekt był przytłumiony przez fakt, że był zasmarkanym nieszczęściem. - Żebym mógł zrobić dokładnie coś odwrotnego - powiedział śpiewnym głosem. Sprzedawczyni spojrzała na niego przez długą chwilę. - Zagroził mi. Bardzo dużo gróźb. Żadnych pieniędzy. - Bystrzacha z ciebie - powiedział jej Eames, puszczając perskie oczko - Dam ci pięćdziesiąt dolarów za paczkę Marlboro. - Sto - skontrowała. - Siedemdziesiąt pięć - powiedział Eames, ponieważ nie zamierzał dać się całkowicie oskubać przez szesnastolatkę - I nie przyjdę tutaj jutro, by złożyć na ciebie skargę do menagera. - Zgoda - powiedział dziewczyna, a Eames opuścił sklep z najdroższą paczką papierosów, jaką kupił w życiu, w ręku. Wsiadł do samochodu i zadzwonił do Artura. - Nadal jestem zajęty - powiedział, ale brzmiał na bardzo zadowolonego. - Jesteś dupkiem - poinformował go Eames - Zadzwoniłeś na wszystkie stacje gazu w okolicy, czy wywnioskowałeś, do której pojadę twoimi... Super dupkowatymi mocami? - Moimi super dupkowatymi mocami - odparł sucho Arthur - Eames, wróć do domu. Tracisz kontakt z rzeczywistością. - Jednak udało mi się zdobyć papierosy, skarbie - powiedział. Trochę kręciło mu się w głowie, może wyjście z domu było błędem - To nie tak, że nie doceniam twojej troski o moje zdrowie, ale powinieneś rozważyć - musiał wziąć oddech, by kontynuować - moją bardzo pociągającą wytrwałość - I kichnął. Głośno. Dwa razy. - Eames - powiedział Arthur tym razem łagodniejszym głosem, jakby żałował, że się do tego posunął - Wróć do domu i połóż się spać. - Dobrze, jasne - westchnął i rozłączył się. Jechał do domu ostrożnie, wiedząc, że mdłości nie były najlepszym doradcą w prowadzeniu pojazdu zmotoryzowanego o dużej mocy i próbował nie myśleć, jak fantastycznie byłoby zasnąć za kierownicą. Tak bardzo chciał papierosa, że jego wzrok mimowolnie kierował się na leżącą na siedzeniu paczkę papierosów, ale nigdy nie palił w Lotusie i nie miał zamiaru tego robić teraz. (\"-Nadal nie mogę zrozumieć, jak możesz palić w naszym domu, ale nie w tym samochodzie\" - powiedział Arthur, wracając z biura któregoś wieczoru. Eames uśmiechnął się do niego. \"-Ten samochód został zniszczony od dymu\" - powiedział, rozkoszując się dyskretnie, jak uśmiech walczył z rumieńcem na policzkach Artura) Zaparkował samochód i wyskoczył z niego, rozdzierając małe pudełko, jakby zależało od tego jego życie. Wyciągnął papierosa i zaciągnął się długo i głęboko, czuł całkowity spokój ze światem, dopóki nie musiał wypuścił oddechu. Od tego momenty sprawy przybrały negatywny obrót. - Kurwa mać - sapnął, kaszląc paskudnie i depcząc podstępny i zdradziecki rakotwórczy patyczek. Cały jego układ oddechowy płonął - Do kurwy nędzy. Żeby jeszcze dodać zniewagę do urazu, jego telefon zabrzęczał, kiedy udało mu się złapać oddech. \"Mówiłem Ci, że palenie to zły pomysł. - A.\" - Czy ty założyłeś na mnie kamery? - zażądał Eames, kiedy Arthur odebrał trzy sekundy później - Jest to bardziej niż niepokojące. Nie wiedziałem, że mieszkanie z tobą oznacza bycie obserwowanym przez 24/7. - Zatem udało ci się dotrzeć do domu w jednym kawałku - powiedział Arthur, siląc się na kpiący i obojętny ton, a Eames poczuł, jak się uspokajał. - Martwiłeś się. - Wcale nie. - Właśnie, że tak - powiedział Eames, otwierając drzwi i wchodząc do środka - Zawsze wiem, kiedy się martwisz. - Zdaje ci się - powiedział - I nadal jestem zajęty. - Nie na tyle, by do mnie nie napisać - Eames zauważył - To naprawdę coś. - Do zobaczenie, Eames - powiedział Arthur i się rozłączył. Eames stał w kuchni przez chwilę. Westchnął i poszedł do sypialni, ponieważ naprawdę czuł śmierć na ramieniu, a mała drzemka nie mogła zaszkodzić. W roztargnieniu zastanawiał się, czy nastawić budzić, ale zrezygnował z tego - jedyną osobą, dla której by się obudził był Arthur, który prawdopodobnie byłby dużo bardziej zadowolony, gdyby zastał go śpiącego. Upadł na poduszki i zasnął... Prawda była taka, że Eames nie czuł się najlepiej od dłuższego czasu. To były drobne rzeczy - czas jego reakcji był wolniejszy niż zwykle, bóle głowy, których nie potrafił się pozbyć, papierosy, które wywoływały ucisk w jego klatce piersiowej. Ignorował to, zrzucając to na kanwę braku snu i nadmiaru kofeiny i nadal zajmował się swoimi sprawami. Ku jego własnemu zawstydzeniu to Arthur jako pierwszy zorientował się, że coś było z nim nie tak. Przygotowywali kolację, cóż, Eames ją przygotowywał, a Arthur ochoczo nie zbliżał się do niczego, co mógłby zniszczyć, kiedy w kuchni zaczęło nagle być lodowato. Zdziwiony, ponieważ chwilę temu było gorąco, zwrócił się Arthura. - Włączyłeś klimatyzację? - zapytał. Arthur uniósł brew. - Nie, przecież jest luty - powiedział. - Jesteśmy w Los Angeles - zauważył Eames. - Dobra - powiedział, wywracając oczami - Na zewnątrz jest 7 stopni**, nie sądziłem, że klimatyzacja jest potrzebna. Chciałeś, aby była włączona? - Nie - odpowiedział - Po prostu nie znałem innego wyjaśnienia. - Czego? - Wyjaśnienia, dlaczego jest tutaj tak cholernie zimno - Sapnął zirytowany, że Arthur udawał głupiego specjalnie, ale wtedy zadrżał i upuścił solniczkę. Nie byłoby w tym nic nadzwyczajnego, gdyby w trakcie próby podniesienia jej, nie uderzył ręką gorącej patelni, parząc samego siebie, i upuścił ją znowu. Tym razem się potłukła, rozsypując kawałki szkła i przyprawy w ilości, która nie była pożądana w sosie do makaronu. - Kurwa - burknął Eames, odskakując - Wszystko na nic. Arthur wydał niski, zaskoczony dźwięk, a Eames warknął, oczekując kpiny z jego strony, na którą nie miał ochoty - Ani słowa, Arthurze. Włożył ręce pod zimną wodę, dopóki ból nie zmalał, zastanawiając się, co zamówić na wynos, a kiedy się odwrócił, Arthur był tuż przy nim, dużo bliżej niż Eames się spodziewał. Zazwyczaj zawsze wiedział, gdzie znajdował się Arthur i był tak zaskoczony, że dopiero po chwili zdał sobie sprawy z chłodnej ręki Arthura przyłożonej do jego czoła. - Dlaczego nic nie powiedziałeś, dupku? - spytał. - O czym? Arthur zmarszczył brwi, przyciskając jeszcze mocniej. - Płoniesz. Eames roześmiał się. - Nie bądź śmieszny, skarbie - Wymruczał - Myślę, że bym wiedział, gdybym miał gorączkę. - Cóż, oczywiście - Arthur wycedził przez żeby, robiąc krok do tyłu i marszcząc brwi - Stąd moje pytanie. Miałeś zamiar żyć w nieświadomości? - Nie wiem, o co ci chodzi - Zaprotestował Eames - Arthur, poważnie, to pewnie wzięło się od stania blisko patelni. - Hmm - powiedział Arthur i obrócił się na pięcie. Wrócił za trzydzieści sekund z termometrem w lewej ręce. Eames uniósł do góry brwi. - Nawet nie wiedziałem, że mamy coś takiego. Czy masz gdzieś ukrytą szafkę z apteczką? - Napełnioną lekami, o których nie masz pojęcia - Zgodził się Arthur, walcząc z małym uśmiechem, który zdawał się pojawiać na jego zirytowanej twarzy. Podał Eamesowi termometr - Śmiało. - Co? Arthur wywrócił oczami. - Jeśli jesteś chory, muszę o tym wiedzieć. Mamy misję za 12 godzin i Yusuf mu się przygotować dla ciebie odpowiednią dawkę Somnacyny. - Twoja troska jest wzruszająca - wymruczał Eames znowu zirytowany. Arthur tylko spiorunował go wzrokiem, więc wsadził ten pieprzonym termometr do ust, odczekał odpowiednio długi moment i wyjął go. -Widzisz? - powiedział, wymachując nim - Jestem w doskonałym... Och. - Trzydzieści osiem i dziewięć***- powiedział oschle Arthur. Po czym dodał - Dupek. - Och - odparł Eames, gapiąc się na rzecz - Trzeba to gdzieś zapisać. Arthur westchnął. - Naprawdę nie wiedziałeś? - Przysięgam - powiedział, nadal patrząc na termometr - Chociaż to tłumaczy parę rzeczy. Co za pieprzone wyczucie czasu. - Nie żartuj. - Cóż, to nie tak, że mogłem coś na to poradzić - odgryzł się Eames nagle wściekły na wszystko - na Arthura, na misję, na termometr, na zrujnowaną kolację, na którą nie miał nawet ochoty - Zapewniam cię, że zrobiłbym wszystko, żebyś się nie martwił... Poczuł ból w gardle i zaczął kasłać bez zahamowań przez prawie minutę. - Na litość boską - warknął Arthur napiętym głosem, kiedy już się opanował - Po prostu... Usiądź na kanapie czy coś, Eames, przysięgam na Boga - powiedział, odchodząc z godnością na powrót sztywny i opanowany. \"Sztywniak\" - pomyślał Eames mściwie, robiąc, co kazał. Włączył telewizor i zaczął skakać po kanałach ze świadomością, że był zirytowany bez powodu i niezdolny do zapanowania nad tym. \"Sztywny, pretensjonalny, wybredny dupek, tak jakbym mógł nad tym kontrolę\" - pomyślał. Wtedy właśnie wrócił Arthur z kocem i buteleczką paracetamolu w lewej ręce i butelką wody w prawej. -Trzymaj - powiedział nadal bardzo spiętym głosem i właśnie wtedy do Eamesa dotarło, co prawda trochę późno, że zmarszczone brwi oznaczały troskę, a nie złość. - Dzięki - powiedział łagodniej niż wcześniej. Wziął cztery tabletki, a Arthur zamówił pizzę i usiadł obok niego. - Połóż się - rozkazał. - Twoje podejście do pacjenta pozostawia sporo do życzenia - powiedział Eames, mimowolnie oczarowany jak Arthur się o niego troszczył. Arthur spiorunował go wzrokiem, więc się położył z głową na jego kolanach - Coś jeszcze? - Koc- Wskazał na niego palcem. -Hmm? - Nakryj się - Arthur nalegał. Eames roześmiał się i przykrył, mimo że to wcale nie pomogło mu się rozgrzać. Arthur napinał się za każdym razem, kiedy drżał, mimo że usilnie próbował tego nie robić. - Wszystko ze mną w porządku, skarbie - powiedział, kiedy zdarzyło sie to czwarty albo piąty raz - To tylko gorączka. - Arthur wydał zduszony dźwięk i przeczesał włosy Eamesa palcami, co było niesamowicie przyjemne, więc przestał mówić. - Nie wierzę, że nie mogłeś poczekać z chorobą, dopóki nie ukończymy misji - powiedział Arthur po paru minutach do siebie - Czy to by cię zabiło, gdybyś poczekał jeden dzień? Robisz to po to, by mnie zdenerwować? - Ale denerwowanie cię to moja życiowa misja - westchnął Eames, powstrzymując ziewnięcie. Nic by się nie stało, gdyby zamknął oczy. Mógłby się zdrzemnąć do czasu przybycia pizzy - Nie wiedziałeś? - Tego w zasadzie się domyślałem. - Poważnie, skarbie... - Jeśli znowu powiesz, że wszystko z tobą w porządku, to cię uderzę w twarz - ostrzegł. - Naprawdę powinieneś zostać lekarzem - wymamrotał Eames. Został za to nagrodzony słabym śmiechem Arthura. - Myślę, że dużo lepiej nadaję się do zadawania obrażeń po kulach niż leczenia ich - Powiedział cicho, przeczesując włosy Eamesa - Kurwa, nawet twoja głowa jest gorąca. - Wybacz - zaoferował, czując jak odpływa w sen, mimo nieduolniej wlaki - Wypadek. - Tak, wiem - westchnął Arthur i to była ostatnia rzecz, jaką Eames miał usłyszeć przez długi czas. Kiedy się obudził, usłyszał dźwięk zamykanego segregatora Arthura. - Która godzina? - wymamrotał głosem zachrypniętym od snu. - Późna - odpowiedział Arthur. Wtedy dotarło do Eamesa, że nadal trzymał rękę w jego włosach - Myślałem, że będę musiał przeciągnąć cię przez podłogę, żebyś położył się do łóżka. - Łóżko - powtórzył wciąż zaspany Eames. Brzmiało wspaniale. Arthur westchnął. - No chodź - powiedział, pomagając Eamesowi wstać. Eames cudem dotarł do sypialni o własnych siłach i upadł na poduszki, otulając się szczelnie. Bardziej poczuł niż widział Arthura zasuwającego zasłony i poczuł, słodki ciężar przyciskający mu się do pleców. - Jesteś takim dupkiem - Arthur wymruczał w jego szyje - Że nawet mnie trudno w to uwierzyć. - Wiem, skarbie - westchnął Eames w poduszkę - Nie robię tego specjalnie. Arthur się roześmiał. - Właśnie, że robisz. - Nie tym razem - odpowiedział i chciał, aby o było jasne, ale był tak cholernie zmęczony. Arthur pogłaskał go po żebrach i oparł się o jego ramię. - Idź spać, panie Eames - powiedział i Eames tak zrobił. Ulga była jednak krótka. - Pogorszyło ci się - powiedział Arthur następnego dnia w drodze do pracy, zaciskając dłonie na kierownicy tak mocno, że aż pobielały mu kłykcie - Spałeś czternaście godzin i ci się pogorszyło. Jak to w ogóle możliwe? - Czasem to się po prostu zdarza, skarbie - westchnął Eames i oparł czoło o szybę. Robił dobrą minę do złej gry, by Arthur nie powyrywał sobie wszystkich włosów z głowy ze stresu, ale taka była prawda, pogorszyło mu się. Kiedy się obudził, miał z problemami z oddychaniem, a ból głowy mógłby nawet obalić królową Anglii. Schował nawet niespostrzeżenie termometr, kiedy Arthur tłukł się po kuchni, ale biorąc pod uwagę jego wahania temperatury, mógł się założyć, że jego gorączka również się podwyższyła. - Naprawdę nie mogłeś poczekać? - powiedział Arthur, kiedy Eames wziął ostry zakręt samochodem, kaszląc i krzywiąc się. - Wiem – odpowiedział – Okropne wyczucie czasu. Ale na misji będzie w porządku, nic nie poczuję, kiedy już zejdziemy. Uspokój się. - To nie o to chodzi – Arthur warknął, zaskakując go – Gdybym znał sposób, by zrobić to bez ciebie, zdecydowanie bym go użył, ale jeśli będziesz musiał się przebudzić, to nie koniec świata. Nie jest uzbrojony, zawsze możemy zrobić kolejne podejście, jeśli będzie taka potrzeba. To nie tak, że jego żona nas zastrzeli, jeśli nie wyrobimy się w terminie. - Ale mogłaby – powiedział Eames, traktując resztę wypowiedzi jak absolutne szaleństwo – Arthur nie mógł mu radzić, aby podszedł swobodnie do misji – Jeśli okaże się winny, nie będę ją za to winił. To naprawdę parszywy interes. - Jestem poważny – powiedział Arthur, kiedy wjechali na parking – Odpuść, jeśli musisz – powiedział, parkując, po czym pocałował Eamesa i położył mu dłoń na policzku, oddychając szybko. - Chryste – jęknął Eames zaalarmowany, kiedy w końcu się odsunął – To cię naprawdę martwi, co? Arthurze, nie przejmuj się, to nic takiego. - Wcale się nie martwię – Arthur syknął – To było... Na szczęście. - Na szczęście – powiedział Eames, robiać najlepszą imitację oschłego głosu Arthura –Naprawdę. - Zamknij się, Eames – prychnął i ruszył w stronę magazynu. To powinna być prosta ekstrakcja, zadanie od dziedziczki, której matka zniknęła w poprzednim miesiącu. Podejrzewała męża, którego kochała, ale który, jak Arthur odkrył, miał poważne długi i całą historię agresywnych zachowań. Kobieta chciała nagranego wyznania, które mogłaby zanieść policji, aby oszczędzić sobie bólu pozwolenia im grzebania w jej życiu, by mogli założyć sprawę. Normalnie nie zajmowali się takimi rzeczami, ale Cobb zdawał się mieć słabość do klientki, Elizabeth, dlatego postanowili coś zaradzić w tej sprawie. Użycie „Serce oskarżycielem\"**** było pomysłem Eamesa. Niestety, była to również rzecz, którą on jeden był w stanie zrobić. - Jesteś tego pewien? - zapytał Arthur tak cicho, że tylko Eames mógł go usłyszeć, kiedy wkuwał igłę w jego ramię – Ponieważ jeśli czujesz, że nie jesteś w stanie utrzymać snu... - Skarbie, to grypa, nie pieprzona dżuma – odpowiedział Eames równie cicho – Schodziłem do snu w gorszym stanie, poradzę sobie – To było kłamstwo. Nigdy nie zszedł z niczym gorszym niż przeziębieniem, ale Arthur nie nusiał tego wiedzieć. - Nie wiemy, jak takie wysokie gorączki reagują na... - Arthurze – powiedział Eames, chwytając go za ramię i delikatnie głaszcząc je kciukiem. Arthur zmarszczył brwi, ale wstał i usiadł na własnym krześle. - Słodkich snów – powiedział Yusuf i włączył PASIV. Eames zamrugał i znalazł się w labiryncie zaprojektowanym przez Ariadne przed kawiarnią, gdzie była ostatnio widziana matka klientki. Cobb był już wewnątrz, siedząc dyskretnie przy stoliku w kącie, jednak Arthur wciąż stał obok niego z zatroskanym wyrazem twarzy. - Wszystko w porządku? - W jak najlepszym – powiedział szybko Eames. Prawdę mówiąc, czuł się bardziej niż zamroczony, ale nie widział powodu, aby o tym mówić. Arthur by tylko spanikował i odwołał całą misję, a Eames współczuł Elizabeth, której życie właśnie wyrwało jej się spod kontroli – Po prostu się przemienię i uwiniemy się raz dwa. Naprawdę nie masz się czym martwić. Skupił się na wyglądzie ich klientki, szybko się w nią przemieniając. To było... Niewłaściwe i ociężałe, nie miało nic z lekkiego dreszczu, który się zazwyczaj pojawiał, a wyraz twarzy Arthura mówił mu, że to zauważył. Eames uśmiechnął się najbardziej ujmująco, jak potrafił. - Skarbie – wymamrotał, niszczący akcent swojej klientki, jeśli nie jej sposobie wypowiadania się – Przestań tak na mnie patrzeć, bo zrujnujesz moją grę. - Uciekaj, jeśli musisz – powiedział Arthur i pośpieszył w kierunku restauracji. Po upłynięciu odpowiedniej ilości czasu Eames poszedł w jego ślady, zajmując miejsce naprzeciwko celu, Zachary\\'ego Slife\\'a. - Cześć, skarbie – powiedział, próbując nie skrzywić się, kiedy nasilił się ból głowy – Dzięki, że się ze mną spotykasz, wiem, że jesteś zawalony pracą, po prostu... W domu jest tak pusto bez mamy. - Wiem, słońce – powiedział Slife i przykrył jego dłoń swoją. Eames spojrzał mu prostu w oczy i już teraz wiedział, że dupek był winny. Przepełniał go irracjonalny, bezsilny gniew – jak mógł wyrządzić coś takiego osobie, którą kochał? Odwzajemnił uścisk Slife\\'a, skupiając się na gniewie, by utrzymać sen, nawet jeśli było to cholernie trudne. - Staram się wierzyć, że będzie lepiej – powiedział cicho, spuszczając wzrok – Ale... Ale nie mogę przestać myśleć o rzeczach, których jej nie powiedziałam i... - pozwolił, by załamał mu się głos i położył dłoń na ustach, by stłumić wymuszony szloch. Kątem oka zobaczył Arthura dającego sygnał i właśnie wtedy zaczęła się naprawdę trudna część planu. Wytłumaczył swojej drużynie, że to było coś w rodzaju brzuchomówstwa fałszerza, ale tak naprawdę było to tworzenie głosu, który słyszał tylko cel. „ Powinieneś jej powiedzieć \" - odezwał się głoś matki Elizabeth, przebijając się przez szum kawiarni. Eames był z siebie dumny, zajęło mu to kilka nocy oglądania starych filmów, aby dobrze oddać jej akcent, z czego Arthur zaśmiewał się w łazience, kiedy Eames próbował wbić sylaby w ziemię. „ Będzie niosła to brzemię do końca życia, Zachary, ma prawo wiedzieć \". Cel zamarł w miejscu, rozglądając się dookoła, jak ścigane zwierzę. - Coś mówiłaś, skarbie? Eames kontynuował swój pokaz rozpaczy, a sztuczne łzy gromadziły mu się w oczach. - Nie... „ Oczywiście, że nic nie powiedziała, Zachary, wiesz, jak brzmi mój głos. Wiedziałeś w nocy, kiedy mnie zabiłeś, racja? Myślałeś, że mój spadek wszystko by ułatwił, nie bacząc na moją biedną córkę... \" - Skarbie! - Slife warknął, odsuwając dłoń. Eames uniósł oczy do góry, i kurwa, cały pokój się kręcił, skup się, skup się. - Co dzisiaj z tobą jest? - zażądał, starając się utrzymać iluzję z całych sił. - Och, przepraszam, wybacz, ja po prostu... - wybąknął Slife, rozumiejąc konieczność przyśpieszenia akcji, nim sen rozsypał w kawałeczki, wyciągnął ciężką artylerię. „ Myślisz, że się nie dowie, Zachary? Myślisz, że ujdzie ci to na sucho? Sądzisz, że nie rozmówię się z nią, tak jak teraz rozmawiam z tobą, i nie powiem jej, gdzie ukryłeś moje ciało, jakie okropne rzeczy mi mówiłeś i od jak dawna to planowałeś... \" -Zamknij się! - Slife wykrzyczał, popychając stół – Zamknij się, do kurwy nędzy, zamknij się! \" Jednak ja nigdy nie umilknę, Zachary, zawsze tutaj będę, wiesz o tym, prawda? I już wkrótce dowie się również Elizabeth, ciekawe, co sobie o tobie pomyśli, Zachary, co powie...\" - Musiałem – krzyknął, i chociaż nie było to wystarczające, by przejść do drugiej fazy, to było wszystko, co dostaną. Eames zerwał się z krzesła i uciekł, ponieważ czuł, jak tracił nad wszystkim kontrolę, mury zaczynały zamieniać się w nicość, było tak gorąco i musiał uciekać... - Stój w miejscu, bym mógł cię zastrzelić, kurwa – Arthur wykrzyczał tuż za nim rozszalały, jednak został zagłuszony, że chaos – Eames, to się rozpada, przestań uciekać, jeśli nie pozwolisz mi cię zastrzelić, wciągniecie cię... Eames wiedział, że Arthur miał rację, ale nie potrafił opanować ataku paniki, że nie mógł zwolnić. - Jeśli się zatrzymam, to wszystko się zawali, muszę coś zrobić... - Kurwa – Arthur wykrzyczał i rzucił się na Eames, strzelając mu w twarz. Natychmiast się obudził z jękiem na ustach, przeklinając na czym świat stał, ku wielkiemu zaskoczeniu Yusufa. - Cholera- sapnął, wyrwał sobie igłę z ramienia i wstał. Natychmiast tego pożałował, gdy dopadły go nieoczekiwane zawroty głowy i oparł się o ścianę, aby złapać równowagę. Arthur obudził się i był na nogach sekundę później. - Ty skurwysynu... - prychnął. Jego głos brzmiał odlegle. Eames zamrugał, próbując nad sobą zapanować. - Czy ty w ogóle mnie słuchasz, och, słodki Jezu, Eames... - Kurwa, przytrzymajcie Slife\\'a we śnie – a ten głos brzmiał, jak Cobb, ale Eames nie miał jak się odwrócić i sprawdzić – Nie był gotowy, nie możesz budzić się w środku akcji... - Pieprzyć akcję – warknął Arthur, zbliżając się do Eamesa i kładąc mu ręce na ramionach – Eames! - Okropnie przepraszam, skarbie – wybełkotał Eames, szukając równowagi i jej nie znajdując – Ale nie jest tak źle... I wtedy, jakby nie miał dość upokorzeń, stracił przytomność. Kiedy się obudził, jego głowa była oparta o coś miękkiego, co okazało się marynarką Arthura, zwinięta pod nim w kulkę. Zamrugał, a nad nim pojawiła się twarz Ariadne na tle czystego, białego oddziału psychiatrycznego, który zbudowali na potrzeby misji. Plan był taki, aby przyprowadzić cel obudzony w kaftanie bezpieczeństwa, przekonać go, że jego sen był wspomnieniem jego załamanie nerwowego i nagrać jego szaloną paplaninę, ale Eames nie miał pojęcia, czy plan doszedł do skutku. - Witaj – powiedziała rozdarta między rozbawieniem a troską – Nie spodziewałam się, że będą potrzebne sole trzeźwiające w naszym planie. - Odczep się – warknął Eames, siadając i natychmiast tego żałując – Kurwa, moja głowa. - Nie powinieneś się ruszać – powiedziała radośnie – Ludzie, którzy mdleją w pracy... - Poważnie, Ariadne – ostrzegł – odczep się w tej chwili. Mamy zeznanie? Jak długo nie byłem nieprzytomny? - Około dwudziestu minut – odparła, klepiąc go w ramię – Mamy zeznanie, nie martw się, podaliśmy celowi środki na uspokojenie i czeka teraz na przewóz na tyłach magazynu. - Gdzie jest Arthur? Ariadne westchnęła. - W innym pokoju, właśnie wpadł w szał. - Co? - Eames zapytał, chowając twarz w dłoniach. Nadstawił uszu i doszedł go głos Arthura zza zamkniętych drzwi z drugiego końca magazynu. - Mówiłem ci, abyś nie zwiększał jego dawki! - Arthur krzyczał, najprawdopodobniej na Yusufa, biorąc pod uwagę kontekst i ton wymruczanej odpowiedzi. - Arthurze, uspokój się... - powiedział Cobb zmęczonym i sfrustrowanym głosem. - Nie uspokoję się – wykrzyczał Arthur, a Eames nawet nie musiał się podnosić, by wiedzieć, że jego twarz była blada z wściekłości. Westchnął i wstał, czuł się jak gówno, ale to było ważniejsze. Opierając się przez chwilę na krześle, by mieć pewność, że utrzyma się w pionie, podszedł do drzwi. - Nie uspokoję się do kurwy nędzy, przedsięwziąłem środki ostrożności, aby tego uniknąć, ale nikt mnie do jasnej cholery nie słuchał, jak mam się uspokoić...! - Skarbie – powiedział Eames, opierając się o framugę – Myślę, że wystarczy, zgodzisz się ze mną? Arthur odwrócił się i jego gniew przemienił się na moment w ulgę. Po czym rysy jego twarzy stężały znowu do zimnej furii. - Usiądź, zanim się przewrócisz, panie Eames – prychnął, kładąc rękę na ramieniu Eamesa i pchając go z całej siły na najbliższe krzesło – Nawet nie miałem szansy powiedzieć ci, jaki ty jesteś cholernie głupi, czy ty myślisz, że to dla mnie przyjemne strzelać do ciebie i patrzeć, jak... - Arthur – powiedział Eames, kładąc dłoń na jego policzku – Arthur, skarbie, przepraszam. Kątem oka dostrzegł Cobba i Yusufa idących powoli do drzwi i wykorzystał zwyczaj Arthura, aby zaciskać oczy i szybko kiwnął w ich stronę, wzdychając cicho, kiedy zniknęli. - Mogłeś utknąć w limbie – syknął wściekle Arthur – Jesteś pieprzonym idiotą, gdybym cię nie zastrzelił, a ty byś stracił kontrolę... - Wiem – powiedział Eames – Wiem, przepraszam. - Kurwa – warknął Arthur i zrobił krok do przodu, ściskając Eamesa za tył koszuli. Eames podniósł ramiona i owinął je wokół Arthura, opierając swoją absurdalnie ciężką głowę o ramię Arthura. Trząsł się pod rękoma Arthura z gniewu i czegoś jeszcze, prawdopodobnie strachu, a Eames zdał sobie sprawę zdecydowanie za późno, że Arthur miał prawdopodobnie rację, aby się temu oprzeć wiele lat wcześniej. To nie tak, że to co mieli, nie było nic warte, nie żałował tego ani sekundy i niczego by nie zmienił... Jednak miał rację. - Wszystko w porządku, skarbie – wyszeptał – Nikt nie utknął w limbie. - Nienawidzę cię do kurwy nędzy – Arthur wykrztusił w jego włosy – Nienawidzę cię, nienawidzę cię, tak bardzo cię nienawidzę... - Och, skarbie, dobrze o tym wiem – wymruczał Eames, gładząc jego plecy – Wiem, że mnie nienawidzisz. Kiedy Eames się obudził, odkrył, że jego twarz była wgnieciona w jeden z jego t-shirtów i był owinięty w koc, który nie przypominał sobie, aby ze sobą zabierał do łóżka. Zastanowił się nad tym przez chwilę z przymkniętymi oczami, nie przypominał sobie również, aby zdejmował koszulę, a ponadto czuł obok siebie wyraźnie ciepłe, silne ciało. - To nie jest mój Arthur, zgadza się? - spytał, próbując się nie skrzywić na dźwięk swojego niskiego, ochrypłego charkot. - Ależ oczywiście, że nie jest - powiedział Arthur - Masz gorączkowy sen. - Ponieważ mój Arthur - kontynuował Eames, nie przejmując się - Nie byłby w domu o godzinie... Która teraz właśnie jest. Miałby naprawdę wiele przekonujących argumentów na temat korków w godzinach szczytu. - Jest szesnasta trzydzieści - powiedział Arthur - I może trafił ci się czyjś inny Arthur. - Współczuję temu, ktokolwiek by to nie był. - powiedział Eames, poddając się i otwierając oczy. Arthur ma na sobie znoszony dres i koszulkę Eamesa \"Złap Rytm\", która wyglądała na nim absurdalnie śmiesznie. To naprawdę żenujące odkryć, że podczas snu przyczepił się do niego jak opętana pąkla, ale w końcu to Arthur wspiął się na łóżko i sobie na to pozwolił. - Zatem cię wykopali? - Może sam się wykopałem - powiedział Arthur, przewracając stronę w książce - To się zdarza. - Zdecydowanie czyjś inny Arthur - mruknął Eames z zadowoleniem - Że niby sam wyszedłeś z pracy z własnej woli? Nigdy. - Szczerze mówiąc zrobiłem to dopiero wtedy, kiedy Ariadne powiedziała mi, że zdefiniowałem na nowo pojęcie \"wrogiego miejsca pracy\" - wyznał Arthur żałośnie. Eames roześmiał się cicho w jego pierś. - Jakże by inaczej - wymruczał - Jak długo tu jesteś? Arthur wzruszył ramionami, a gest ten spowodował, że Arthur osunął się, znajdując się tym samym trochę bliżej Eames. - Parę godzin. Jak się czujesz? Eames westchnął - nie chciał odpowiadać na to pytanie, ale był winny Arthurowi prawdę. - Okropnie - przyznał - Ale trochę mniej. - Twoja gorączka się trochę obniżyła - odpowiedział Arthur, uśmiechając się delikatnie i odkładając książkę - Dobra robota z chowaniem termometru, nie myśl, że nie zauważyłem. Dzisiaj rano musiałem go szukać przez piętnaście minut. Jesteś najbardziej nieznośnym pacjentem w historii świata. - Powiedział mężczyzna, który mało mnie nie uderzył w twarz pewnego wieczora - wymamrotał Eames. Arthur roześmiał się łagodnie i tajemniczo, nadzwyczaj czerwony na twarzy, biorąc pod uwagę, jakie otaczał ich chłód. Eames zadrżał wbrew sobie, a Arthur tylko westchnął i przysunął się bliżej. - Przynajmniej do siebie pasujemy - wymamrotał pokornie. - Skarbie - westchnął Eames - To już wiedzieliśmy. Zapadła cisza. - Wiesz - podjął po chwili Arthur - Robi się z siebie niezła przylepa, kiedy jesteś chory. - A ty jesteś zaskakująco miły, kiedy jestem chory - odpowiedział Eames, podnosząc na niego wzrok i szczerząc się - Może powinienem wystawiać się na deszcz w trakcie burzy, twoja łagodna strona charakteru jest naprawdę intrygująca. Ani razu nie poczułem dzisiaj, że moje życie jest zagrożone. - Dupek - powiedział Arthur z rozczuleniem. Przesunął kciukiem po dolnej wardze Eamesa, łagodny i cichy, łagodniejszy niż zazwyczaj. Eames wydał dźwięk, który był częściowo spowodowany przyjemnością i częściowo niemożnością oddychania, więc Arthur się odsunął, przygładzając mu włosy. - Poważnie - powiedział Eames, kładąc głowę - Czy zamieniłeś się z kimś ciałami? Możesz mi powiedzieć, skarbie, nie ocenię cię za mocno. Arthur roześmiał się. - Spędziłeś cały dzień, oglądając okropne filmy, co nie? - Niestety nie - westchnął Eames - Większość dni spędzam na spaniu. - I włamując się znowu do Lotusa - dodał Arthur. - I włamując się znowu do Lotusa - potwierdził Eames - Oraz byciem instruowanym przez tego palanta o zagrożeniu płynącym z opuszczania domu samemu. W większości raczej tylko próbując. Gdybyś go zobaczył, ponieważ jego tutaj wcale nie ma, ty jesteś jego zdecydowanie lepszą wersją, mógłbyś, no wiesz, zająć się nim? - Teraz pleciesz bzdury - wymamrotał Arthur. Eames skinął głową, niewytłumaczalnie nadal zmęczony i naprawdę rozważając powrót do spania, kiedy Arthur się napiął. Eames mógłby pisać całe rozprawy na temat dziwacznych reakcji Arthura. Może zrobi to jutro, kiedy nie pozbędzie się wrażenia, że umierał. - Zatem, o co chodzi? - zapytał, ziewając. - Co co? - Jesteś cały spięty - narzekał Eames - Jesteś niewygodny. Idź mi z tym. - Wybacz, że jako poduszka nie spełniam twoich wymagań - bąknął Arthur i brzmiał jakby naprawdę trochę żałował. - Sarkazm wcale cię nie zmiękczy - powiedział Eames - O co chodzi? - Cóż... - powiedział - Nic... Tylko jeśli chodzi o ostatnią noc... - Ach - sapnął Eames - To - uniósł się do góry ogromnym kosztem pozostających w nim resztek sił i posłał Arthurowi rozdrażnione spojrzenie - Poważnie, skarbie... - Nie - odparł Arthur stanowczo - Słuchaj. Źle zareagowałem, ale... Ani trochę tego nie żałuję. I chcę, żebyś zrozumiał, że mogę zareagować równie źle... W podobnych sytuacjach. W przyszłości. Musisz mieć świadomość takiej możliwości. Eames zwyczajnie się gapił. Arthur nie patrzył mu w oczy, a policzki pokrywał delikatny rumieniec, i och, był największym idiotą, jakiego w życiu spotkał. - To wszystko? - zapytał, znowu się rozsiadając - Och, no cóż. Ja też cię kocham. - To nie to, co miałem... - Właśnie, że tak - przerwał mu Eames, lekko się szczerząc - Masz dla mnie jeszcze jakieś rewelacje, od których miałaby się zatrząść ziemia, czy mogę kontynuować mój powrót do zdrowia? Zapadła na chwilę cisza. - Następnym razem, gdy zachoruję, zmienię twoje życie w piekło tylko po to, aby zrobić ci na złość. - Zaskakujesz mnie - mruknął Eames. Czuł, że przegrywał walkę z bezsennością, więc tylko dodał - Nie musisz ze mną zostawać, wiesz. Zasnę tak czy siak. - Dobrze mi tu, gdzie jestem - powiedział Arthur. Znowu podniósł książkę i oparł ją o czubek głowy Eamesa, kładąc wolną dłoń na jego plecach. - Śpij. Obudzę cię na kolację. - Mmmm - zgodził się Eames. Zamknął oczy. * W Stanach Zjednoczonych używa się stopni Fahrenheita do mierzenia temperatury. W oryginale Eames miał 103 stopnie Fahrenheita, dlatego pozwoliłam sobie przeliczyć i podać jego temperaturę w jednostce, której używa się w naszym kraju - stopniach Celsjusza. **Podobna sytuacja, w oryginale było 45 stopni Fahrenheita, czyli naszych 7 stopni Celsjusza. *** Podobna sytuacja, w oryginale było 102 stopni Fehrenheita, czyli 38,9w zaokrągleniu do części dziesiętnych. **** \"Serce oskarżycielem\", czyli \"Tale-Tell Heart\" to nowela Edgara Allan Poe, w której główny bohater dokonuje morderstwa na starcu, z którym mieszka. Kiedy jego krzyk alarmuje sąsiedztwo, do jego domu przybywają policjanci, by przeprowadzić śledztwo. W jego trakcie główny bohater słyszy bicie serca starca, dopadają go wyrzuty sumienia i przyznaje się przed policjantami, że jest mordercą. ","Summary":" Oryginał: between my reflex & my resolve Autor: Gyzym Zgoda: Jest Źródło: /works/135872 Tłumaczyła:"},{"Movie":"Inception","Title":"Matter","Author":"PrettyPrettyPlease","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11665538","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Matter[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: PASIV Whisperer \"I was afraid you\\'d say that...\" The disappointment in the elderly man\\'s voice was evident. The concern was hidden in an undertone but after enough time spent together, Ariadne could sniff it out. \"Ari, dear, what on earth are you thinking?\" She made quick work of quelling his anxieties with an air of nonchalance that seemed starkly contrary to the situation. \"It\\'s just a few jobs. Nothing is set in stone.\" And because Miles knew how dreary and depressing her outlook on normal life had become, she added, \"You know I\\'ve been complacent lately. I need a break from the monotony before I jump into the Seine.\" \"Your life isn\\'t monotonous, it\\'s normal,\" Miles argued, \"Contrary to your newfound belief, life does not have to be dangerous and chaotic to be pleasurable.\" With Professor Stephen Miles, his bark was always more barbed than his bite (and his bite was pretty alarming too). He didn\\'t mince words and he definitely didn\\'t sugarcoat his criticism. That\\'s why he and Ariadne had gotten along so well. He told her exactly where she lacked or needed to improve without worrying about her feelings and unlike most students, Ariadne rose to the challenge without taking it personal. That\\'s how she could calmly reply, \"With all due respect, Miles, did you only call to lecture me?\" And here, he retreated. Because attached though he was to his protege and uneasy as he was about the amount of safety in her chosen future...he would not allow himself to shove his misgivings down her throat. There was no way to forcefully change her mind. Not in a way that would be loving. \"No. I\\'m sorry. You\\'re a grown woman who is entitled to make her own decisions—whether I agree or not.\" He wouldn\\'t hold back his words of wisdom, however: \"I just pray that you keep your wits about you. You\\'re a sharp girl, Ariadne, the brightest I know. Use that intuition for your benefit.\" The Point Man had crossed the expanse of the concrete walkway and turned in a copy of receipt to the rental kiosk. Ariadne idly watched as the hefty man behind the desk handed Arthur a car fob and tossed another to a lankier man a few steps back who then ran into the depths of the parking garage like a man on a mission. \"I will. Like I said, it\\'s not a permanent life-change. We\\'re going to work together for a set number of jobs and if I want to pull out after that and go back to normal life, I will.\" In earshot of her last few words, Arthur made eye contact with her. There was nothing but understanding and a little boredom in his gaze. After all that was the deal, wasn\\'t it? Her declining his partnership for a permanent address in Paris wasn\\'t a new concept. He merely tossed her the extra key fob. \"I see. And I understand, believe me, I do. But will you promise me to be careful?\" \"I promise. Arthur\\'s training me in both physical and psychological defense; I\\'ll be prepared for whatever\\'s thrown my way.\" The two stood waiting for their car. Ariadne, earnestly easing the mind of Stephen Miles over the phone and Arthur, re-setting his watch for the new time zone, pretending out of politeness, to be deaf. \"Good. Good. Might I give you some added advice? As a caring mentor who just wants to see you successful and happy?\" Distracted, Ariadne answered, \"Yeah. By all means.\" The rental car had finally been pulled up and her attention was split between the Professor trying to give her meaningful guidance and assisting Arthur in loading their luggage into the trunk. Honestly, she was a little more focused on the latter. That is, until he dropped a bomb in the form of: \"Stay emotionally guarded as well...Feelings make decisions harder and when the time comes I don\\'t want you sacrificing the life you really want for... someone you think you really want.\" She halted, eyes wide with shock, to the loud clank of Arthur slamming the trunk shut. \"Professor—\" Miles must\\'ve been cringing because the woman could practically hear it, \"I know. It\\'s an awkward subject. I\\'m dangerously close to cross—\" \"That\\'s not going to happen.\" Ariadne trudged forward, adamantly ignoring Arthur\\'s glance of curiosity. \"Arthur and I don\\'t share any type of...whatever you\\'re hedging at.\" As the Point Man slid into the driver\\'s seat, Ariadne opened her door and shot him a confused \\'where the hell is this coming from\\' look across the seats as if he knew what was said and could sympathize with her. \"I apologize. After Mal, I can\\'t abide and not at least warn you against it. Dom told me you mentioned kissing Arthur during the last job—\" Arthur noticed a splash of pink bloom on her cheeks but that didn\\'t stop her from shooting her eyes at Arthur. There was more teasing in her look than there was actual accusation, \"Number one: he kissed me.\" Eyes to the dashboard. \" And number two: it was during the dream. Nothing in a dream actually counts.\" \"A kiss is a kiss,\" stated Miles plainly. \"Not this was a distraction —\" and before Miles could present another theory of his own she spouted, \"For the projections .\" At this point, Arthur was more than keyed in to the subject of conversation. And the subject was that peck in the second level that he hoped wouldn\\'t come back and bite him in the butt. Arthur couldn\\'t hear what Miles replied through the receiver but Ariadne\\'s defense was clear: \"You had to be there...\" Arthur saw Ariadne roll her eyes in annoyance. \" I don\\'t know what it was—but it wasn\\'t...\" After making eye contact with the Point Man again, Ariadne stood back, closed the car door and turned her back to it. Her partner guessed she was going for a smidgen more privacy but he could hear easily through the windows no matter how hard he tried to be respectful and tune it out. \"Miles...Okay, yeah, I give you that. He\\'s good looking—\" Clearing his throat, Arthur took great notice of the steering wheel. \"No. No, that\\'s where whatever feelings you\\'re talking about stop. He\\'s a business partner. This is a business venture. Honestly, would you question me about this if I was starting an internship with Clement Forvieux?\" Perhaps, Arthur could adjust the seat for a minute or two... Ariadne\\'s voice raised—\"That is the point.\" And if her total exasperation wasn\\'t clear enough, she dissolved into French. Fortunately for Arthur, that meant he no longer needed to pretend he knew what she was arguing. He knew enough French to get around the city and conclude deals with those who spoke it but he wasn\\'t fluent...or at least not enough to process the words as fast as she was spouting them out. He was in the middle of adjusting the rear view mirrors (for the 4th time) when Ariadne visibly sighed and relaxed against the car. She must\\'ve won the dispute. Then back in English and much slower than the speed of light, she promised, \"I\\'ll send you postcards every now and again so you know I\\'m safe.\" And as she plopped into the passenger side, she smiled a sort of nostalgic and warm way. \"Always.\" Arthur took that as his cue to rev up the car and get on their way. Xxxxxxx Once they were further down the road to their destination (aka the Brazilian city of Belem) Ariadne broke the silence while simultaneously opening her bag of chips, \"I\\'m guessing you heard some of that...\" \"I...\" Arthur shrugged with a stare fixed out the windshield, \"well the English parts were evident but I wasn\\'t going to bring it up.\" \"We may as well talk about it,\" suggested the Architect. The Point side-eyed her for propping her feet on the dash but refrained from saying anything. She looked at him, chip waving in the air, \"Get it out of the way so it\\'s not awkward between us.\" It was really hard to gauge his nod but he agreed, \"I suppose.\" \"So...Miles is convinced that I\\'m an idiot and you\\'re somehow irresistible—so I\\'m assuming Cobb never introduced you two—and I\\'m obviously going to fall all over myself for you.\" Ariadne explained her view on Miles\\' opinion quite openly and sarcastic. Arthur understood where the Professor was coming from but wondered if Miles really didn\\'t know Ariadne that well or if Ariadne misjudged what Stephen was truly worried about and imagined her Professor\\'s unflattering opinion of her. It had to be the latter. Miles would be the first to give Ariadne more credit than that. She was imaginative and creative and bold and independent. That was another thing Arthur liked about her...she had her head on straight. \"He doesn\\'t think of you as an idiot. No one that knows you could think that. I\\'m sure he didn\\'t mean any of it the way you took it.\" \"He didn\\'t,\" she admitted then waved her hand dismissively, \"But just the same.\" With the possibility of romance laid out like a dead body by Stephen, they should address it. And not just the prospect of it but Arthur\\'s intentions during their dream-kiss and what they expected out of the partnership in the future. In dangerous and dodgy situations, life or death circumstances, sanity dependent on your partner and their talents...you need implicit and utter trust. And they couldn\\'t have that absolute certainty in each other if they were beating around bushes and sidestepping the other inelegantly. So he braced for impact and stated, \"When I kissed you...\" Maybe that wasn\\'t where he should\\'ve started. He rerouted, \"Ariadne, I think very highly of you. I admire your talents and I enjoyed your company while we were working but—\" \"The kiss had a purpose, I know.\" She finished for him. No question in her tone. No bitterness or wistfulness. Arthur appreciated the blunt, light, non-committal lilt to her words. It was reassuring. \"And for me, it was just a welcome distraction from all the murderous projections. I was freaking out.\" The woman chuckled and re-adjusted her feet, \"You don\\'t have to worry about me lying awake at night thinking about it.\" Arthur laughed, \"Good. I\\'m glad.\" But then he twisted the conversation on it\\'s head and addressed a more serious matter. \"And you don\\'t have to worry that I\\'ll try to steal another kiss. Or try to make an unprecedented move on you...\" In silence, he waited, expecting her typical tongue-in-cheek response. But she was taking this seriously too. She was taking his words to heart. He glanced briefly, from the road to her, then back to the road. \"I want you to be comfortable with me. Feel safe with me. I will respect you and your space and my interactions with you will always be deferential and chaste. You have my word.\" \"So being lovers is not in the job description?\" There it was. That was the dry humor he was anticipating to begin with. Instead of cracking a smile at it, though, he kept his face schooled and his answer simple and honest. \"No.\" \"Golden,\" followed with a crunch of potato. Following a bit of quiet background noise from the air vents, Arthur piped, \"But I would like to be friends. Good friends.\" \"I think we can manage that,\" The Architect reacted happily. Watching the highway ascend towards the Rio-Niteroi bridge, taking in the rippling waters on either side and the lights of Belem twinkling against the early evening sky. xxxxxxx Ariadne took to training like plants take to soil. She soaked up all the knowledge Arthur could water. The only problem with how fast she learned, was how easily bored she got. The Point Man liked to educate by diagrams, visual aid, answering questions...he had many methods and at first they kept her engaged; However, Arthur liked to drill. Arthur repeated and repeated and made the woman recite over and over. Ariadne was someone who thrived on constant challenges and brain stimulation and unfortunately Arthur\\'s favorite method of teaching became monotonous for her real fast. \"And the Somnacin is distributed through the tubes when...?\" \"The pistons are released.\" They sat facing each other on the ground of a decent-sized metal shed Arthur procured for their Brazilian work hide-out. Ariadne was cross-legged, chin in hand, deadpanning at her tutor who believed it necessary to hide the PASIV blueprints behind him as if she needed to cheat for their information after the eight hundredth quiz on the subject. The lessons were far less taxing and he was way more fun during the Fischer job, when no one really expected her to know anything but the basics. But with their entire future in the dreamshare field at stake...lord help her. \"And the pistons are released by?\" \"The main push-button.\" \"And the Somnacin is then regulated by?\" \"An electric pump that serves as an infusion adapter.\" Frankly, Ariadne didn\\'t even have to waste thought about the questions anymore. The answers flowed out whether she was paying attention to the words leaving her mouth or not. And she wasn\\'t paying attention...because her stomach was eating itself raw and she was so bored she felt her life-force draining with every second. \"The flow is called the?\" \"Menstrual cycle...\" \"Ariadne.\" \"The drip rate.\" Arthur checked his watch, pursed his lips. \"Average rate?\" \"60 drops per millimeter. Can be adjusted according to size and weight of the dreamers,\" she spouted off like a living goodle-search. \"Can it be done manually?\" \"Yes, by means of a clamp on the intravenous tube while adjusting pressure according to drops per minute.\" Here, the Architect switched her seating position by stretching her jean-clad legs and leaning backwards on her hands. \"Can we grab lunch now? I\\'m freakin starving.\" It didn\\'t seem he had listened to her because he held up a picture of a big, clunky, copper looking briefcase. \"What model is this?\" \"The first?\" Her eyebrows displayed her sarcasm more than her voice did. Arthur merely tilted his head. That answer wasn\\'t going to suffice for him. Damn his specificity. \"The prototype. Also known as PSS-USM00.\" In rapid succession, he had her name off the other systems at random. Including the PSS-PRO, PAS-X01, PAS-X02 and the PASIV-3X. She rattled the answers correctly, on sight. Though she hoped that was the last quick test before Arthur had mercy on her and took her to eat, Arthur checked his watch again, \"We\\'ll eat in another half hour.\" Without batting an eyelash towards her, he pulled a binder from his messenger bag, pulled a paper packet from inside the binder\\'s front pocket, and tossed it in front of her. \"I want you to label all six of these PASIV models\\' parts and gears correctly before we take a break.\" Ariadne looked down at the packets and cut her eyes back to him with furrowed brows, \"Are you kidding?\" He held her gaze. Rolled a highlighter and a pen her way. Then stood and sauntered over to the white folding table on the wall behind her.\"You have to start working on the specs for our client at 3 to keep on schedule.\" Ariadne watched as he scooted the PASIV aside to make room for a wrench, screwdriver, pliers and wire cutters. \"And it\\'s not even noon,\" she gestured at the papers now in her lap, \"I can\\'t do this when we get back?\" \"No.\" Arthur said. His back towards her. \"When we get back, you\\'ll be assembling a PASIV.\" With a flick of his wrist, the framework of the PASIV popped out and the tubing went sprawling and uncoiling. Xxxxxxx The reasons were justified. A dreamer\\'s entire operation, job, life, depended on a working PASIV. Work for the wrong people and have your PASIV blow out on you before the job is complete? You\\'re looking at being on the run for however long your client can hold a grudge. There was a black market for PASIVs, of course, but any you came by were expensive as hell and just as beat up as the last. The US military wasn\\'t manufacturing them anymore so most PASIVs to be found were all of the old models smuggled around in the same circles of people. There were what everyone called \"Possees\" or P.A.S.S.E\\'s. Portable Automatic Somnacin System Engineers. These were people who took it upon themselves to create similar systems with PASIV functions. Rip-offs, basically. Find a talented engineer who knew enough about dreamshare (and knew enough about chemistry to put together the proper mechanisms for safe Somnacin drip) and you had a decent rip-off. That was one in a million though, everyone in that business was after a quick buck. Arthur\\'s PASIV was the real deal. Official PASIV 3X model, reliable programming, stainless steel shell, drip timer (which was only available on the latest two models) and easy to clean. Miles bought it through an American friend of a friend during his experimental years right after Mal left home for UCLA. This was shortly after the order for PASIV manufacturing was banned in the US. Mal met and brought home Cobb, who was an architect major and friend of a soldier who\\'d been part of the recently shut down DIE (Dream-Intelligence Extraction) Program. That naturally made him curious, put him and Miles on common ground and they began to experiment together. Miles\\' PASIV became Dom and Mal\\'s PASIV. And then when Mal died and Dom when on the fritz...he let Arthur keep up with it and by default, The Point Man became its owner. This is why Arthur was anal about the maintenance of the PASIV; It was the most important piece of equipment they possessed. And this is why Arthur insisted Ariadne knew how to clean, program and repair it. So it\\'s use could extend. He wanted her to be able to repair it at a minute\\'s notice, be able to know how it worked so she could improvise and substitute parts and gears in a location where there weren\\'t any replacements to be found. Arthur made her memorize models other than their own for back-up. In case a client requested they use one in his possession, or they joined a team who insisted on using their own, or if Arthur and Ariadne\\'s PASIV was destroyed, she could damn well make another one. And she could make any of the varying models depending on what parts and tools she had at her disposal. At this point, Ariadne had been disassembling and reassembling PASIVs the entirety of this trip. Thankfully, when Arthur stated that their first job would be simple, he meant simple . The dream was one level and the scenery was based off the man\\'s front lawn. Ariadne designed a multi-dimensional facade resembling the front of the mark\\'s house and the rest was basically just...grassy maze, two trees. She added a third on her twentieth edit just to have something new to look at. She was thankful to have something other than a PASIV to look at even if she didn\\'t wasn\\'t thankful for very long while working on it. \"So the change isn\\'t structural. You just added a tree?\" Arthur gestured to the specs in his hand as he stood in the doorway of her hotel room, dull look in his eyes. He\\'d already showered and been in bed a couple hours when she called him about alterations to the level and slid some hurried, pencil smudged, sketches under his door. \"This couldn\\'t wait until morning?\" \"I mean...\" Ariadne grimaced. Arthur had typed up some worksheets containing scenarios of varying complications with the PASIV, locations of random job sites, and objects available at or in those sites. Her job was to brainstorm what she could use out of her surroundings in each scenario and fix the PASIV or construct a system to function like it to get by. She\\'d been working on those for hours...energized by finally working on something challenging and without repetition. Ariadne had know idea what time it was. \"I didn\\'t check the time, I\\'m sorry. Is it late?\" Arthur shrugged sarcastically, \"Nah, just...you know, 2 am.\" The amused glint in his eye confused Ariadne until his eyes cut down to her hands and she remembered the half-drank cup of coffee she was nursing. \"I guess you\\'ll be sleeping on the job tomorrow.\" \"Sleeping on the job is technically part of my job.\" Her head tilted side, \"Besides the dreamscape is designed—\" Arthur lazily leaned his head against her doorway, \"Except you keep changing it.\" \"Tweaking,\" Ariadne corrected. \"And the plan is outlined—\" \"But not perfected.\" The woman peered, \"No one is capable of absolute perfection,\" to avoid his mention of their disastrous run the day before (Ariadne made a change to the design on instinct, having forgotten they were running a trial and not judging the landscape anymore, and the projections ate them alive. Close to literally) she plowed on, \"and I pretty much know enough about PASIVs to be a PASIV whisperer so...\" He deadpanned at her, still amused though, \"Uh-huh.\" Her sketches were rolled and stuck into his suit pocket, \"Well I\\'ll make sure to drill the addition of your flower beds, tomorrow. See you in the morning—or,\" he smiled teasingly, \"late afternoon most likely.\" \"Ha. Ha,\" droned the woman with squinted eyes. \"Thank you for the enormous effort of putting on a shirt and walking a door over.\" He saluted, \"Night.\" xxxxxxx \"I\\'m impressed...\" Arthur grit through his teeth as Ariadne twisted his arm while straddling his back. Not only was dreamworld training requisite but real world prep was a must. The underground community for this career was cutthroat at best and tortuously abominable at worst. Arthur\\'s biggest concern was if they got separated. He wanted her to be able to hold her own and protect herself. She was doing well. Her free hand smooshed his face against the (dirty) carpet of his hotel room, stained by substances Arthur didn\\'t want to brainstorm about. \"Thank you,\" she replied before hopping up and bouncing in place, ready to go again. Her eyes were twinkling with enthusiasm. Arthur came at her, lunging for her middle. Ariadne grabbed his arm and turned her body so that his torso was flush against her back and used his weight against him to flip him to the bed. Successfully knocking the air out of him. She stood over him, upside down from his point of view. \"I like this part of training.\" \"I wonder why.\" He cleared his throat as he started to sit up, \"You sure are catching on quick.\" After holding out her hand to help her mentor up, Ariadne shrugged, \"I would hope so. I took six months of self defense before I moved to Europe.\" Arthur narrowed his eyes, \"You didn\\'t think to tell me?\" he threw two nimbly blocked punches. \"It didn\\'t show up in your research?\" Ariadne threw a punch back. Arthur grabbed hold of her wrist with both hands and pulled her in to him only for her knee his stomach, \"You\\'re not that great of a Point Man, are you?\" He grit through his teeth, \"I was looking for basics!\" A knock sounded from the door. \"Room service!\" Ariadne started for the door, excited at the prospect of dinner when Arthur grabbed her foot, making her nearly face plant. He dragged her back towards him, \"Never let your guard down.\" It was his turn to straddle her and he was quick to pin her hands down. She struggled against him angrily, attempting to free her hands for a punch because trying to knee him in the back was not successful. In frustration (more over the prospect of the food being taken back to the hotel\\'s kitchen or getting cold that having to spar with the Point), she groaned, \"Arthur!\" and not having any mercy until she figured a way out he coaxed, \"Come on, Ariadne. Use my weight. Use my body.\" Giving off another gruff sound, the Architect bent her legs again, hooked her feet with his, and used his own force to roll them over. \"How\\'s that?\" she asked derisively, already abandoning him for the door and the food. When he went to grab her waist, she simply elbowed his crotch (she wasn\\'t really aiming there...honestly...) and continued on her way to accept the room service. \"Shit, Ariadne!\" Finally giving up, Arthur collapsed on the bed in pain. In all fairness...he told her when they started, not to stop until her opponent was incapacitated. And he certainly fought like he meant it, so... She opened the door to a cringing, flustered, uncomfortable male her age. He held out the tray and stuttered, \"I\\'m so—um, so—uh...\" It wasn\\'t until the waiter\\'s eyes cut to and away from Arthur in shock that she registered more than the facts that she beat Arthur and her food was at the door. She looked down at herself...clothes twisted and askew, hair all but fallen completely out of her ponytail, sweating, flushed, breathing heavy. \"I\\'m very sorry to have disturbed you—uh, Miss—Ma\\'am?\" \"No it\\'s—it\\'s not—\" she glanced back at Arthur, very blase, only to find Arthur half on the bed, clothes just as tousled, holding the area of pain and groaning. Looking back at the waiter, Ariadne didn\\'t have the time nor the stomach to explain what he thought was happening. The woman resigned herself to leave it be. \"It\\'s okay.\" Ariadne grabbed the tray and shut the door before any more speculation could be made, \"We\\'ll tip you on the card, thanks.\" Unbeknownst to the two inside, the waiter delicately switched their door sign to \\'Do not disturb\\' and quickly walked away. xxxxxxx It went on like this for weeks into months until Arthur felt Ariadne had enough knowledge to tackle the world of Dreamshare as an active, paid, contractor instead of mostly a tourist as she had been. He was confident that in addition to being an Architect, Ariadne had sufficient enough skills to act as Point if needed or Extractor if life depended on it. Her forging still needed a lot of work, she struggled with that most. But she was going to be a killer Sentinel—the team member who pushes the plunge and watches from reality, who has to think on their feet and fix any problems with the machinery and sedative. Of course, there were more aspects in all the roles that she needed to learn and improve upon but the base was there and honestly experience was the best teacher. After their first small side job in Brazil, Arthur decided it\\'d be easier to hunker down somewhere and focus just on the training. Having her brain zeroed in on the education alone instead of stretched between it and the stresses of a job was \"more beneficial\" in Arthur\\'s opinion. In Ariadne\\'s, it was \"deadening.\" But now here they were, at the true start of their journey. Hopping a plane to Madrid to meet Mateo Cortes. A lawyer with his reputation on the block and the money to spend to get it off.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: DC Their layover in New York was long enough to grab a bite to eat and spend the night. A diner on the corner of 45th caught their eyes and appealed to their grumbling stomachs so they stopped their taxi and headed in. It was termed \"The Comfort Diner\" and it certainly was well worn-in. Most of the green seat cushions had tears in them and the white tiles on the floor were stained a dirty brown but the food was less greasy than Arthur had had at most other diners and he was more focused on his phone than the ambiance to scrutinize the grime. He was thankful they happened to pick a restaurant so scarce of customer and yet so loud. That meant they could multitask and get some groundwork done for the job. \"I\\'ll tell you this,\" Arthur said without looking up from his screen, \"It\\'ll be one of the easiest jobs we\\'ll get.\" Ariadne looked from the broken jukebox in the corner (it played music but the diner had it on locked rotation so customers couldn\\'t pick songs but listen like it was a radio) to the Point Man in disdain, \"I didn\\'t think anything could be easier than the last one.\" The man scrolled through the notes taken from his last contact with the client, \"His sub isn\\'t militarized because he\\'s an avid protester against dreamshare; doesn\\'t think it\\'s a threat.\" \"Ironic,\" smirked the Architect as she dipped a fry in ketchup. \"He rarely leaves his office which spans the entire upper floor of the building, so that\\'s our location,\" Arthur sighed, he was hoping for a harder job too. He wanted to test Ariadne\\'s limits and challenge her abilities since her recent training. \"Plus, he has lunch for his firm catered everyday so—\" Ariadne finished, \"That\\'s our in. So disappointing...\" \"We\\'ll get something to chew on soon.\" Arthur put away his phone and forked some of his meatloaf, carefully sopping up a small amount of gravy. \"I think clients with complicated work are too leery of trusting a two person team for a five person job just yet. We might should collaborate with larger teams on larger jobs for a bit to get a reputation out there.\" \"I thought we had somewhat of a reputation. \" \"Yeah. Somewhat .\" Like a true gentleman, he waited until after he\\'d finished chewing and swallowed to finish the sentence. \" I have a reputation. But people aren\\'t sure about the young, green, Architect I\\'ve taken up.\" In contrast, Ariadne threw two crisp fries in her mouth and immediately questioned, \"An inception wasn\\'t proof enough for me?\" \"Not if most people think we faked it.\" —Which was the common belief about the mythological Fischer Inception. Not because people actually denied it was possible. Not because a team consisting of the legendary Dom Cobb, the notorious Mr. Eames, and the fabled Arthur weren\\'t capable of pulling it off. And not even because they were ignorant of the evidence...that being the complete hundred and eighty degree turn around of Robert Fischer\\'s (the alleged mark\\'s) decisions about his father\\'s company and the rise of Saito\\'s (the alleged client\\'s) energy empire through Proclus Global. It was just because the rest of the Dreamshare community didn\\'t want the members of that team to monopolize the underground business and so spread the rumor that the Fischer Inception was just that—a rumor. \"I\\'ll reach out to some of my contacts after this. See if we can\\'t get on something that will put us on the map,\" promised Arthur. Ariadne straightened as if she\\'d been stung by a bee but it was only an idea, \"What about Eames?\" Arthur\\'s face actually dissolved into disgust, \"That rat?\" Ariadne didn\\'t disagree because that was exactly her point, \"Rats attract seedy jobs. And seedy jobs are complicated. Which makes them more fun.\" \"We\\'ll talk about it.\" They didn\\'t talk about it for the duration of their dinner. Instead, they discussed their plans for meeting up in the morning, how late they\\'d get in the next day, what the weather was like in Spain, and fought over splitting the taxi fare. Paying their own checks at dinner was expected, they ordered their own meals...paying their own hotel fees was simple, they had their own separate rooms...but they shared a taxi and God forbid Ariadne make it easy for him to be chivalrous. They were on their way as another song on the jukebox rolled around: Working My Way Back To You by Franki Valli if Arthur was correct. Having agreed upon Ariadne paying for the taxi that evening and Arthur paying for the shuttle in the morning, Arthur was following her out. He was mid-step, shrugging on his trench coat, when she stopped in her tracks and he almost collided into her back. She grabbed her front jean pocket (presumably where her totem was). \"Everything ok?\" asked her partner. \"Yeah.\" She continued out the door, \"Just haven\\'t heard that song in long time.\" xxxxxxx Arthur enjoyed spending his mornings in the fresh air if possible and fortunately the hotel was able to accommodate he and Ariadne two rooms with balconies. The Point Man was up at 6am because of his turned around biological clock, in time for a shower, a call with the client about their ETA, and morning news on the tv while he waited on room service to bring his order up. He was surprised to find Ariadne already awake when he brought his breakfast and coffee outside, of course she was still in her pajamas as if she hadn\\'t been up long. There was a half-drank mug of tea on her outside table and the woman was leaning on the concrete railing and holding a package of crackers with earbuds in her ears. Arthur intended to wave but she was in her own little zone. They met in the lobby at a quarter to 11am, fifteen minutes before their shuttle back to the airport was scheduled to arrive. Arthur was astonished, again, to see Ariadne had beaten him there. She was propped against a column watching a cooking show on the lobby\\'s tv. Duffle at her feet. Arthur pegged her as perpetually late and a chronic over-sleeper based on her behavior during the Fischer job but to be fair, there was so much else going on during the Fischer job, her sleep patterns and punctuality might\\'ve been circumstantial. They were barely passed airport security when her phone rang. Which normally wouldn\\'t have been a big deal, except her cell\\'s service chip had been removed back on their first night in Brazil. Arthur advised that it would be safer for her and her loved ones to disable her personal line during any period of time during which she was involved in Dreamshare, even in the least, and to switch burner phones between jobs. He\\'d helped her jailbreak this phone the same night they put together their new identities (fake passports, ids, and all) and the only numbers they installed were each others and the client\\'s, per protocol. But Arthur wasn\\'t calling her...and it was a one way line of communication with the client. Arthur and Ariadne contacted them, not the other way around, or else it would incriminate the client. Thus, the Point whipped his head from the terminal screen to her phone in disbelief, \"Whose calling your burner?\" In pure damage-control mode, Arthur swiped the phone from her hand before she even fully pulled the thing from the side pouch of her backpack. There was no reason for them to be tailed from someone in Brazil, the job was successful. So either some other Point had been casing her way before they joined forces or it was something to do with Browning and Fischer. Something had gone belly-up. Why else would it be her phone ringing and not his? The caller id listed \"DC,\" when Arthur read it. \"Washington?\" Had she played him? Was she part of a sting on Dreamshare crime? He noted a splash of pink on her cheeks as a wide-eyed Ariadne snatched the phone back, \"No, it\\'s—\", she scrambled to right the phone, press the green button, and rush a \"Hey, not now—\" The Point Man grabbed it back, suspicious now, and listened. Observing Ariadne\\'s resigned sigh and stare at the ceiling. An orotund voice jumped through the earpiece, \"Well, a burner phone is never a good sign. Arthur already making you cut off the known world? Listen—\" Arthur remembered that voice. \"Dom?\" the Point said with utter incredulity. \"Arthur?\" Dom matched Arthur\\'s tone, \"Man, we need to talk. I see you\\'re in New York, I\\'ll have someone watch the kids for a couple days and I\\'ll fly out to meet Ariadne.\" Arthur narrowed his eyes, \"No can do. We\\'re on our way to a job. You\\'re tracking us?\" Ariadne\\'s head shot down to meet Arthur\\'s eyes. She was just as taken back as Arthur was about it. Arthur pulled her by the arm into an alcove between an airport eatery and the bathrooms to keep some measure of secrecy. And so he could hear better and talk louder. Cobb negated to answer the obvious and switched gears, \"I promised Miles back during the Saito job that I would keep Ariadne out of this. I can\\'t let her get involved again. I know she spoke to Miles and he\\'s trying to step back and let her learn her own lessons but I can\\'t. We got close on the Fischer job and I feel a responsibility to protect her—\" Responsibility? Protect? Since when did Cobb bother himself with that? When he tied Ariadne to his coat tails and pulled her down into limbo with him? For the life of Arthur, he could not figure the two of those people out. It drove him crazy during the Fischer job. He wasn\\'t jealous of either of them but he didn\\'t like their secretiveness. Their hushed tones, late night talks, experiments, it always felt like they were up to something and whatever it was, it toed the line of peril. Whatever it was, they refused to let Arthur do his job and help; they wanted to keep it to themselves. And Arthur be damned, he felt protective over Ariadne since he was her first teacher. He felt accountable for her during that job (compounded with his usual duty for the whole team\\'s wellbeing) so to watch her get involved with Cobb\\'s insanity and follow him around like Mal used to...and to watch Cobb let her? Encourage her? And to then have Cobb act like he hadn\\'t exploited Ariadne\\'s talents for his own psychological and literal gain and that Arthur was the dangerous one here...it just...he wanted to punch Cobb. \"Protect? That\\'s why you\\'re calling on her burner, then? \\'Cause that\\'s the safest thing,\" when Arthur got sarcastic, you know he was angry, because he couldn\\'t keep his cool, monotonous, facade. Before Cobb had a chance to debate, Arthur continued, \"You know, I understand Miles\\' concern but I don\\'t know why you give a shit except you have to get in the middle of everything. You\\'re out, Dom. Stay out of it.\" \"Take a pill, Arthur. Respectfully, this has nothing to do with you—\" That was it. Because it most certainly had to do with Arthur. This was about his new business partner. They were trying to grow a reputation together. They were mentor and protege. Point and Architect. A team. And Cobb had the audacity to try and wiggle his way in. Again. Like he\\'d done with Mal. And lord knows, Dom could do much more damage to Ariadne\\'s head than Arthur could. \"No respectfully this has nothing to do with you. It\\'s a business agreement between two grown adults who would appreciate if the decision was honored.\" \"Put Ariadne on the phone.\" Arthur grit, \"We\\'re getting on a plane. Don\\'t call this burner again,\" he didn\\'t wait for Cobb to respond to hang up on him. Not that he wouldn\\'t have been pleased to reconnect with his old buddy in another context but considering this was through Ariadne\\'s secure (supposed to be) line and the insinuation that out of Cobb and Arthur that Dom was the prudent, self-preserving, one was an infuriating joke. Judging from Ariadne\\'s sheepish look, she knew Arthur was not happy with her giving away that number. All he had to do was hold up the phone pointedly, \"I know, I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t think it\\'d hurt to have him on there too. For advice or whatever...\" At least he had the courtesy not to scroll through her contacts without asking, he respected her privacy. Instead he trusted her to answer honestly, \"Do you have anybody else on here?\" \"Just Dom.\" He held the phone out to her, \"Block him and delete the number, please.\" Ariadne obliged. He could sense she was perturbed but couldn\\'t discern who at. Him? Or Dom? Probably both. \"It\\'s not about me being a control freak, Ariadne, it\\'s about safety.\" \"I know,\" she affirmed, punching buttons with her fingers. It actually sounded like she was more annoyed with herself. \"The last thing we need is for Dom to show up somewhere trying to drag me back to Paris.\" She then slid the device into jacket pocket, \"I\\'ll call him from a payphone if I need to.\" Why would she need Cobb? What was her fascination? Arthur just couldn\\'t figure those two out. xxxxxxx Because it was just the two of them, there was no need for a work space outside of either of their hotel rooms which were conveniently located down the hall from each other. They just met back and forth to work. This morning they were in Arthur\\'s room. Ariadne took the desk so she could splay out her sketches and Arthur sat on the bed with his laptop, a few notepad and files surrounding him. \"Do you think we\\'ll be ready by next Tuesday?\" Ariadne rolled her chair away from the desk so she could be eye level with her ruler, \"Yeah, probably.\" The man informed her over the incessant sound of his typing and clicking, \"He\\'s having the firm catered by Aspic next week and the guy who drives the truck is a struggling college student. I bet we could pay him off to get us in the truck as runners. Maybe even to be our Sentinel.\" \"What\\'s with dream criminals and picking up college students to do your bidding?\" Ariadne teased, eyeing the line she was tracing with one eye closed. \"You\\'re all easy to bribe,\" he teased back. That got her to sit up for a second and twist over her shoulder to give him a feigned dirty look. \"Am I lying?\" he snorted when she refused to reply and went back to her drawings. They\\'d forgone lunch that day, having got into a rhythm in their work that neither wanted to break. After highlighting the truck driver\\'s name and opening a tab to get his info, Arthur requested, \"Toss me some of those jamon fritos, will you?\" Without looking Ariadne grabbed from the pile she\\'d brought from the lobby snack store and launched them over her shoulder while calculating the space she\\'d need in yards between the sidewalk and the building front. The chips ended up smacking against the far left wall and falling into the seat by the window. \"You missed.\" \"33...\" she muttered under her breath as she sent another bag flying towards him. Or rather the alarm clock on his bedside table. \"It should be an even number.\" She\\'d have to go over the measurements again and make sure she was plugging the right figures into the equation. \"You\\'re aim is impeccable,\" he jested, getting up to retrieve the two bags instead of goading her on to throw more. And retracting back to his more sincere self, he opened one of the bags for her and placed it on her desk. xxxxxxx Ariadne was on the bed this time, lying on her stomach, upper body propped up at the edge and looking on to the carpet where her designs were and where Arthur was crouched in the midst of them all. The desk in her room had been moved to where it blocked the entrance to her bathroom and the chair sat on top of it, to give them more room to lay out her papers. \"My confidence in my ability to replicate this is not too high...the maze I get, but the atmosphere, the design...it seems a bit layered to the nth degree.\" \"That\\'s the beauty of it, you don\\'t have to replicate this exactly as I did.\" The Architect rolled off the side of the bed and picked up a few example sheets. \"Barcelonan architecture is all over the place because it\\'s had so many influences. Roman, Baroque, Catalan, Gothic, Modernism. Any amalgamation of those layers you can infuse will feel right to the dreamers. It\\'ll be easier than it looks.\" Arthur thought a minute. Studying over the reference photographs she\\'d used. \"Alright, I trust you. Let\\'s do a trial with the PASIV.\" \"Can you run some forging tests with me while we\\'re down there?\" xxxxxxx They stood before the outside of the courthouse, the intersection into the parking lot behind them. Ariadne stood with hands in pockets and patiently watched while Arthur raised, lowered, and shaped the building. Adding columns and gold lined windows. The outline was right but the tone was just...off. \"It doesn\\'t seem right,\" he commented to her, inviting some guidance in her area of expertise. She gave it a once over and provided him with an immediate answer, stepping up next to him, \"Your lines are too clean. Warp them a little. Think Dali.\" He did so. \"That\\'s good.\" But instead of writing it off as passable, she crossed her arms and retreated back to the edge of the street. \"Check your columns.\" Arthur found they were too pale in color and the ridges too deep. \"Too Roman. Take them out?\" \"Nah, I would leave them,\" she advised, \"just change the appearance. The column references Roman architecture in the structure itself, base the look on another influence. Baroque or...\" Arthur jogged up the steps to one of them and pushed on either side, thinning it out a great deal. Then he took his pocket knife and carved a square onto the column and peeled the square to reveal a colored tile. He hit the side of the column with his palm and tiles erupted down the entirety of the column. He then went down the line and tapped the side of each of the rest to model them the same way. \"Catalan. I like it.\" After regarding his work again, Arthur waved his hand in the air to tint the whole dream. A warmer, rusty orange blend that made the atmosphere seem hotter and truer to life. He rejoined her down at the base of the stairs, \"Anything else?\" Her eyes peered, her head tilted this way and that, and then one of her eyebrows raised. Like a miracle, the building raised ten feet and the structure took on an older, muddier, carved appeal. \"Needed a bit more Gaudi.\" Ariadne was simply amazing. Arthur and anyone he\\'d ever met, even Cobb, had to use physical motions to get their brainwaves to cooperate and change the appearance and structure of their dreams. Ariadne need only lift an eyebrow. Arthur had a sharp mind. He was intelligent and he trained himself to retain that sharpness and intelligence while he was lucid dreaming but it was natural for Ariadne. She was already in-tune with her cognitive powers. She could access the compartments of her brain used while awake, in the middle of REM sleep. Watching her work in dreams was riveting and that was an understatement. Arthur\\'s appreciation for her gift was almost too much for words. \"How do you do that?\" he said, his amazement clear. \"What?\" asked the woman, casually. Arthur gestured in front of them, \"Snap your fingers and change everything.\" Ariadne shrugged, \"You and Cobb are good teachers.\" \"That\\'s not taught,\" said Arthur, \"That\\'s pure talent...\" Ariadne modestly deflected and waved him off, \"Let\\'s take a look at the maze inside.\" In truth, not only to have Arthur\\'s approval but to have his admiration was a huge compliment. And to have Arthur voice it was another feat in itself. Not because Arthur was stingy with his compliments—he gave credit where credit was due—but because he only praised someone if he really thought they deserved it. Xxxxxxx Naturally, they spent a lot of time together. But with separate rooms and only so much prep needed for the job, they were able to have a lot of alone time too. Late afternoons and evenings they had free and usually Arthur would read, watch documentaries, or work on some files and background checks on his laptop. Ariadne would do things like watch tv, doodle, play games on her tablet, and tweak some designs. As you can see, neither could completely keep from working while not working. One particular night, close to the extraction date, Arthur felt like doing something out of routine. He\\'d eaten hotel food more meals than not and was getting tired of the menu they had to offer. So he threw on his sports jacket and decided to go see if anything on La Rambla sounded delicious. Maybe Ariadne would want to come too. As he was headed to knock on her door, the Architect emerged. Signature red jacket on, messenger bag slung over her shoulder, room key in hand. \"Hey.\" \"Hey, I was just coming to see you,\" said Arthur, sticking his hands in his pockets. Ariadne replied, \"Yeah? Did you have a question about something?\" concerned the final version of the Dreamscape she dropped off at his room a few hours ago had too many small modifications. \"Nah, I\\'m just tired of hotel food and thought I\\'d see what caught my eye in the square.\" Ariadne nodded in understanding. Enchiladas, rice, beans and soups were getting old. \"Thought I\\'d ask you to come too,\" then he added jokingly: \"unless you\\'re sick of spending time with me already.\" The Architect smirked, \"If I\\'m not already sick of you after that two months of unrelenting training, I think our partnership\\'s gonna last a while...\" Her door closed with a thud and a click and she traded the room key in her hand for the phone in her bag while they talked. \"Well, I wouldn\\'t mind some company,\" Arthur gestured to her bag, \"Did you have plans?\" Ariadne shook her head and shrugged, \"Not \\'til ten. I was just gonna go explore until then.\" They fell into step towards the elevator with arrangement understood yet unspoken. The thing about Arthur and Ariadne was the easiness they had around each other. And they\\'d had it from the very beginning. They just meshed. It was never awkward between them for Arthur to kneel next to her when she woke and carefully remove the lead from her wrist (even though she could do it for herself after a while). Never weird for them to stroll together in dreams for hours or be left in the workshop by themselves. There was no tension of any sort for them to lay next to each other to dream or to accidentally brush arms while going over her designs...but there had always been respect, admiration, and genuine interest in the other as a person. Arthur was still guarded with her, of course, he was guarded with everyone but something about Ariadne loosened him up now and then. And the more time they were spending together, the more he felt he could show pieces of himself instead of just the Point Man around her. They wouldn\\'t have called themselves \\'friends\\' after the Fischer job...maybe coworkers who gravitated towards each other out of habit (because Cobb was always throwing Ariadne at Arthur from giving her crash courses to coffee runs) but now that they were legitimate partners in crime , it was slowly feeling like they were becoming actual friends who didn\\'t mind each others\\' company outside of the occupation. Which in all honesty, was what they both hoped would gradually happen. xxxxxxx A/N: Hey guys! Thank you for reading. Please leave a review of what you think so far! Bear with me for the first few chapters, I\\'m still getting back in the groove and setting everything up. We\\'ll have a some action in the next chapter as the job takes a turn they didn\\'t expect and we\\'ll introduce a little more Cobb drama. I\\'m playing a longer game with Arthur and Ariadne in this one which I promise is going to get so good and tense...review and share with others who love A/A! Thanks :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Reverse After eating dinner somewhere off the main stretch, the two felt like walking it off to make room for dessert. So they strolled and explored and commented on the different storefronts and handmade souvenirs. Arthur bought a small stuffed cartoon bull for James and Ariadne helped him pick out a hand-beaded bracelet for Phillipa. For the longest time while they were separated, Dom picked up little things for the kids in each country he worked in and sent them. The kids had quite a collection but Arthur figured he\\'d continue the tradition. He was their \"uncle\" after all and didn\\'t want them to forget him after he stopped coming around as often. Ariadne was doing something of the sort as well, instead, making a book of postcards and collecting stickers for them because it was easier to amass and keep in her bag until her next visit. \"So how do you like Spain? Better than France?\" They\\'d just walked out of a boutique where she\\'d procured a new scarf. Black, yellow, and red roses. She slipped her wrist through the handle of the bag, \"It\\'s beautiful...\" Ariadne regarded a uniquely shaped building with brightly colored tile and doors. It was interesting from a design standpoint because analyzing that sort of thing was ingrained into her through schooling, but it wasn\\'t her personal taste. \"But not better than France. Rien ne bat le Francais.\" Arthur snickered to himself, \"You are such a Francophile.\" \"What do you expect?\" she asked without needing an answer. In addition to living in France, Ariadne was part French on her father\\'s side. Only something like a fourth but still enough heritage to instill a lifelong admiration for the culture. She was also part American (of course), plus Welsh and Scottish but very minuscule amounts. All this had shown up in the background check Arthur had done on her before Fischer, which was not extensive, contrary to (Eames\\') belief. All Arthur was concerned with (and all he had time to waste on) was basic information such as immediate family members, current education, and warrants or arrests (which there were none of). Everything else, he respected her privacy about until she gave him reason not to. \"What about you?\" inquired the woman. \"What am I?\" clarified Arthur as they stopped at an intersection and waited for the walk sign. Ariadne nodded. He saw no harm in informing: \"A little Italian, a little Jewish, trace amounts of German.\" She smirked, \"I can see that.\" None of this showed up in Ariadne\\'s background check on Arthur...because she hadn\\'t done one. Arthur had taught her the process; how to pry \\'confidential\\' content from \\'restricted access\\' sites, how to copy and paste information that was formatted against the action, what to search for and where to search. Arthur had also mentioned in passing that there was a large pool of information on his formative years, everything from birth to when he went \\'ghost\\'. Ariadne hadn\\'t yet investigated into Arthur\\'s past because she preferred to learn it when he was ready to share about it. That, and she didn\\'t know his full name. Arthur casually watched the timer on the light tick down and added, \"I\\'ve also always felt a bit Japanese.\" That wasn\\'t part of her question but the answer slipped out of him nonetheless. Ariadne was easy to talk to. Evidently. Because he told her things he didn\\'t mean to all the time. She wasn\\'t judgmental, she didn\\'t want to know things about him so she could tease or blackmail. She was just genuinely interested. \" Felt Japanese?\" Ariadne\\'s eyebrows raised. He shrugged, \"Yeah. We lived in Osaka for a while while my dad was stationed in Japan.\" There was a lot to unpack from that information and so many questions springing up from it. His dad was in the military? Arthur was a military brat? Where all had he lived? Did Arthur speak Japanese? \"How long were you there?\" she finally decided on. \"We moved there when I was seven...\"he thought back, \"and left...when I was thirteen? No, we moved to San Diego during my first year of high school. So fourteen. Seven years sounds about right.\" \"That\\'s so cool,\" Ariadne remarked before they finally crossed the street. \"I did a lot of growing up there. I suppose that\\'s why I feel that way.\" They came upon a couple of men playing acoustic guitar on the corner and both dropped a few dollars into one of their guitar cases as they kept going. \"No, that makes sense,\" she compared herself, \"Like, I guess I feel Greek because of my name. And because that\\'s where my grandparents retired and I spent a lot of summers there with family.\" Arthur followed her as she broke off the main road into a side street. It wasn\\'t until they were further down did Arthur catch the scents of cinnamon and toasted almonds and realize Ariadne was tracking down the source. \"I assume you\\'ve been to Crete, then?\" Surely, Ariadne had been to the infamous island from her namesake\\'s myth. Ariadne turned and walked backwards so she could reply, \"That\\'s where they live . That\\'swhy I have my name. My parents thought it\\'d be clever.\" \"It is,\" agreed Arthur as they found the street cart and meshed into the line. It was a sweet and spicy flavored nut mix, mixed with caramel, and cooled on a stick. Arthur figured this was an in-between snack since she had adamantly stated she wanted a churro before the day was over and since Arthur took up a separate mission to introduce her to flan. \"Were you the first grand baby?\" \"Third. And the trendsetter apparently.\" They moved up. \"Before me, there was Matthew and Leah. And after me, there was Athena, Ajax and Castor.\" Arthur remembered seeing that Ariadne\\'s younger brother and sister were named Brannon and Madison. Pretty far departures from the uniqueness of \\'Ariadne\\'. Normally parents were more balanced. Either all the children had unique names or traditional names or each child a mix of the two...Either way they usually preferred and stuck to the same flavor for all the kids. It prompted him to think aloud, \"Why don\\'t your siblings have names like that?\" Ariadne opened her mouth. Then paused and thought for a second, face changing from pleasant to schooled. Arthur wondered if he touched a nerve— \"My stepdad didn\\'t like the trend.\" She exchanged coins for the snack and let Arthur pick off some nuts for himself. They wandered over to the bench by the plaza fountain and sat there to rest their legs and decide where they wanted to check out next. \"I didn\\'t know your parents were divorced. Recent?\" Ariadne\\'s head shook, \"When I was seven.\" Her mouth made a flat line, \" She left him. In case you were wondering.\" Arthur grimaced, \"I\\'m sorry.\" He could be sympathetic but he couldn\\'t quite understand, even as logical and matter-of-fact as he usually was. The statistics didn\\'t lie and he didn\\'t argue with them but Arthur had grown up with two parents who were madly in love. Yeah, life was rough moving around every few years, he and his brother had to say a lot of goodbyes and help their mom out immensely while their dad was deployed but his mother was always faithful. His dad too. And when they were together, they were happiest. And that made the boys happy. In fact, one of the biggest reasons Arthur was so chivalrous was because of growing up watching how his father treated his mother. It didn\\'t make Arthur a \\'romantic\\' man, necessarily. He wasn\\'t looking for romance. He didn\\'t aim to achieve it or have a desire to devote so much time to it at this point in his life. But if the time ever came where he miraculously felt that way about someone, he knew what his parents had was what he should aspire to. \"It is what it is, right?\" Whereas observing Arthur\\'s star-crossed parents didn\\'t encourage his inclination (or lack of) to fall in love, observing Ariadne\\'s divorced parents did nothing to deter her from being ambitious about it. \"Some people are just incapable of fighting for one person their whole life...\" Arthur tilted his head. He neither fully agreed or disagreed. He supposed it was circumstantial. \"And some people can never love anyone else,\" she added. \"My dad never stopped loving her. Even after she cheated and left...he loved her until he died.\" \"Died?\" Arthur\\'s face softened. He might\\'ve regretted dredging all of this up from the past for her. Ariadne swallowed a little harder and her voice got a little quieter. \"That was recent. He was in a car accident the summer I left for college.\" Arthur sighed. Fully upset with himself and wholly regretting asking the prying questions that led to this. As innocent as he intended them. \"I\\'m so sorry.\" The Architect shook her head at him and offered a close-lipped smile. Not one of joy but at least one of peace and what contentment she could find in it. \"It\\'s ok. It helped me finally decide on what college I wanted to go to. France made me feel closer to him.\" And if Arthur couldn\\'t feel any worse, he did just then. \"When I called you a francophile earlier...I apologize.\" \"You were joking,\" then a more gleeful smile lit up her face and put him at ease, \"Besides, I totally am.\" The Point Man picked off some more nuts after she offered and popped a few into his mouth, \"This is why I don\\'t do personal conversation often. It gets prickly and people get depressed.\" Rolling her eyes at him, Ariadne pulled her feet up to the bench so that her knees were in front of her. \"I know how you could cheer me up...\" \"I\\'m not taking my shirt off.\" He deadpanned. That got her laughing. And that made him feel less guilty. \"Okay, what?\" \"Tell me something I don\\'t know about your family. Something happy though.\" Arthur contemplated...mulled it over... \"We took a vacation to the Grand Canyon once—\" Ariadne ended up dragging Arthur with her to the local Flamenco and Tapas place (her previous made plans at 10pm). They served flan, so Arthur\\'s mission was complete. Ariadne was very much a texture-sensitive person so the thought of something creamy having a jelly looking substance turned her off to it but she was proved wrong. It was actually very tasty. Not her first pick for dessert but she\\'d eat it again. They stayed out until just past midnight, then crashed in their respective rooms; bellies full and minds refreshed for another day of work. xxxxxxx Before they knew it, they day of the job was upon them. He wanted to curse Ariadne for putting so many large windows in the courtroom but to be fair, she was trying to liken it to to the real courthouse so the mark would feel comfortable. On top of that, the hypocrite was supposed to be against Dreamshare. A protester. He didn\\'t even believe it worked...but Arthur supposed none of that meant he wouldn\\'t take the precaution just in case. He should\\'ve double-checked. It was like Fischer all over again. Glass was shattering all around as Arthur hastened to crack the safe and there was a deafening pounding at the barricaded doors as if the projections had knocked down one of the columns and was using it as a ram. \"Ariadne?\" he called out for his earpiece to pick up. Arthur grabbed the file before the safe was blown out of the wall from the other side. He could hear the steps of all the projections closing in. He shoved the file in his inside jacket pocket and disappeared through a trap door under the witness stand. \"Ariadne, come in.\" The tunnel was very narrow and tight, designed that way so that a horde of projections could not follow him through fast enough. They\\'d be broken up into single file and easier to both evade and defend against. He only had room to crawl, his arms touching the borders on both sides and feet making scuff sounds against the cement. Once he felt a safe distance away from the tunnel opening and could no longer hear his pursuers, he stopped to read the extraction information. He did his best to commit the five pages to memory using techniques he\\'d learned from Miles. He had yet to share them with Ariadne but would once she started taking on more extraction roles. Speaking of, she hadn\\'t responded yet. Perhaps she was hiding somewhere herself and couldn\\'t respond without giving herself away. Even so, he needed to inform her, \"Listen, the mark\\'s sub-security is militarized. Be prepared to hold them off. I\\'ll come meet you.\" xxxxxxx Ariadne emerged from behind an alcove with an ATM machine and looked around wearily. Wherever Ariadne was it was crystal clear. The projections hadn\\'t caught on to anything yet and passed her with polite smiles, minding their own business. They obviously hadn\\'t noticed that the hand on her waistband was fingering a gun. She walked quickly with her head bowed, staring at the pavement, anticipating the sky to open up with bullets at any second. It was a miracle but she met up with Arthur at the steps of the courthouse; He was jogging out and the both of them turned the corner and crossed the street as if of one mind. \"I got it.\" \"Sweet,\" Ariadne commented while looking over her shoulder. \"It\\'s too calm. Too easy. It\\'s freaking me out.\" Coincidentally (or not), as she mentioned her unease, a number of projections halted and looked at them through the window of a cafe as they passed. Arthur wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her away, \"It\\'s okay. Just keep yourself calm. It\\'ll keep them calm.\" The Point pulled his gun from his holster. A little to shakily for Ariadne\\'s comfort. He was freaking out too... \"I ruffled them up in the courthouse,\" he said, \"We just have to lay low.\" Something wasn\\'t right about these projections. They were too passive, even for someone whose mind wasn\\'t militarized. Were they not concerned because there weren\\'t any real secrets to gather? Did Cortes and Torres set them up with a fake job? \"You got the information, did you read it?\" \"It\\'s in an enclosed case.\" He pulled it from his jacket pocket and showed her. Instead of a file it was a notebook encased in glass with a mechanized lock and keypad on the side. Ariadne peered at it. Feeling a sense of familiarity as she studied it. \"I need something to break the code. Where were you before you met up with me?\" \"The ATM.\" \"Let\\'s go there.\" xxxxxxx Arthur came out a small vent in the building to the far right of the courthouse. He gingerly stood up into the side street and pressed his back against the building as the projections finally busted through the courthouse doors and charged inside with guns and random objects they held as clubs. It was only a matter of time before they followed the evidence of his movement and found the tunnel. All the projections and security were now pouring through the streets, yelling, converging on the courthouse. That left the storefronts empty. Arthur slipped inside one of the doors and made his path down the street in the opposite direction. There was a camouflaged sliding door in each wall that allowed Arthur to pass through the whole block of storefronts without once leaving the facade. \"Ariadne, what\\'s your status?\" Arthur couldn\\'t begin to explain his frustration with her lack of communication. That is, until he came up to their meeting point and there was no one there. Then he started to worry. Strangely, in the midst of this abandoned area of the dream, there was an idling taxi across the street. That must\\'ve been her. So Arthur ran across and opened the back passenger side door to find— Ariadne. Xxxxxxx Arthur was walking beside her but his steps were hesitant by a millisecond. As if he was unsure where they were headed...but...Arthur had memorized his level...Again, simultaneous with her suspicion, projections slowed their paces and started noticing them. Arthur grabbed Ariadne\\'s wrist and pulled her along as his gait accelerated. \"It\\'s ok. Calm down,\" he almost demanded of her, his thumb rubbing her wrist too roughly for her taste. Too roughly for his personality. Something clicked for the Architect, then. And she stopped in her tracks forcing Arthur to do the same. \"Why does it matter to the projections if I\\'m calm?\" Arthur scoffed and tugged at her, \"We don\\'t have time, Ariadne.\" Ariadne narrowed her eyes, \"Unless I\\'m the dreamer.\" The Point Man\\'s grip on her wrist tightened to a painful degree as his face darkened. xxxxxxx He\\'d finally found Ariadne—Laid out in the backseat of a taxi with a needle in her arm and her earpiece smashed in the floorboard. Before Arthur could begin to process what that deviation from their plan meant, a man in the driver\\'s seat turned and shot at Arthur, who responded by ducking and cocking his gun. The man—or sub-security projection— made the mistake of thinking he could get away. And it was the moment he turned to put the car in drive that Arthur put a bullet through his head and climbed in with the Architect. She looked unharmed other than a bad bruise on the right side of her forehead, a bleeding cut on her eyebrow, and most obvious—unconscious and connected to a PASIV—which made no sense unless there was someone else connected to it too. Sure enough, the other tube lead to Torres (the mark) sitting up in front passenger seat. Not a mark on him. So, from the looks of it, he\\'d attacked Ariadne and took her a level down. Probably to perform a shoddy reverse extraction and find out who sent them. If Torres found out Cortes had hired them and had the extraction info as proof, Cortes could be disbarred and they\\'d have one powerful and angry man after their heads. Arthur couldn\\'t disconnect either one of them without some detriment. There was a certain procedure to follow but it depended on who was the dreamer. Arthur assumed it was Ariadne but he couldn\\'t be positive. Instead, he decided to alert her to the strangeness of the dream from above in case she hadn\\'t noticed already. Arthur took her shoulders and gave her a shake. xxxxxxx An earthquake shook the city and in the distance some buildings collapsed in on themselves creating a cloud of dust. The Point Man or whoever was wearing his face pulled her entire body into his hold. If that wasn\\'t enough to tip her off, nothing would be. The shaking didn\\'t stop, in fact it became more violent and rapid. Then, the sky thundered. Except it thundered with a noise that sounded like \\'R\\'. Ariadne grabbed the arms that encircled her and held them close as she pushed both of them backward and rammed the guy into the building exterior as hard as she could. It knocked his breath out, making him release her, which gave her the opportunity to turn and punch him. Except even in the state he was in, struggling to breathe, he ducked and her fist collided with cement. The Architect instinctively held her fist and hissed at the pain. Her opponent used that moment of weakness to tackle her to the ground. The sound of \\'R\\' turned into an \\'E\\'. He may have been bigger than her and he may have been wearing Arthur\\'s strong body but he didn\\'t know how to use it as well as Arthur did. He was clumsy with it. She fought to sit up. Baiting him. Setting them up for her next move. The man took the bait and threw all of Arthur\\'s weight into slamming her back to the ground which she used the momentum of to roll them both backward, over her shoulder, so that she landed on top of him. His look of shock showed how little he expected her to be able to defend herself. The \\'E\\' became \\'AD.\\' Ariadne threw another punch and this one landed, made his nose bleed. In a hurry, she pushed herself off of him and stood pulling her gun. Her opponent scrambled to his feet too and pointed his own firearm in her direction, \"Don\\'t!\" He warned. His real accent cracking through Arthur\\'s voice. \"If you shoot me, I\\'ll shoot you!\" The man shook his gun and threatened again, \"I\\'ll shoot you!\" The sound of \\'AD\\' booming through the sky melded into what sounded like the word \\'KNEE\\'. Ariadne just smirked at the man, \"Amateur.\" She brought the gun to her own temple and pulled the trigger. Xxxxxxx \"Ariadne!\" The real Arthur was speeding up the ramps of the parking garage to the roof, wheels screeching, brakes squealing. The projections had gone berserk and were everywhere now; throwing rocks through windows, setting fires, shooting at everything that moved. Sub-security was after him in police cars too, blaring their sirens as loud as they would go. They were almost to the top... and Ariadne shot up, heaving, and grabbed the handle of the roof before Arthur turned the curve and thrust them sideways into the concrete barrier. \"Good. You\\'re up,\" Arthur grit through his teeth. Ariadne pulled her needle out as Arthur checked Torres\\' pulse and remaining dream time. They had a minute and eight seconds if Torres didn\\'t shoot himself awake first. Ariadne was already out of the car running towards the edge of the roof. Arthur was right behind her as the police cars flew up the ramp towards them. \"You\\'ll never believe—\" Ariadne said on the ledge. Arthur cut her off, running towards her, \"Tell me in a minute,\" and dove into her, the both of them hurdling off the garage. Xxxxxxx Arthur jolted up first. Ariadne\\'s body jumped next to him and they both eased into a rhythm. Arthur unhooked carefully and coolly whereas Ariadne ripped the lead from her wrist, coiled her tube up, threw it in the PASIV and checked the timer. \"Three minutes real-world.\" On their last job they\\'d used a slower acting Somnacin so the clean-up after hadn\\'t felt time sensitive. And she hadn\\'t even had to worry about it during the Fischer job. When she woke up, it was taken care of. This being the first time she had to polish the extraction scene and get away undetected within moments...she felt rushed. And ten times more nervous. \"Lean him forward onto the desk like he fell asleep,\" instructed Arthur, removing the needle from the mark and packing up the PASIV. Ariadne folded Torres\\' arms in and rested his head on them ( a little clumsily) then replaced the drugged bottle of water with a new one, partly poured out as if he\\'d drank some. They hurried to slip the catering uniform jackets on. And with that, the both of them left the room like they were never there. The PASIV and Ariadne\\'s backpack sat on the bottom rack of the cart that they rolled out, covered by a tablecloth and several metal dishes. The secretary was never the wiser. In fact, she grinned and waved as they left (Ariadne made sure to leave her a second piece of cake). When they got back outside, it was simple. They dropped the cart and uniforms off at the catering van, slipped the remainder of cash owed to the driver, and got into the SUV they rented that morning. \"I can\\'t believe we pulled it off,\" Ariadne exclaimed, putting her seat belt on. Arthur asked her to dial Mateo\\'s number for him and sped off. Xxxxxxx Ariadne was freshly showered and sifting through tv channels when there was an abrupt knock on the door. She shrugged her Universite t-shirt on over her sports bra and padded over to open the door. \"Can I come in for a sec?\" Arthur asked, clad in his white undershirt but still wearing his suit pants and dress shoes. \"What\\'s up?\" she asked back, stepping aside for him to enter. He ran a hand through his hair. The gel was breaking up and hard strands were falling free but his face seem refreshed. He must\\'ve taken a nap when they got back. \"We\\'re clear with Cortes. Payment was just wired in.\" She was handed several visa gift cards held together by a rubber band. \"So what happened down there?\" He pulled out her desk chair and swirled it around to sit facing her. \"Did he try a reverse extraction?\" Ariadne wasn\\'t sure what defined a reverse extraction but it very much seemed like Torres was trying to get information out of her instead of the other way around so she answered, \"I think so.\" He asked her to recall the events. \"I was headed to meet you and the projections just started swarming. So I ducked into the alley by the launderers...and got whacked on the head, I think. Next thing I knew, I was walking back towards the courthouse and you met up with me except it was actually Torres.\" \"So he\\'s been taught to forge...that\\'s interesting. Must\\'ve been trained by a forger instead of an extractor. Explains why his sub-training was chaotic and clunky.\" Ariadne nodded and sat on the edge of her bed, \"They just thrashed around and used brute force instead of an organized take down.\" They both enjoyed examining the situation and figuring out in retrospect why the dream was the way it was. It was fascinating to make sense of it. \"When did you clue in that it wasn\\'t me?\" Ariadne laughed, \"He didn\\'t seem to know what he was talking about.\" Arthur joined in, amused. \"That would do it.\" \"Plus he was really rough,\" added the Architect. Arthur frowned at that but didn\\'t say anything. At least his partner was confident he\\'d never treat her roughly but he wasn\\'t pleased someone with his face had. \"We need to train your subconscious. You\\'ll have a quicker, more automatic, response the next time someone attempts. I\\'ll enlist Eames to help with that when we meet up in Lisbon.\" \" Eames\\' help? But he\\'s a forger...wouldn\\'t I be as bad off as Torres?\" \"He got his rep from extracting actually, he just prefers to focus on forging.\" He smirked at her knowingly, \"Less responsibility.\" Arthur assured her, \"You can\\'t be trained by someone close to you and we work within each others\\' dreams every day. Eames is the next best thing.\" By chance, he glanced at her wrist and noticed a small scab and purplish bruise. His train of thought switched tracks; No way an injury in the dream could be sustained in reality so he assumed, \"Did you rip the lead out?\" Immediately, the Architect knew what he was talking about. She lifted her hand and looked at it, shrugging unaffected. \"Yeah, I panicked. Just woke up and went full throttle.\" \"You don\\'t want to do that often.\" She didn\\'t expect Arthur would get out of his seat and kneel in front of her to check it out but he did. He ran his thumb over it and took note of how much pressure he could apply without her yelping. Which wasn\\'t any pressure at all. \"You blew a vein.\" He didn\\'t seem shaken by it though so it evidently wasn\\'t life threatening. Arthur pulled out an alcohol pad, \"Here wipe it down for me.\" \"You keep alcohol pads in your pockets?\" she almost chuckled. But he was already headed for the door, \"I\\'ll be back with an ice pack.\" ","Summary":" Matter[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: PASIV Whisperer \"I was afraid you\\'d say that...\" The disappointmen"},{"Movie":"Inception","Title":"The Hand of Fate","Author":"deinvati","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898117","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: This is a work in progress, but I have about this much more already written. I will try to get this out as soon as possible so you\\'re not waiting! Thanks for reading! \"What are you doing here?!\" Arthur squeaked, helping Eames in the window anyway. His bulky frame squeezed through the opening and he tumbled on the floor like the world\\'s worst circus clown, springing to his feet with a whispered, \"Tada!\" that made Arthur want to giggle, but he settled for grinning madly instead. \"Eames,\" he whispered, pushing at his shoulders, \"what are you doing here? You\\'re going to get us both killed.\" \"I had to see you,\" Eames whispered back, ducking under Arthur\\'s defenses for a quick peck at his lips. \"You didn\\'t think I would just settle for a hug and a handshake at the airport, did you?\" Arthur kissed him back, almost without meaning to, before he could get his lips under control. \"You can\\'t, mmmph, be here.\" Eames kissed him again, grinning, the crooked smile of someone who knew they were going to get away with it. \"Mmph! Stop it! We\\'re going to get, mmph, in so much, mmph, Stop it!\" He pushed against Eames\\' shoulders half-heartedly, as Eames wrapped his strong arms around Arthur\\'s too skinny, too pale body and kissed him for all he was worth. \"God, you taste, mmph, so, mmph, good…\" Eames kissed Arthur\\'s mouth, hands under the thin t-shirt he wore, taking down Arthur\\'s defenses like they were made of tissue and half-hearted attempts at parentally imposed morality. \"What is that?\" Arthur asked, dazed when he finally pulled back for breath. Eames waggled his eyebrows. \"Coconut.\" Arthur melted, as Eames had known he would, as his heart warmed and he realized perfect happiness could exist on the same plane as perfect sadness. Eames was flying back to England tomorrow. His parents had never promised how long they were going to stay in the States, and Eames, it turns out, had known it would end someday, but Arthur hadn\\'t. So when Eames had asked him out, blatantly leaning against his locker like it was easy, like it was okay, like it was something people did, Arthur had jumped in with both feet and his whole heart, like the teenaged dumbass he was. And why not? He\\'d already figured he would be alone forever in his high school of closeted gays and homophobic straights. Finding Eames was already a one in a million chance— a gorgeous guy the universe had to fucking import in order for his dreams to become a reality— and he knew better than to think this was a coincidence. So he\\'d said yes, calm and sure in a way he hadn\\'t known he could feel a moment before, and he wasn\\'t stupid enough to flaunt their relationship at the school, but his parents knew, and Eames\\' parents knew, and they had after school and weekends, and Arthur was in love. He was head over heels, heart skipping out of his chest, butterflies in his stomach, stupid smile in study hall, in love. Eames was… God, he was everything. Arthur read novels about people in love, smirking to himself, \"I know what you\\'re feeling. Shakespeare? Austen? Basically written for us.\" He was so stupid. Eames kissed his way down Arthur\\'s neck, his hands roving under Arthur\\'s shirt, and Arthur realized what this was. This was it. This was his last chance to taste that before it was gone. He stepped back, looked Eames in the eye, and lifted the hem of his shirt. He pulled it off one-handed, the other hand hooking Eames\\' belt loop to keep him there. Then he tugged at Eames\\' shirt. Eames raised his eyebrows, not really in surprise, but in question. \"You sure?\" he asked, hands already at his clothing. \"Yeah,\" Arthur answered, knowing he really was sure. \"Yeah, I am. I want this.\" \"Yeah?\" Eames said, an excited grin bursting out of him that Arthur couldn\\'t help but mirror. He felt like punching the air. Instead, he turned and thumbed the lock on his bedroom door. \"Yeah. We\\'ve got to be quiet though.\" \"Course,\" Eames nodded, like that went without question, and maybe it did, but it wouldn\\'t be the last time Arthur said it that night. They kissed and disrobed clumsily, unhurriedly, excitedly. They\\'d talked about this, theoretically, hypothetically, hopefully, but they\\'d never done anything more than mutual masturbation, and Arthur knew it was stupid, but he felt like this one act, this final step, would make it real. It would make it official, something no one could take away from them. Something they couldn\\'t undo. Something that would make it last. He was right and he was wrong. It turned out two 17-year-old virgins having clumsy first-time sex in a twin bed wasn\\'t the stuff of pornos, but it was still soft and tender, and achingly sweet. Eames loved him— he whispered it fervently into Arthur\\'s sweaty temple, and Arthur loved him back, with his whole being. And it was good. It was so, so, good; easy orgasms that they felt no shame for, taking the edge off so they could focus on being careful, considerate, patient. Just like they\\'d talked about wanting when that day came. They didn\\'t know what they were doing, but it was okay because they didn\\'t know together. They figured it out. It wasn\\'t rocket science, and Arthur was in love. He pushed the morning and the future out of his mind, knowing this was the right decision, taking it with both hands. Eames was too much, too good, too perfect to be anything but preordained. Eames stroked his body like it was precious, like it wasn\\'t too small or too bony, like Eames knew too that this was meant to be. They cuddled and whispered and smiled at each other, and Arthur\\'s heart ached from being too full. His eyes filled from trying to contain it all, and he was in love. There would never be another person like this. He was right, and he was wrong. Because Eames left. The next day, they exchanged chaste hugs and several waves, the reality not quite sinking in, and Arthur and his parents saw them off at the airport, watching Eames lug his backpack and his boarding pass, with Arthur\\'s sweatshirt around his waist. And then he was gone. It didn\\'t feel real, but it really, really was. They called and texted at first, but then those got fewer and more infrequent, and suddenly it had been weeks since he\\'d heard from Eames and realized he had nothing to tell him. And then Arthur, straight-A student, graduated high school and decided he hated fate. The feeling started to solidify as he sat on a folding chair, its legs sinking into the football field and the PA system scratchy no matter what year it was. The girl next to him was yawning and concentrating on nothing but adjusting her cap and how her hair looked, and the guy behind him was bragging, loudly, about how \\'fucked up\\' he was getting that night. So this is it, he thought. Actually trying, actually giving a shit about how I did in school, and it leads up to this: sitting in the same chairs, listening to the same speech as the rest of these assholes. And Arthur should have walked off the damn field right then, tossing his cap in the air behind him as he left, stripping out of his gown and leaving it in a crumpled pile on the 20-yard line. But he didn\\'t. He shook the principal\\'s hand, smiled for his mom, and moved his tassel. Because that was what you did. But sitting in the garage later, a sheet cake wilting with the heat and a basket of cards on the folding table beside him, he decided he was done. He missed Eames. It was over, and Arthur had finally acknowledged the truth that he would never see him again, and everything from here on out in his life would be different because A) Eames had been his, and B) he didn\\'t get to keep him. Well, fuck that. If the universe was spinning at exactly the right pace to put Eames into his life, well, then fuck everything all to hell if the same universe decided it was a \"learning experience\" or some shit to take him back out. It was a shitty system, and he was damned if he was going to support it. Fuck fate. Fuck it in its stupid ass. He was done following the path fate had laid out for him. He picked up the acceptance letter his mother had placed proudly on the table in the corner, along with his 2nd-grade tee ball trophy and his taekwondo belts, and folded it carefully. Then he walked out of his own graduation party. Good luck keeping up, fate. His parents blew a gasket when they found out what he\\'d done, and they called the recruiting office to see if they could, somehow, veto his decision to enlist. But he was 18, a legal adult in his state, and as the US Army told his parents, in much nicer terms, there was fuck-all they could do to stop him if that\\'s what he wanted. His family were academics through and through. There was very little history of military service his parents could point to and be proud of, and Arthur knew he could still do that for them, at least. He wasn\\'t throwing anything away, he assured them, and he wasn\\'t going to be killed, and he wasn\\'t going to go away and come back a different person. None of which he knew for sure, but all of which he knew was the right thing to say. At the end of the day, he was still a straight-A student, and he would always actually try and actually give a shit, no matter what he was doing. He just decided he wanted a say in what it was he was doing for a while. Boot camp didn\\'t break him, and he managed to put on some wiry muscle even though he still looked like a baby— even in his dress whites. The short hair made his ears stick out more, but he loved everything else. He loved the early morning drills and the late night exercises, and the predictability of routine. Until he didn\\'t. After boot camp, it was just a job. He did what he was asked to do, and he did it well. He felt confident, ready, calm. And he was done waiting. He got a day of R&R;, had too much to drink at a bar off base and blew a nameless guy in the bathroom. He wanted there to be at least one more, anyone\\'s, to take the sting out of it. Eames was just a person. It was puppy love which had built him up and it was unrealistic to measure every person he\\'d ever date against this unobtainable standard. Better to suck a dick, let someone suck him, let someone fuck him, and pave the way for someone real. Someone solid and obtainable. He didn\\'t look for anyone, exactly. He just kept taking whatever left turn happened to appear, selecting whichever option would fuck fate up more. \\'Accept the unexpected\\' was his personal motto, although he only ever said it in his head, and he kept his head down. \"Arthur,\" called Patrick, flinging a Playboy on his neatly made bunk. \"You look like you could use a round with Miss April.\" He grinned at Patrick, just for the joy of not letting him get under his skin. \"Thanks, I\\'m all set,\" he said, tossing it back. \"I\\'ve got a vivid imagination.\" Patrick smirked. \"Oh yeah? Whooo, Arthur, my man, I didn\\'t think you had it in you.\" He rose from his bunk and sauntered over, making sure he had the attention of the rest of the guys in the tent. If Patrick was anything, it was a prima donna, and he loved to be the one calling the shots. Arthur hated him, just a little, but only because he was the antithesis of everything Arthur liked in a person. \"Tell us more!\" Patrick crowed. \"Gather round, boys, it\\'s story time.\" Arthur placed the last folded t-shirt in his footlocker and closed the lid. He gave Patrick a once-over, too tight shirt stretched around his biceps, fatigue bottoms slung low on his hips. He leaned close to Patrick\\'s ear, turned so the attentive audience couldn\\'t see the graze of his lips on Patrick\\'s earlobe and could only see the hard swallow Patrick gave. \"I only give private storytimes,\" Arthur murmured in his ear, his voice a low rumble. \"But I\\'m a very, very good storyteller. Behind the Mess at 2100.\" Then Arthur walked away, not looking back, not giving a shit what Patrick would do. Fate could watch him cross the finish line from the starting blocks. He let Patrick fuck him and refused to think about Eames. \"Oh, my God,\" Patrick breathed, his belt clanging like an idiot. \"I\\'ve never… I\\'m not… oh, God, that feels…\" \"Patrick,\" Arthur snapped, \"shut up and fuck me, or I\\'ll find someone who will.\" And with that, Patrick came with a whimper, and Arthur rolled his eyes. He grabbed Patrick\\'s hand and showed him the common courtesy expectation of the Reach Around, and after that, it was easier. He took to strolling past the mess hall after his shift, and sometimes Patrick would be waiting, sometimes Brian, occasionally Jimmy, who would trade messy hand jobs with a \"thanks for the assist, bro,\" like they were two straight guys just helping each other out. Jimmy made Arthur laugh, and they actually ate together from time to time too. For a couple of years, it was alright. He went through a dry spell after the night he strolled past and saw Brian and Patrick kissing, though, something he\\'d never done with either of them, and that was alright too. They\\'d be good together. Then there were random guys, men, bars and hotels, and Arthur convinced himself that the time and buffer had made him forget. The first time he heard about Project Somnacin, spoken of in whispered tones, he wasn\\'t really interested, but if it had been an opportunity that had fallen in his lap, he\\'d have shaken his head and run the other way. As it was, he stopped hearing about it, and then there was a firearm discharge on base, and then it was all anyone could talk about. Rumors were everywhere, from someone trying to shoot somebody, to someone actually managing to shoot themselves, to government conspiracy theories about the project itself. None of the rumors were good. A sane person would have stayed as far away as they could. So Arthur, naturally, started inquiring. When he finally got the assignment to the project, it didn\\'t feel like fate. It felt like a hard-won battle and a bloody finish, but he grinned with satisfaction. He called his parents that night. \"Hey, Mom,\" he said into the handpiece, turning away from the guy in the cubicle next to him crooning something into the phone. He propped his heavy head on his fist and let his eyes droop closed, a warm sense of security settling over him as he listened to her talk about Mrs. Miller next door, who had been stealing her tulips , if you can believe it, just digging them up and moving them to her own yard, and how his cousin Megan was pregnant from that bearded guy at Christmas, and on and on. He listened and nodded even though she couldn\\'t see him, mmhmm-ing where appropriate and patted himself on the back for how it had turned out. It was definitely not where his senior class had pictured him, and not where he\\'d pictured himself. Then, in the middle of his mother\\'s story about their weekend grocery shopping, he smelled it. He perked up in his chair, glancing around, but nothing had changed. The same soldier sitting next to him, the same tone of his mom in his ear, but over everything, a breeze. And the scent of— \" Coconut .\" Arthur stood up, phone pressed hard to his ear, eyebrows drawing together. \"Mom.\" His mother stopped talking, sounding concerned. \"Yes, honey? What is it?\" \"Why haven\\'t you asked me why I\\'m calling?\" \"Well, I just figured you\\'d tell me when you were ready, Arthur.\" \"What\\'s going on?\" Arthur said, frowning heavily and looking at everything. \"Who is this?\" It was a stupid question, one he hadn\\'t really meant to say out loud because that was definitely his mother\\'s voice. But as soon as it was out of his mouth, the line went dead, and everything around him froze. The people, the sound, even the air. \"Excellent work, son,\" came the voice behind him. \"Most people don\\'t realize something was wrong until they wake up.\" His new CO was strolling in behind him, and Arthur couldn\\'t place a source, but he could still smell it. Sickeningly sweet, cloying, choking him. The room started to spin, his head started to ache, and he fell to his knees, blacking out on the way down. He blinked awake in the same room where he\\'d laid down on the military issued cot, IV in his arm and a soldier in a surgical mask still standing over him, jotting things on a clipboard. She nodded at him as he struggled to sit, his CO next to him sitting up too. \"Nice work, soldier,\" the older man said, his voice cool and clinical. \"Thank you, sir,\" Arthur said, clearing his too-dry throat, trying to keep his lunch in his stomach. \"What did I do?\" That night, Arthur lay on his side and jerked himself slowly, not caring if he came, just squeezing his eyes shut and remembering Eames\\' hands, his lips, his voice whispering his adoration into Arthur\\'s spine. Because, of course, he hadn\\'t forgotten a thing. To do so would be a betrayal, to his younger self, whom he hated and loved and wanted to be and wanted to bury, and to Eames, who had been so much a part of that younger self, a personification of the good parts of him, and a comfort for the bad. Arthur touched himself and remembered. Dreaming was hard work, and he was a straight-A soldier too, and he sat through more lecture time than he did dream time, learning what others knew and following orders to the letter. Eventually, Arthur was the one people were coming to for help, with questions, with possibilities. He kept his head down and made friends with the tech guys who helped with the machine. He learned how to clean it, how to repair it, and eventually, how to build it. He stored it all in his head, the way they taught him, and then stored it somewhere else, a way they didn\\'t teach him. He taught himself everything there was to know about that machine, until he knew it better than his rifle, than his hands, than his own thoughts. There was no turning back from the path he\\'d chosen, but he was fairly sure fate had fucked off about three dreamshare COs ago. No one knew where this boat was headed. Except, apparently, for the general who was defunding the project. Too much risk, too many deaths, and not enough successful application in a timely manner. The official position was that they were \"tabling\" it, for a more applicable time, but Arthur was done. He had been through too much, dreamt too deep, and pushed too far to table anything. He gritted his teeth and took the next left. Not re-enlisting made his mother cry happy tears and his father clap him on the back. It made Arthur\\'s stomach hurt and it made him drift around for three months, getting two jobs in IT and hating both of them, and working on rebuilding the machine from memory. The design was simple and easy to replicate, even with non-military hardware. It was the drug that he couldn\\'t do on his own. \"Hello, this is Dr. Tupper, I\\'m calling from the Phoenix office to inquire about that batch of Somnacin I ordered last week. Well, can you check again? I can\\'t keep taking time out of my day to contact you. You people should have had this fixed the last time I called. Sweetheart, this is what we call \\'unacceptable record keeping\\'. I want to talk to your supervisor.\" Three months as a civilian IT customer service rep had taught Arthur one thing: if you went high enough and yelled loud enough, eventually you\\'d reach someone who was paid more than it was worth to waste their time, and they wouldn\\'t know enough about their own company to recognize any of the bullshit you were feeding them. Then they\\'d do what he needed. Life was a bitch like that. So he had lied to his mother after all; he had come back different. He had learned to play dirty, learned when to be rude to get his way, learned when to shut off his feelings and punch his way through. To be fair, he couldn\\'t promise that it was his time in the military which had made that happen— he might have been that person underneath all along. But Arthur was too old for what-ifs. The somnacin was how he met Dom, and through him, Mal. They were academics too, and his parents loved them. His mother kept saying how he needed to find a nice girl like Mal, although Jewish, of course, and then she would laugh and tell Arthur to invite them for dinner. He just let it go, not upset about the assumption and not needing to correct her. He had sworn off dick for a while anyway. It hadn\\'t necessarily lead to anything bad, but it hadn\\'t lead to anything good, either, and he didn\\'t like the introspection it inevitably turned up. Mal was the one who introduced him to Jackson and asked quietly how it was going. \"Slowly,\" Arthur said, sipping the mug of coffee she\\'d made him as she tucked her feet underneath her on the couch and swirled the wine in her glass. \"That is good, no? Slow and steady wins the race?\" Arthur tipped his head in acknowledgment and dropped it. He didn\\'t need to explain that the architect\\'s appetite was voracious and they hadn\\'t really been doing a lot of getting to know each other with their clothes on. They\\'d had one conversation about books which Arthur had to remind himself was not a reason to end a relationship, and if they went out, which they rarely did, it was never to the movies or, God forbid, the theater, but to bars and clubs. It was good. It was fine. It was freeing and did an excellent job of separating love and sex in Arthur\\'s mind. Relationships, even long-term ones, could be casual. Life wasn\\'t a fucking Hallmark movie. Their breakup was inevitable, and messy, and stupid because Arthur had done a fantastic job of making sure the PASIV plans in his brain were secure. The ones he kept in a box under his bed though… \"No more!\" Mal swore, stomping through their trashed office. \"We go to the clients, we become untraceable, we do not. Date. Coworkers. \" Arthur glared and rolled his eyes, something he hadn\\'t previously been aware he could do at the same time, and he did not point out the fact that Mal had thrown them together or that Dom and Mal had been fucking before he met them. So Arthur, who\\'d had to learn how to be rude, was tasked with keeping them untraceable. He was the tech guy, so he should know, right? Because they taught those classes at night school. On the other hand, it was one more left turn the universe couldn\\'t possibly have predicted for him. He started hanging around the wrong sorts, both criminals as well as pasty guys who lived in their basements, telling his parents he had done such a good job on all the IT conferences he\\'d been going to that the company had him traveling to their various international locations. He\\'d be back for Passover, don\\'t worry about him. He stuffed down the impulse to tell them he wasn\\'t throwing everything away, that he wouldn\\'t get killed, and that he wouldn\\'t come back different. They hadn\\'t asked anyway. \" Do you want some cake?\" \" I would, darling, but someone has dropped some hair on the top.\" \" What? That\\'s coconut. It\\'s a German chocolate cake; it\\'s supposed to be there.\" \" Ah, it looks lovely, but unfortunately, coconut is an abomination. It tastes like dirty straw.\" \" Eat a lot of dirty straw, do you?\" \" Come over here and I\\'ll eat you.\" Arthur never slept well in hotels. He scrubbed a hand over his face and slid into his trunks. A few laps in the pool should shut his brain off enough to sleep, and if that didn\\'t work, there was a bartender in the hotel bar who\\'d looked at his ass earlier. He\\'d try that next. On his third lap, he felt like someone was watching him, and he switched to a freestyle stroke and used his breaths to scan the small area around the pool. Florida meant outside pools though, which meant a larger area than just what he could see. He finished his lap and decided to call it a night. Maybe the bartender would be there, maybe he wouldn\\'t, but one thing was certain: he was buying his own shampoo and conditioner in the morning, and he was never going to use the hotel provided amenities again. Fucking coconut-lime scented shit was putting him on edge. \"Hey, thanks, Carl,\" he said, slipping another $20 to the hotel attendant. \"Night swims are the best.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Carl replied, not giving a shit and pocketing the money before Arthur could change his mind. He was really only there to keep drunks from falling in and drowning in the middle of the night, what did he care if Arthur swam? \"Arthur?\" Arthur froze, not sure if he should turn around or not. He hadn\\'t given anyone that name, Dom and Mal wouldn\\'t— \"Darling?\" Arthur spun. Eames was standing there, actually standing in front of him. Khaki cargo shorts and a god-awful orange Hawaiian shirt, wearing a hat even though it was night and carrying a Bahama Mama with a mother fucking umbrella. He looked amazing. Arthur took one look and the door he\\'d shut on his heart flew wide open. One look and every teenaged idolatry, every unsent text, every night of longing came smashing into him like a freight train. Eames looked different, and exactly the same. As a kid, Arthur\\'d always assumed people aged in a way that made them unrecognizable from child to adult, but he\\'d have known Eames anywhere. He was taller, but not by much, had more wrinkles, but not by much, and he was thick. His whole body was a solid slab which Arthur wanted to press onto the nearest flat surface and straddle. \"Eames?\" His voice was a waver, uncertain like he hadn\\'t been in years. With everything in his being, more than he\\'d ever wanted anything, he wanted Eames to stride across this pool area, take him into his arms, and hold him. \"I\\'ve never stopped wishing everyone else was you,\" he\\'d whisper, and Arthur would say, \"I know,\" and the ache in his chest would finally subside. \"How the hell have you been?\" Eames said, grinning widely, coming closer. \"Ah…\" Arthur tried to smile back. \"Good?\" Eames stuck out his hand. \"Bloody hell, what\\'s it been? Ten years?\" \"Twelve,\" Arthur whispered, his hand gripping Eames\\' and shaking like it was something he didn\\'t have to tell his limbs how to do. \"Pardon?\" Arthur just frowned and shook his head. \"Nothing. How have you been? Back in the States, I see. What brings you back here?\" Eames just laughed and held up his drink. \"Well, they don\\'t have beaches like this in England!\" Arthur gave an awkward half laugh, trying to remember exactly how far away the beach was from this particular hotel. Then his hands had nothing to do, and his trunks were puddling water on the ground, and this was it. This was the universe\\'s last, cruel fuck you. Eames was going to give him a, \"Well, it was good to see you,\" and he would never hear from him again. He would walk away, ridiculous drink in hand, and Arthur would crumple, a broken pile of parts. \"You look good,\" Arthur croaked out, too devastated by Eames\\' appearance to think straight. Eames of old would have leered at him, leaned in close, and made some kind of innuendo before grinning like a loon. Arthur of old would have laughed and kissed his neck. The Eames in front of him spread his hands and laughed down at his outfit. \"Ah, well, when in Rome, am I right? But, seriously, mate! What are you doing here? Have you really migrated away from the frozen tundra you call home?\" \"Ah, no,\" Arthur said, giving Eames an odd look. \"Just passing through. I\\'m attending one of the conferences here.\" At the hotel. Where he wouldn\\'t be staying if he\\'d moved here. Arthur mentally retraced his steps and reached for the loaded die he\\'d started keeping in his pocket at all times. Eames was acting… strangely. Wasn\\'t he? Also… mate? Were they just going to ignore their history, then? Is that what people did when they accidentally ran into their first… everything while prepping a mostly-illegal job? \"Of course, of course,\" Eames said. \"Are you heading back to your room now? Mind if I walk with you? I can\\'t believe it\\'s been so long!\" Arthur tried to shake off his sense of unease. Of course Eames was acting weird. It\\'s not as if there were some kind of protocol for this particular scenario. It was off-putting for him too. Arthur grabbed his things from the beach chair by the pool and draped his towel over his shoulders, holding onto the ends, and let himself smile at Eames— a real smile. \"Sure, why not?\" He saw Eames relax too and turned to lead the way. Eames followed, the same walk, the same easy smile, and Arthur\\'s heart beat harder. \"How long is your conference?\" Eames asked conversationally, and Arthur spent a few minutes delving into the backstory he\\'d created for his parents. It was the first time he\\'d ever had to use one of them for someone other than his family, but he was immensely grateful he\\'d created one. He was here with his two co-workers, they were staying a week, he was enjoying the weather and couldn\\'t wait until they had a break so he could read a book in a hammock properly. Eames finished his drink and grinned at him, and the sight of those wonky teeth made Arthur\\'s fists clench. Eames asked him question after question— had he tried this restaurant yet, had he bought any kitschy souvenirs for anyone, was he learning anything interesting at the conference? Before Arthur knew it, they were at his hotel room door. Arthur withdrew his room card, turning it over in his hands. \"This is me,\" he said, indicating his door. Eames\\' face softened, and he hummed as he looked at the room number like he was making a mental note. Arthur\\'s stomach flipped and Eames took a step closer. \"Darling,\" he said, his voice warm as he took Arthur\\'s hand. He squeezed Arthur\\'s upper arm with the other hand, a tingle of warmth spreading through Arthur\\'s body. \"It was so good to see you.\" For a moment, Eames was just as he remembered. That intense gaze, the quirk of those lips, his thumb sweeping across Arthur\\'s knuckles— Arthur was 17 again and Eames was the whole world. Then Eames stepped back. \"We should meet up again!\" he said. \"Maybe get a drink, catch up.\" His smile was wide but felt different somehow, and Arthur struggled to switch gears. \"Yeah,\" he said, nodding. \"Yeah, we should do that. It\\'s been a long time.\" \"Too long.\" Eames gave him a cheeky wave. \"Cheers, darling.\" Arthur watched him walk away, admiring the view, then let himself into his hotel room. For just a moment, for just one damn second, he allowed himself to stand there, back pressed against the door, a stupid smile on his face, and breathe. Eames, his Eames, had stood a foot away from him seconds earlier and asked him to have drinks. Maybe it wasn\\'t about fate. Maybe it wasn\\'t about the choices he\\'d made. He didn\\'t know anymore. What he did know was that he needed to take a shower, and all of a sudden, the thought of the hotel-provided shampoo wasn\\'t turning his stomach. In fact, he had a pretty good idea what he could use it for that might even help him sleep. It had been a long time since he\\'d rubbed one out to thoughts of coconut and Eames. Since he\\'d let himself think about it so frankly, anyway. It seemed fitting, somehow, a nod to all those nights he and Eames had \"watched a movie\", winding each other up, before going to their respective homes and beds. Arthur rolled his eyes at himself, still grinning, and shucked his trunks, placing them in the sink while he showered. He turned on the shower, letting steam fill the room, and he reached for his phone to check the time. Except he\\'d put his phone in the pocket of his trunks. And his trunks were sitting in a pile in the sink. Arthur felt the pockets anyway as if he could have somehow missed an Otterbox in the thin material. Then, as he looked at his hands, he noticed the tan line on his wrist. His watch was missing too. \"Shit.\"[Chapter 2] Dom and Mal were light sleepers, a byproduct of their job, and Arthur was able to rouse them with a knock on their door. He was already packed, and a single spoken sentence was enough to spur them into action. He helped them toss their belongings into bags and escape down the back staircase, ditching the rental car in the parking lot and taking a cab to the warehouse where they\\'d staged the job. Everything was as they\\'d left it, the files of information he\\'d printed still untouched. He started stacking documents into a pile and tossing them into a box, moving efficiently through the space. \"Wait,\" Dom said, \"just wait a second. What exactly happened? Isn\\'t there any way we can save this job? Arthur,\" he barked when Arthur didn\\'t stop moving, \"we need this one. What is going on?\" Arthur gritted his teeth and stopped. Dom wasn\\'t going to move until he\\'d wrenched the whole stupid story out of Arthur\\'s past, and Mal would follow his lead. \"There was a guy casing me at the hotel,\" Arthur said carefully, crossing his arms. \"I\\'d rather be safe than sorry.\" The skin around Dom\\'s eyes tightened and he made a \"go on\" motion with his hand. Arthur breathed out through his nose. He didn\\'t owe Dom anything, he reminded himself. \"I went for a swim. He approached me. We started talking as I walked back to my room,\" Arthur said, his sentences clipped. \"Then he left and I noticed my watch and my phone were missing.\" Dom didn\\'t move. Mal\\'s eyes flitted between them. \"That\\'s it?\" Dom asked. \"How do you know it wasn\\'t just a robbery?\" \"I had a lot of information on that phone,\" Arthur gritted out. \"If he knows how to get into it, the whole job could be compromised.\" Dom\\'s hands curled into fists. \"God damn it, Arthur. I thought you were on top of the technical stuff.\" Arthur scowled. \"That\\'s what I\\'m trying to do. You asked me to keep us untraceable, that\\'s what I\\'m trying to do here,\" he said, indicating the box at his feet. \"Normally it would be hard to track us, and I didn\\'t give him any information about the job, but…\" Arthur trailed off and Dom glared. \"But what, Arthur? Did you sleep with him?\" Arthur flinched. \"Not… exactly.\" Dom looked confused, then annoyed. \"Look, I\\'m not asking for your definition of \\'sex\\' here. You know what I want to know. What exactly does your pillow talk consist of?\" Arthur scowled and counted off on his fingers. \"He knows where I\\'m from. He knows I\\'m single and I travel frequently for business. He knows my real name. He knows how long I\\'ll be in town, when I arrived, which restaurants I\\'ve eaten at since I\\'ve been here, and which room I was in. I mean, if I had that information about someone, I\\'d be able—\" \"He knows your real name?\" Mal interrupted. \"You gave a stranger your real name?\" \"I…\" Arthur looked between them again. \"Not… exactly.\" Dom threw his hands up and walked a few feet away, fuming. Mal just watched Arthur, her soft brown eyes concerned for him. \"He\\'s my ex,\" Arthur finally admitted. \"My first boyfriend, actually. From back home.\" \"And he stole your watch ?\" Dom accused. \"Jesus, Arthur, what did you do to the guy?\" Arthur did nothing, said nothing, tried to kick the door in his chest closed again. But Mal\\'s eyes saw anyway. \"Dom,\" she said quietly, \"let\\'s just move our setup for tonight. We can\\'t get a new work location until the morning, but we still have the backup card, yes?\" \"That\\'s for emergencies, and I don\\'t think Arthur\\'s sex life getting yet another job ruined for us qualifies as—\" \"Dom,\" she said again, her voice calm and lilting, \"we cannot sleep here. We will just find somewhere for the night, and see what we can salvage tomorrow. Arthur is right: better safe than sorry.\" Arthur kept an ear on the police radio and heard the warehouse they\\'d been holed up in was reported broken into three days later. They\\'d managed to wrap the job early, tossing out some of Dom\\'s more creative ideas and just blowing things up instead, the way Arthur had suggested from day one, so he didn\\'t feel any pressing need to tell Dom about the break-in. Arthur took the next two days off, but he couldn\\'t get Eames\\' actions out of his head. It was the watch. He couldn\\'t figure out why Eames had taken it. His phone, sure. It was protected the best way he knew how, although he\\'d been around the block enough times at this point to realize he was outmatched by at least three different hackers who were still in middle school, so he hadn\\'t held out a ton of hope it would remain unaccessed. But the watch... It wasn\\'t anything special. Waterproof, comfortable band, medium price-range, but not something you\\'d steal. That meant it had to be personal. It wasn\\'t a family heirloom, and there wasn\\'t even anything in Arthur and Eames\\' past that had anything to do with watches. Not even wrists, that he could think of. It finally came to him as he was getting ready to leave one morning. and searching his end table for his car keys. As his fingers finally closed around them, Arthur realized that if only one or the other of the things had been missing, he\\'d have simply thought he lost it. When he recognized it was gone, he\\'d have retraced his steps, maybe gone back to the pool or called the front desk to see if anyone had turned it in. But with both of them gone, he\\'d known immediately that they\\'d been taken. And when he knew that, Arthur did the stupidest but also the most logical thing, which was run. The three of them had headed straight for the PASIV and the research, leading anyone following him right to the very thing he\\'d been trying to protect. Arthur cussed himself out, clenching his jaw and vowing not to fuck up like that again. He hated that learning the things he knew were precipitated by mistakes like this. It infuriated him that Eames could have predicted he\\'d react that way, after 12 years of trying specifically to be unpredictable. But mistake or not, Eames hadn\\'t followed him to the warehouse. Why? The warehouse had been hit, so someone had been chasing them. But if that someone had been Eames, why had it taken him three days? Even if it took three days to break into his phone, which Arthur knew a 14-year-old who could have done it in three hours, Eames wouldn\\'t have needed to. He just had to watch Arthur flail around like a fish out of water and flop into the net all by himself. Unless... Unless Eames hadn\\'t been trying to make him run so he could follow, but so that Arthur could get out. Maybe Eames had been trying to warn him. It was outlandish and far-fetched, but it was the only explanation Arthur could come up with that made any kind of sense. He called Dom. \"The warehouse was what ?\" Dom squawked loud enough that Arthur pulled his new phone away from his ear. \"By who?\" \"Whom, and I don\\'t know,\" Arthur said. \"I\\'ve got a guess as to what Eames had to do with it though.\" \"Who the hell is Eames? Jesus, is he that guy? Why is it always your love life that is making us run halfway around the country and blow things up? What the hell is going on, Arthur?\" \"My love life is not the problem, and we blew things up in a dream. Are you done? Can I go on?\" Dom was silent for a few beats and Arthur continued before he could get fired. \"I think he was trying to warn me they were after the PASIV.\" There was another pause before Dom asked tightly, \"How do you know that?\" \"I don\\'t know for sure,\" Arthur agreed, \"but the important thing is that we know someone is after the PASIV.\" \"Well, of course someone—\" Arthur could hear Dom taking deep breaths, then a crackle as he handed off the phone and Mal\\'s voice came on the line. \"Arthur? What is it mon cher ?\" Arthur refocused. \"Someone is actively tracking our jobs to try and steal a PASIV. Because we moved shop, they didn\\'t get one. Any idea who that might be? Or how we can find out?\" There was a beat, and then, \"Yes, I may be able to find out. But why?\" \"I was thinking we contact them and find out if we can sell them one. It\\'ll get them off our backs and if we charge them enough, maybe we can skip that shitty job in Sri Lanka.\" Mal didn\\'t say anything for a moment and then said, \"You have extra ones?\" Her voice was light, too casual, and Arthur would forever hate himself for this conversation later, but at the moment all he could think of was how to fix the problem in front of him. \"Yeah, I mean, I can build one.\" \"Does anyone else know you can build a PASIV?\" \"Jackson, I suppose. And whoever he told.\" She just hummed and told him she would talk to Dom, and Arthur took a deep breath and believed her when she said it would be alright. The next day, Dom called him. \"You are not building them a PASIV,\" he chastised, as if Arthur were a child. \"We don\\'t need any more competition than we already have, and not everyone has my background to be able to pul—\" \" Your background?\" \"...Our background, I meant. Look, I just mean that this isn\\'t a good time to make the playing field even. We need to keep as many of the balls in our court as we can, and if we—\" \"When is it ever going to be a good time to keep the field even? That\\'s not what this is about, and God knows it would be nice to have another team to spread out the jobs we don\\'t want. Yes, it\\'s competition, but the more this gets out, and it will , the more—\" \"Mal\\'s pregnant.\" Arthur broke off and the answering silence ringing through his hotel room pressed in on him. \"She just found out, we haven\\'t told her parents yet, and she\\'s,\" Dom sighed and Arthur could picture him pushing his hand through his hair, \"she\\'s scared. We weren\\'t exactly expecting…\" Dom trailed off and Arthur could only picture the end of everything he\\'d known. How was that for confounding fate? \"Well, you are now,\" he finally said. Dom croaked a laugh that. \"Yeah.\" He sounded lost, and Arthur got a grip. \"Hey, congratulations, man. That\\'s really exciting.\" \"Yeah? I mean, yeah, thanks. You\\'re the first person I\\'ve told.\" Arthur didn\\'t know what to do with that information. He didn\\'t have siblings, hadn\\'t really been around people who were babies or who owned babies, and he wasn\\'t sure what he was supposed to say. \"Well, um,\" he tried. Maybe Dom would prefer getting back to something he was used to? Arthur knew he would. \"About the PASIV— maybe you\\'re right. Maybe it\\'s not a good time right now.\" \"Right,\" Dom said, steadier. \"Yeah, exactly. Just, who needs the competition, right?\" \"Right,\" Arthur confirmed, nodding even though Dom couldn\\'t see him. \"Ah, just... maybe something to think about. If Eames hadn\\'t tipped me off, they\\'d have gotten ours. So I might build a backup just in case.\" \"Yeah, that\\'s a good idea, Arthur. And we can keep the other one, so they\\'re not in the same place. Spread out the liability a bit.\" \"Yes, good,\" Arthur said, shoving the pieces of PASIV he\\'d already started building into a pile. \"Also, we kind of owe Eames one. Not in an obvious way, but just, you know. If it comes up.\" \"I\\'ll keep that in mind,\" Dom said drily, like he knew exactly what Arthur was asking, and Arthur felt his spine stiffen. \"But hey,\" Dom said, softer, \"thanks. For, you know. Being the one I could tell.\" \"You\\'re... welcome.\" The call ended and Arthur found himself looking at his phone like it was a stranger. He didn\\'t know anything about babies. When the second PASIV was together, he took it over to Dom and Mal\\'s to test it. \"Hello,\" he said, not sure if he should bring up her... pregnant-ness. \"Arthur, my dearest, I\\'m so glad you\\'re here! Come, look at these things I bought for the baby!\" Arthur found himself knee-deep in a world of organic everything, and Mal looked too happy for words. Dom had said she was scared, and if Arthur was any kind of judge, she should be. But the PASIV he had carefully fashioned to fit into an old briefcase of his, was clutched in her hand and it was saying she wasn\\'t planning on changing her lifestyle. And so Arthur listened and nodded and integrated words into his lexicon like \"layette\" and \"lovey\". Then he steered the conversation back to what he was good at. \"I need another person to do the test run. Dom?\" Dom and Mal looked at each other. \"Yeah, probably a good idea,\" Dom said, taking the offered IV. \"Better safe than sorry, right Arthur?\" Dom smiled and Mal\\'s mouth twisted, but Arthur was dead serious when he nodded back. \"You don\\'t want to be sorry on this one.\" \"No,\" Dom said, and to Arthur\\'s surprise, Mal\\'s face untwisted and she hugged him. \"Thank you,\" she said into his sweater vest, sounding too close to weeping for comfort. \"You are right. Thank you for keeping us safe. All of us.\" She pulled back with a watery smile and a hand on her stomach, and Arthur only squirmed a little. \"Right.\" The PASIV worked perfectly, the two minutes of dream time enough for Dom to poke at the beachside cabana he\\'d built and not enough time to wonder about the scent of coconuts. Ever since the pool, any dream Arthur built seemed permeated, which he\\'d thought he\\'d gotten a handle on in the Army, but apparently not. He gritted his teeth as Dom built an Eiffel Tower on the shore and the smell intensified. \"It won\\'t be long,\" Dom promised. \"She\\'ll be back to work as soon as the baby\\'s born.\" Arthur nodded. \"We can take two-man jobs until then. She can help me with research topside. I can help you with the builds.\" Dom just nodded, his smile tight, and then they blinked awake in Mal and Dom\\'s family room. Arthur prided himself on his quick and efficient dreams, but now he just wanted to go back to his hotel room and shower off the scent of coconut. With a baby on the way and funds running low, they took the shitty Sri Lanka job, which was a terrible idea and Arthur told them both that, loudly, and was overruled by things like,\"diversify our portfolio,\" and \"future market share,\" and \"before Mal can\\'t fly anymore.\" Even if the job was doomed, at least the location was beautiful, Arthur thought, leaning back in the cafe chair and sipping his espresso. Arthur had never been to Sri Lanka, and indulging in a day of sightseeing, and actually buying a souvenir for his mother (because Eames had made him feel like shit for not getting her one from Florida) was more peaceful than he\\'d expected. It had taken two days for Dom and Mal to nail down the deal, which had apparently been agreed to without knowing any specifics, and almost ended with Dom stomping about of the room and muttering about \"motherfucking diamonds \". Eventually, though, he was able to strike a deal with the head of the manufacturing corporation, and they were set to extract the location of a family-owned diamond mine. Their mark was the aging owner, currently bedridden and shut-in. \"It\\'s not going to work,\" Arthur argued. \"He\\'s not going to leave the house, and that family secret has been ingrained into his cell matter. We\\'re not going to be able to get to him, and if we do , he might be militarized. I found copies of— \" \"That\\'s why you do what you do,\" Dom interrupted, slapping a folder into Arthur\\'s chest, \"and I do what I do.\" He walked away and Arthur glared. When he looked to Mal for help, she was engrossed in her computer screen with a crease between her eyes and hadn\\'t heard a word. Arthur frowned and made sure they had tickets off the island. They\\'d been paid for two weeks, although Arthur was betting it would fall through in ten days. He pulled three 20-hour days in a row trying to find a way to get to the mark, and then Arthur told Dom, in no uncertain terms, that he was taking the rest of the afternoon off. \"You\\'re what?\" Mal just looked at him, her hand on her barely noticeable bump. \"I\\'m going sightseeing.\" \"We\\'ve got a job to do, Arthur.\" \"Yeah, and as soon as you figure out how you\\'re going to pull it off, I\\'m ready to hear it. Until then, I\\'m going to go see an elephant and then I\\'m going to sit on a beach. I\\'m not going to kill myself if you don\\'t have a plan in place.\" Dom, fuming, apparently couldn\\'t come up with a retort until Arthur was almost out the door. \"Try keeping your pants on. We can\\'t afford any screw-ups.\" Arthur, the mature 30-year-old that he was, decided that slamming the door and storming off was better than the list of damaging and hurtful things he could have said in return. So the elephants were amazing, and the walking tour was beautiful, but he didn\\'t get a chance to let his chest uncoil until he had a coffee in hand, a newspaper in front of him, and blessed, blessed silence. \"Sir? How is everything this morning?\" Arthur spared a glance at the over-eager waiter who was making a lot of eye contact. \"Fine.\" \"Ah, a fellow American!\" the waiter continued with a grin. He was young, probably taking a gap year to see the sights, and Arthur nodded once. \"Yes.\" \"Well, it\\'s good to hear a familiar voice,\" he laughed, cocking a hip and looking like he was going to stay a while. \"Are you here for business or pleasure?\" He gave Arthur an appreciative once-over and Arthur was not at all thinking about Dom\\'s warning when he didn\\'t return the glance. \"Actually,\" Arthur said distantly, \"I will have another one of these, now that you mention it. Thank you so much.\" He gave an impersonal, but polite smile. The waiter only looked stung for a second before straightening and murmuring, \"Right away, sir,\" and hurrying off. Arthur gritted his teeth and returned to his paper and his silence. \"Is there anything else I can get you, sir?\" Arthur didn\\'t look up this time. \"Just the coffee is fine.\" \"Are you sure?\" Annoyed, Arthur frowned over the top of the paper and felt his mouth drop at the sight in front of him. Eames pulled out a chair and sat down, grinning. \"Hello, darling.\" Except he said it in an American accent. It was jarring and odd, and Arthur hated it. He closed his mouth and raised an eyebrow instead. Arthur fluffed his paper. \"Have a seat, why don\\'t you?\" \"Don\\'t mind if I do.\" The Eames in front of him was a different person, yet again. It wasn\\'t just the accent. He was dressed in a slouchy blazer and trousers, wide splayed collar showing off his thick neck— a far cry from the gauche tourist he\\'d been at the pool. Arthur tried to focus on the words in front of him and appear unaffected. \"How did you find me?\" \"You\\'re not very creative with your aliases, Arthur.\" Arthur clenched his jaw, but Eames\\' accent was back so he didn\\'t say anything, relieved to hear the familiar drawl wash over him. \"I\\'d heard about this job through the grapevine—\" \"There\\'s a grapevine?\" \"— but I thought to myself, no, Arthur\\'s far too practical to take something like that. Seems you\\'ve changed, darling.\" \" I\\'ve …!\" Arthur gaped at him, but obviously, the man by the pool hadn\\'t been Eames. The man sitting next to him now might not be Eames either, but Arthur was startled to realize he was okay with that. At least now he knew that if he wanted to know Eames again, really still know him, it wouldn\\'t be as easy as walking Eames back to his hotel room. That thought made him want to grin. Eames, the one he\\'d loved, had been interesting and complex. Arthur was glad at least that hadn\\'t changed. \"I got you a Sno Ball.\" \"A what now?\" \"A Sno Ball. They\\'re good.\" \"It definitely sounds like something I would like. I like snow, I love balls… but I just don\\'t believe it\\'s possible I would enjoy those, darling. There\\'s dandruff all over them.\" \"Oh, no, that\\'s coconut. Don\\'t you like coconut? No, wait. You hate coconut. Damn, I knew there was something about coconut.\" \"Uh huh. What if I trade you? I\\'ll give you my hairy balls for your chocolate bar.\" Arthur had always liked coconut, but he liked teasing Eames about it more. Every time he saw it, all he could think about was Eames and how he would react to whatever food it had disgraced, how even coconut scented things offended his sensibilities. Arthur bought coconut everything and gifted them to Eames, left them in his dresser drawers, and let him \"borrow\" them. It became so common that even his parents would bring him things they found \"for Eames\" and Arthur would cackle. Eames had always been a good sport, and Arthur had never been cruel because he knew Eames really, honestly didn\\'t like coconut. So the fact that Eames had made himself coconut scented on their last night together was a form of \\'I love you\\' Arthur never thought he\\'d hear. It was I love you more than the things I don\\'t like. I love you enough to endure them because you like them. I love you. He chanced a glance at Eames, who had acquired a toothpick and was rolling it around his mouth as he watched Arthur. He smirked at Arthur and Arthur could feel himself blush. He jerked his gaze back to his newspaper and kept his face neutral. \"Your espresso, sir.\" The waiter appeared at his elbow, a cool and unimpressed look toward Eames, who turned his smirk on him. When the waiter set down the cup, Eames leaned close to Arthur. \"Sweetheart, you got me one too? You\\'re the best.\" His voice was low and warm, a fond crinkle in his eyes, and Arthur knew it was a mask, but he was still transported. He was in his childhood bedroom, warm summer air breathing through his curtains and Eames breathing into his mouth. Then he blinked. And Arthur turned on his thousand-watt smile, dimples and all. \"Sure I did, babe. Anything for you.\" Eames\\' smile faltered, and in that instant, Arthur felt his heart thrill. Yes, Eames was different. Arthur was different too. But Arthur could still tease him. And Eames\\' answering grin was wider and truer, even as he leaned closer and put his wide, warm palm on Arthur\\'s knee. The waiter finally got the message and left them alone, and Arthur folded his paper and then reached to grab Eames\\' hand. He kept smiling as he tightened his grip to the point where Eames winced. \"What are you doing here, Eames?\" Eames gave him an adoring look despite Arthur crushing his fingers together and murmured, \"Same as last time, of course.\" Arthur froze and dropped Eames\\' hand, and Eames sat back, flexing his fingers unobtrusively under the table. Eames scanned the area, sipping the espresso Arthur had ordered and looking for all the world like he could have been there simply to enjoy the coffee and the foot traffic. \"Who?\" Arthur clipped, done smiling. Eames shook his head, setting down the cup. \"Doesn\\'t matter. How long will you be?\" Arthur frowned but decided to answer honestly. \"I give it another week before it falls apart.\" Eames scanned the area again, a casual, relaxed air as he said, \"See if you can wrap it up sooner, hmm? I\\'m not the Second Coming.\" Arthur snorted softly. Eames\\' eyes swung to look at him, amused and mischievous. He moved as if to rise, and Arthur felt a stab of panic he hadn\\'t anticipated at the thought that Eames would walk out and he would never see him again. He had no way to contact him, no idea if Eames wanted to be contacted. \"Arthur.\" Arthur held back a shiver, but only just. His name rolled off Eames\\' tongue, warm and sweet and full of memories. Eames curled himself into Arthur\\'s space again, far too close and not close enough. \"You\\'ll call me if you need someone who\\'s good with his hands, yeah?\" Arthur vaguely registered the weight dropping into his pocket, but all he could see were Eames\\' eyes. Icy blue-gray with a few more wrinkles at the corners than he remembered, but smiling at him just the same. Arthur couldn\\'t think of a thing to say. Eames stood with a cheeky wink and Arthur watched him walk away, pulling a map out of his pocket as he walked and stopping an elderly woman on the street to ask for directions in his unsettling brassy American accent. Arthur had wiped his mouth before he remembered to check his pocket, but sure enough, his hand closed around the familiar shape of his phone.[Chapter 3] Arthur walked back into Mal and Dom\\'s hotel room in a strange cloud of calm, replaying the meeting with Eames in his head. \"Guys?\" Dom and Mal looked up from where they were working, and Arthur raised his head to meet their eyes. \"I think we should pull the plug on this job.\" The other two looked at each other, having a whole conversation with a look, and Dom rose. \"Why? You never bail on a job, not even with that mess with Jackson. You were ready to go right to the—\" \"Oh, will you stop bringing that up?\" Arthur exploded. \"I\\'m sorry, alright? I fucked up. I\\'m trying to make it up to you.\" \"By cutting and running? We just made a breakthrough while you were \"sightseeing\", in case you care, and I think we could really—\" \"Eames is here.\" Now Mal was on her feet. \"What? Here? In Sri Lanka?\" Arthur nodded and Dom yelled, \"How in the hell did he find us? Did you tell him where we were going?\" Arthur glared. \"Of course not!\" \"Well, then what the hell is he doing here?\" \"When I asked him that,\" Arthur said pointedly, \"he said, \\'Same as before.\\' So I assume that means whoever\\'s hired him is still after the PASIV. And instead of stealing it, Eames is trying to warn me.\" Dom paced, thinking, and Arthur put his hands on his hips, trying not to scream. \"So we\\'ve got some time,\" Dom said, and Arthur wanted to beat him. He gritted his teeth instead. \"I told Eames we needed at least ten days. He said he won\\'t be able to hold them off that long and—\" \"Ten days should be plenty, no?\" Mal asked, her soft voice cutting through the tension. \"With the new plan?\" \"What plan?\" Dom turned to look at him, assessing, and then he said, \"I had an idea.\" He paced the floor, talking with his hands. \"You said that the mark might be militarized, right?\" Arthur nodded. \"I got the idea because the guy who taught me about militarization, Mr. Charles, took me into a dream and started to teach me about militarization. Except I didn\\'t know I was in a dream. When he stopped and told me it was a dream, all of a sudden I could see all the things that were strange, which I hadn\\'t noticed before. His point was that I couldn\\'t trust anything he\\'d told me since it had all been a dream, but what I realized was that in that moment, he was the only thing I could trust.\" \"That\\'s…\" Arthur frowned, \"actually terrifying.\" \"Yes!\" Dom exclaimed coming over to him. \"That\\'s the point! If the mark is militarized and we make his dreaming mind aware he\\'s dreaming, he\\'ll only be able to trust us and eventually lead us right to what we want.\" Arthur shifted, the rationalization a little too close to home with his dealings with Eames. He tried to remember if he\\'d checked for a tail before he walked back here. Mal spoke up. \"It could work, Arthur. We wouldn\\'t need as long, maybe five minutes topside. I could distract his nurse,\" she stroked her belly, \"and you and Dom could go under.\" If she\\'d been imploring instead of steady, Arthur might not have agreed. But she was so calm, so sure. Arthur nodded. \"Fine. Thursday the rest of the house will be out, his nurse will be the only one there. You two,\" he said, pointing, \"can play act. I\\'m just there to work.\" Dom grinned like a little boy and even Mal smiled, smug and French. \"Thursday it is, then.\" Arthur sat at the computer. \"What do you need from me?\" It was a disaster. Arthur sat up from the bed and vomited into the trash can nearby. He was careful to keep the mess contained, grabbing the liner and wrapping it up almost before he was finished. \"Dom,\" he croaked. \"We\\'ve got to go.\" The answering groan was muffled and he turned to see Dom hanging his head between his knees looking distinctly green. \"Shit. Do not puke on the carpet.\" A string of worried French hit him. \"What has happened?\" Mal asked. \"It didn\\'t work. We have to go. Now.\" Mal frowned but helped Dom remove his IV and Arthur shoved the lines into the case without his usual care, trying to wipe down fingerprints while he could still stand. Mal dragged Dom to standing and hauled him out of the room. \"Where\\'s the nurse?\" Arthur asked, staggering behind them. \"Dealt with,\" came the familiar British accent, and Arthur stumbled into unfamiliar arms, so different from what he remembered. Eames took his weight easily and Arthur didn\\'t care why he was there, only that he was helping. \"This way,\" Eames clipped, and Arthur followed. When they hit the air outside, Arthur felt his head clear and he started noticing things. Eames was tense, looking everywhere at once. Mal was holding on to Dom, but she also had a hand on the gun in Dom\\'s shoulder holster. And they weren\\'t heading toward their hotel. \"Eames, what…?\" \"I need you to trust me, Arthur. Ten minutes and I\\'ll explain everything. Okay?\" He wasn\\'t looking at Arthur, just barreling ahead and Arthur felt small beside him. It wasn\\'t a feeling he was used to. \"Arthur,\" Mal hissed. \"Who is this? What is going on?\" \"I don\\'t…\" \"Arthur.\" Eames looked at him, one strong arm still wrapped firmly around him, dragging him on. \"Ten minutes. Please, darling.\" Arthur\\'s helpless glance at Mal was met with grim understanding, but she just pursed her lips and didn\\'t let go of Dom\\'s gun. That\\'s how Arthur found himself standing in a room of the shittiest roach motel he\\'d ever laid eyes on, a bag of his own vomit in one hand and the PASIV in the other. Arthur looked dubiously at the two double beds as Mal steered Dom towards the room\\'s only chair. Dom was there mere seconds before he sprang up and made a beeline for the bathroom, Mal clucking after him. \"Eames?\" Arthur asked. \"What the hell is going on? How did you know where we were? And where are we now? Eames turned from where he\\'d been peering out the corner of the curtain he\\'d twitched back. \"Alright, it\\'s like this. I have been tailing you for a few months because I was supposed to steal a PASIV.\" Arthur, who had suspected but had stupidly hoped he was wrong, glared. \"What?\" \"I didn\\'t know it was you at the time!\" Eames insisted. \"Honestly, Arthur, when I saw you in Florida I was—\" \"You were going to steal it from some one, though. One of my friends. But then, what? You felt a twinge of nostalgia and decided to grow a conscience?\" Eames\\' lips thinned. \"I have been trying to earn a permanent spot on a dreamshare team for years, and I did what—\" \" You were the one?\" Mal\\'s face in the bathroom doorway was thunderous, a black scowl, and Arthur could see Dom\\'s pasty one behind hers. \"The one who has been chasing us, threatening us…!\" \"Hey,\" Arthur said, frowning at her, \"he hasn\\'t threatened—\" \"You have no honor,\" Mal spat. Then she started in on him in French, and from the way Eames flinched, he had to have understood at least some of it. \"Mal, be reasonable, he did try to warn me, and we—\" \"Did he?\" Mal rounded on Arthur. \"Are you certain he was warning you? Because it seems to me that he is closer to his goal than he has ever been.\" She looked pointedly at the case clutched in Arthur\\'s hand. Eames and Arthur both looked at the case, and Eames took a step back. \"Hey, no, Arthur,\" he said, raising his hands, but Mal didn\\'t let him continue. \"You have put my family in danger, Mr. Eames. You are not welcome here.\" Her words landed like a viper attack, and Eames drew back. \"Alright,\" Eames said, curling his fingers and letting his hands drop. His face was a cool mask. \"I can see how you might think that. I\\'ll go. I snagged a few provisions for a quick getaway, so I\\'ll leave them outside the door, and then you\\'ll never see me again.\" He brushed past Arthur to head to the door. \"No, wait,\" Arthur started himself out of his stupor. \"Just... wait.\" He shoved the bag and the PASIV at Mal, barely noticing her grimace and followed Eames into the hallway. When the door was shut safely behind him, he turned to Eames. \"What is going on? Seriously, Eames. I don\\'t know what to believe right now.\" The truth was that Arthur knew what he should believe and he knew what he did believe, and they weren\\'t matching up. Arthur desperately wanted Eames to fix that for him. Eames, however, looked a little rattled. \"Everything I told you is the bloody truth, Arthur, and I want to explain.\" He raked a hand through his hair and turned to face Arthur fully. \"I...\" His hand made an awkward motion, and Arthur wondered if Eames had been intending to touch him, but Eames only crossed his arms. \"But there\\'s nothing I can say right now that you\\'ll believe, is there.\" His sigh was a challenge and a resignation at the same time. Arthur tried to distance himself, think about it objectively, dispassionately, the way Dom would expect him to in any other situation. Eames was a thief; he\\'d said so himself. And if he was still interested in stealing a PASIV, he wouldn\\'t have a very easy time of it now that he\\'d admitted it to Arthur. But maybe that was the point. Maybe it was reverse psychology, or reverse reverse psychology, or... Or maybe Eames was telling the truth. Arthur knew Eames. Not the man in front of him, obviously. Arthur wanted to think he knew the \\'real\\' Eames though, the one he\\'d been before he\\'d built up the obvious layers between them. The one Eames still was underneath them all. If Arthur was being honest with himself, it was unrealistic— Arthur was a different person than he\\'d been at 17, even though some days he still felt 17 on the inside. He could suppose no differently for Eames. \"I think I don\\'t know what to believe,\" Arthur said again, hesitantly, and Eames only nodded, looking away. \"I\\'ll be back,\" Eames said, \"I\\'ll bring you some things. You think about it, yeah? Let me know what I can do to convince you.\" \"It\\'s not me you have to convince,\" Arthur said. \"It\\'s Dom.\" Eames snorted. \"You think I care what that bloody ponce thinks?\" Arthur\\'s lips twitched. \"Yes. You want to be on a dreamshare team, you didn\\'t score a PASIV, and Dom is the head of this particular team. So yeah, I do.\" Eames had the sense to look abashed. \"Yeah, alright, that might have crossed my mind. Probably not a good start to the whole \\'trust\\' thing, now was it?\" He chuckled. \"I\\'ve been a liar for a long time, Arthur. \\'S as natural as breathing to me. But I would like it if you\\'d trust me again.\" Arthur just raised his eyebrows and put his hands on his hips and Eames sucked in a lip and nodded once. \"Right. I\\'m off.\" He turned, but after a beat looked back. \"You know, Arthur... I\\'d always pictured meeting you again going much differently.\" And Arthur, too stunned to know what to think, watched him walk away. 45 minutes later, there was a knock on the room of the hotel, and Arthur\\'s gun was in his hand. Even when he checked the peephole and opened the door to Eames, he frowned. \"What do you want, Eames?\" \"\\'Nothing,\" Eames frowned back, \"just bringing the stuff like I said I would,\" which was when Arthur noticed what he was carrying. \"That\\'s,\" Arthur said, backing up in surprise and Eames stepped into the room. \"That\\'s my suitcase.\" \"And mine,\" Mal said, reaching for the one Eames was handing her. Eames nodded. \"Dom\\'s is still downstairs, I\\'ll go grab it.\" \"But how did you...?\" Arthur picked his case up. \"You know what? I don\\'t want to know.\" Eames grinned at him and Arthur could feel himself smirking back, even as Eames left again. Arthur closed the door behind him and could feel himself settle. It was always like that once he\\'d made a decision. He moved smoothly, stripping the comforters off both beds and setting his suitcase on the one closest to the door. He unzipped it to find all of his belongings stacked inside, including the ones he\\'d stowed in the dresser, and his watch laid neatly on top. Arthur grinned. There was the Eames he knew. He was still grinning when he heard the knock on the door. \"Eames, I\\'m sorry, I should—\" As soon as Arthur opened the door, Eames plowed into him. Every square inch of muscle hit Arthur square in the chest and Arthur toppled backward. Training kicked in about halfway down and Arthur tried to twist to protect his spine, but he still landed badly. And then Eames landed on top of him. \"What the—\" Arthur broke off at the look on Eames\\' face, terror and sorrow as he scrambled off Arthur. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he whispered frantically. \"This wasn\\'t, I—\" \"Well, well, well, my little Arthur. You look so surprised to see me.\" The tall, dark-haired man in the doorway was pointing a gun at Arthur, a cold smile that didn\\'t reach his eyes. He closed the door quietly behind him. \"Sergio!\" Dom yelled, springing to his feet, more life in his cheeks than he\\'d had all morning. \"You piece of—\" \"Shut up,\" Sergio clipped, and Dom clamped his mouth closed again, glaring for all he was worth. \"We\\'re not going to draw this out. Hand it over, and I\\'ll be on my way.\" \"I\\'m not giving you anything,\" Arthur spat at him. \"Sergio, love, let\\'s talk about this,\" Eames said, crouched on the carpet, hands splayed. \"Oh, I wasn\\'t talking to either of you,\" Sergio drawled. He strolled into the room, the calm confidence of a small man with a big gun. With a cruel sneer, he pressed the gun in his hand to the soft mound of Mal\\'s belly. \"I was talking to Dominic.\" Arthur couldn\\'t describe the emotions crossing Dom\\'s face as he put his hands up, far away from the gun in his holster. \"Okay,\" he said quickly, \"okay, Sergio. Let\\'s just… there\\'s no need for that. Okay?\" \"Fine with me,\" Sergio said with a shrug. \"So hand it over.\" Arthur, ignoring the soreness in his body from the fall, rose to his knees. \"He doesn\\'t have it.\" He put his hands up as Sergio looked at him, but Sergio didn\\'t move the gun from Mal\\'s stomach, even though silent tears were streaming down her cheeks. \"I do,\" Arthur said. Sergio regarded him with a squint. \"No tricks, Arthur. I know it\\'s here.\" Arthur nodded, then pointed to the pile of blankets at the foot of the bed. \"Arthur…\" Mal\\'s pleading voice stopped them all. \"Just give it to him. Please.\" Arthur frowned, then nodded and rose to his feet, hands still raised. He retrieved the PASIV and handed it over, and Sergio tucked it under his arm so he could keep his gun trained on them. He opened the door with a grin. \"It has been a genuine pleasure. Eames, wonderful to work with you, as always. Couldn\\'t have done it without you. But, as you can see, I did end up having to do it without you, so you can go ahead and consider this our final interaction.\" \"You bloody prat. I wouldn\\'t—\" \"Ah, ah, ah,\" Sergio warned, waving his gun. \"I implore you, love . Think of the children.\" He grinned again and Arthur felt a red surge of hate he hadn\\'t realized he could create aimed at the smarmy man. Eames\\' lips were a hard line and he looked away. Sergio smiled the whole time as he let the door close. As soon as it clicked shut, Arthur moved to engage the lock while Dom collected the sobbing Mal in his arms. As the adrenaline crashed through his system, Arthur could feel his knees shaking and he took the few steps to the bed and sank down, fists curling and uncurling. Eames was still crouched on the floor, watching him. They listened to Dom comfort Mal for a few moments, Arthur trying to slow his heartbeat, every anger management class he\\'d ever been in screaming at him not to make it worse. \"Arthur?\" Eames asked, tentative. \"Are you alright?\" \"You shut up,\" Dom barked at Eames from where he stood, Mal pressing her face into his shoulder. \"You sold us out, you piece of shit. Get the hell out of this room before I—\" \"Before you what, you pencil-pushing dick?\" Arthur roared, standing, his rage finding a comfortable target. \"He didn\\'t sell us out, Dom. Only an idiot would think Eames wanted that to happen just now.\" \"Of course he didn\\'t want it to happen! He was supposed to be on the other side of the gun! Jesus, Arthur, if you could think with the big head for once .\" \"Fuck you.\" Arthur scowled hard enough Dom flinched. \"Wait, I didn\\'t—\" \"Alright, Eames, let\\'s go.\" Arthur stooped and fished around under the blanket before pulling out the gun he\\'d stored next to the PASIV under the bed. He checked the magazine and loaded the chamber. \"Next time, Mal? Just let me shoot him.\" Arthur shoved the gun in his belt and slid on his coat. \"Arthur, wait,\" Dom said, \"I\\'m sorry, alright, I didn\\'t… I was just upset. You don\\'t have to go.\" \"No, I think you\\'ve got plenty of people to take care of right now,\" Arthur said, his voice sounding hard even to his own ears. \"Why don\\'t you go ahead and do that.\" Eames, who had been standing unobtrusively in the corner, spoke up. \"Arthur, you don\\'t have to—\" \"You, shut up,\" Arthur said, pointing at him. Eames sighed through his nose. \"Getting a little tired of that,\" he quipped without humor. \"Yeah, well, that\\'s too bad. You\\'re coming with me. After we get out of the city, you can do whatever you want.\" From his pocket, Arthur withdrew two boarding passes and threw them on the bed before slamming his suitcase closed and zipping it shut with sharp jerks. Arthur yanked open the door and pointed with his chin for Eames to go, and Eames went readily enough. Which was good. Arthur still wasn\\'t sure what to think, so he shoved thoughts of Eames aside, like he should have done from the beginning. He was going to get any and all threats away from Mal, and if that meant taking himself out of the picture, so much the better for the kid. At least that\\'s what he told himself as he looked back at the pair he\\'d spent the last several years of his life with. Dom looked shocked, like he had been sure Arthur was bluffing, and Mal just looked sad, both hands wrapped around her abdomen, tears drying on her cheeks. \"Drop me a line when the kid is born, yeah?\" And then he left. The door clicked closed behind him, Eames was waiting in the hallway, and Arthur just walked away. Fate was laughing its ass off. Here Arthur was, next to a man he thought he\\'d never see again, 12 years of hard work for him to be back where he started. Except now he didn\\'t know if he could trust Eames, and he didn\\'t own a working PASIV. He did have his shitty watch back, though, so really, it all evened out. \"Arthur,\" Eames said, keeping pace next to him. Arthur ignored him. \"Arthur.\" The hand on his arm jerked Arthur to a halt. \"What.\" Eames looked stung, and Arthur immediately felt guilty. He tried to remind himself that Eames was a con man, a thief, and he didn\\'t know the person in front of him. But Eames\\' eyes… Arthur felt like he could see into Eames\\' soul, and that soul looked pretty familiar. Those were the same eyes which had looked into his when Eames had grabbed his hand and asked if he could kiss him. They were the eyes that had widened when Arthur had lunged forward and kissed Eames instead. They were the ones that twinkled when Arthur handed him the coconut cream pie from the dessert tray, taking Eames\\' favorite cherry for himself, and then switching them when Arthur\\'s back was turned. \"I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean for any of this to happen,\" Eames said, his hand still on Arthur\\'s arm, and Arthur could feel every point of contact. He shrugged it off before it could affect him any more than it already was. \"I know,\" he said, but softer, and Eames relaxed a bit. \"Come with me,\" Eames said, and Arthur blinked at him. \"Come with you?\" \"Yes,\" Eames insisted, the beginnings of a smile on those well-known lips. \"I\\'ve made a mess of this, darling, I\\'d really like to start again. I\\'ve got a place we can lay low for a while. At least let me try and make it up to you,\" he said. \"Maybe this time I can steal a PASIV for you.\" \"Shit.\" The welling of blood was immediate and Arthur grimaced and put his finger in his mouth. It wasn\\'t the first time he\\'d cut himself on the wires of a PASIV, and it probably wouldn\\'t be the last. His DNA was probably all over every one he\\'d built. \"What did you do to yourself? Oh, that\\'ll need a plaster, darling. Let me get one.\" They\\'d gone to London, of all places. Arthur had never been, for some reason, and Eames had looked delighted as he\\'d shown him the walk-up. As soon as Arthur stepped inside, he knew this wasn\\'t just a place to lay low. This was home. He\\'d been shown around the small apartment, deposited his suitcase in the guest room/office/home gym, and been taken on a sightseeing tour to the hardware store. \"There are so many places to see though, Arthur.\" \"You can show me later. I\\'ve got work to do.\" He bought as much as he could remember he\\'d need, and a computer from the electronics store they\\'d visited next, Eames looking like a pouty child. Then Eames had bought the ingredients to make dinner, and apparently, passports. Arthur looked at the man in front of him, tutting over the finger he\\'d pulled from Arthur\\'s mouth and readying a band-aid. \"You\\'re awfully distracted,\" Eames said. \"What are you thinking about that\\'s making you scowl so?\" And Arthur, who seconds ago wouldn\\'t have been able to pin down what was bothering him, answered without thinking. \"You called Sergio \\'love\\'. Is that a throwaway term or…?\" It wasn\\'t a jealousy thing. It was tactical. Arthur needed to know how deep Eames was in this. Eames hedged but applied the bandage with precision. \"I call a lot of people a lot of things.\" He released Arthur\\'s hand, and Arthur scowled. \"I can\\'t believe you slept with him.\" \"Yes, well, you slept with him first.\" Arthur shifted. He wasn\\'t aware that was common knowledge. \"Yeah, well, I slept with you first too,\" he grumbled. Eames blinked and then chuckled, the same laugh Arthur would have known anywhere. Eames leaned closer and touched his fingertips, oh so gently to Arthur\\'s jaw. \"Yeah, you did, darling. And I slept with you first.\" \"Yeah. You did.\" Arthur swallowed, and looked into warm, gray eyes. \"What are we doing here, Eames?\" Eames cupped Arthur\\'s jawline in his warm palm, his thumb just brushing Arthur\\'s lip. \"I\\'m trying to woo you. Can\\'t you tell?\" \"Yes,\" Arthur said, his voice tight. \"But I can\\'t tell why.\" Eames froze, and his eyes flickered up to Arthur\\'s eyes from where\\'d they\\'d been resting on his mouth. \"Is this about the PASIV?\" he asked, a thread of anger underlying the question. \"That\\'s what I want to know.\" Eames dropped his hand and leaned back out of Arthur\\'s space. \"I guess once you finish it, we\\'ll find out.\" Eames stood and took his chair back to the desk, thunking it in place and lowering himself with his back to Arthur. Arthur pulled his other foot up on the bed and contemplated the stretch of muscles under the thin polyester of Eames shirt. They went back to work. \"Did you love him?\" He thought Eames hadn\\'t heard him at first. He drew another line on the passports he was making. \"No.\" There was certainty in his voice. Did you love me? The question was on the tip of his tongue but he couldn\\'t bear to hear the answer to that one. Arthur let it die there and went back to the PASIV.[Chapter 4] \"Oi!\" came the shout from the living room. \"I thought you were taking a break!\" \"I am.\" Arthur directed his answer to his computer screen, putting the finishing touches on a tracking worm for one of Sergio\\'s known associates. He\\'d need to call Jordan after this and make sure he\\'d done it right, and then he could duplicate it across the other aliases he\\'d— \"Arthur. This is not a break.\" Eames\\' head peeked around the corner at Arthur\\'s workstation he\\'d set up on the unused breakfast nook, one half taken over by PASIV pieces and the other with his laptop and research. Arthur blinked up at him. \"What?\" Eames sighed a reprimand at him and walked forward, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. \"I\\'ve got the film queued up and you\\'re still at this same spot. Come on, darling, an actual break won\\'t break anything.\" \"I\\'m not in the same spot,\" Arthur grumbled under his breath, getting up anyway. \"I moved to the other side of the table.\" Eames just handed him the popcorn. It was nice, actually. They hadn\\'t been in London long, but staying in Eames\\' flat, as he\\'d been instructed to call it, was actually kind of nice. Arthur was an expert at living alone, so he\\'d been worried they\\'d drive each other crazy. They\\'d been a little stiff at first, navigating cautiously around each other, but eventually he stopped looking up with Eames entered the room, and Eames made him a cup of coffee if he got up first, and it was… nice. They padded out to the couch in their sock feet, and Eames pushed play while Arthur got settled, taking the snack from him and then passing it back, minus one handful. They didn\\'t touch, and Arthur was grateful for Eames\\' distance. Eames had been very careful, although Arthur could feel his eyes on him every once in a while. And Arthur didn\\'t think at all about Eames in a towel exiting the bathroom. \"Which one is this again?\" Arthur asked in an effort to curb that train of thought before it got going. \"Shh,\" Eames instructed. \"I\\'ve seen it, you haven\\'t.\" They didn\\'t talk for a while, the heist movie Eames had picked keeping their attention. Until Arthur snorted at the horrible gun handling practices of the main character and Eames nodded beside him. \"Going to shoot his mate in the face he keeps doing that.\" Arthur couldn\\'t help but grin at him, but Eames just looked surprised, his mouth full of popcorn. \"Wha?\" \"Nothing,\" Arthur said. \"It was funny.\" \"Hmm,\" Eames said, turning back to the screen. \"Not for his mate. Five pounds says him keeping his finger on the trigger at all times is going to kill someone accidentally.\" \"I thought you\\'d already seen this one.\" Eames shrugged. \"I lied. It sounded familiar.\" Arthur just shook his head. \"Where did you learn about guns?\" he asked, stealing a handful, already pulled out of the movie. Eames licked salt off his lips. \"Same place I learned about dreamshare. Royal Marines.\" It was like shutters being pulled. Eames faced the screen, but Arthur could tell he couldn\\'t see the movie anymore. Arthur pulled a knee up so he could turn slightly and face him better. \"What were the Royal Marines doing with dreamshare?\" \"Probably the same thing as the Army,\" Eames snorted. He paused, choosing his words. \"It was part of the Training Center.\" So they were training new recruits to be soldiers. Sounded familiar. Nothing like shooting someone in the face to turn an 18 year old kid into a hardened veteran. Arthur would have nodded, or groaned his understanding, or commiserated, but Eames was a thousand miles away. He turned down the volume instead. \"What happened?\" Eames breathed out through his nose, long and loud. His fingers twitched, a nervous habit that he quickly stilled by rolling his hand into a fist. Then he reached for the scar on his chin, one thumb drawn across it. Arthur had noticed it the first time he\\'d seen Eames, hidden in stubble but so obvious to him when it hadn\\'t been there before. Then, pulling down the collar of his shirt, Eames showed Arthur another scar on his trapezius muscle. There was one horizontal scar, about three inches long on the front, and another, slightly larger, matching one on the back. \"Jesus,\" Arthur breathed, leaning forward in the dim light to see it better. A knife wound, through and through from what he could tell. It would have required stitches. Eames pulled his shirt closed before Arthur\\'s fingertips could graze the raised scar, an indication he hadn\\'t gotten them. Arthur pulled back, embarrassed that he had almost crossed that particular boundary unsolicited. Eames was still watching the screen without seeing it and ate another piece of popcorn. He didn\\'t say anything else, but Arthur kept staring, expectant, and after a moment, he continued. \"We was mates, he and I. Hooked up a few times, but mostly we just got on.\" Arthur didn\\'t flinch outwardly and Eames kept talking. \"We was supposed to switch off roles, to practicing getting information out of a witness. One of us was supposed to be the informant, one of us was supposed to encourage him to talk. But he said he couldn\\'t hit me, let alone shoot me, it was easier for him if I…\" Eames licked his lips again, and Arthur thought he might be done talking. He placed a hand on Eames\\' forearm and felt the flex of muscle as Eames made another fist. \"Anyway,\" Eames cleared his throat, \"the Lieutenant-Colonel found out he was skipping his turn and came down with us on the next run. And he still couldn\\'t do it. Even with someone insulting him and a bag over my head, he couldn\\'t pull the trigger. Even knowing it wasn\\'t real.\" Eames still didn\\'t turn to face him, jaw clenching and a pain Arthur could only sympathize with in his eyes. \"When we woke up, he lost it. I came over to check on him and he pulled his knife out and spun me round, held it under my chin. He was screaming at our CO, something about being able to do it when it counted, and we were all trying to talk him down. I don\\'t know if he couldn\\'t hear us or if he just didn\\'t want to hear us, but he stabbed me in the shoulder, took the sidearm out of my holster and…\" Eames mimed putting a gun under his chin. \"Pfft.\" Arthur squeezed his forearm, trying to offer reassurance, or solidarity, or something. Just to let him know he wasn\\'t alone. He couldn\\'t tell if Eames felt it or not. Eames took a deep breath. \"And after that, I was done. They said he didn\\'t know he was awake, but he knew. He just,\" Eames deflated a bit, \"he didn\\'t want that to be his reality anymore. And I didn\\'t either.\" Eames finally, finally, turned to face Arthur, lifting his eyebrows, his voice rising. \"So. I asked for my walking papers and they handed them over, no muss, no fuss. I heard the rest of the project didn\\'t last long after that either. Besides, you lot had already jumped ship.\" He grinned at Arthur, already shutting everything else away. But Arthur wasn\\'t done with him. He wasn\\'t going to let that Eames go— the one he knew. The one he finally recognized. \"What was his name?\" Eames looked down at Arthur\\'s hand on his arm and moved to grasp Arthur\\'s fingers in his. He was quiet as he traced them with his other hand, studying them in the flickering lights as the credits rolled. \"It doesn\\'t matter. He\\'s part of my past. And I\\'m more interested in my future.\" Arthur shifted, and Eames met his eyes. \"Do you feel that way about everyone from your past?\" Eames smiled at him, clear-eyed and soft. \"Shite, Arthur. You\\'ve never been in the past for me. You\\'re a constant.\" Arthur closed his eyes as Eames leaned in to kiss him, sweet and slow. It was a kiss that spoke of a hundred movies, a thousand afternoons. And Arthur had wanted to comfort Eames, but it was he who felt known and safe. The mostly empty popcorn bucket tumbled to the floor as Eames\\' bulk pushed him into the couch cushions, except this time they didn\\'t have to worry about cleaning it up before their parents got home. This time, it was up to them if they wanted to stop. And Arthur really, really didn\\'t. He pulled Eames\\' face to him, deepening the kiss, tongues flirting, then exploring. Arthur thought it would feel familiar, but it wasn\\'t. Every electrifying second he was pressed against this man was brand new, and Arthur\\'s entire being was screaming right here, right now. Eames\\' hands roamed Arthur\\'s sides, making their breaths quicken and Arthur knew what he wanted. He wanted the rest of Eames\\' past and all of his present, and maybe, if fate didn\\'t fuck him over, as much of his future as he could get his hands on. He tilted his hips up to rub their groins together and caught Eames\\' groan with his mouth. \"Eames,\" Arthur breathed against his lips, and Eames knew, rocking them together, his tongue mimicking his thrusts. Eames pushed back, both of them breathing hard, and looked into Arthur\\'s eyes. \"Yes, darling?\" \"I want this,\" Arthur said without hesitation. Eames smiled at him, those wonky teeth making his heart skip a beat, and for the first time in a long time, he and fate wanted the same thing. \"Good. Because you\\'re driving me mad. Those basketball shorts of yours make me feel 17 again.\" Arthur grinned. \"Remember that time—\" Eames groaned. \"God, yes. Think about it all the time.\" His length slid along Arthur\\'s and Eames caught Arthur\\'s mouth in a kiss, and Arthur let himself be overwhelmed, let himself take what he wanted, and let himself focus on nothing except making Eames feel good. Even afterward, pressed against Eames\\' too-warm skin, their release pooling between them, he refused to think about how if Eames had given him a name, he could have verified his story. Arthur set up the finished PASIV and decided that fate could just stay over there and he would stay over here and they would get along just fine. No need for hate or bribe attempts, they could just peacefully co-exist without one imposing their will upon another. \"Who\\'s dreaming, love?\" Arthur blinked at the endearment but just passed him the IV line. \"I will. My projections are less likely to freak out if I\\'m running the tests on myself.\" \"Fair enough.\" They hadn\\'t talked about sleeping together, but Eames\\' casual touches were frequent, and he dropped the occasional kiss on Arthur\\'s lips when he handed over his coffee in the morning. It hadn\\'t happened again, and Eames seemed content to wait for Arthur to initiate anything more. But Arthur felt on edge most of the time. In more ways than one. He looked over at Eames, squeezing his fist several times in preparation. He lined up the needle, then set the line down, got an alcohol swab, wiped his wrist, and picked it back up. Then made a fist again. Then lined up the needle. Eames took a deep breath and let it out, slowly. He made a new fist. Took another deep breath. Adjusted his feet. Resettled his weight. Cleared his throat. Lined up the needle. Glanced at Arthur. \"Need some help?\" Arthur asked dryly. Eames flashed him a bright smile. \"Nope, right as rain.\" Arthur watched him complete this entire charade again before sighing and kneeling next to him. \"Guess your mom was wrong. You didn\\'t outgrow it.\" Arthur took the needle out of his hand and grabbed Eames\\' wrist, turning so his body was between Eames and the needle. \"You know, lots of people have trouble with needles. It\\'s nothing to be embarrassed about.\" Eames\\' laugh was only slightly shaky. \"Who\\'s embarrassed?\" Arthur said nothing, just found a vein as quickly and efficiently as possible, pinching the meat of Eames\\' palm between his fingers to take his mind off the sting of the needle. The whole thing took less than ten seconds, and Eames discretely wiped a film of sweat from his brow when Arthur straightened. \"So!\" Eames said sunnily. \"Our first time dreaming together. Anything I should know before we go under?\" He said it with an eyebrow waggle but Arthur\\'s smile was subdued. He looked at Eames, assessing. \"Yes, actually. My security is going to run you down hard.\" Eames only laughed. \"Well, then. I shall lead them on a merry chase, shan\\'t I?\" Arthur\\'s lips twitched, but his hands didn\\'t stop fussing with the dials. He was on a precipice here, and Arthur forced himself to acknowledge what he hadn\\'t been able to look at head-on. The PASIV was done— after this test run, he\\'d know for sure if it worked. If Eames were hanging around just to get his hands on it, this would be it. And them sleeping together would have been nothing but a ploy. Arthur knew exactly what Arthur-from-the-last-12-years would do. He\\'d kick fate in the balls and run before it could get back up. He\\'d pack up the PASIV and prove he could fall off the grid completely. He\\'d start over. He\\'d sell insurance or something, anything to get out of dreamshare. Until he could forget and find someone to fill the void Eames had left so many years ago and widened so recently. Eames gave him a questioning smile, hand held uncomfortably still as he waited for Arthur to start the run. He was so different from who he\\'d been and yet whenever he was nearby, so much of Arthur remembered. He didn\\'t just remember Eames—it was as if he was remembering himself. Arthur didn\\'t want to leave. He side-eyed fate, set the timer on the PASIV, and pushed the button. \"Why, you cheeky bugger,\" was the first thing Arthur heard, and he shook his head to clear it as Eames chuckled. They were standing in his childhood bedroom. Arthur frowned to cover his blush. \"Well, this isn\\'t an office building.\" He turned to see Eames standing in his doorway, his broad shoulders wrapped in a gorgeous dark gray suit, the shirt beneath showing a hint of artistic flair. \"Nice suit,\" Eames beamed at him, and Arthur adjusted the cuffs on the blue Tom Ford he\\'d been drooling over since last fall. \"I know,\" Arthur said, but he preened a little anyway, and Eames looked at him knowingly. Arthur scowled. \"You remember what you\\'re supposed to be looking for?\" \"Of course, darling.\" Arthur tried bouncing a few times, the carpet under his feet exactly as flat as he remembered. \"Physics seems stable enough so far. Give me ten minutes and then start keeping track of any bleeds or tremors or—\" \"I said \\'of course,\\' darling.\" Eames stepped into his personal space, running his hands up Arthur\\'s arms, tracking the magnificent lines of the suit he\\'d dreamed up. \"How much time do we have down here?\" he asked, his voice low, his grin aimed at Arthur\\'s mouth, and Arthur\\'s heart sped up. \"Not enough time for that,\" he warned, and Eames tsked. \"I can be quick,\" he promised, nudging his nose against Arthur\\'s own and sharing his air. \"I know,\" Arthur replied, letting his lips catch on Eames\\', resting there, adding his own teasing to the mix. \"You should be less proud.\" \"Your fault,\" Eames said, a brief press of mouths, then a sweep of his lips over Arthur\\'s. \"You should be more proud.\" Arthur rolled his eyes and allowed himself one short kiss before pulling away. \"Go. See if the bridge is still there. Don\\'t miss anything.\" Arthur watched him duck out the window with a smirk instead of taking the stairs like a normal person and he found himself grinning instead of giving into his anxiety. Then he got to work. He waited for Eames to get into position before he started his litany of building scenarios and environment stability tests, before evaluating projection response. Despite being dropped into the incorrect build, everything else seemed sound. He observed his projections on the street, which were aware of his manipulations but not overly perturbed. He hoped Eames hadn\\'t changed anything too drastically or he\\'d find out the hard way why Arthur had taken the time to warn him. Cobb hadn\\'t believed him the first time they\\'d gone under together, and Arthur hadn\\'t been sorry when Cobb had pushed too far. \"Jesus Christ, Arthur,\" Cobb had woken up panting. \"You kiss your mother with that brain?\" Arthur, who had never been surprised by his projections\\' reactions and liked it that way, just shrugged. Arthur knew what he was getting when he went under. It made it easy to build and made it easy to tell if anyone else was trying to change things. It also made it easy to see if his creation was running smoothly, or if his hardware needed to be adjusted. He checked his watch, writing everything in a notebook he\\'d dreamed up because he tended to remember it better if he could see it in writing. Everything looked clean. He should have been a lot happier about that. But a clean run meant he had to face what was waiting for him topside— a reality he\\'d been avoiding since Eames had first unlocked the door to his flat and shown Arthur inside. He wanted to believe Eames was with him for no reason other than him. He wanted to trust that Eames wouldn\\'t grab the finally finished machine and disappear like the fog. There was, unfortunately, only one way to test Eames\\' trust. So when the timer went off signaling the end of his test run with Eames, Arthur faced the music with trepidation. The world around him, a mix of memories and easy possibilities, started to dissolve, and just before he blinked awake in Eames\\' living room, he smelled it. The waft of sickly sweet scent he\\'d kept locked up tight for years. But trust Eames to bring out the past in him. Eames was watching him when Arthur opened his eyes, his IV already removed. He looked serious, drawn, his hands folded and his elbows on his knees. Arthur, a lump in his throat he didn\\'t want to think about, busied himself disposing of the needles, wiping down the machine, and rolling the lines. He packed up the bottles of Somnacin, closed the PASIV gently, and stowed it under the sofa. When he was done, he faced Eames, ready, he thought, for Eames\\' decision. Eames hadn\\'t moved, held himself taut, and Arthur\\'s throat was closing because he couldn\\'t read the look on Eames\\' face. He didn\\'t want this to be the end, here in London. He hadn\\'t even seen the things Eames had promised him when they arrived, the places where he\\'d finished growing up. Arthur tried not to panic at the thought that Eames was going to apologize, call him \"love\" again, and leave him with nothing. Fate, rather than staying in its corner, was now kicking him in the balls. \"Arthur,\" Eames started, and Arthur wanted to stop him, to shove the PASIV at his barrel chest and tell him he could have it if he just wouldn\\'t talk. Please, don\\'t make it worse. Just take it and go, he wanted to scream. But he didn\\'t. When Eames didn\\'t continue, his eyes on the coffee table and glancing at Arthur hesitantly, Arthur widened his eyes in a pissed off, \"Yeah? What?\" gesture. Eames\\' eyebrows drew together for a flash before he seemed to shrug and said, \"The bridge was there, and the environment was seamless the whole way. I didn\\'t notice any bleeds,\" he continued, and Arthur scrambled for the Moleskine notebook he\\'d left on the coffee table to write it down. \"And the physics stayed steady the whole time, although I felt lighter than I usually do?\" He wasn\\'t… going to take it? The PASIV worked, it was a successful run, and Eames was sitting on the sofa going over the fine points of the dream. \"Uh, yeah,\" Arthur said, his hands trembling although he tried to hide it, \"that\\'s probably because we were working without a sedative, so that makes sense. Any, uh, glitching? Like, in the sky?\" Eames shook his head. \"No glitching or tremors, but Arthur? Did you make any major adjustments just before the time ran out?\" Arthur frowned. \"No?\" The coconut hadn\\'t been a deliberate change. \"Ah. Must have been me, then. Eames raised an eyebrow. \"You were right, darling, your projections don\\'t like me making changes much.\" Arthur gave him an admonishing look. \"What did you do?\" Eames broke out in a grin. \"Let me show you.\"[Chapter 5] Before writing this one, I went back and made a few minor changes to the previous chapter to make it more tonally consistent with the rest of the fic. The second dream was an office building, finally, and Arthur took a deep breath to shake out the nerves. Eames was next to him practically bouncing on his toes and grasped Arthur\\'s arm as soon as he made eye contact. \"Here, come see.\" Eames dragged Arthur through the workspace, projections wandering busily through the area ignoring them for the most part. When Eames pulled him into the men\\'s room and locked the door behind them, Arthur sighed. \"Really, Eames? In a public restroom?\" Eames gave him a devilish grin but just pulled him toward the sinks. \"Just watch.\" He settled himself in front of the mirror, hands braced on the porcelain, an intense focus in his eyes that made the hair on Arthur\\'s neck rise. When Arthur thought about it later, he tried to remember if there was a shimmer, or a sense of something shifting, but there wasn\\'t. Between one breath and the next, Eames\\' familiar visage disappeared and Sergio\\'s face looked out from above Eames\\' gray suit. Arthur made a strangled noise and took a step back. Eames turned to smile at him, and was Eames again. Arthur stepped forward, hands tracking the scruffy jawline, fingers finding the scar on his eyebrow, the line on his chin, the curve of his mouth. Eames let him explore, an indulgent smile on his lips. \"What did you do!?\" Arthur asked, just as the projections started to rattle the door to the bathroom. \"Did you like it, darling?\" Eames asked. \"I can forge more than just documents, turns out.\" \"How? When? Can you do it again?\" Eames laughed and nodded, then turned to the mirror again. The transformation this time was even faster. This time, instead of Sergio, Arthur\\'s mom stood in Eames\\' place. And instead of Eames\\' hair and clothes, she wore the severe pencil skirt suit Arthur remembered from his youth, although now her hair and face showed more signs of wear than the Eames version in front of him. \"Holy shit, you can change their clothes too?!\" Arthur couldn\\'t help himself, he had to reach out and touch the new face in front of him. He could feel the curl of her hair, the way she was just an inch shorter than he was, he could even smell a whiff of her perfume. \"I can\\'t do voices just yet,\" Eames\\' accent lamented from his mother\\'s face, and that was jarring enough to make Arthur drop his hands. \"But I\\'ll get there. A few more test runs, I think.\" Arthur stared at him, amazed and intrigued, as the door squealed under the onslaught from the other side. \"How? When? How? \" In a blink, he was Eames again and he shrugged. \"Dunno, really. I was thinking about how we can create buildings, whole cities, hell, even our clothes when we dream. But we can\\'t create people. I tried to build a person at first, and that didn\\'t go well. I also tried to change my mate into someone else, but that didn\\'t work either. But myself…\" He trailed off and shrugged again. \"I\\'m pants at what you do, Arthur. But I\\'m a rather good liar. I thought I\\'d try my hand at it down here.\" \"Fuck,\" Arthur breathed. \"That\\'s the most amazing thing I\\'ve ever seen.\" Then the door to the bathroom gave way and a flood of Arthur\\'s enraged projections swarmed in, and then they were busy until the timer went off. Blinking awake again in Eames\\' flat, Arthur nearly ripped a hole in his arm when he forgot he was still plugged in and tried to rush to Eames\\' side. Cussing and bleeding, he fired a thousand questions at Eames, who did his best to explain, and after Arthur had written down every scrap of data he could get, he sat back, exhausted. \"My god, Eames. This… does anyone else know you can do this?\" Eames ducked his head as if he were embarrassed, and Arthur boggled at Eames being embarrassed about anything. \"Well, can\\'t do it properly yet, can I?\" He frowned. \"Voices aren\\'t as easy. I\\'ll have to study accents, maybe get a dialect coach—\" \"But Eames,\" Arthur insisted, \"this could change the way we do extractions forever. Christ, Dom would love you until the end of time. Have you tried it real time? Like on a job?\" Eames tilted his head at Arthur and regarded him. \"You\\'re the only one who\\'s seen it, Arthur. You\\'re the only one on this planet who knows.\" And Arthur stilled. He leaned back from where he\\'d been pushing into Eames\\' space, and looked at this man, who he\\'d been learning and remembering, and trying to keep at arm\\'s length at the same time. Eames had given him a secret. Not a personal one. A professional one. One that Eames didn\\'t have to share. \"You didn\\'t have to tell me that.\" Eames shrugged. \"I wanted to.\" \"Why?\" Eames frowned. \"Because I owe you, Arthur. I\\'ve taken so much from you, and I want you to trust me. I know you don\\'t, quite.\" He couldn\\'t quite squash the flare of annoyance he felt. \"What do you expect me to do with this information? I am not a secret keeper. I am a dream criminal.\" Eames smiled slow and easy, despite Arthur\\'s scowl. \"I know. And I am impressed, Arthur, I truly am. Who would have thought you, Mr. Stage Manager of the High School Thespians Troupe, would end up here?\" \"Well,\" Arthur said, straightening his waistcoat, \"some of those skills transferred. Mal is very dramatic.\" Eames barked a laugh. \"I noticed.\" Then his face sobered. \"Listen, about that. I apologize. I never meant to put myself between you and your team.\" Arthur lifted a shoulder, unwilling to admit how much the apology meant to him. \"Eames,\" Arthur said, elbows on his knees, Moleskin rolled between his hands. \"I\\'m serious. I appreciate the trust, but I don\\'t do this alone. I\\'ve always worked with Dom and Mal, and if you\\'re showing me you can…\" \"Forge,\" Eames supplied. \"... forge, the only way I can apply this is with a team.\" Eames leaned back into the couch. \"Well, darling, I may have a confession then about my motives.\" Arthur closed his eyes and sighed. He had been childish to expect anything else. \"I was also hoping that by showing you the forge, it might get me an invitation to your team.\" Arthur looked at his auspicious face and could still see the Eames he had known. He was still the smartass teenager who would crawl through his window or creep his fingers under the hem of Arthur\\'s basketball shorts in the back of the bus. He also saw the Eames he didn\\'t know, the one who hadn\\'t needed to be taught how to be a criminal; he\\'d figured it out all on his own. Well, fuck it. They were both criminals now. And back-of-the-bus-Eames still thought about his basketball shorts. \"And now, Mr. Eames, I will always have to wonder if you ever do anything without an ulterior motive.\" \"Rarely,\" Eames said as he tapped his plush lips, thinking. \"I find that one can usually acquire two birds with one stone, provided they time it right. And who doesn\\'t want two birds?\" Arthur tried not to take that personally. He gave Eames a tight smile. \"I guess you\\'ve got it all figured out then.\" \"Also rare, as it turns out,\" Eames mused. Then he grinned. \"But now that you\\'ve got your PASIV in working order, I can help you with the rest.\" Arthur blinked. \"The rest of what?\" Eames\\' knowing eyes met his. \"Sergio. And his team. I know you\\'re looking for him. Let me help.\" Arthur shifted uncomfortably and rose, moving to the small kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee and give his hands something to do. \"I\\'ve got a few things in place,\" he hedged. Arthur stuffed down the anger which flared when he thought of Sergio. They had fucked once, the second-to-last job they\\'d ever worked together. Arthur hadn\\'t been able to sleep, so he hadn\\'t been able to think , and he wasn\\'t the kind of man to use four resources when he had five. That was all it had been. There were no feelings attached, and yet Arthur was still pissed. He couldn\\'t imagine how Eames felt. He had no idea what their relationship had been like, but Eames had called Sergio \"love,\" and that sounded like something at least. But then he\\'d told Arthur he hadn\\'t been in love. And now he was offering to help track him down. \"You do know what I plan on doing once I locate him, right? It\\'s not going to be a nice, civil discussion.\" \"Trust me, pet,\" Eames said, arm across the back of the sofa as he watched Arthur. \"I owe him one. Maybe even two.\" \"His name was Bugs,\" Eames said, his voice coming out of the dark just as Arthur started to wonder if he should go back to his own bed. Arthur looked over at Eames, the teal-blue glow of the alarm clock numbers bouncing off his skin. \"Well, Victor Martin, but everyone just called him Bugs.\" Eames\\' eyes were far away, a tiny, wistful smile on his face. \"He was in training with me, so I knew him all the way up. Wicked smart, funny, never lost a hand of poker he didn\\'t mean to.\" Arthur said nothing, afraid to break the spell darkness and closeness had wrought. \"I was a bit in love with him, actually,\" Eames admitted, sounding embarrassed. \"The only man who could rival you, Arthur.\" He turned to look at Arthur then, the light shining off his smile. \"I\\'m sorry,\" Arthur said, brushing aside Eames\\' deflection, and he meant it. Eames rolled closer, his fingers on Arthur\\'s shoulder, tracing down his side. \"\\'S okay,\" he hummed. \"How could I think of anyone else when I\\'ve got you in my bed again? Color me surprised that it happened at all,\" he chuckled. He dropped a kiss on Arthur\\'s skin. \"Do you think it could ever be the same between us? Or are we too different now?\" It seemed rhetorical, as Eames kissed his way down Arthur\\'s lax body, no intent, just touching, tasting, for the joy of it. Until that moment, Arthur thought Eames already believed it was the same. \"I don\\'t know,\" he answered honestly, wishing it wasn\\'t the truth. \"But I look at you, and sometimes you don\\'t seem different at all.\" Eames smiled against his skin, hovering over Arthur\\'s back. \"What can I say. You make me feel like a bloody teenager again.\" He kissed the dip of Arthur\\'s spine. \"Sometimes you seem the same as you were.\" He kissed his way even lower. \"And sometimes, you\\'re brand new.\" \"Yeah?\" Arthur asked over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised. Eames\\' grin shone. \"Yeah. I like it.\" Arthur snorted. \"Yeah, well my refractory period isn\\'t the same.\" He was ignoring how Eames\\' kisses seemed to be making a liar out of him. Eames gave a small shrug, still grinning. \"Doesn\\'t matter. I don\\'t have a curfew anymore.\" Eames\\' face was buried in the bedding, deep breaths in the darkness, and Arthur eased himself off the mattress, making sure Eames\\' slow breaths stayed even. He eased Eames\\' door closed behind him and with a bitter taste in his mouth, did what he knew Eames expected him to do. He looked up information about Bugs. He found information with simple web searches, easy and obvious documenting of his service and a public obit. He was good looking— blonde with a wide grin and slight buck teeth, and he looked painfully young. And Arthur, hating himself, knew everything he found would have been exceedingly easy to plant. There was nothing he couldn\\'t have duplicated given a day or two prep time, and as he told himself to drop it. Just believe him , he told himself, even as he picked up a burner phone and dialed, you want to believe him. \" Hello?\" \"Hello, is this Mrs. Martin?\" \" ... Yes, who is this?\" \"I\\'m sorry to call so late, ma\\'am. I just wanted to tell you that I\\'m sorry about your son.\" There was a pause on the other end, and this was it. Either she knew what he was talking about, or she didn\\'t. \" ... who did you say this was?\" \"I didn\\'t,\" Arthur said, his stomach sinking. \"My name is Alexander.\" \" Well, Alexander,\" she said, and Arthur held his breath. \" I appreciate you calling. You know, it\\'s been years, but grief doesn\\'t exactly have a stopwatch, does it?\" Arthur tried to breathe normally. \"No, ma\\'am.\" She sighed. He could picture her settling back into a recliner, rearranging the crocheting on her lap. \" Other people forget, after a while. But for me, it\\'s something I have to re-face every time I wake up. I suppose you know what I mean, if you\\'re calling me now, after all this time. How did you know my Victor, Alexander?\" \"I didn\\'t know him well, actually. I\\'m just familiar with the circumstances in which he passed, and I thought I would—\" \" You are?\" she interrupted, sounding alert, and Arthur kicked himself. \" Could you tell me what happened? No one would tell us anything, and we\\'ve been waiting so long for them to declare the files unclassified. We just want some closure, you know?\" \"I… well,\" Arthur grimaced, \"I\\'m not at liberty to say, exactly…\" \" Are you part of the declassification committee?\" \"Yes, exactly. I\\'m part of the committee. We haven\\'t come to any conclusions, but I just wanted to extend my sincere apologies for your loss.\" She sounded a bit stiff as she said, \" Thank you.\" Arthur hesitated, then said, \"I have to go now, but… I wanted you to know that Bugs, I mean Victor, at the end… he was surrounded by people who cared about him. He wasn\\'t alone.\" He could hear her crying and he waited, uncomfortable, until she managed to say, \" Thank you .\" He murmured a response and hung up, and then jumped out of his skin when Eames spoke up from the darkened doorway. \"Couldn\\'t wait until the morning, hmm?\" He didn\\'t look angry, but Arthur watched him warily. \"You knew when you gave me his name I was going to check.\" \"Suppose I did, at that,\" he murmured. He approached Arthur, and ran a dry palm over Arthur\\'s bare shoulder. \"Want a coffee?\" \"Uh,\" Arthur looked at the clock. \"It\\'s 2am.\" Eames moved through the kitchen anyway, preparing the machine with slow, deliberate movements. \"Won\\'t be able to sleep anyway.\" Arthur closed his eyes and wanted to cuss. \"Alright, yeah, I guess.\" He felt like he\\'d been handed a test, and then when he passed, the teacher looked like he\\'d let him down. When it was ready, Eames brought him a mug and settled on the far end of the couch, his sinful lips blowing across the top of his own. Arthur sipped at his, cream and sugar even though he hadn\\'t taken it like that in years, and he decided it was actually okay. It made him feel warm and content, not wired and on edge like the black coffee he drank to the dregs on jobs. \"I\\'ve wanted to do that for years,\" Eames said, lighthearted and casual. Arthur looked up, confused. \"Do what?\" \"Ring his mum,\" he said. \"Now I realize I probably just should have. So thank you.\" Arthur huffed. \"You really shouldn\\'t be thanking me.\" \"Mmm,\" Eames hummed around his coffee, \"no, probably not. But I\\'m sure she appreciated the call, and so I do too.\" Arthur fiddled with the handle of his mug, guilt and righteousness warring in his belly. \"Eames,\" he started, and Eames looked up at him like they were discussing the weather. Arthur sighed. \"I want to believe you. I thought that checking everything would let me do that, but it\\'s just making me more paranoid, and I can\\'t…\" I can\\'t keep doing this, he wanted to say. I can\\'t keep searching for you in a different body for the rest of my life. I can\\'t bring myself to distrust you completely, not when you trust me. Not when I want to give you everything. Eames just watched him, letting the silence stretch. Arthur licked his lips and swallowed. \"I can\\'t keep tracking down every single thing you say. I don\\'t have time for that and it\\'s time to put our cards on the table.\" Eames appeared unperturbed and Arthur took a breath. \"Do you want the PASIV?\" Eames cocked his head like a puppy and waited. \"I mean,\" Arthur said, scooting toward the front of his chair and setting the mug on the table in front of him, \"if that\\'s why you\\'re here, you have a choice. You can take it and go, and I will put you at the bottom of my list, after Sergio and his team. Or you can stay, and I will trust you, and I will vouch for you to Dom.\" Eames didn\\'t move except to take another sip of his coffee. Arthur fidgeted. \"Say something.\" He didn\\'t at first and Arthur would need to breathe soon so when he finally started talking, Arthur felt a little lightheaded. \"Do you know why I kept on? After Bugs?\" Arthur gaped. \"What do you mean?\" Surely he couldn\\'t have considered... \"I mean in dreamshare. Why I kept going under, even with the violence and the needles and memories?\" Arthur frowned, considering. He thought about why he kept dreaming, despite the all those things Eames listed, and a few of his own. \"Because there\\'s nothing else like it,\" he finally said, his voice thin. \"Yes. Because you know everytime you dream, you\\'re not going to get that experience anywhere else, not in a thousand lifetimes. You were like that for me too.\" Arthur jerked his eyes to Eames\\'. Eames sipped his coffee, his face hard, and said, \"I would have done just about anything to get another chance at either. But dreaming was the only one I thought possible. And now, here you sit, offering me only one of those, but with either a threat of violence or begrudging trust.\" He frowned. \"You are not the same man, Arthur. You used to love with your whole being. What in God\\'s name happened to you?\" Arthur felt stung. He scowled. \"You happened to me, you asshole. You left and you stopped talking to me. Or did you forget that part? \\'You would have done anything,\\' bullshit. It\\'s not like you tried to find me. My mom still lives in the same damn house. She kept the landline.\" Eames didn\\'t deny it, but he didn\\'t soften either. \"And now?\" \"Now, what?\" Arthur barked, and refused to cross his arms. \"Now we\\'ve fucked, and you told me secrets specifically for the express purpose of getting me to trust you, so how could I not! How is that even possible.\" He glared his sarcasm. And Eames, god damn him, was too hard to read. He licked his lips and drained the rest of his drink. \"I won\\'t ask what it\\'ll take because I don\\'t believe you even know. If you figure it out, you let me know.\" ","Summary":" A/N: This is a work in progress, but I have about this much more already written.

Dominic Cobb sat at the small, cozy coffee shop, waiting for his guest. He fidgeted with his hands, the coffee not helping calm his nerves. All he wanted was to return home, play with his kids, put them down to sleep, and relax in his own dreams. His own personal reality. All alone with her. Mal. Arthur walked into the coffee shop, and looked around for Dom. After locking eyes with him, he straightened his brown tie, and walked to the table. The two colleagues sat in silence while the barista brought Arthur a cup of coffee. Arthur sipped from his cup before starting conversation. \"So, are we going to talk about this?\" Arthur started. \"What is there to talk about?\" \"You know exactly what I\\'m talking about. You\\'ve been visiting Mal again, haven\\'t you?\" Cobb stared into the air. He had been visiting his dead wife, but to admit that to Arthur would show it was his weakness. \"What if I have been? It\\'s not like before, when I was risking the team\\'s lives.\" \"You\\'re hurting yourself, Dom. Living in Retention is only going to cause you to lose your grip on what is real and what isn\\'t.\" \"I can take care of myself, Arthur. I have a grasp on this.\" Arthur sipped his coffee again before continuing. \"Does Avery know?\" Dom breathed deeply. \"No, why would she?\" \"I thought you would have told her.\" \"Unless you told her, Arthur, which I would not put past you, she has no idea.\" \"You should tell her, Dom.\" \"What she doesn\\'t know won\\'t hurt her.\" Dom threw his money on the table and grabbed his coat. \"I\\'ll see you around, Arthur.\" he said as her stormed out. Eames, Arthur, Ariadne, and Yusuf all met in the house they had dedicated to meeting. It was a small house, only one level. The group decided to purchase it after they all made the decision to remain in LA. It was a mutual decision to purchase the property, as a way for them to meet in the occasion they needed to retreat to the dream world. Arthur had called them to meet on this occasion. Arthur stood up. \"Guys, we have a problem.\" Eames smirked. \"Arthur if you\\'re talking about the stick that is stuck up your ass, that\\'s only a problem for you. It\\'s entertainment for the rest of us.\" Arthur glared at him. \"I\\'m talking about Cobb. He\\'s getting worse. He\\'s living through Retention.\" Ariadne looked puzzled. \"What\\'s he doing?\" \"He\\'s dreaming only to dream of Mal. That has become his reality.\" \"So what are we supposed to do about it?\" \"There\\'s only one way to permanently get rid of her.\" Eames added. \"And that is…?\" \"Kill Mal in Dom\\'s subconscious\" Arthur said coldly. \"How can you do that?\" Ariadne questioned further. \"We would need to have Dom asleep for a long period of time. We\\'d have to kill her on each level of his subconscious. Ariadne, you said she\\'s on every floor of a building in his mind, correct?\" \"Yeah, his subconscious is kind of like a hotel.\" \"We\\'re going to need another extractor, if Dom is going to be distracted.\" Eames added. Arthur sighed. \"I may have an idea of who can help us.\" Eames connected the dots. \"Arthur, do you think she\\'ll come?\" \"He\\'s her brother, Eames. My guess is she will.\" Ariadne looked puzzled as Arthur walked into another room. \"Who is he calling?\" \"Dom\\'s sister,\" Eames said. \"Avery.\" Avery walked as the 8 year-olds danced across her studio\\'s dance floor. \"Toes out, girls. Toes out!\" she said as they continued to move to the snapping of her fingers. The girls reached their final pose and smiled brightly. Avery smiled as well. \"Great job, ladies. Grab a drink, and be back in five.\" The girls ran to their water bottles, as Avery\\'s phone began to ring. Arthur walked into the kitchen and took out his phone. He began to search through his contacts. Did he still have her number? Did he delete it to forget her? No, he didn\\'t. He reached her name. Avery Cobb. He sighed, and called her number. Here goes nothing , he thought. Avery looked at the name across her phone. Arthur. She sighed before accepting the call. \"Hello,\" her voice sounded shaky as she answered. \"Avery?\" \"Yes, that\\'s my name.\" \"It\\'s Arthur,\" \"No shit.\" \"This is serious, Ave. Dom\\'s in trouble.\" \"What happened?\" \"He…he\\'s living in Retention.\" \"With Mal?\" \"Who else would it be?\" \"So, what exactly am I supposed to do about this?\" \"We need your help. There\\'s a team of us that wants to fix this, but we need a fifth. You were the first person I thought of.\" \"Arthur, I have a life here. I can\\'t just fly to Paris-\" \"We\\'re in Los Angeles.\" \"How long have you been here?\" \"About six months.\" \"And neither you nor my brother thought to call me and let me know this?\" \"Your brother probably didn\\'t want to concern you with this. I, on the other hand, thought you wouldn\\'t answer your phone if I called.\" \"I would have answered, Arthur.\" \"And now I know this. But, please, Avery, meet me and the team for coffee. I know you love your brother more than anything, and he really needs our help.\" \"Text me a time and place and I\\'ll be there.\" \"And Avery?\"\"Yes?\" There was a brief pause. \"It\\'s nice to hear your voice again.\" Avery hung up her phone, and waited for an incoming text from Arthur. R&R.; Peace. Love. Lauren.[Chapter 2] Thank you for reading! Here\\'s the next chapter. Arthur, Ariadne, Eames, and Yusuf sat at the café where Arthur and Dom had previously met. It was busy, a typical Saturday afternoon. \"So,\" Ariadne started. \"What does she look like?\" \"She\\'s probably wearing heels,\" Eames started. \"Brown hair, unless she dyed it. Medium length, unless she cut it.\" He noticed Arthur staring into the distance. He looked to where Arthur was staring. He noticed a familiar face, ordering her coffee. Avery stood there, wearing a grey short-sleeved sweater dress that hit mid thigh. Her patterned tights led to her black patent leather pumps. She looked over to the table and noticed Arthur staring, the same look he had given her when they had last seen each other. Eames gave her a friendly wave. She waved back and made her way to the table. \"Nice to see you, Ave\" Eames greeted her as she took a seat. \"Thank you, nice to see you too.\" Her gaze switched to Arthur. \"Hello, Arthur.\" \"Hello, Avery\" he said. \"As he said this, Avery\\'s arms began to feel chilled. His voice always did that to her. \"So, who are the newbies?\" \"This is Ariadne, an architect, and Yusuf, a chemist.\" Eames introduced. \"Very nice to meet you two. Now, what is going on with my brother?\" \"His mind functions like a hotel.\" Ariadne started. \"On each floor is a different memory of Mal,\" Arthur added. \"We need to kill her on each floor-\" \"to erase her from his subconscious.\" Avery finished. \"Are you sure that will work?\" Ariadne asked. \"Killing her in his subconscious means he can have memories, but not live in Retention. This means he won\\'t be able to just dream about her. He will remember her, just not in his dreams.\" Avery explained. \"So you\\'ll do it?\" Eames asked. \"You\\'ll help us?\" \"Here is where things get complicated,\" Avery started. \"First, the question is whether or not I will do it. I can get into my brother\\'s subconscious. That doesn\\'t mean will . Second, when I get there, the question is no longer will I kill Mal, it is can I kill her. I want to stop my brother living in Retention, but I may not be able to kill her.\" \"Can I just ask a question?\" Ariadne asked. \"Sure, go ahead.\" \"What exactly is Retention?\" Avery looked at Arthur. \"You haven\\'t showed her Retention?\" \"No, it\\'s too risky.\" Avery looked back to Ariadne. \"Why don\\'t I show you what Retention is?\" Arthur and Eames looked at each other, \"I don\\'t know if that\\'s such a good idea, Ave.\" Eames responded. \"You don\\'t think Dom trained his sister to be smarter at dreaming than he is? It is possible to have a harmless retention dream. The point is to know how. Let\\'s go back to your lab, and I\\'ll enlighten Ariadne to the world my brother is living in.\" Avery walked into the ranch style house with the others. Eames and Arthur began to set up the dream machines. Yusuf went to watch some television. Ariadne and Avery sat down, waiting to be hooked up to the machines. Avery smiled. \"It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve done this.\" \"How long?\" \"About a year.\" Arthur began to hook up the women to the machines. \"You sure you\\'re good to go under?\" he asked. \"Give us five minutes. It shall only take that long.\" The girls closed their eyes as they entered Avery\\'s dream. Ariadne and Avery found themselves on a warm beach. The setting was clear, no one was around. Ariadne saw two figures in the distance, a man and a woman. The man and woman were sitting on the shore line, laughing as the small waves would crash against their legs. Avery walked until she was next to Ariadne. \"I probably should preface my Retention explanation by letting you know that Arthur and I used to be a \\'thing\\'.\" \"I kind of guessed that. What happened?\" \"Life got in the way. Now, Retention is reliving memories through dreams. This can be harmless: remembering something in order to gain information, to remember something you may have forgotten. When you lean on Retention to relive memories of, say, a dead loved one, that is when Retention becomes dangerous. When you begin to bring people back, you blur what is reality and what isn\\'t, which is what my brother is doing. You have to be a very sane person to successfully dream using Retention and my brother is not very sane right now.\" Ariadne thought for a moment. \"So, how is this a Retention dream?\" Avery smiled. \"Look closely at the two figures over there.\" Ariadne looked closer, and began to recognize the facial features of both Avery and Arthur. \"I\\'ve never seen Arthur smile like that.\" Ariadne pointed out. Avery sighed. \"So I\\'ve been told by many.\" \"How long did you two date for?\" \"Almost a year.\" \"How long has it been since you\\'ve seen him?\" Avery paused. \"About ten months.\" Just then, the sound of a French woman came into their ears. \"Almost done.\" Avery said. \"Do you have anymore questions?\" \"No, I think I understand it. I just hope Cobb will be alright with this.\" \"What he doesn\\'t know we have planned won\\'t hurt him.\" Ariadne saw Avery\\'s gaze, which was upon the figures of herself and Arthur in the distance. She watched as she relived her and Arthur, beginning to kiss, the two of them laughing underneath their embrace. Ariadne noticed Avery\\'s change of emotion. Avery looked to Ariadne, a glaze of anger in Avery\\'s eyes. \"If this dream wasn\\'t so close to ending,\" Avery said. \"I would ask you to kill me right now.\" Avery and Ariadne both awoke in the house. Avery ripped the tube from her arm and rushed into another room. Arthur tried to stop her, but failed. \"What happened?\" he asked. \"I bet you already know.\" Ariadne said coldly. Arthur became confused as Ariadne followed after Avery. She found Avery standing in the kitchen, digging something out of her pocket. Avery pulled out a small, purple, wooden high-heeled shoe. She placed it on the table and pushed it down. She picked it up and placed on the table again, before pushing it over once more. She breathed a sigh of relief. Ariadne looked worried. \"Are you alright?\" Avery looked up at her, breathing deeply. \"Yeah, I\\'m fine. It\\'s just…damn, even the strongest and sanest of us can become weak at times. Dreams just have to find our blind spot and BAM! We\\'re gone in a matter of seconds.\" R&R.; Peace. Love. Lauren.[Chapter 3] Hey guys! This chapter is a bit shorter, but the next one will be longer. I\\'m thinking of adding a slight Dom/Ariadne love angle in this story, and it\\'s hinted at in this chapter. So, I hope you guys are cool with that. The story will still focus on the Arthur/Avery love story, though. Enjoy! After regaining her sanity in the kitchen, Avery walked into the living room and sat next to Yusuf. \"So, you\\'re a chemist?\" \"Yes, I am. What exactly are you?\" \"I forge, I extract, sometimes I design. I just come along for the ride and help where I\\'m needed. So, listen, I need your help.\" \"With what?\" \"I need to get two people asleep for a short amount of time. Probably an hour or so.\" \"That should be easy enough.\" \"But I need them asleep so I can go into their dreams to see exactly what is in their subconscious.\" \"Why do you need to do this?\" \"First off, I want to get into my brother\\'s mind to see for myself how bad his Retention really is. Second, I just really want to see what\\'s going on in Arthur\\'s mind.\" \"Why do you need Arthur\\'s mind?\" Avery was getting annoyed. \"I just need to see his dreams. Now, can you do it or not?\" \"I\\'ll formulate a compound. When do you need it by?\" \"Tonight, please. From what I heard, Arthur told Dom I came to visit. He will be joining us for dinner.\" Dom Cobb walked up the driveway, anxious about seeing his sister. He didn\\'t want to face telling her about how he declined from when they had last seen each other. Arthur seemed to sound neutral on the phone when Dom had heard from him. He knew Arthur had genuinely loved his sister, but he agreed with Arthur when their relationship had begun to get in the way of work. He straightened his jacket and rang the doorbell. Ariadne answered the door, and when Cobb saw her, he smiled. She was a breath of fresh air, a light in the dim world of dream sharing. Whenever he was around her, time seemed to pass slower, the way it did when Mal was around. Ariadne smiled. \"Hello, Cobb.\" \"Hello, Ariadne.\" \"Come on in.\" Cobb walked in, and looked around the house. \"You guys cleaned up this place nicely.\" \"It was Arthur\\'s doing.\" Avery walked out of the kitchen into the room where Dom stood. She smiled. \"It\\'s been too long, Dom.\" she said as she walked to her brother and embraced him with a hug. \"It\\'s good to see you again, Ave. What brings you back?\" \"I miss the dream world too much. Now, shall we have dinner?\" The group made their way to the dining room. With the food that had been in the house, Avery was able to through together a lasagna. Arthur brought it to the table as everyone began to take their seats. Dom sat at one head of the table, and Eames sat at the other. Yusuf and Ariadne subconsciously sat next to each other, leaving the two spots on the other side of the table. Avery realized what had just happened and blatantly rolled her eyes as she sat. Ariadne mouthed \"Sorry\" across the table as Arthur took his spot next to Avery. The group ate in silence until Eames decided to break the ice. \"So, Avery, how are the men in LA? Do they please you the same way our dear Arthur did?\" Arthur gulped the wine he had been drinking. Dom, Ariadne, and Yusuf all sat in shock, waiting to hear a response. Avery, who was about to take a bite of food, placed her full fork on her plate and turned to face Eames. \"For your information, Eames, I haven\\'t been dating since Arthur and I went our separate ways. So, to answer your question, no.\" \"What happened to you two?\" Eames pressed further. \"I always caught you two sneaking off in the middle of missions, and in real life come to think of it.\" Arthur wiped his mouth with his napkin. \"We decided to go our separate ways.\" Avery looked at Arthur in disgust. \" YOU decided to go YOUR own way. Our break up was anything but mutual.\" \"You said you wanted your dance career.\" \"In addition to working with you guys. I could have had the best of both worlds!\" \"Leaving your own studio for multiple days at a time? THAT\\'S professional.\" \"You told me you didn\\'t want me to become another Mal.\" Dom stood up and stormed out. \"I\\'m going for a walk.\" he said. \"Shit,\" Avery muttered. \"What\\'s wrong?\" Eames asked. \"I had Yusuf develop me a compound that would knock him out. He\\'ll be down in a few minutes, and the last thing I need is that happening outside.\" Arthur slumped in his chair as she said this. \"What\\'s wrong with him?\" Eames asked again. He looked at Avery\\'s face. Her gaze shifted away from him. \"You drugged him, too?\" \"Think of it as an experiment. We have an hour to get this done. Drag him into the living room. I\\'ll meet you there.\" R&R.; Peace. Love. Lauren.[Chapter 4] Here\\'s chapter 4, everyone! It\\'s a little less detail oriented that I thought I was going for, but I had a hard time figuring out how to put all the details I wanted into words. Some of what I wrote might be confusing, so I hope it wasn\\'t too bad. Hope you guys like it! The team fixed Cobb and Arthur up in two of the chairs in the living room. \"How much time is left before they wake up?\" Avery asked. \"45 minutes.\" Yusuf responded. \"Ok, give me 30 minutes for Dom, and set up 10 minutes for Arthur. I\\'m gonna need that 5 minute buffer.\" \"Alright, is Eames going with you?\" \"No, I want Ariadne with me.\" Avery and Ariadne hooked up to the dream sharing machine. \"I feel weird doing this. Will he know we\\'re in there with him?\" Ariadne asked. \"If he finds us.\" Avery said. \"Think of it as dream creeping.\" The two fell asleep and awoke in an elevator. Avery looked at the buttons. \"Now,\" she questioned. \"Do I start at the top, or the bottom?\" Ariadne pushed the basement button. \"Probably should get the worst over with first.\" The elevator sent them down into the basement. Avery recognized the room. \"This hotel,\" Avery said as she stepped out of the elevator. \"I\\'ve been here before. Dom wanted me to help him set up the suite for their anniversary.\" Avery saw Mal sitting on the sofa, no yet noticing Avery or Ariadne. She motioned to Ariadne to move as slowly, quickly, and quietly as possible. They had not noticed that Dom had entered the room. \"Avery?\" he questioned, noticing her. \"Shit,\" Avery mouthed to herself. She turned to face Dom and Mal, both of them now staring at her. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked. \"Seeing how far gone you are. Arthur was right.\" \"What did he tell you?\" \"Enough to concern me. I need to see more, now.\" Avery walked quickly to the elevator, closing the door as she got in. She didn\\'t know that Ariadne was in there as well, until she looked behind herself. \"God damn it, Ariadne,\" she breathed. \"You scared me.\" \"Sorry, where to next?\" Avery and Ariadne spent the remainder of the time in Dom\\'s mind exploring the rest of his subconscious. On each floor lived a different memory. The music of a French woman signaled the dream was headed toward collapsing upon itself. Avery opened her eyes, and Ariadne awoke seconds later. Avery rubbed her eyes and took a few deep breaths. \"Now to Arthur,\" she said out loud. Ariadne began to hook herself up to the machine, but Avery stopped her. \"This one I need to do myself,\" she said. Ariadne nodded and unhooked herself. Eames walked over to Avery. \"You sure you will be alright?\" he asked. \"As sure as I will every be.\" She closed her eyes and Yusuf started the machine. Avery found herself on a street in the pouring rain. She observed her surroundings: tall buildings, taxi cabs, billboards surrounding her. \"I know this place,\" she said out loud. She walked a block or so before finding what she had been looking for. She saw her predictions coming true. Arthur stood on the corner across from her, and the figure next to him was herself. They had been in the middle of a job, and Arthur had stolen her away, the two of them sneaking off. Avery knew exactly the conversation that was coming. She found herself mailbox to hide behind. She knew Retention came in two different forms: dreamers participating in the dreams themselves, or dreamers watching the memories from afar. She had no idea which type Arthur was, and needed to make sure she could observe the entire scene. She began to listen in on the conversation, carefully thinking so she could note which type of Retention this was. She watched as Arthur kissed her passionately in the rain, his arms locked on the small of her back, her arms around his neck. The kiss was broken, and the two smiled at each other. \"I love you, Avery.\" Arthur said. \"I love you, Arthur.\" the projection of Avery said. \"I want grow old with you Avery. I-\" \"I feel the same way, Arthur.\" \"That\\'s not just it though. I want to marry you. I know the whole cliché \\'American dream\\', and I know that for us, it\\'s a little different. I know you won\\'t be the housewife, but you\\'ll be my colleague. But I want the house, and the kids, and the white picket fence. I want it all.\" Avery, still sitting behind her mailbox, knew how this conversation went. This conversation had been glued into her brain. Not only because this conversation meant the world to her, but because it was only two weeks before her and Arthur ended their relationship. Avery knew, from the content of the conversation she had observed, that Arthur was reliving this memory in this subconscious. She knew that meant Arthur himself is watching the whole thing from somewhere in close proximity. Avery began to stand up, not caring if Arthur found her in his dream. She stood on the corner, across from the projections of herself and Arthur. She began to tear up as she knew the next part of the conversation. The projection of herself smiled at Arthur. In unison, Avery and her projection said, \"Don\\'t forget the stereotypical dog. It wouldn\\'t be the true \\'American dream\\' without it.\" \"Avery!\" She heard Arthur\\'s voice coming from her right. At this time, the projections of her and Arthur had resumed their embrace, kissing once again. Avery turned to her right, the tears streaming down her cheeks, her face forming a scowl. Her brown hair was soaked against her neck. Arthur looked at her from across the street, pain forming in his face. \"What are you doing here, Ave?\" he asked, as he crossed the street to her. \"Figuring out you\\'re a lying bastard.\" she said. \"How did I lie to you?\" \"Oh, I don\\'t know, maybe by breaking up with me, and months later living in Retention. You could have had me, Arthur. I was ready to marry you, I was ready to settle down and spend forever with you, and you gave it up. Now you\\'re reliving the past?\" \"Avery-\" \"No, just stop it. Just stop it! I want out. I want out!\" Arthur continued to try to hold her back, but Avery turned to find a knife sitting on the mailbox. She walked over to the mailbox, took the knife in her hands, and, while Arthur continued to try to talk to her, stabbed herself in the chest. Avery awoke, gasping for breath as she did. Eames and Yusuf rushed over to her. \"What the hell, Avery? You had a minute and a half left.\" \"I couldn\\'t take it anymore, I needed out. Now let me go!\" She ripped the tube out of her arm, and ran into the kitchen. She reached the kitchen, digging her totem out of her pocket. She knocked down the shoe, and it knocked over just as it normally did. Out of frustration, Avery, the tears now streaming down her face again, picked up the totem and threw it across the kitchen. She slid down the cabinet behind her and let the tears fall as she sat on the floor. Ariadne walked into the room, and put her arm around Avery. Avery leaned her head into Ariadne\\'s shoulder as she cried. Dom and Arthur woke up simultaneously. Arthur looked over to Dom, confused as to why he was asleep. Dom looked to Arthur. \"So you told Avery? About Mal?\" Arthur sighed. \"She needed to know.\" Arthur stood up from his chair, and went to Eames. \"Where\\'s Ave?\" Eames looked at him. \"Kitchen, but it\\'s probably not smart to go in there right now.\" Arthur ignored Eames\\' warning and walked to the kitchen. He looked in to see Avery and Ariadne on the floor. \"Avery?\" Arthur said, quietly. Avery looked up, and Arthur was taken aback. He looked into her eyes, noticing the pain behind her brown beauties. Her eyes were red and swollen, obviously from crying quite a bit. But in those eyes, he noticed not only pain, but anger. Anger toward him. Toward what she had just seen in his subconscious. Arthur took the hint from Ariadne\\'s pleading eyes, and left the room. R&R.; Peace. Love. Lauren.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5! Here we go! Avery was trying to sleep, but that wasn\\'t coming easily. She continued to toss and turn as the night went on. All she could think about was what she had seen. Dom\\'s constant memories of Mal. And Arthur…Arthur\\'s thoughts and memories of her. Eventually, enough was enough. Avery grabbed one of her pillows and walked to a room down the hall. She paused before she knocked on the door. She figured out that knocking was the only way any progress was going to get made. She knocked on the door. It took a few seconds, but Avery began to hear movement from behind the door. The door opened, and Arthur\\'s figure appeared in the doorway. From the look of his face, he hadn\\'t been sleeping either. \"I can\\'t sleep.\" Avery said. \"Me neither. Want to come in?\" Arthur opened the door a little extra to let her in. Avery came into the room. It reminded her of the apartment he had in London that she was far too familiar with. Avery continued into the room and sat on Arthur\\'s bed. She placed her pillow on the right side of the bed. To her surprise, he still slept on the same side of the bed he did when they were together. Arthur took a seat next to her. \"So,\" Avery started. \"Who should talk first?\" \"You. You know I\\'m not as talented with words as you are.\" \"Alright. So, I just want to know why you ended the relationship and then now you\\'re falling into the same path my brother is on. It scared me, Arthur. I don\\'t want to you to become him. So, if me being here is causing this, I\\'ll pack my things and be on my way. I trust you to deal with Dom\\'s issues.\" \"Avery, that\\'s not the case. Have I missed you? Yes. Have I been living in Retention? No. That\\'s the first vivid Retention dream I have had. Now let me explain everything to you. You have your own ambitions, some that don\\'t involve this world. I left the relationship because I wanted you to be able to live out your own ambitions, not the ones your brother and I have.\" \"I never felt like I was being forced into anything, Arthur.\" \"Look at you. You have your own dance studio; you\\'ve done exactly what you wanted to do with your life.\" \"I could have done this with you.\" Arthur knew she was right. He had no way to explain to her that he was scared. That he left their relationship, not because he wanted her to live her dreams. He knew she was \"the one\". He just wasn\\'t convinced that she felt the same way. He knew she loved him, he just didn\\'t know if it was as strong of a bond as he felt with her. \"Ave, I don\\'t know what else to say-\" Avery picked up her pillow, and began to walk out of the room. \"Well, I guess I better get going.\" She walked out of the room, closing the door lightly behind her. Arthur ran his hands through his hair, sighing. What was supposed to be one step forward ended up being five steps backwards. The next morning, Avery woke up after not sleeping more than an hour or so. She stumbled into the kitchen, rubbing her eyes. There, she found Dom, sitting at the island in the kitchen, eating a bowl of cereal, reading the latest newspaper. She grabbed a bowl and poured herself the same breakfast. \"How did you sleep?\" Avery asked, beginning conversation. \"Fine,\" Dom said, coldly. He looked at her. \"You look like hell.\" \"Thanks, bro. Means a lot.\" \"I take it you didn\\'t sleep well.\" \"What gave it away?\" The two went silent for a few minutes, eating away at their cereal. Dom decided to break the silence. \"Avery, about the Retention-\" Avery interrupted. \"You\\'re really far gone, Dom. Further than I had originally thought.\" \"I can handle this.\" \"No, you can\\'t. You\\'re going to end up compromising an important job and end up harming one of your colleagues. What about Arthur, Eames, Yusuf?\" \"They know the risks of the job.\" \"What about Ariadne?\" Dom looked up, and looked directly at Avery. She knew she had hit a nerve dropping Ariadne\\'s name. She could tell there was a connection between the two of them, she just didn\\'t know how deep it ran. She figured it out, and decided to use it to her advantage. \"You wouldn\\'t be able to live with yourself if you put her in harm\\'s way. Plus, if you ever want to pursue a romantic relationship with her, how are you going to do that if in your dreams, all you\\'re thinking about is reliving your romance with your dead wife?\" Dom looked at Avery, who was giving him a look of concern. He knew she was right. \"Alright, so let\\'s say I want to get out of this cycle,\" Dom proposed. \"How do you think we can do this?\" \"Well, it\\'s going to be a long process. We\\'re going to have to get into your subconscious, probably with a compound Yusuf will make. Then, myself, Eames, Arthur, and Ariadne will go in and begin to kill Mal on the various levels she is on, since your subconscious has the elevator complex. However, with Mal fighting us also comes you fighting us. Your subconscious is going to do everything it can to save her. If one of us dies during the fight, we\\'ll end up waking up. If we kill you though, you\\'ll go into limbo.\" \"So, you have to kill Mal on each level-\" \"Without killing you.\" \"Is it possible?\" \"Yes, it is possible. It will be a long process, and it may take multiple attempts, but we should be able to do it.\" \"You and Arthur are going to have to work together.\" \"I know.\" \"Are you willing to do that?\" \"When it comes to your safety and sanity, I\\'m willing to do almost anything.\" \"When do you think we\\'ll start?\" \"Give me a few days to plan it out, and then we can get started, slowly but surely.\" Avery stood up, taking her and Dom\\'s empty bowls and putting them in the sink, and began to head out of the room. \"Ave?\" Dom called to her. \"Yeah?\" \"What do you think of Ariadne?\" Avery smiled at her brother. \"She\\'s fantastic, Dom. She\\'s more compatible for you than Mal ever was.\" \"You think so?\" \"I know so.\" Avery walked out of the kitchen. Dom looked around the kitchen for a minute, then smiled to himself and went back to reading his paper. Sorry this has been so delayed! I\\'ve been super busy with school and everything, so I\\'m glad to be writing again. R&R;! XOXO, Lauren[Chapter 6] Hi readers, First of all, let me apologize for leaving this story hanging. In the past four years, I have attended and graduated college, and entered a new phase of my life. During this time, I have brainstormed new ideas, and I feel it would be a disservice to my characters, stories, and to you, the readers, if I were to just pick these up and try to imagine where I had planned for these stories to go. HOWEVER, That does not mean that I am just giving up on this story completely. So, here is what I am going to do… Over the next few weeks, I will be determining if the stories I currently have in progress are worth a rewrite, or if I will be closing the chapter on these pieces. If I decide that I will be continuing the piece, I will place a follow-up Author's Note onto the piece, so that those who have these items on alert can be informed to the new link. If I will not be continuing the piece, I will be deleting the story at some point over these next few weeks. I will be revamping my author's page shortly, and will be posting new ideas and stories as I begin to map out where my next steps in the fanfiction world will take me. Thank you for your patience and following. I hope that you will be joining me on this next journey. Peace. Love. Lo. ","Summary":" Here\\'s a new story from me!

I Sueños . . Podía decirse que Robert Fischer lo tenía todo. Era un hombre rico; infinitamente rico, luego de haber desmantelado el imperio de su padre para comenzar su propio negocio, casi un año atrás, el cual solo le había dado ganancias hasta la fecha. Dinero. Todo se reducía a eso. Ahora tenía mucho más del que podría contar y del que necesitaba, tenía éxito, poder... Su padre lo educó en un mundo donde la felicidad era directamente proporcional a la cantidad de millones que uno tuviera en el banco, y Robert tenía muchos. ¿Por qué no era feliz entonces? No. No había podido encontrar la felicidad ni un solo día luego de seguir la última voluntad de su padre. No mientras estaba despierto, al menos. Había un sueño recurrente que lo visitaba cada vez que cerraba los ojos. Una mujer, no especialmente exuberante o llamativa, pero sí muy hermosa. La misma imagen, noche tras noche. Lo extraño de esa mujer era que no existía; nunca la había visto o escuchado su voz, pero, de alguna manera, verla lo hacía sentirse seguro, a salvo de un mal que no recordaba. Robert no salía muy seguido desde que se había vuelto uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo; no solo, al menos. Pero cuando lo hacía, le gustaba perderse largas horas en algún lugar donde nadie pudiera conocerlo, donde podía, por unos minutos al menos, fingir que era alguien normal. París se presentaba ante él como un sitio ideal para eso; allí nadie sabía su nombre ni conocía su cara. En esa ciudad podía transitar libremente, sin huir de reporteros ni amenazas. Dejando que sus pies lo guiaran, llegó a una pequeña y encantadora cafetería alejada del centro, tomó una mesa en el interior y pidió un café mientras intentaba recordar todas sus clases de francés para poder leer la edición financiera de Le Monde de ese día. Fue entonces que, tras darle un sorbo a su humeante taza, un ligero resplandor le molestó en los ojos, haciéndole desistir en su lectura. Algo molesto, levantó la cabeza y fue en ese instante que la vio, morena, menuda, con un bloc de hojas y una pluma de metal entre las manos, sentada en una de las mesas más alejadas. Casi sin quererlo, Robert posó la mirada en ella y la dejó allí, desviando el rostro para esquivar el brillo de la pluma. Conocía ese rostro, esos ojos y aquellas expresiones. Estaba seguro de que las había visto antes, pero, ¿en dónde? La chica jugaba con la pluma entre sus labios, haciendo algunos trazos de a ratos y volviendo a llevársela a la altura del rostro, despistada. Robert no podía quitar los ojos de ella, y siguió mirándola hasta que al fin supo de dónde la conocía: de sus sueños. oOo . N del A: Hola! Gracias por leer! Saludos! H.S.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . II Robert Fischer . . Las horas se pasaban demasiado rápido cuando se empecinaba con el diseño de algún edificio. A Aridne le fascinaba dibujar a mano, después de todo, la mayor parte de su trabajo se trataba de eso, pero rara vez usaba algún programa para plasmar sus ideas a futuro. Y aquella pequeña cafetería, en esa esquina de París donde Dominic Cobb le había enseñado un mundo que nunca hubiera creído posible, era su favorita; el único punto de la ciudad desde donde podía sentarse y ver la vida pasar delante de sus ojos, imaginando, creando. Esa tarde salió como cualquier otra de la universidad, donde trabajaba como ayudante para terminar su tesis. Caminó por aquel puente que tanto le recordaba a Mal, la desquiciada esposa de Cobb, y terminó en la misma cafetería, con su bloc se hojas en una manos, una pluma de plata (regalo de Arthur) y diferentes lápices de grafito en la otra mientras se dedicaba a diseñar un sencillo apartamento para un nuevo trabajo, sin prestar atención a nada ni a nadie, hasta que fue interrumpida: —Disculpa... — ¿Sí?— levantó la vista casi de inmediato, arrepintiéndose al instante cuando sus ojos se toparon con la mirada más azul que había visto en su vida. La respiración se le cortó en ese instante y el corazón casi se le salió del pecho Hubiera reconocido esos ojos en cualquier lugar. Eran los ojos de Robert Fischer. Azorada, miró hacia todos lados en busca de la policía o algún matón, pero, para su sorpresa, Fischer estaba solo, parado frente a ella, con una mirada tranquila, pero la boca torcida con algo de nerviosismo. Ariadne casi comenzó a hiperventilar y algo en su mente le dijo que permanecer allí no era seguro, pero al mismo tiempo el miedo le impedía moverse y alejarse. Se aferró con fuerza a su bloc de hojas y comenzó a buscar la salida más próxima cuando él volvió a hablarle, sin cambiar el tono de su voz. —No suelo hacer esto...— él dudó, hablando en un francés poco fluido, y Ariadne lo miró, olvidándose por un segundo de su miedo, curiosa— Yo... ¿Nos conocemos? Aliviada al saber que no la reconocía, pudo volver a sentir el aire llenando sus pulmones nuevamente, así que intentó no parecer desesperada mientras recogía sus cosas con prisa moderada. —No, no lo creo— le sonrió, tan nerviosa que no se dio cuenta de que había respondido en inglés, y terminó de guardar todo en su bolsa— Lo siento. Tengo prisa. Intentó alejarse, pero él se lo impidió, colocándose delante con las manos alzadas. —Lo lamento. No quise asustarte— dijo, bajando la cabeza mientras torcía los labios, indeciso— Dios, he estado en aquella mesa por más de veinte minutos pensando como abordarte, y...— se detuvo y soltó un bufido que le causó gracia— Soy malo en esto. Jamás he hecho algo así— ahora sí Ariadne no pudo evitar sonreír abiertamente, y él acompañó su sonrisa— De verdad, no quiero asustarte, pero debo decirlo o creo que me volveré loco— ella lo miró fijo, curiosa al percibir que no se encontraba en peligro, y Fischer la imitó, dubitativo, antes de suspirar— Tal vez tú no me conozcas, pero yo a ti te he visto antes. En mis sueños; cada noche. Ariadne no pudo evitar retroceder ante esa afirmación, no obstante, presurosa, solo volvió a sonreírle con condescendencia y se alejó dos pasos. —Vaya... Eso es halagador. O espeluznante, viniendo de un completo desconocido— dijo, intentando alejarse para disimular el pánico que comenzaba a entrarle, pero de nuevo él se lo impidió. — ¡Lo siento! No fue mi intención asustarte de nuevo, o... —Está bien— lo cortó, alzando una mano— Sí fue raro, pero está bien. En cierta manera hasta es lindo— sonrió, regañándose mentalmente por haber dicho eso mientras se escabullía fuera de la cafetería, presurosa— Y lo siento, pero tengo una clase... Adiós. Lo escuchó chasquear la lengua al darle la espalda, y había comenzado a alejarse cuando volvió a escucharlo. —Soy Robert, por cierto. Robert Fischer. Ariadne se giró casi por costumbre, mordiéndose la lengua para no soltar un \"lo sé\", y sin darse cuenta respondió de la misma forma: —Ariadne. —La chica de los laberintos— dijo él, sonriendo de manera sospechosa. — ¿Disculpa? —Teseo y Ariadne— respondió Fischer, metiendo las manos en los bolsillos de sus pantalones claros, bastante informales para alguien como él— Es mitología griega. Mi historia favorita. Ariadne asintió, ocultando una sonrisa de alivio mientras volvía a darse la vuelta, haciendo la nota mental de no regresar a aquel lugar, por lo menos hasta que estuviera segura de que Robert Fischer ya no seguía en París. oOo . N del A: De nuevo, gracias por leer! Saludos! H.S.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . III Ariadne . . Robert Michael Fischer no era alguien muy sociable. Nunca había tenido un mejor amigo ni tiempo para compartir con personas ajenas a su trabajo. Desde la muerte de su madre había estado solo, abandonado en internados y luego en la universidad. Claro que contaba con el apoyo de Peter Browning, mejor amigo de su padre su padrino, pero con nadie más. La única forma de relacionarse de alguna manera con Maurice Fischer, su padre, había sido siempre a través de su trabajo, por eso siempre se había esforzado por cumplir con sus expectativas y no decepcionarlo, formarse a su imagen y semejanza para que algún día estuviera orgulloso de él. Sólo la opinión de su padre contaba; jamás le había importado la de nadie más a ese nivel, tampoco la de su padrino y único amigo, la persona en la que más confiaba. Mucho menos la de una completa desconocida. ¿Por qué, entonces, se sentía así ahora por una chica a la que solo había visto una sola vez en su vida? La había visto solo una vez en carne y hueso, pero miles de veces en sus sueños. Ariadne... Ése era su nombre. Elegante y bello, como ella. ¿Bella? Después de años de indiferencia hacia el resto del mundo, se vio sorprendido al estar pensando en una mujer que para él no implicaría ningún buen negocio en esos términos. — ¿Robert? Robert, ¿estás escuchándome? El aludido parpadeó y salió bruscamente de sus pensamientos, enderezándose sobre su asiento. —Lo siento, tío Peter. ¿Qué decías? Peter Browning torció los labios con disgusto, pero se deshizo de ese gesto casi de inmediato. —Luces extraño— observó— ¿Te pasa algo? —No. — ¿Seguro? Robert lo miró fijamente y movió la cabeza de manera afirmativa. Sin embargo, su padrino no se mostró conforme con esa respuesta. —No me engañas, Robert. Te conozco desde que naciste, y te he notado diferente desde que decidiste desmantelar el imperio de tu padre. —Vender Fischer Morrow era lo que él quería para mí— se defendió, a pesar de no ser necesario— Y sé que no te hizo ninguna gracia tener que volver a empezar de cero, pero no nos ha ido nada mal hasta ahora— discurrió, jugando con una de sus plumas de oro— En nuestro primer año casi lideramos el mercado asiático, y estamos logrando grandes avances en el europeo. Browning apretó los labios, mostrándose de acuerdo con sus palabras. —En eso tienes razón— concedió— Sin embargo, sabes que si algo te molesta puedes hablar conmigo, ¿verdad? Eres como un hijo para mí. Ante eso, Robert vaciló por un segundo, indeciso. No obstante, su padrino era la persona en quien más confiaba en el mundo. Si alguien podía darle un buen consejo, el consejo de un padre, sin duda, sería él. —Ahora que lo mencionas... Hay algo que ha estado inquietándome últimamente— admitió, soltando un largo suspiro. — ¿Qué es? —Una mujer. — ¿Una mujer?— se sorprendió el otro hombre, frunciendo el ceño— Robert, sé que la muerte de tu padre te ha afectado, pero, ¿no crees que ahora es muy pronto para pensar en formar una familia? Digo, aún eres joven y tienes tanto por hacer antes de atarte a una mujer e hijos que... —No, no es eso— fue el turno de Robert de sorprenderse, y, estando con su padrino, no se molestó en ocultarlo— Si deseara formar una familia tú serías el primero en saberlo, tío Peter— comentó con calma— Solo es...alguien a quien conocí hace unos días. Me pasó algo muy extraño con ella. ¿Te acuerdas de esas sesiones que mi padre y tú querían que tomara para entrenar mi mente? Quizá te sonará loco, pero creo que la he visto allí, como una proyección de mi mente. — ¿A quién? —A la chica que conocí hace unos días. Ariadne, era su nombre. —Curioso nombre— el administrador torció los labios, pensativo— ¿Es francesa? —No, no lo creo. — ¿Ariadne qué? Tal vez pueda mandar a investigarla. Robert lo miró, frunciendo el ceño. —No lo sé. No me dijo su apellido... Pero no vas a investigarla como si fuera una criminal, tío Peter. —Robert, es por tu seguridad— se justificó el hombre, imitando su gesto— Como tu albacea es mi deber cuidar de ti. Eres una figura pública y tienes mucho dinero; eso puede ser peligroso a veces. —Y crees que nadie puede querer acercarse a mí si no es por mi fortuna— afirmó Fischer Jr con escepticismo. —No, yo no dije eso— su padrino negó con la cabeza, amenizando el sonido de su voz, como si estuviera hablándole a un niño pequeño— Eres un joven excepcional, Robert, pero a veces no sabes reconocer a quienes se acercan a ti porque de verdad te aprecian, o porque en realidad tienen intereses... ocultos. Robert lo miró, entornando sus profundos ojos azules con suspicacia, como si intentara procesar esas palabras. Luego desvió la vista hacia la ventana de su oficina y, con los ojos escudriñando la vista de la ciudad, soltó un profundo suspiro. —Sé que solo te preocupas por mi bienestar, tío Peter; pero, si te deja tranquilo, ella ni siquiera se interesó en hablarme— refutó, sintiéndose extrañamente frustrado con solo decirlo. No obstante, eso pareció relajar a su padrino, que solo se limitó a colocar una mano sobre su hombro, presionándolo con afecto. —Bueno, esa es una preocupación menos, ¿no?— sonrió, complacido— Siendo así, olvídate de ese asunto y sigamos trabajando. Hay unos papeles que necesito que... Robert giró su asiento y pretendió seguir escuchándolo, aunque en realidad su mente vagaba muy lejos de allí. Mientras su padrino seguía hablando acerca de unos nuevos contratos, sus ojos azules se perdieron en la tapa del libro que descansaba sobre su escritorio se cristal, la cual tenía el sello de Escuela de Arquitectura de la Universidad de París en una esquina. Tal vez ella estudiaba ahí. Tal vez era una arquitecta. ¿Quién sería realmente la chica de sus sueños? Sin darse cuenta sonrió, entrelazando las manos delante de su mentón para esconderlo. Tal vez Ariadne y él podrían volver a encontrarse y así podría responder a esa pregunta. Y devolverle su libro, claro. oOo . N del A: Dudas? Comentarios? Críticas? Todo será bien recibido, gente. Gracias por leer! Saludos! H.S.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . IV Cobb . . Arthur y Eames se desternillaron de risa cuando Ariadne les contó acerca de su extraño encuentro con Robert Fischer Jr, dos días después, luego de que el equipo se reuniera en Berlín para un nuevo trabajo de extracción. Y, aunque se indignó un momento porque su preocupación no había sido tomada en serio, sintió un gran alivio al ver que tal vez en verdad ninguno corría peligro. —Escuché que Fischer Jr cerró algunos negocios en París. Tal vez lo veas seguido— comentó Eames, con una sonrisa burlona mientras revisaba unos papeles. —Debes tener cuidado, Ariadne— dijo Cobb, el único que pareció tomarse el asunto con seriedad— Si lo que te dijo es cierto y su subconsciente te proyecta constantemente podríamos tener un serio problema entre manos. —No importa, Dom— Ariadne, al ver la preocupación en el rostro de su mentor, intentó restarle un poco de importancia al asunto—. París una ciudad muy grande. ¿Qué probabilidades hay de que vuelva a cruzarme con él? —Si él quiere encontrarte lo hará sin problemas— intervino Arthur, jugando distraídamente con su tótem— Puede pagarle a quien sea para hacerlo. Ariadne torció los labios y dejó de trabajar en su maqueta para mirarlo, curiosa. — ¿Por qué querría buscarme?— inquirió, confundida— Él dijo que me veía en sus sueños, pero no sabía mi nombre ni parecía recordarme. Ni a mí ni a ustedes. —No lo sabemos. Los ricos son extraños— añadió Eames. —Sea lo que sea, no te acerques a él, Ariadne. No sabemos cuáles puedan ser sus intenciones. —Dom, jugamos con su mente y lo manipulamos para que destruyera el trabajo de la vida de su padre. Acercarme a él no sólo sería inmoral, sino que no sería correcto... ¡No soy una lunática como para intentar algo con él cuando prácticamente destruí su vida! — ¿Inmoral?— repitió Arthur, burlón— Pues no parecías pensar eso mientras hurgabas en su cerebro, mi querida Ari. —Y yo sigo creyendo que le hicimos un favor y que tendríamos que haberle cobrado a él también por la terapia gratis— acotó Eames, divertido— Lo único malo fue que no pudimos quitarle de encima al padrino oportunista. —Tampoco hacemos milagros— Arthur no pudo reprimir una sonrisa burlona que fue compartida solo por Eames. —Esto es serio, señores— Cobb aportó un poco de cordura a la situación mientras calibraba la máquina— Ariadne, si te sientes en peligro no dudes en buscarme. Puedes quedarte en mi casa el tiempo que quieras— le dijo, colocando una mano sobre su brazo para estrecharlo con gesto amistoso. La arquitecta se sonrojó hasta las orejas al instante, pero sus ojos seguían fijos en los de Cobb. No querían dejar de mirar ese profundo azul cielo. Le gustaba; tal vez demasiado. Sea como fuere, durante meses había esperado volver a verlo, y no pudo evitar pensar que no quería que aquel contacto acabara nunca. —Ugh...Consigan una habitación, tórtolos— bufó Arthur, echándose su chaqueta de cuero al hombro tras haber roto el momento. Ariadne y Dominic se separaron de inmediato, mirando al piso cada uno por su lado— Me voy de aquí. Llámenme si me necesitan. —Nadie te necesita— dijo Eames, recibiendo un lápiz en la cabeza mientras reía y también se ponía de pie— Que delicado... Bien, iré a buscar un bar. ¿Se apuntan? —No. —No, gracias. Eames alzó las manos y soltó un gemido de resignación, despidiéndose con una seña y una mirada sugerente. — ¡Usen protección!— gritó antes de atravesar la puerta y soltar otra carcajada, dejando un ambiente muy tenso entre los dos arquitectos. —Yo... —Eso fue.. Los dos hablaron al mismo tiempo, y rieron al pisarse con sus palabras. De pronto toda la tensión se esfumó. —No le hagas caso a esos dos. — ¿Bromeas? No confío en Arthur desde que me hizo besarlo con mentiras. — ¿Lo besaste? —Más o menos. En realidad no estoy segura de que a eso pueda llamársele beso. Solo fue un roce, y... — ¿Quieres ir a cenar?— le soltó Dom de improvisto, bajando la cabeza casi con pena, como si fuera un adolescente pidiéndole una cita a la chica que le gusta— Solo los dos. Es decir, sí tú quieres... Yo no... —Sí— su respuesta fue aún más instantánea que su sonrisa y el agitado latido de su corazón— Sí me gustaría... Y Fischer pasó a un segundo plano. oOo .

Drabble #5 Extraño . . — ¿Te estoy aburriendo? Apenas si levantó la vista del fondo de su vaso de whisky hacia la exuberante mujer rubia que se había sentado a su lado; y la contempló por un segundo de reojo, sin demostrar ningún interés. Pero la mujer seguía esperando por una respuesta, por lo que Robert soltó un suave suspiro y se giró hacia ella, abriendo los ojos con una fría condescendencia. —Lo siento, pero no salgo con prostitutas— soltó sin ninguna delicadeza, alzando una mano para pedirle al cantinero que rellenaran su vaso, sin prever la copa de agua que fue directamente a su cara. —Imbécil— la mujer se levantó, ofendida, al mismo tiempo que los tres guardaespaldas de Robert la imitaban, acariciando el arma que llevaban en la cintura, mirándola como si fuera una amenaza, pero volviendo a sus lugares ante una seña de su empleador. —Está bien— murmuró Fischer Jr. mientras tomaba una servilleta para secarse con hastío, rechazando la ayuda de su jefe de seguridad— Llama al aeropuerto. Que preparen mi avión para regresar cuanto antes. El enorme hombre asintió, dándose la vuelta para hablar por su teléfono a la vez que el resto de sus hombres se desplegaban por el lugar, cuidando del perímetro. Robert se levantó también, pagó su consumición con una generosa propina y se arregló la ropa antes de de caminar fuera del bar, seguido de su equipo de seguridad. Por lo general, prefería pasar inadvertido, pero Peter Browning había insistido hasta el cansancio en contratar a esa gente para él, por lo que, para dejar tranquilo a su padrino, había aceptado, al menos mientras estuviera de viaje fuera de París. —Señor Fischer. Tenemos un problema con su vehículo. Espere aquí mientras lo estacionamos en la puerta— le dijo su jefe de seguridad discretamente al oído, causándole un estremecimiento involuntario. — ¿Qué pasó? —Solo un altercado callejero, no se preocupe. Pero debemos estar seguros. Robert asintió, colocando una mano sobre las solapas de su chaqueta. Pese a su actitud siempre soberbia e impaciente, no iba a protestar. Tenía un seguro anti secuestro, pero desde la muerte de su padre había comenzado a sentirse sumamente inquieto ante cualquier inconveniente, por mínimo que fuera, que pudiera derivar en uno. Así que se quedó de pie en el vestíbulo del restaurante, trabajando desde su teléfono mientras esperaba. En eso estaba cuando de repente alzó la mirada, solo por un segundo, y entonces la vio. Ariadne estaba sentada al otro lado del restaurante, riendo con alguien. Robert miró la espalda del hombre que la acompañaba como si de esa forma pudiera reconocerlo, pero sus ojos volvieron rápidamente a la chica. Ariadne usaba un sencillo vestido negro con los hombros descubiertos y el cabello castaño suelto y con ondas tras las orejas; lucía linda, y no pudo evitar pensar que se veía mucho más bonita cuando estaba relajada y reía. Nunca la había visto reír; le gustaba, y se sintió extraño pensando en ella de esa manera, tanto que incluso no pudo volver a concentrarse en el trabajo. —Señor Fischer, disculpe los incovenientes. Su auto está listo. Si me acompaña... —Sí— Robert guardó su teléfono en el bolsillo interno de su Armani y miró al guardia; luego volvió a mirar hacia la mesa de Ariadne, sorprendiéndose al encontrarla sola— Esperen un momento. — ¿Señor? —Ahora regreso. Para cuando fue consciente de lo que hacía ya se encontraba a un lado de la mesa de la chica, carraspeando incómodamente para hacerse notar. —Buenas noches— saludó, entrelazado las manos tras la espalda. Ariadne alzó la vista y por poco se atragantó con su vino blanco, colocándose una servilleta oportunamente sobre la boca mientras intentaba recuperarse de la sorpresa. A Robert le causó gracia que lo mirara como si acabara de ver a un fantasma. —Señor Fischer— tosió, abriendo los ojos con sorpresa— Buenas...noches. Ariadne se mordió el labio inferior y desvió la mirada hacia el mantel, tamborileando los dedos nerviosamente sobre la mesa mientras él la observaba en silencio, consciente de lo incómodo de la situación, pero sin darle importancia. — ¿Estás sola?— la pregunta era innecesaria y algo fuera de lugar, ya que sabía la respuesta, sin embargo necesitaba oír de sus labios con quién estaba. Era una sensación extraña y molesta, como cuando alguien invadía su espacio personal— Tienes una cita— resolvió tras unos segundos, alzando las cejas con escepticismo. La joven parpadeó y bajó la mirada una vez más, cubriéndose con una cortina de cabello. Robert no podía verla con mucha claridad pero hubiera jurado que ella estaba sonrojada. —Sí. No, yo... Estoy con un...amigo. Fischer frunció el ceño y asintió, no del todo conforme con esa respuesta evasiva. \"Pero no es de tu incumbencia, Robert\" dijo una voz en su cabeza, y, contra su voluntad, decidió que eso era verdad. Esa chica no tenía nada que ver en su vida, ni él en la suya. Era inapropiado hacer esa clase de preguntas tan entrometidas. — ¿Y tú? La suave voz de Ariadne le sorprendió, aunque lo que más llamó su atención fue el tono nervioso que usó. No obstante, suspiro y se recargó levemente contra el respaldo de la silla frente a ella, mirándola fijamente. No era usual que decidiera dar explicaciones sobre su vida personal, a veces ni siquiera a su padrino, pero Ariadne era diferente. A ella estaba respondiéndole incluso sin pensarlo dos veces. —Estaba... Solo vine por una copa, y... —Ari, ¿todo bien? Robert parpadeó y frunció el ceño, haciéndose a un lado para observar al hombre que antes había ocupado el lugar frente a Ariadne parado junto a él, mirando la escena como un curioso espectador. Era un hombre bien parecido, mayor que Ariadne, tal vez de su edad, pero bien parecido al fin, y vestía de forma casual, pero aun así, como Ariadne, lucía muy elegante. —Buenas noches— saludó el desconocido, recorriendo la mesa hasta pararse tras ella y colocó una mano en su hombro, causando que Ariadne le sonriera con sobriedad. Hacían una bonita pareja, y Robert no supo cómo sentirse al respecto. Sin embargo, algo más llamó su atención. —Disculpa, ¿nos conocemos?— preguntó directamente al desconocido, sin importarle sonar un tanto brusco. —No lo creo— contestó el hombre con toda naturalidad, extendiéndole una mano— Dominic Cobb. Arquitecto. —Robert Fischer. Jr— respondió, aceptando su gesto de forma casi robótica. — ¿El dueño del imperio Fischer Morrow? —Ex dueño. —Claro. Robert guardó silencio, perdido en sus propios pensamientos. Ya había visto a ese hombre, pero, ¿dónde? — ¿Está seguro de que no nos...? —Señor Fischer, estoy seguro de que recordaría haberlo conocido— le sonrió Dominic Cobb, apretando su mano con ligereza— No siempre uno puede cruzarse con alguien tan importante y rico, ¿no cree? Fischer soltó su mano y entrecerró los ojos con duda. Algo le decía que ese hombre mentía. —Dom, ya se nos hizo tarde— dijo Ariadne, regresándolo a la realidad mientras se levantaba y recogía su abrigo, que Cobb se apresuró a ayudarle a ponerse. —Oh, sí Ariadne. Lo siento— respondió Dominic, recogiendo su chaqueta también y extendiendo su mano nuevamente hacia Robert—. Señor Fischer. —Señor Cobb— Robert aceptó su gesto de nuevo y se quedó muy quieto mientras ellos le daban la espalda, dispuestos a retirarse— A-Ariadne— la llamó antes de que se perdiera entre las mesas. La joven se detuvo y lo miró. — ¿Sí? Robert dio un paso hacia adelante. De pronto se sentía demasiado nervioso al enfrentar los ojos curiosos y castaños de Ariadne. Pasó saliva algo incómodo y se ajustó el nudo de la corbata con disimulo, carraspeando para aclararse la garganta. —Tengo tu... —Ari, es tarde. Cobb interrumpió su breve momento con su voz tranquila y amable, haciendo que ella cortara el contacto visual para verlo. —Sí, Dom— sonrió, y luego volvió a girarse hacia Robert— Lo siento, señor Fischer... —Robert— le recordó, mirándola fijamente— Solo dime Robert. —Robert— repitió Ariadne, despidiéndose con un leve movimiento de cabeza— Adiós. —Pero, yo...— Robert se quedó con la palabra en la boca cuando Ariadne se dio la vuelta y rápidamente se alejó del brazo de Dominic Cobb—...tengo tu libro— acabó la oración, mirando, incrédulo, el lugar por el que ella se había ido, preguntándose qué demonios había sido todo eso. ¿Desde cuándo vacilaba al hablarle a una mujer, y desde cuándo permitía que lo dejaran con la palabra en la boca? ¿Qué le había hecho esa chica desde que la había conocido que lo hacía sentirse tan descolocado y temeroso? Su padre debía estar revolcándose en su tumba al verlo actuar como un principiante por una mujer. —Señor Fischer, ¿todo en orden? Robert dirigió sus fríos irises azules hacia su jefe de seguridad, volviendo a esconderse tras su práctica máscara de desdén. —Vámonos de aquí— ordenó, saliendo primero, y, de forma inconsciente, fijándose si Ariadne seguía cerca. Pero ya se había ido. . N del A: Hey! Gracias por leer! Si les gusta mi historia, debajo hay un cuadro donde pueden dejar su opinión. Saludos. H.S.[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . . 6 Eames tenía razón . oOo — ¿Y qué pasó? — ¿Con qué? —Con Cobb. ¿Cerraron el trato? — ¿Qué? Eames soltó una carcajada, negando en silencio. —Creo que no. Si al fin se hubieran deshecho de toda esa tensión sexual Cobb no habría llegado tan amargado y tú no seguirías arruinando todos tus planos pensando en él... Ariadne abrió los ojos, consternada, y para su mala suerte no pudo evitar escandalizarse ante el comentario. — ¡Yo no pienso en él! — ¿Ah, no? Eames rió una vez más en voz baja, divertido, y la sujetó sutilmente por las muñecas para levantar sus manos y enseñarle lo que había hecho con la hoja de dibujo. Ariadne miró, sorprendida, el trompo de papel que había hecho con los dibujos, y deseó que la tierra se abriera y la tragase en ése instante. — ¡Oh, maldita sea! — ¿Y qué me dices ahora? Ariadne contuvo el aliento para calmarse, peinándose el cabello nerviosamente tras las orejas mientras golpeaba la punta de sus botas entre sí. — ¿Tienes los planos?— preguntó Arthur, llegando hasta ellos mientras Eames seguía riendo. Ariadne se sonrojó ligeramente y, desviando la vista, le tendió el trompo. El investigador torció los labios con escepticismo, y al recoger la figura de papel levantó las cejas, abriendo los ojos con algo de intriga, pero no con sorpresa. — ¿Otra vez?― bufó, desdoblando algunos pliegues con las puntas de los dedos a la vez que fruncía el ceño— ¿Ahora qué hizo Cobb? —El problema es lo que no hizo— se burló Eames, soltando una nueva risotada y haciendo que Arthur pronunciara aún más su ceño fruncido. —Me lo imaginaba... Ari, ya te he dicho que tienes un increíble talento para estas cosas, pero prefiero los planos enrollados y dentro de un tubo. Tenlo en cuenta para la próxima. Ariadne parpadeó, más avergonzada que antes. ¿Por qué tenían que asociar todo lo que le pasaba con Cobb? ¿Era tan obvia? Aunque, para su mala suerte, Arthur y Eames tenían razón. —Iré a mi casa y traeré las copias de respaldo— suspiró para cambiar el tema, apenada, levantándose y buscando su bolso— Lo siento. —Te acompaño— dijo Arthur, consultando su reloj— Tengo algo de tiempo ahora y no me vendría mal un poco de aire fresco. ― ¿Y qué le digo a Cobb?― inquirió Eames, jugando con una ficha de póker entre los dedos― No estará nada feliz cuando vea que desapareciste con la princesa. ― ¡Eames! ―Dile que fuimos a su departamento. Será divertido ver cómo reacciona. Los dos hombres rieron, y Ariadne no pudo hacer nada más que desear desaparecer lo más rápido posible. Realmente prefería que esos dos volvieran a pelear como perro y gato antes que se juntaran para burlarse de ella y su desastrosa vida amorosa. ―Los dos váyanse al demonio. Tomó sus cosas con brusquedad y caminó a la salida; Arthur, sin dejar de reír discretamente, se colgó un tubo portaplanos al hombro y la siguió de cerca hasta las frías calles de París. El último trabajo sería en Suiza, a unas pocas horas en tren desde París, así que todo el equipo se había trasladado hasta allí para crear un sueño de dos niveles antes de volver a disolverse, así que por unos cuantos días volverían a estar juntos. Unos días que estaban volviéndose demasiado largos gracias a las bromas de sus colegas más molestos. ― ¿Quieres un chicle? ―No. Arthur se encogió de hombros y se metió una bola de chicle en la boca, arrojándole la envoltura al cabello. —Había olvidado lo tranquilo que es esta ciudad— murmuró para sí mismo cuando entraron en una callejuela poco transitada que Ariadne usaba cada tarde al salir de la universidad, haciéndose a un lado para darle paso a una motoneta. — ¿Te gusta París?― preguntó por mera cortesía al cruzar la calle. Y Arthur la miró, enarcando una de sus cejas oscuras —No. Realmente prefiero el bullicio de Boston o Nueva York— dijo, jugando con el tubo mientras ella reía. — ¿Por qué siempre debes ser tan complicado? Arthur la contempló de soslayo y enarcó una ceja; sin embargo, casi de inmediato miró hacia atrás, y al cambiar la señal pasó un brazo sobre los hombros de Ariadne, sorprendiéndola. ― ¿Qué haces? —Alguien te sigue— le dijo al oído, empujándola suavemente para que no se detuviera— Camina con naturalidad. — ¿Por qué alguien me seguiría?— preguntó Ariadne en voz baja, sujetándose a su cintura en busca de más seguridad. —No lo sé. ¡No mires! ¿Le debes dinero a alguien? —No. — ¿Te metiste en problemas últimamente? — ¡Claro que no! Arthur pensó su siguiente pregunta por unos segundos mientras seguían caminando. — ¿Crees que Fischer te haya descubierto?— eso la dejó sin palabras. De inmediato quiso voltear pero Arthur no se lo permitió— ¿Has vuelto a verlo? ¿Te dijo algo? —N-No...— mintió, un tanto insegura. Avanzaron unos cuantos metros más, doblaron en una esquina y se metieron en un callejón que daba a otra calle un poco más transitada; caminaron otros cuantos minutos y Arthur se detuvo. Miró hacia atrás y hacia todos lados, y chasqueó la lengua. —Creo que lo perdimos. — ¿Cómo supiste que nos seguían? —No lo sabía— le dijo, regresando la vista al frente— Solo quería ver si me dejabas abrazarte. Ariadne frunció el ceño y se apartó de un manotazo, golpeándolo otra vez en el brazo. — ¡Me asustaste! —Valió la pena— Arthur tomó su mano y la besó. El coqueteo entre ellos no era nada extraño, por lo que Ariadne ni se inmutó cuando entrelazó sus dedos y comenzó a guiarla calle abajo, rumbo a su apartamento, sin sorprenderle realmente que supiera el camino. Entraron al pequeño piso y durante varios minutos se dedicaron a buscar los planos que querían. Arthur hizo algunas acotaciones acerca de los gustos del sujeto y juntos concordaron unos cambios para ya no tener que regresar a la bodega hasta el día siguiente. Terminaron con el trabajo y Ariadne lo acompañó de regreso a la salida. Sin embargo, antes de salir del edificio Arthur volvió a hablarle, en tono casual pero firme, dándose la vuelta para mirarla fijo a los ojos. —Sé lo que pasa. Entre tú y Cobb— Le soltó como si nada, de pie en medio del vestíbulo y frente a las puertas de cristal, desde donde todo mundo podía verlos— Sé que tuvieron una cita, y eso es inaceptable en este momento. Ariadne parpadeó, sonrojándose en el acto. — ¿A qué te refieres? No pasa nada entre Cobb y yo...— era cierto que no pasaba nada, lo que no quería decir que ella no quisiera, pero no entendía el comentario de su compañero. Arthur, por su parte, se dedicó a seguir mirándola. Unos segundos después y alzó ambas manos para pasarlas a los lados de su cabeza, suspirando mientras bajaba la cabeza hasta ella para hablarle más cerca. —Ari, esto no es un juego— aseveró, de repente serio—. Sí, se nota que se gustan, la pasan bien juntos y tienen cientos de cosas en común, pero eso no durará. Y afectará a todo el equipo, ¿entiendes? A TODOS nosotros. — ¿Qué? —Cobb es un buen tipo y todo, pero...después de lo de Mal, él no... No está bien. Hizo un gran progreso luego del trabajo de Fischer, y sin embargo... Lo conozco. Aún no puede dejarla ir. Y además están James y Phillipa— hizo una pausa te chasqueó la lengua, viéndonos las Manos para acompañar sus palabras— Su mente aún no está lista para embarcarse en otra historia. ¿Y quién crees que sufrirá más por eso? Es por tu propio bien y el del equipo también. Aléjate de Cobb. Ambos han funcionado de maravilla hasta ahora, pero no dejes que su relación avance más allá, o te aseguro que todo se arruinará... Créeme. Lo he visto antes. Las relaciones en el trabajo simplemente no funcionan, mucho menos con alguien tan emocionalmente afectado como Cobb. Ariadne estaba aturdida, y, sin poder creer lo que oía quiso replicar, pero Arthur no se lo permitió: ―Sé que te gusta y estoy seguro de que tú a él, pero Cobb ahora debe concentrarse solo en recomponer su familia, su vida; en cuidar de sus hijos... No te digo que en un futuro no pueda funcionar, pero, ahora...― suspiró, acariciándole la mejilla al ver la incomodidad que le había provocado― Vamos, chica de los laberintos. Eres demasiado joven, inteligente y hermosa para complicarle la vida de esta manera. Espera a envejecer y engordar para eso― le soltó, y a pesar de la seriedad del tema, Ariadne no pudo evitar sonreír― Sé que no soy nadie para decirte qué hacer, pero eres lista. Tomarás la decisión correcta. Ariadne sonrió para ocultar una mueca de tristeza y Arthur volvió a suspirar, rodeándola con sus brazos. ―Ven aquí... Todo estará bien... Ella se dejó hacer y escondió la cara en el chaleco de Arthur, recobrando la compostura casi de inmediato. Se limpió el rostro y asintió, separándose para retroceder un paso. ―Te entiendo. Yo... Es que me siento un poco tonta ahora, y... Te odio por ser siempre la voz de la consciencia. Eames tiene razón. Eres fastidioso. ―Ariadne, sé que estás molesta pero no vuelvas a decir delante mío, no afirmes o siquiera insinúes, que Eames tiene la razón en algo, ¿oíste?― le espetó, frunciendo las cejas con falsa molestia. Aridne sonrió un poco más abiertamente entonces y sin pensarlo se abrazó a su cuello y ahora fue ella quien lo besó, en la vida real, logrando que los músculos de Arthur se tensaran ligeramente. ―Gracias, Arthur. Como siempre, me has hecho ver las cosas en perspectiva. Él asintió, todavía estático. Se despidió con una seña y avanzó dos pasos; luego se arrepintió y regresó sobre ellos, ya sin esa expresión de turbación, sino con una mirada de intriga y recelo. ―Dime, ¿eso fue por el beso que te di en el subconsciente de Fischer?― preguntó, entre curioso e inquieto, mientras la señalaba con un dedo acusador. Ariadne entonces rió y bajó la vista, acomodándose el cabello tras las orejas. ―En parte. Se siente feo ser la víctima, ¿verdad? Arthur soltó un bufido irónico, dio un par de pasos vacilantes y volvió a acercarse a ella. ―Te mostraré quién es la víctima. Antes de que Ariadne pudiera repelerlo la tomó por el rostro y estampó sus labios contra los suyos una vez más, acercándola a su cuerpo poniendo las manos en su cintura. Y ella forcejeó al mismo tiempo que reía, haciendo que Arthur se negara a dejar de besarla. No obstante, no había pasión ni deseo en aquel beso, sino más bien un sabor alegre y juguetón que hacía que Ariadne no lo golpeara por su atrevimiento. Los dos sabían que eso era sólo juego. Los dos estaban tan ocupados en su competencia de egos que ni siquiera notaron al hombre que se había acercado a ellos hasta que éste les hizo notar su presencia. ― ¿Ariadne? Arthur y ella dejaron de besarse y reír, y, sorprendidos, se giraron hacia Robert Fischer, que estaba de pie tras ellos, mirándolos con los ojos azules inquietos. Ariadne quitó las manos del investigador de su cuerpo y pronto dio una paso al costado, más que incómoda con la presencia de Robert en la puerta de su edificio. ―Señor Fischer... ¿Qué hace aquí?— fue lo único que atinó a decir, tan sorprendida que ni siquiera tuvo tiempo para sentir temor o inquietud. Robert Fischer, con su porte elegante y ligeramente altanero, sin duda era una figura que, lo quisiera o no, infundía respeto y algo de admiración. Si alguien miraba su fachada vería al hombre exitoso y frío que dirigía su propio imperio emergente; pero si se concentraba más allá y miraba en lo profundo de sus ojos imposiblemente azules, reconocería un brillo cándido y casi infantil en ellos, el mismo que antes le había parecido ver en ellos cuando la había abordado por primera vez en la cafetería. La dicotomía entre el empresario sin escrúpulos y el hombre de buen corazón qué estaba parado frente a ella era confusa para Ariadne, y todo eso pasó por su mente en el segundo que Fischer se tardó en digerir su pregunta. Robert la miró un momento, y luego sus ojos se posaron brevemente en la mano que Arthur había vuelto a poner en su cintura, de seguro para evitar que corriera. Y cuando pensaba que Fischer no diría nada más, éste le enseñó un viejo libro que cargaba consigo, desconcertándola por completo. ―Yo... Dejaste tu libro el otro día en la cafetería, y... Creí que...― dejó su frase a la mitad para concentrarse en Arthur, y a Ariadne se le congeló la sangre al notar que lo miraba de la misma forma que había hecho con Cobb días atrás; como si supiera que lo conocía, pero intentara recordar de dónde― Disculpe, ¿nos conocemos? ―Lo dudo― respondió Arthur con esa naturalidad que lo caracterizaba siempre, extendiéndole la mano con gesto amistoso― Mucho gusto... ―Robert... ―Fischer, ¿verdad?― le sonrió el otro hombre, abrazando a Ariadne por la espalda para pegarla a su cuerpo― El dueño del conglomerado Fischer Morrow. ―Ex dueño― contestó Robert, bajando la mirada un momento para cambiar de tema― ¿Y usted es...? ―Arthur. El prometido de Ariadne― dijo con tal naturalidad que incluso Ariadne se lo creyó por un momento. Y miró a Arthur, que había ajustado su brazo alrededor de su espalda para advertirle que no dijera nada. No le pareció lógico que mintiera de esa forma, pero lo que le pareció lo más ilógico de todo fue la expresión en el rostro de Fischer. Era como duda, molestia y decepción entremezclados. ¿Por qué Fischer hijo la miraba de esa forma tan extraña? No obstante, había una pregunta aún más importante que resolver en su cabeza. ―Emm... Señor Fischer― sus ojos, imposiblemente azules, centellaron con expectación al oírla llamándolo, y al clavarse sobre ella le causaron un extraño hormigueo en la espina; Ariadne se sintió acalorada, y no pudo evitar sonreír, nerviosa― ¿Cómo supo dónde vivo?― le soltó, más por temor que por curiosidad. ¿Y si Fischer los había descubierto y quería su cabeza? En su mente eso tampoco tenía mucha lógica, ya que él había ido hasta allí personalmente en vez de enviar a algún matón. Robert, por su parte, parpadeó un par de veces, y Ariadne notó lo bonito y atractivo de sus rasgos; eran bien definidos y angulados, su barbilla era muy masculina, y como siempre su rostro se mostraba fresco e impoluto, y a pesar de estar ligeramente distorsionado con esa mueca de permanente indiferencia hacia el mundo, seguía teniendo algo; un pequeño pero claro vestigio de inseguridad que no le sorprendió en lo más mínimo después de recordar la fría relación que había tenido con sus padre. Aun así, Robert era un hombre apuesto, de eso no había duda, pero también muy peligroso para ella y los demás. ―Pregunté en la universidad― contestó él tras unos segundos, sacándola de su introspección al extenderle el libro sobre arquitectura romana que había creído perdido― Lo siento si fue demasiado imprudente, pero yo...creí que tal vez necesitarías el libro, y... Arthur alzó una ceja, atento y un tanto sorprendido. Ariadne de inmediato supo que estaba pensando en algo, pero no dijo nada. ―Gracias. Pero no debió molestarse― recibió el libro de sus manos, y, cuando sus dedos se rozaron por accidente, Fischer la miró fijamente con sus profundos ojos azules, recordándole al cielo despejado de una tarde de verano en la Toscana, y a las aguas color turquesa de los mares de Bali; casi fue como si pudiera abrazarla con ellos, y hacerle desear ahogarse en esa inmensidad azul. Era...extraño. Cobb tenía los ojos azules también, pero no se comparaban con los de Robert Fischer. ― ¡Qué amable! ¿No lo crees, cariño?― exclamó Arthur, simpático pero notablemente molesto con la situación― Pero, retomando sus palabras, creo que enviar un mensajero hubiera sido más sensato, señor Fischer. No me gusta que otros hombres merodeen a mi novia. Usted entiende— dijo, besándole la mejilla tan impulsivamente que Ariadne se molestó. Como respuesta, Robert asintió, moviendo la cabeza de forma afirmativa. Miró a Ariadne por un segundo y luego se despidió de ambos moviendo la cabeza una vez más, sin emitir sonido alguno. Arthur y ella observaron su espalda enfundada en una chaqueta de corte muy costoso y lo siguieron con la mirada hasta que Fischer Jr se subió a un taxi y se fue, alejándose de ellos al fin. Sólo entonces Ariadne pudo volver a respirar, empujando a Arthur lejos apenas los dos se quedaron solos. ― ¿Qué pasa contigo?— le reprochó— ¿Prometidos? ¿Se te zafó un tornillo o qué? El investigador arrugó el entrecejo y la miró, cruzándose de brazos. — De nada — ironizó, receloso— ¿Qué demonios hacía Robert Fischer en tu edificio? Ariadne se congeló en su lugar, atónita. —No sé... Mi libro... ―Esto es peor de lo que creí― la interrumpió Eames, sobresaltándola al salir de su escondite tras una columna, jugando con una ficha de casino entre sus manos como si hubiera estado esperando para salir por un largo rato. Ariadne lo miró, sin entender su presencia allí. ― ¿Eames? ¿Qué haces...? ―Cobb me envió a vigilar a Fischer Jr desde que nos contaste de él, y lo seguí hasta aquí― explicó el susodicho, taciturno, y la sujetó por el codo para arrastrarla a un punto más íntimo del edificio, mirando hacia atrás a cada paso. ― ¿Qué pasa? ―Es más grave de lo que Cobb pensó― explicó el falsificador, sin bajar la guardia mientras arrinconaba a Ariadne contra una columna― Fischer está interesado en ti. Ariadne pestañeó, sin entender muy bien. ― ¿Qué? ―Estoy de acuerdo― secundó Arthur, haciendo una mueca. Ariadne frunció el ceño otra vez, más confundida que antes. ― ¿De qué están hablando? Eames soltó un pequeño bufido y chasqueó la lengua, sacándose la paleta de fresas que tenía entre los labios para poder hablar con más claridad. ―Al parecer Fischer ha estado buscándote. Ya sabes, como una especie de cacería del tesoro o algo así― explicó, taimado― Aún no sé bien lo que busca, pero si yo fuera tú saldría del país... Ariadne sintió su respiración cortarse en ese instante, y como acto reflejo miró a su alrededor, sintiéndose vigilada de pronto. Tragó grueso y se tomó unos segundos para poder hablar sin que la voz le fallara: ― ¿Crees que sepa...lo que pasó?― inquirió, temerosa por la respuesta. Eames y Arthur se miraron, compartiendo un gesto de intriga. ―No lo creo― acotó el segundo. En ése momento oyeron el elevador abrirse y los dos llevaron a Ariadne hasta él― Me vio y no me reconoció, pero es obvio que recordaba haberme visto. ―Por eso no podemos confiarnos― siguió Eames, parándose delante de las puertas del elevador para presionar el botón de su piso― Fischer Jr. parece inofensivo, pero el que de verdad me preocupa es Browning. Aléjate lo más que pueda de él y su ahijado o todos podríamos caer. Supongo que has escuchado de Ingeniería Cobol. Pues créeme que ellos no serían nada en comparación a alguien con tanto poder como Robert Fischer. Ariadne lo miró fijamente mientras el elevador subía los pisos. Sabía que Arthur odiaría admitirlo en voz alta, pero Eames, una vez más, tenía razón. Debía irse antes de que las cosas con Fischer se salieran de control. oOo . N del A: Gracias por leer!

Y no te preocupes, porque seguiré todas mis historias hasta el final, por más que a veces la inspiración esté en mi contra ;) Tal vez no lo crean necesario, pero cada comentario ayuda,y así, como autor, te dan más ganas de seguir escribiendo. Saludos! H.S.[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . . 7 Destino . oOo Las gaviotas chillaban sin cesar sobre sus cabezas. Las olas del mar rompían contra las rocas, emitiendo un fuerte y ensordecedor sonido que llegaba hasta sus oídos con la brisa. A lo lejos podían ver los últimos rayos del sol reflejándose en la estructura metálica de la Ópera de Sídney, proyectando tantos maravillosos colores que casi parecían irreales. Robert cerró los ojos al sentir el aire húmedo golpeando suavemente contra su rostro e instintivamente abrazó con fuerza a la chica que reposaba entra sus brazos y aspiró el aroma a rosas y sal de su largo cabello castaño. De pronto ella se movió y lo miró a los ojos, brindándole una caricia a su rostro que lo hizo suspirar y hundirse contra esa suave mano. — ¿Qué es éste lugar? —Aquí veníamos mi madre y yo todos los fines de semana cuando aún vivía. Ella amaba la ópera. Ariadne torció los labios un momento, pero luego regresó la vista hacia el atardecer, acomodándose entre sus brazos una vez más. —Me gusta. —A mí me gustas tú— respondió, sincero, volviendo a acercar sus rostros para besarla, y ella acercó el suyo también, teniendo que detenerse a mitad de camino. — Señor Fischer... Señor Fischer... Ariadne movió la cabeza con el ceño fruncido y Robert alzó la vista hacia el cielo, suspirando, derrotado. — ¿Qué fue eso? —Están llamándome— resopló, apretando el cuerpo de Ariadne contra el suyo un poco más, como si intentara mantenerla allí para siempre— Significa que debo regresar. —Pues ve. —No quiero dejarte. — ¿Por qué? —Porque cuando abra los ojos tú ya no estarás allí. Ariadne se separó de él y lo miró a los ojos con una sonrisa. De pronto el suelo comenzó a temblar, y la playa a desmoronarse a su alrededor. —Ariadne... —Volveremos a vernos, Robert— le sonrió, uniendo sus labios antes de que todo el universo desapareciera. —Señor Fischer. Disculpe, señor Fischer. Robert abrió los ojos y al instante se encontró con el bonito rostro de la sobrecargo de su avión frente a él, con una mano apretando ligeramente su hombro para despertarlo. Se acomodó sobre su asiento y carraspeó inconscientemente para aclararse la garganta. —Lo siento, señor Fischer, pero aterrizaremos a Los Ángeles en diez minutos y debe abrochar su cinturón. —Sí. Gracias— asintió, obedeciendo al instante mientras intentaba no volver a cerrar los ojos y ceder a la modorra. Se sujetó con fuerza de los lados de su asiento cuando el avión se movió ligeramente y empezó a descender; Robert observó el brillante océano azul por su ventana para intentar distraerse, y luego las palmeras, pero sus pensamientos rápidamente regresaron a su sueño, y de allí a Ariadne. Había pasado más de un año desde que la había visto por última vez. Ella simplemente había desaparecido, como si se la hubiese tragado la tierra. No sabía si se había casado o si alguien le había ofrecido empleo en el extranjero; durante meses había resistido el impulso de contratar a alguien para que la buscara en el mundo, lo cual no había sido muy difícil teniendo que liderar una compañía que rápidamente se había convertido en multimillonaria. Las obligaciones y el trabajo mantenían su mente ocupada la mayor parte del tiempo cuando estaba despierto, pero nada de eso bastaba en sus sueños. En ellos Ariadne no había faltado ni un solo día, y en ellos él no era tímido ni arrogante, y era capaz de decir lo que realmente sentía y pensaba sin miedos ni dudas. Pero cuando no dormía y no trabajaba, nada podía impedir que sintiera lo vacía que se había vuelto su vida. Tenía tanto dinero que no se acabaría en cien vidas, éxito y poder, pero no tenía a nadie a su lado, no tenía familia ni amigos más allá de su padrino, cuyo cariño muchas veces sentía forzado. Cuando estaba solo, únicamente en compañía de sus pensamientos, no podía evitar pensar que estaba convirtiéndose en su padre, siempre de junta en junta, preocupándose por hacer crecer su cuenta en el banco y descuidando todo los demás aspectos de su vida. Y odiaba eso. Su padre hubiera odiado verlo así. —Señor Fischer, estamos listos— dijo su asistente, indicándole que era hora de avanzar. Robert simplemente lo miró. No sabía su nombre, pues su padrino siempre procuraba cambiar sus asistentes cada mes por su seguridad, y apenas si tenía tiempo para relacionarse con ellos. Pero no le daba importancia. Siempre que su tío Peter creyera que era lo mejor estaría de acuerdo. Apenas la compuerta del avión se abrió y Robert descendió los primeros escalones metálicos su teléfono empezó a sonar, haciendo que volviera a zambullirse de lleno en el trabajo. Los guardaespaldas lo llevaron hasta su auto y no se separaron de él hasta que llegó a la junta de la única compañía que había conservado del conglomerado Fischer Morrow en Norteamérica. La reunión transcurrió sin ningún imprevisto y Robert analizó sus acciones con minuciosidad hasta que estuvo conforme con los resultados. Firmó algunos papeles, dio órdenes y recogió unos documentos que revisaría para dar su consentimiento antes de marcharse hasta dentro de dos semanas, cuando regresaría para la próxima reunión, siempre seguro, altivo y frío. Una vez que todo acabó, recogió sus cosas y se las dio a su asistente para marcharse. El equipo de seguridad los llevó hasta su hotel y solo entonces lo dejaron a solas, de nuevo solo con sus pensamientos. Pidió un almuerzo ligero que no tocó y se acomodó junto a una ventana, observando el océano a lo lejos mientras rememoraba su último sueño, hasta que, sin darse cuenta, se quedó profundamente dormido. De inmediato volvió a abrir los ojos en un lugar oscuro y desconocido. Tenía los pies y las manos atadas, y una mordaza en la boca. No tenía idea de cómo había llegado hasta ahí, pero estaba asustado. Algo le decía que iba a morir. Entonces una hermosa chica de ojos cafés apareció y le quitó la mordaza, acariciando su rostro con una mano e hizo que Robert se sintiera repentinamente a salvo. — ¿Se siente bien?— le preguntó, todavía con la mano en su mejilla y la respiración tan agitada que parecía estar asustada también. Eso le sorprendió, pero no tanto como la familiaridad de sus rasgos. Esos ojos, esa voz... Los conocía de algún lado, pero no lograba recordar de dónde. Todavía algo obnubilado por la situación creyó escuchar dos disparos y más gritos, y luego Robert se sintió caer al vacío, despertando de un salto cuando la sensación se volvió demasiado real. Se tambaleó hacia atrás como si estuviera a punto de caerse, y tardó unos segundos en darse cuenta de que seguía en su cuarto de hotel, en la misma posición en la que se había dormido y con su traje todavía puesto. No estaba en ningún lugar oscuro, no estaba cayendo y mucho menos había alguien con él, pero seguía sintiendo aquella opresión en el pecho, la sensación de que estaba en peligro inminente. Y de pronto se sintió incómodo y ahogado dentro de esa suite. Necesitaba salir de allí casi con desesperación, pero quería hacerlo solo, sin escoltas ni ojos curiosos controlando sus pasos. Nunca le había gustado eso de tener que moverse rodeado de llamativos guardaespaldas; de alguna manera eso hacía que se sintiera mucho más expuesto que cuando andaba solo, sin llamar la atención de nadie más allá por usar un reloj costoso o ropa fina. Por eso, aprovechando la confusión con unos turistas japoneses que ocupaban todo el corredor con su comitiva, Robert pudo escapar de los guardaespaldas que custodiaban su puerta y salió del hotel casi escabulléndose para evitar ser reconocido por los empleados. Solo una vez fuera pudo sentirse mejor, de nuevo a salvo y un poco más relajado; se deshizo de su corbata y chaqueta y deambuló sin rumbo fijo por las calles de la ciudad, mirando cosas sin ver nada realmente, solo caminando con las manos en los bolsillos como si fuera un transeunte más y no el sujeto que valía miles de millones que era. Caminó durante horas sin importarle su trayectoria, y, sin buscarlo, sus pies lo llevaron directo al Museo de Arquitectura y Diseño de Los Ángeles; entonces Robert, impulsado por la misma fuerza que lo había llevado hasta allí, decidió entrar. No era particularmente fanático de la arquitectura o el diseño, pero sí sabía apreciarlos, o al menos eso se repetía mentalmente mientras se preguntaba porqué demonios recorría aquella exposición cuando debía estar trabajando antes de volver a Sídney, donde lo esperaba aún más trabajo. No había muchas personas cerca, por lo que no tuvo prisa en regresar a las calles atestadas de gente, y no le pareció mala idea perder un poco más de tiempo en la calma de aquel lugar. Empezó a observarlo todo con atención, a pesar de que no entendía demasiado de diseño y estructuras. Como si supiera lo que hacía empezó a observar varias obras por cerca de veinte minutos, hasta que, mientras intentaba comprender las formas de un mezquita turca, algo llamó su atención: era un brillo, un pequeño destello que molestaba sus ojos y llegaba desde una pluma de metal que una chica sostenía entre sus dedos y golpeaba contra su bloc de notas, impaciente, observando unos planos en exposición con el ceño levemente fruncido. Robert se acercó un poco más para observarla mejor, y al hacerlo sintió su corazón detenerse y volver a latir sin control. No supo cómo reaccionar, si estaba en un sueño o aquello era real, porque allí, frente a él, estaba Ariadne, con su cabello castaño cayendo sobre su hombro derecho y esa misma expresión de concentración que tenía la primera vez que la había visto. Luego de desaparecer repentinamente un año atrás, ahora volvía a entrar en su vida de la misma forma; era ella, la chica de sus sueños. Con el corazón en un puño, y el miedo de que ella se desvaneciera como ya le había pasado antes, Robert se acercó con cautela. Toda su vida había desoído esas tonterías acerca del destino y cosas así, pero ahora no encontraba otra explicación. Él no había planeado adelantar su viaje esa semana, ni ir hasta allí ése día, a esa hora. Y sin embargo ahí estaba, y ahí estaba ella, tan concentrada en su trabajo que ni siquiera pareció notarlo. Así que, aclarándose la garganta, intentó hacerse notar por ella. — ¿Ariadne? Ariadne se sobresaltó y casi lanzó su cuaderno por la sorpresa. Parpadeó un par de veces para buscar la pluma que había soltado y luego alzó la vista, abriendo los ojos como platos al enfocarlos en él. — ¿Señor Fischer?— murmuró, desconcertada— ¿Qué hace aquí?― Robert se sorprendió por la crudeza de sus palabras, pero el hecho de volver a escuchar su voz hizo que sonriera como un chico de quince años. ― ¿Te refieres a Los Ángeles o aquí en el Museo?― respondió, de un buen humor tan inusual que incluso Ariadne pareció sorprendida. Ella parpadeó una vez más y casi con disimulo empezó a recoger sus cosas. ―Yo...― le sonrió, nerviosa, y ocultó los dibujos en los que había estado trabajando― Creí que ya no tenía asuntos que atender aquí luego de vender la compañía de su padre. Es decir, lo leí en algún lugar. ―Bueno― Robert decidió ser más osado y tomó asiento a su lado, tratando de parecer lo menos nervioso posible―, conservé algunas acciones, las más sentimentales, y así pude empezar mi nueva compañía con algo de respaldo. Por eso regreso periódicamente al país para asistir a las juntas de accionistas. ―Ah...― Ariadne se acomodó el cabello castaño tras las orejas, y Robert notó que estaba más largo y lacio que en sus sueños. Le gustaba de esa forma― No lo sabía. —Tampoco yo sabía que habías dejado París― mintió. Aunque no le había pagado a ningún detective, Robert la había buscado, en su departamento, la universidad y el café donde se habían visto por primera vez, y había averiguado que ella se había graduado para luego abandonar la ciudad sin dejar una nueva dirección o rumbo. Pero no le pareció muy apropiado decírselo sin sonar como un acosador. Ni siquiera él comprendía porqué había hecho todo eso. Ariadne se mojó los labios con indecisión y bajó la mirada. Robert quiso sonreír al notar que ella también se ponía nerviosa en su presencia. No tenía muchas experiencias con mujeres, pero dedujo que eso debía ser una buena señal. ―Sí― respondió la chica tras unos segundos, todavía algo indecisa― Terminé la universidad y me hicieron una oferta de trabajo. Así que empaqué y me fui― se encogió de hombros e hizo algunas rayas sin sentido en la cubierta de su libreta. ― ¿Y tu prometido?― Fischer no pudo detener la verborragia y tuvo que soltar la pregunta que había estado guardándose por más de un año. No estaba seguro de si podría soportar el hecho de que hubiera unido su vida a otro hombre, pero necesitaba saberlo. Ariadne lo miró, y por un momento pareció no entender de qué estaba hablándole. Luego reaccionó abriendo los ojos con sobresalto y negó, volviendo a concentrarse en su libreta. ― ¡Oh, Arthur!— exclamó, como si acabara de recordarlo— No iba a funcionar― suspiró, y para su sorpresa esbozó una sonrisa traviesa― Pero todavía somos muy buenos amigos. ― ¿Entonces no te casaste con él?― inquirió, sintiéndose ridículamente más animado de repente. Como respuesta, Ariadne negó con la cabeza y regresó la vista al frente, volviendo a concentrarse en los planos que colgaban de la pared. Robert, por su parte, se dedicó a admirar su perfil durante unos segundos antes de seguir su mirada y también concentrarse en la obra, frunciendo el ceño con intriga, en busca de iniciar una nueva conversación. ― ¿Sabes? Jamás entendí que son esas cosas en los dibujos― señaló mientras alzaba un brazo, y Ariadne dirigió su mirada hacia el mismo lado que él― Esas rayas y números a los extremos... ―Se llaman cotas― indicó con voz casi maternal, y Robert se deleitó al verla sonreír por su causa. ― ¿Y para qué sirven? Digo, porque muchas veces sólo parecen rayas accidentales que alguien se olvidó de borrar. La joven rió con un poco más de ganas. ―Es la distancia que indica la altura de un punto sobre una base de comparación. También se le llama elevación. Y los números son las medidas exactas o aproximadas del objeto o trazo— explicó, y Robert ladeó la cabeza como si de esa forma pudiera comprenderla mejor, lo cual no sirvió de mucho. Se pasó una mano por el mentón, un tanto indeciso, y sonrió. ―Sé que fuiste muy clara, pero aun así suena como ruso para mis oídos de graduado en Administración. Ariadne lo miró, riendo un poco más fuerte, y él le sonrió también. ―Por suerte para usted la arquitectura es en realidad muy fácil de apreciar si no te concentras sólo en planos o estructuras. ―Oh, sí. Ya lo creo— dijo, parándose para observar los planos más de cerca— Este lugar será un excelente edificio cuando alguien lo construya. ―De hecho alguien ya lo hizo. Se llama Guggenheim y está en Nueva York― declaró la joven, divertida, y Robert se hubiera sentido muy humillado si su risa no hubiera sido tan maravillosa para sus oídos. Se acercó un poco más y leyó la placa bajo la obra, comprobando, con el ceño fruncido, que ella tenía razón. ―Es cierto. Yo estuve ahí hace como seis meses. Es como meterse en un avispero gigante— comentó, sintiéndose algo estúpido por su falta de apreciación, pero la arquitectura jamás le había interesado hasta que la había conocido a ella. ―Supongo que esa era la idea, señor Fischer. ―Por favor, llámame Robert, Ariadne. ―Robert. Su nombre saliendo de aquellos labios sonaba tan bien que le causó un estremecimiento extraño. Y guiado por esa nueva sensación de seguridad la miró a los ojos, casi como una súplica, y sonrió. ― ¿Te importaría enseñarme el resto del museo? Digo, todo podría resultar mejor desde la perspectiva de una experta...— dijo, arrepintiéndose casi al instante. Si embargo, aunque algo renuente, ella por alguna razón aceptó. Los dos caminaron lado a lado en silencio por un rato. Ariadne no se mostró muy cómoda al principio, pero tras unos minutos pareció habituarse a su presencia y a dejar de intentar luchar contra ello. A pesar de su renuencia inicial, cuando empezó a hablar de arquitectura Robert la notó mucho más relajada, y sólo se limitó a escuchar y responder cuando era necesario. Por algún motivo le gustaba escucharla; había algo en su voz que lo hacía sentirse seguro. Ariadne se tomaba su tiempo con cada exposición y le hablaba sobre lo complicado de algunas estructuras, edificios y distintos diseños que, aunque sorprendentes, a Robert no le interesaban tanto como escucharla a ella. Tan a gusto se sintió que ni siquiera se dio cuenta de en qué momento había oscurecido afuera. Y mientras recorrían lado a lado el último tramo del museo, Fischer vio la fantasía llegando a su fin, si poder hacer nada para evitarlo. Miró la hora en su teléfono, dandose cuenta de todas las llamadas perdidas y mensajes de su padrino, pero decidió volver a apagarlo y no pensar en él. Cuando Ariadne y él salieron del edificio, antes de que pudiera despedirse, algo aterrado, la interrumpió, hablando de forma atropellada. ―Ariadne, ¿quieres...? ¿Te gustaría ir a comer algo? Aquí cerca. No como una cita o algo así. Solo...— Robert soltó un pequeño bufido, procurando calmarse— ¿Te gustaría comer algo?— repitió con calma, tal y como hacía cada vez que alguna junta lo ponía nervioso. Y Ariadne lo miró y frunció el ceño, algo incómoda. No obstante, no se negó ni salió corriendo. Eso le pareció muy positivo. La muchacha se tomó unos cuantos segundos para analizar su expresión y pensarlo, como si tratara de ver alguna especie de mensaje oculto tras sus palabras, y cuando pareció satisfecha con su escrutinio se encogió de hombros. ―Sí― contestó, guardando las manos en los bolsillos traseros de sus jeans con despiste― Me gustaría una hamburguesa y papas fritas. ― ¿Hamburguesa?― Robert levantó una ceja. Nunca había sido muy amigo de la comida chatarra y los lugares donde la servían, pero decidió que valía la pena intentar. Y para cuando se dio cuenta estaban sentados frente a frente en la cafetería más decadente que había pisado en su vida, rodeados de gente que parecía salida de todos los rincones más extraños de Los Ángeles, pero debía aceptar que aunque los pisos no se veían muy higiénicos y muchos de los clientes parecían salidos de un centro de rehabilitación, la comida era bastante buena; y a muy bajo costo, debía agregar. Pero lo mejor de todo era ver a Ariadne en un ambiente que era tan común y cómodo para ella. Sin duda era otra persona cuando se relajaba. Sonreía mucho más y hablaba hasta por los codos de todos sus proyectos y planes a futuro. ― ¿Así que eres americana? —Sí. — ¿De qué parte? —Nueva York. —Creí descubrirlo por tu acento... Yo soy de Australia. Sídney. Supongo que lo supiste por el mío— admitió, observando el fondo de su vaso de Soda con interés. Ella sonrió levemente. ―No tanto. Más bien hablas como un inglés. Robert soltó una breve e irónica risa carrasposa sin poder evitarlo. Siempre le pasaba cuando miraba hacia el pasado. ―Es porque mi padre me envió a un internado en Cambridge a los once, después de la muerte de mi madre— explicó, sin poder esconder un ligero atisbo de amargura—; finalicé mis estudios allí y luego me gradué en la Universidad de Oxford. Eso me hace más inglés que australiano, creo. Ariadne lo miró un momento, algo incómoda, pero luego rió entre dientes, terminando el dibujo en el que estaba trabajando para iniciar otro. ― ¿Qué hacés? ―Trato de crear un laberinto en dos minutos del que me cueste al menos uno salir. Es un viejo hábito. Los hago para...para divertir a los niños― sonrió con tristeza y regresó a sus trazos. ― ¿Puedo intentarlo? ―Si quieres. Robert tomó la libreta y trazó unas cuantas líneas paralelas bastante chuecas que luego borró y reemplazó por una curva, diseñando un laberinto redondo. Cuando se lo dio a Ariadne esta lo miró, sorprendida, e intentó resolverlo, sonriendo al ver que ya habían pasado sus dos minutos, pero sobre todo ante lo familiar de la escena. —Ganaste— lo felicitó, dejando su anotador y la pluma sobre la mesa en señal de rendición, gesto que Robert respondió con una sonrisa y un suave movimiento de cabeza. — ¿Y qué gané?— se atrevió a preguntar después de un rato, más osado de lo que había sido nunca. Y Ariadne lo miró, interrogante. —Pues... Yo invitaré las hamburguesas, señor Fischer— dijo, observando la hora en la pantalla de su teléfono. Y Robert la miró fijo, sopesando cada una de las alternativas que tendría a continuación. Entonces recargó los codos sobre la mesa y entrelazó los dedos delante del mentón, pensativo. No sabía qué era exactamente lo que sentía cuando Ariadne estaba cerca, cuando pensaba en ella o la veía en sus sueños. Pero lo que sí sabía era que nunca lo había sentido antes, y había conocido a las mujeres más hermosas del mundo, pero ninguna tan fascinante como ella, y mucho menos a ninguna que se hubiera metido tan adentro en sus pensamientos. Ariadne era la chica de sus sueños, después de todo; incluso antes de conocerla o escuchar su voz. Y aunque no tenía idea de adónde los llevaría todo eso ni qué era exactamente lo que sentía al respecto, tenía muy claro que quería averiguarlo. Pues había descubierto que nada, ni siquiera su trabajo, lo hacía sentirse tan pleno como cuando en sus sueños estaba con Ariadne. Y era mil veces mejor en la realidad. ―Quisiera salir contigo— le soltó de repente, tras un incómodo silencio, intentando ser de nuevo el imparable hombre de negocios que conseguía todo lo que se proponía. Ariadne dejó de comer y lo miró con sorpresa. Robert no entendió porqué le pareció ver pánico en sus ojos, pero se alivió al ver como la joven se sonrojaba hasta las orejas. ― ¿Usted quiere salir conmigo?— preguntó, temerosa, mas Robert no dejó que su inseguridad lo alcanzara. —Me gustaría. Mucho. — ¿Por qué? Solo soy una arquitecta. No soy bonita ni interesante... —Yo no lo creo así— respondió, seguro de sí mismo— Eres muy hermosa, pero la belleza no es un factor importante. Y eres muy interesante, al menos para mí. Por eso quisiera conocerte. — ¿Por qué?— insistió la chica. Robert dudó momento. No seas cobarde , se dijo, dando una gran bocanada de aire. Era un hombre adulto, Ariadne era visiblemente más joven pero una adulta también. ¿Qué tenían que perder? ―Tal vez te suene loco— comenzó, jugando distraídamente con el servilletero de metal—, pero... Creo que... No. Estoy seguro de que eres la persona que he estado buscando durante toda mi vida... La chica de mis sueños— soltó, sin vuelta atrás, y alzó la vista lo justo para ver . Ariadne parpadear, algo confundida. Y no la culpaba, pues él se sentía exactamente igual. Y cuando separó los labios para decir algo que lo redimiera un teléfono sonó, y, pidiendo un minuto con un seña, Aridne sacó el aparato de su bolso y atendió. — ¿Diga? James, cariño... ¿Qué pasa? ¿Qué?— empezó a hablar como si se hubiera olvidado de que él estaba allí, y Robert empezó a preguntarse si el tal James sería algo de ella para que le hablara con tanta familiaridad— Lo sé, cariño, lo sé. Pon a tu hermana al teléfono, ¿quieres? No. Dile que no voy a regañarla. No. No estoy enojada, cielo. Te lo juro— Robert frunció el ceño, ya sin entender nada, pero siguió atento a la conversación— Phillipa, cariño, ¿qué pasa?— preguntó, con la voz más angustiada— Oh, pequeña... Claro que no me molesta que me llames. Llegaré en un momento— dijo, inclinando la cabeza para sujetar el teléfono entre su cara y el hombro y de esa forma poder recoger sus cosas, así como sacar dinero que dejó sobre la mesa— Cariño, cariño, estaré allí en diez minutos, ¿está bien? Dale a James un beso de mi parte, y métanse a la cama. Ya, ya estoy saliendo. —Lo siento— se disculpó, apenada, mientras se ponía la chaqueta. — ¿Problemas? —No. Sí. Bueno... Los niños a los que entretengo con laberintos están enfermos y se angustiaron porque su padre es demasiado terco para avisarme...— bufó, de pronto molesta— De verdad lo lamento, pero tengo que ir con ellos... —Yo... Sí. Déjalo. Yo pagaré— la detuvo cuando iba a dejar el dinero sobre la mesa, pero ella negó con la cabeza e igualmente dejó el dinero, extendiéndole la mano después. —Gracias por la compañía, señor... Robert— se corrigió, apretando su mano con una sonrisa— Lamento tener que salir así, pero... — no pudo terminar su frase porque Robert no lo resistió y, siguiendo un impulso, inclinó la cabeza y la besó, haciéndola callar abruptamente. Sin embargo, segundos después, sin que ella le respondiera, completamente avergonzado, se separó de Ariadne y dio un tembloroso paso hacia atrás. —Lo siento— dijo, y al ver que ella seguía sin reaccionar se dio la vuelta y empezó a alejarse, con la ilusión de que Ariadne lo detuviera, pero no lo hizo. oOo . N del A : Hola gente al otro lado! Espero que les haya gustado el capítulo... En lo personal, no estoy fascinado, pero quería subirlo. Gracias por leer a mis fieles lectores! Hasta la próxima. Su buen vecino, H.S.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . oOo 8 Salvavidas . oOo James se removió ligeramente entre sueños, amoldándose mejor a su cuerpo en busca de calor mientras Phillipa, al otro lado, extendió un brazo sobre su cintura, tratando de no dejarla ir. Ariadne sonrió levemente y acarició los largos cabellos rubios de la niña, que respondió con una sonrisa inconsciente. Recordó entonces todas las noches que ella y Dom se quedaban así con los niños tras leerles un cuento, solo sonriéndose mientras los veían dormir entre ellos. Entonces suspiró, pensando en lo mucho que extrañaba esos días, cuando podía imaginarse formando una familia con Dominic y los niños. Lo había arruinado; había desoído las advertencias de Arthur y había caído por Dom. Se había enamorado de él, y al final le habían roto el corazón, pero aun así, por extraño que fuera, no se arrepentía de haberlo hecho; había sido un año de relación muy lindo. Cobb y ella se amaban, y sus hijos la adoraban tanto como Ariadne a ellos. Tan así era que incluso había llegado a pensar que aquello sería para siempre, pero Dom no podía. Él de alguna forma seguía aferrándose a Mal y todo lo sucedido. Era como si tuviera miedo de herirla también, por eso decidieron (o más bien él lo había hecho) tomar caminos separados. Pero los niños eran otro asunto. Ariadne los quería y ellos a ella, y ese vínculo, como le había dicho Dom, no podía romperse a pesar de que ellos ya no fueran pareja. Ya habían pasado dos meses de eso, y entonces Fischer había aparecido esa misma tarde, y la había besado. Fue el primer hombre en hacerlo después de Dom. ¿Cómo se suponía que debía reaccionar a eso? ¿Qué era lo que buscaba metiéndose con ella? ¿Querría sacarle información? ¿Acaso la había descubierto? Horas atrás, mientras estaban juntos en el museo, luego de mucho analizarlo había llegado incluso a pensar que el interés de Fischer, aunque no le parecía lógico, era honesto y sin segundas intenciones. Pero ahora no sabía qué pensar. Robert Fischer era un gran estratega, y una personas soberbia, sin duda descubrir que ellos habían estado hurgando en su mente para cambiar su vida podría haberlo molestado tanto como para planear algo en contra del equipo, usándola a ella para lograrlo. Eso era lo más lógico. Fischer hijo era muy apuesto, no era tan necia como para negarlo, y además era uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo, y podría tener a la reina de belleza que quisiera, incluso a alguna princesa europea si se lo proponía, ¿por qué entonces le interesaría alguien como ella? Ariadne sabía que no era muy bonita, tampoco era alguien muy divertida o interesante. Varias veces los chicos en la escuela se habían reído de ella por su forma tan tosca de caminar cuando tenía prisa, diciéndole que si no tuviera el cabello largo pasaría por un chico. Aunque reconocía que no era un espanto, pero sabía que en el mundo real eso no bastaba para que el Príncipe se enamorara del sapo. Sin embargo, había algo en los ojos de Robert que le decía justamente lo contrario. No podía dejar de pensar en las palabras de Fischer, diciéndole que era 'la chica de sus sueños'. Ya había oído de algunos extractores cuyas proyecciones quedaban en el subconsciente del sujeto, pero nunca con tanta claridad como para que ellos lograran identificarlos fuera del sueño. No entendía, entonces, cómo era posible que una proyección suya se hubiera arraigado tanto a la mente de Fischer, al punto de que él asegurara que la veía específicamente a ella. Dom comentó una vez que había sabido de unos cuanto a casos que podía contar con los dedos de una mano; no pasaba con mucha frecuencia pero no era imposible que sucediera. No había una explicación lógica, pues la mayor parte del subconsciente era, aún para ellos, muy difícil de predecir y comprender. Quizá Robert Fischer lo era también. Sin embargo, él había sido entrenado para prevenir intrusos en su mente, y le aterraba la idea de que eso hiciera que la recordara a ella tal y cómo era, aunque Robert se había tragado el cuento de que ellos eran los buenos, ¿no? Era muy extraño. Demasiado. Por eso, tal vez, sólo quizá, debería indagar al respecto... No, Ariadne. Se reprendió mentalmente. Encogiéndose de hombros decidió dejar el asunto de lado y abrazó al pequeño James con un poco más de fuerza, acomodándose para descansar un rato, pero después de cinco minutos se dio por vencida, y, cansada de esos extraños pensamientos, Ariadne se levantó con mucho cuidado de no despertar a los niños. Cubrió a ambos hermanos muy bien con una manta y salió de la habitación sin hacer ruido, notando que la luz del estudio seguía encendida, así que no dudó en dirigirse hacia allí. —Buenas noches, profesor —saludó, y Miles rápidamente levantó la mirada de los planos que revisaba, sonriéndole al instante. —Oh, Ariadne... Entra. ¿Cómo están los niños? —Bien. Les di la medicina y la fiebre bajó —respondió ella, ahogando un bostezo mientras dirigía una rápida mirada al proyecto en el que trabajaba su profesor —Ahora están dormidos… —Eres un ángel para esta familia, Ari... ¿Quieres darme una mano con estos planos? He tenido algunos problemas para dibujar los espacios abiertos, y no me vendría mal otra opinión experta —le sonrió, y Ariadne le regresó al gesto, tomando una silla para sentarse a su lado. Sin embargo, antes de poner manos a la obra, decidió cambiar el tema: —Profesor, ¿puedo hacerle un pregunta? —Por supuesto. ¿Qué necesitas saber? —preguntó el anciano, sin levantar la mirada de los planos. Ariadne dudó un momento, mojándose los labios con la punta de la lengua. —¿Recuerda hace un año…cuando me presentó a Cobb y me uní a su equipo? —preguntó, y Miles asintió, mirándola con el ceño levemente fruncido con intriga, invitándola a continuar —En ese primer trabajo, yo…creo que algo salió mal. Extremadamente mal… —¿Qué cosa? —preguntó el profesor; ella tomó aire y relajó los hombros. —Volví a ver al sujeto, y él me reconoció —admitió, sin dar lugar a que su antiguo mentor dijera algo —Y no solo eso, profesor. Rob-…el sujeto se acercó a mí, y me dijo que soñaba conmigo. Él me ve en sus sueños, como una clase de…proyección constante. Y sé que no soy una experta en esto como usted y Dom, pero sé que eso no debería pasar. Yo no… no sé qué pensar al respecto, y tengo miedo, porque nuestro sujeto es un hombre entrenado para proteger su mente. ¿Es posible que algo de lo que hicimos haya dañado su subconsciente? —preguntó, preocupada. Sin embargo, aunque su planteo era serio, el anciano, lejos de compartir su preocupación, solo esbozó una tenue sonrisa. —Oh, Ariadne, trabajaste junto al mejor, y créeme que Cobb no hubiera permitido que algo malo le pasara al subconsciente de ninguno de sus sujetos. Lo conozco bien. Es mi yerno, y además yo lo entrené. —Pero si no hubo daños, ¿por qué él me ve en sus sueños una y otra vez? ¿Cómo es que mi imagen pudo grabarse en su mente inconsciente? —Bueno, quizá ése sujeto se 'encariñó' con tu proyección, por eso su mente te repite constantemente —el profesor frunció sus cejas blancas una vez más —Tal vez, podría ser, que eres como un salvavidas para su subconsciente. —¿Salvavidas? —Sí. Su mente, de alguna manera, te asocia con la sensación de bienestar que tal vez el sujeto necesita. Quizá necesitaba llenar un hueco emocional, y tú, de alguna forma, lo cubriste —comentó, y Ariadne entonces rememoró todo lo sucedido durante el trabajo de Fischer hijo. Recordó que ella le había salvado la vida luego de que la esposa de Cobb le hubiera disparado y después secuestrado en el último nivel de su sueño, si es que podía decirle así a arrojarlo por un precipicio; no entendía cómo era que el subconsciente de Fischer la viera como una especie de heroína. Aun así, todo lo que el profesor decía ahora cobraba cierto sentido —Aunque no puedo asegurarlo —siguió Miles —, porque no conozco al sujeto ni lo he estudiado. Sin embargo, admito que nunca había escuchado de un caso similar, pero en cuestiones del subconsciente humano, todo es posible… —¿Y cómo hago que se detenga? —preguntó Ariadne, con algo de frustración. —No puedes. Nadie puede controlar el subconsciente de una persona, Ariadne. —¿No? ¿Y entonces qué se supone que hacemos invadiendo sus sueños? —Lo manipulamos, pero no lo controlamos. Y si la mente de tu sujeto te tiene atrapada allí, pues no hay nada que puedas hacer. No desde aquí afuera, al menos. —¿Podría arreglarlo si vuelvo a entrar en su mente? —O empeorarlo. Siendo alguien entrenado, una segunda intromisión de tu subconsciente en el de él podría hacer que su mente te reconozca, y te descubra, tanto dentro del sueño como fuera de él. Sería demasiado arriesgado volver a meterte en sus mente —zanjó, quitándose las gafas. Ariadne entonces ahogó un suspiro de frustración, cubriéndose el rostro con las manos brevemente. —Hay algo más, profesor... —admitió, soltando un profundo suspiro —No es solo que el sujeto me vea en sus sueños… Creo…creo que él piensa que tiene sentimientos por mí... —Bueno, quizá eso sea verdad... —No, no es posible. Ni siquiera me conoce. ¿Cómo podría sentir algo por mí? —Cosas más extrañas pasan todos los días, Ari —el hombre rió con simpatía, poniéndose las gafas nuevamente, pero Ariadne no quería dejar el asunto todavía. —¿Qué cree que debería hacer entonces? —preguntó, haciendo un mohín de auténtica preocupación —¿Cómo saber que su mente solo proyecta mi imagen y él no trata de jugar conmigo para vengarse o algo así? —Investiga. —¿Cómo? El profesor rió una vez más, dándose la vuelta para volver a concentrarse en sus planos. —Eres una chica inteligente; sabrás qué hacer. oOo Ariadne ahogó un suspiro, tratando de ocultar su nerviosismo, aunque sin mucho éxito. Sabía que Robert Fischer era un hombre de hábitos. Años atrás lo había estudiado, y sabía que mientras estaba en Los Ángeles siempre visitaba la misma cafetería para desayunar, a la misma hora. Pedía un café negro, huevos revueltos y donas, que nunca comía, porque al parecer sólo le gustaba la imagen del típico desayuno americano, pero no su sabor. La arquitecta miró su reloj. Aún faltaban unos minutos para las siete, pero la ansiedad se estaba apoderando de ella. Ni siquiera estaba segura de lo que hacía allí, o sí Fischer siquiera seguía en la ciudad, pero entonces Robert apareció en la entrada, puntual, igual que siempre, hablando por teléfono mientras mantenía el ceño fruncido y esa expresión arrogante y de superioridad que siempre mostraba desde la primera vez que lo había visto. Excepto, ahora se daba cuenta, cuando estaba con ella. Las veces que Ariadne había hablado con él, Fischer se mostraba algo tímido, incluso simpático; nunca la trató con superioridad o desdén. Eso le hizo sentir un extraño retorcijón en el estómago. ¿Cómo alguien podía ser tan implacable y tímido a la vez? ¿Cómo alguien podría fingir tan bien dos personalidades tan opuestas? Ariadne movió la cabeza y enderezó la espalda, pensando cómo sería la mejor forma de abordar a Fischer sin que pareciera que estaba acosándolo. No obstante, ni siquiera habían pasado cinco minutos cuando se arrepintió de haber ido hasta allí, así que tomó sus cosas y salió del lugar, dudando unos segundos antes de irse, con los últimos resquicios de valentía que le quedaban, pero finalmente decidió tomar la dirección opuesta e irse. —¿Ariadne? Demasiado tarde. Sintiendo su corazón paralizado, Ariadne detuvo su marcha y lentamente se dio la vuelta. Robert Fischer estaba tras ella; había corrido fuera de la cafetería hasta alcanzarla, y Ariadne sintió sus mejillas acalorarse al verlo, igual que a Fischer, que de inmediato bajó la mirada, como si acabara de darse cuenta lo extraño de su reciente exabrupto. —Yo…¡ujum!…—Robert se aclaró la garganta y acomodó su corbata, mirando al pisa un momento, igual que ella —¿Cómo estás? —Señor Fischer —dijo Ariadne en un suspiro, soltando todo el aire que estaba conteniendo en sus pulmones. Fischer hijo frunció el ceño. —Llámame Robert —murmuró, y después los dos guardaron un incómodo silencio. —Amm…Tengo que irme —musitó la arquitecta con algo de dificultad. Robert la miró a los ojos un momento y después volvió a bajar la vista, sin decir nada hasta que ella volteó para irse. —Lamento haberte besado —le dijo, deteniéndola una vez más; y Ariadne volteó para verlo nuevamente, sintiendo aún más calor en su rostro. Fischer, que también se había sonrojado, añadió con rapidez —Quiero decir, no me arrepiento de haberlo hecho. Yo quería besarte. Pero lamento si te molesté. No puedo explicar lo avergonzado que me siento por haber actuado de esa forma... Yo nunca hago ese tipo de cosas, pero aquel día…—suspiró —Entenderé si mi presencia te molesta. —No es eso —lo interrumpió la joven, mirándolo a los ojos una vez más, armándose de valor para sonreír —No me molesta, y no me molestó que me besaras…—informó, bajando la vista con pena una vez más, pero aun así pudo ver la enorme y sincera sonrisa que Fischer, esa vez, no intentó ocultar. —Sé que podría sonar extraño, pero… ¿Quisieras acompañarme a desayunar? —le preguntó, ya sin dudas o vergüenza. —Sí —respondió Ariadne, sin borrar su sonrisa. Fingir frente a Fischer se le antojó extrañamente fácil de pronto. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Los personajes de Inception no me pertenecen. . I Sueños . . Podía decirse que Robert F"},{"Movie":"Inception","Title":"Practically Perfect","Author":"slash mania","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12957925","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A.N- This is a blanket author\\'s note. There is also a blanket disclaimer, too. I just finished posting on AO3. I don\\'t own either Inception or Mary Poppins. I had a lot of fun writing, so please enjoy! People wouldn\\'t know it from looking at him, but Arthur came from a very special bloodline. Arthur, while not looking particularly average or even outstanding (though a certain forger might have something to say about that), came from a line of specifically skilled individuals. They were indispensable, prompt, rule-abiding, sometimes taskmasters, but always remembered for their charm, though they often were mistaken as either stuffy or sticks in the mud. Unless they had seen it for themselves, not a soul would believe that Arthur\\'s last name was Poppins. That the traits that made a Poppins an exemplary nanny actually skipped a generation, and that Arthur, who had always known the family secret, had thought that his oldest sister (who was kind, but firm, and could marshal and command an entire troop of children with a smile and promise of sweets for jobs well done) would have received the Poppins trait. But Arthur had been wrong, and his parents had noticed the earliest signs well before Arthur could formulate an opinion against becoming a magical nanny; like how when he was a toddler Arthur would play patty cake with his image in the mirror, the reflection behaving like another, identical Arthur. Or how Arthur had an untrained but excellent singing voice that allowed objects to move at his melodic command. But when he was older, Arthur, then a sulky and pubescent teen, had argued with his grandmother about following the family calling. \"I don\\'t-\" \"Pish posh,\" his grandmother said, reaching out and smoothing his hair back. \"It\\'s not a matter of want. It\\'s your calling. You have skills that are perfect for looking after others, Arthur.\" \"And changing diapers and wiping noses and reading stories to ungrateful little children,\" Arthur groaned. \"Grandmother, I don\\'t want to do it! Why can\\'t I become what I want to be? Maybe something that isn\\'t so girly?\" His grandmother raised an eyebrow at him, imperious, commanding. \"Being a nanny isn\\'t girly, Arthur Poppins.\" \"I sang to my vacuum and it took care of the carpet for me,\" Arthur said slowly. \" I sang to it . There weren\\'t even words, I just started humming and then it happened!\" \"You\\'re a natural,\" his grandmother proclaimed. Tugging her grandson in for a hug, she muffled his complaints, because Arthur always had many, many complaints when they spoke of the Poppins gifts. Face smushed against his grandmother\\'s chest, Arthur mumbled, \"My window was open and a bird flew in and sang along with me.\" \"But that\\'s lovely!\" \"It crapped on the floor, too. Am I supposed to say that\\'s lovely?\" Grandmother Poppins gave him a stern look, squeezing his shoulders and reassuring him that everything would be fine. \"You\\'ll grow into it, Arthur.\" And Arthur grew up, eventually moving away from home, joining the military in an attempt to escape the dominantly feminine aspects of the family gift. Arthur wanted to be a soldier, proving his mettle and strength, fighting for his country, and purposely not singing or cleaning or looking after children. But after he became involved in Project Somnacin, he felt he\\'d finally found his niche- that it was far enough away from the future and skills his grandmother had promised him he\\'d grow into and closer to what he imagined for himself which had been a blurry anything but what grandmother said . That sort of definition gave Arthur plenty of leeway- he\\'d tried being a soldier; but after being in that experimental program, he\\'d taken to dreamshare and seen all the blurry ideas about his future suddenly become clear- he could go anywhere, do anything , as long as he had the PASIV. So he stole it. He wished he wasn\\'t surprised when his grandmother managed to call him on the special burner phone he\\'d gotten so he\\'d be able to drop off the grid and hide from the military. It said something about the willpower of his grandmother that she\\'d been able to do what the US Military couldn\\'t. \"Arthur, I\\'m very disappointed in you!\" Though Arthur was a grown man now, skilled in several forms of combat and known for his ability not to flinch in the face of the most horrifying dreams, the sound of his grandmother\\'s voice made him remember what it felt like to be small and young and only wanting her approval. \"Grandmother, I can\\'t do what you want me to do. I can\\'t- no, I won\\'t be a nanny! Special Poppins traits, be damned!\" He could practically feel her disapproval from over the phone; it was tangible and manifested itself as a prickling sensation across the back of his neck. Then he heard her sigh. His grandmother didn\\'t often give up, or lose hope. She often managed to find some way to get things done properly. After all, when measured she was Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way. Arthur wasn\\'t so sure what he\\'d be measured as; there may be swears included next to the name of Arthur Poppins because he\\'d disappointed her. \"You\\'ve always been the most independent of my grandchildren. But I don\\'t think this chapter of your life is closed. Please be safe, darling.\" Arthur worked in dreamshare and made a name for himself. He was the best. Arthur was the best point man. He got to spend several years of his life working his dream job; it had nothing to do with caring for children. But it appeared that even as he worked his dream job, he was drawn into the world he\\'d fled, the destiny he had tried to ignore. Even when he met the Cobbs and worked with them for awhile, it took him awhile to develop relationships with their children. Aware of the skills he possessed, Arthur became famous for raising up his empty hands and quickly saying, \"No, no please, wouldn\\'t you rather someone else hold the baby?\" The answer was usually no. Despite his best efforts of masking it, Arthur was excellent with children. And from the Cobbs pleasant home in California, Arthur was certain he could feel the quiet triumph of his dear grandmother on the other side of the planet. Arthur rocked, fed, played with, and changed babies, silently telling himself that this meant nothing. That he wasn\\'t a nanny! And then Mal committed suicide and the axis of Arthur\\'s world shifted place, forcing him to take on an entirely different job that didn\\'t relate to the Cobbs growing, now motherless, babies, but focused on Arthur\\'s diligent care of Dominic Cobb as he circled the globe and struggled to come up with a way back home in light of the damning evidence Mal had left behind. Cobb was just unobservant enough that he didn\\'t notice when Arthur\\'s family gifts began to encroach on Arthur\\'s neatly ordered, dream criminal lifestyle. When Cobb was broken by grief, Arthur would have to force Cobb to do even the most basic things. He\\'d have to force Cobb to change his clothes, chide him for living like a slob, and really put his foot down when the man\\'s drinking became unhealthy. But the worst had to be Cobb\\'s sleeplessness. The man would stare up at the ceiling in a disturbing fashion. And when they had to share beds because of poor accommodations explained away in several languages that boiled down to \"from the nurturing and kind way you dragged the blonde man in here, we thought that you were a couple. You\\'re not? Because if you\\'re not a couple you must be very codependent. Or he treats you like his personal nanny!\" It wasn\\'t an exact quote or translation, but that was the gist of it. Arthur always cringed at the last part, because he thought he\\'d moved on from that. He was able to wave off the comment about them being a couple because there were only so many assumptions that could be made when Arthur had to do so much for Cobb to ensure his survival. So when Cobb would stare at the ceiling, Arthur wouldn\\'t be able to help himself. He\\'d sing to himself very softly. His grandmother\\'s favorite songs for sleep, the ones he remembered her singing to him when he was a child. As Arthur continued, just as soft, just as mellow, Cobb\\'s eyes began to flutter and unintentionally shut. Cobb would drop to sleep within minutes and then roll over and cuddle Arthur. Arthur would silently hate himself and then either very firmly tell Cobb the next morning that he was sleeping on the floor for his back, or resolve to come up with a better argument for the hotel owners that believed he and Cobb were a couple; maybe something that translated better than a simple no. Maybe hell no, you would have to kill me first, this man cuddles. When he met Eames, things became difficult. His grandmother, bless her, didn\\'t often tell her grandson about her husband, Bert. Arthur never met him, his mother never met him; at a certain point of his life, Arthur had been certain that Bert was just a made up, dreamed up man that his grandmother said was her husband, and that was all. Because when Arthur was a very little boy, he\\'d not believed his grandmother when she would talk about all the fun things she and Bert had done. His grandmother couldn\\'t possibly do fun things like jumping into chalk drawings or dance and sing on rooftops! Grandmother Mary was firm and liked rules, and when Arthur grew up a little he could understand how he\\'d not understood that the fun and the rules sometimes mixed. That it wasn\\'t at all fair to say his grandmother wasn\\'t fun just because she had a hard job that forced her to come up with entertaining ways of getting those in her care to listen to her. And once again, once he was older, Arthur began to see the parallel. While he\\'d been sort of frightened of James and Phillipa when they were babies, he learned to love them because of their personalities and the way they\\'d look at him adoringly, even if he forced them to eat their vegetables or clean their rooms. Arthur\\'s caring for Cobb wasn\\'t all that different- Cobb also wasn\\'t so awful, even if Arthur had to tell Cobb to shut the fuck up at 3 a.m. because they had to sleep and then get out of the country in the morning. He was getting away from himself. What he meant was that his grandfather, whom he never knew but he could now believe in a little bit more because he was older and wiser and couldn\\'t find a better explanation for why Grandmother Mary had his mother. Not wanting to open up that kind of a can of worms, Arthur was willing to believe his grandmother\\'s stories of Bert. When Arthur was very young and not so dead set on never ever becoming a nanny, Arthur could imagine that Bert had been an amazing guy. He\\'d been funny, creative, and charming. Responsible when it counts, but also very insightful, too! And when Arthur met Eames, he\\'d had a horrible sinking feeling that not only was he fulfilling his grandmother\\'s beliefs of what he was supposed to be in life, but that they also had a similar type. Because Eames was artistic and charming, funny, too! He was just the right mix of responsible and renegade, a fellow deserter from another PASIV oriented project, who left because he didn\\'t agree with what use the technology was being put to. Never mind that Eames was using the same technology to steal information from others! \"Hello, darling,\" Eames had said, shaking hands with Arthur, but giving him such a look. A look like that could last for days. If Arthur were honest, he replayed that look in his mind over the course of that job, ignoring Cobb until the man finally became aware enough of what they were doing and what was at stake to ask Arthur why the hell was he taking so long in the shower? The only difference between Eames and Arthur\\'s grandfather was their professions. Eames, dream thief and forger, may have been an artist at one point. Or he could have dabbled in it for money. Or maybe he honestly loved it and kept it separate from his work for a reason. Arthur\\'s grandfather had been the type of artist to choose a nice spot on the streets and begin creating a beautiful world that would only seem two-dimensional on the pavement, but was really a wonderful place that was accessible if you think, wink, double blink, and then jump! Whenever grandmother would tell those stories, Arthur would wish he could do the same, to really jump into the scenes he loved best. Bert was also a musician. And, of course, the last was the one thing that grandmother Mary always mentioned with a sad smile. \"Arthur, your grandfather was a fine chimney sweep.\" He only learned what happened to Bert when he was old enough to understand that unlike all the other magical parts of her stories, chimney sweep accident only meant that Bert had jumped in and not made it to the other side of anything. That the only thing he\\'d done was hit the bottom and not come back. But why bring it up at all? Arthur had never met the man, and knew that his grandmother missed him. If Arthur were being honest with himself, he\\'d say that he was hopelessly attracted to Eames (that he liked working with him, talking with him, and had spent much personal time thinking about him) but didn\\'t see how he could make a relationship work, especially with his history and his family. Cobb\\'s dependence upon him deserved its own category, so for many years as he followed after the extractor Arthur had enough reasons to not indulge in the idea of anything with Eames. Because deep in his heart, for as many times as he clenched his fist and swore the oath to never, ever become a nanny, he also had another oath about not setting himself up for disappointment. And then the Fischer job happened. They completed an inception, and Cobb got to go home to his children, leaving Arthur free to take on whatever jobs he wanted, without seeing to the care and well-being of Cobb. What happened next was inevitable.[Chapter 2] It was like being involved in some sort of accident or natural disaster. It was amazing how fast things progressed once Eames appeared at Arthur\\'s side at baggage claim, pointedly looking the way that Cobb had gone as if he was checking that the coast was clear. Arthur was busy pretending he didn\\'t notice that. \"Now that you\\'ve ditched Cobb, what do you say to us teaming up, Arthur?\" \"I didn\\'t ditch him; we\\'re all separating like any team should after the completion of a high-stakes dreamshare job.\" But it was possible that it was obvious how done Arthur was with Cobb\\'s behavior during the inception. Sure, Cobb had pulled off what Arthur had believed to be impossible, but that didn\\'t restore any good feelings Arthur had for the man; after all, when all was said and done, that man cuddled. He had done ridiculous, unethical things in order to get back to his children during that job, but none of it trumped the fact that the man cuddled. Arthur trusted James and Phillipa with Cobb. In the past they\\'d proven to him that they could keep their pet gold fish alive. They were smart kids, and now that Cobb was back and mostly sane, they\\'d likely be enough to keep their father in line and could still proudly show Arthur their clean bedrooms, drawings, intricate Lego designs, and report cards over Skype. Arthur was free from playing point-nanny to Cobb. It made Eames\\'s offer very tempting. Arthur clenched his fist and tried to remind himself why it was a bad idea, that it would only lead to disappointment. \"Come on,\" Eames said as Arthur thought, considered, and reconsidered. \"We work well together. We\\'ve always worked well together!\" Arthur turned to Eames then and gave him his terms. \"Fine, we\\'ll work together as a team. But let me make this clear, okay?\" Eames nodded, perhaps prepared for some form of negotiation. \"I\\'m listening.\" \"If we\\'re a team, you and I? I\\'m your point man not your caregiver.\" Eames raised his eyebrows. \"We\\'re both grown men. We\\'re criminals at the top of our fields after just pulling off the biggest job of both our careers combined. If I wanted you to treat my wounds, cook my meals, and look after me, I\\'d say so.\" \"I\\'m not doing that,\" Arthur pressed, shaking his head and picking up his bag, gesturing that Eames should follow him. \"If we\\'re going to be talking about work, let\\'s do it somewhere where people can\\'t overhear.\" The forger followed after Arthur, already offering suggestions. \"We could go to a bar? Get a meal?\" Arthur snorted. \"I\\'ve got a hotel room that would be much more private. Is room service and a minibar good enough, Mr. Eames?\" \"Yes, it will be the perfect way to celebrate!\" They didn\\'t order anything fancy from room service; Eames had a burger and Arthur had decided on a salad, then regretted the choice when he started to put away lots of itsy-bitsy bottles of Jack Daniels. Eames had matched him with itsy-bitsy bottles of Absolut. \"I-,\" Arthur began to say, then forced himself to speak even though it was going to come out sort of slurred, thinking: Once you\\'ve begun to get drunk with your new partner, there\\'s some things you have to let go. \"\\'m getting too drunk, Eams- Eamers- Eames! There,\" Arthur said triumphantly, and grinned at the forger. \"Got it right on the third try!\" \"You are so darling,\" Eames said, not nearly as crocked as Arthur, sitting with his arms folded against his chest, his line of empty vodka bottles standing like soldiers next to his plate. The hotel room table was nearly big enough for their plates, but if they continued drinking all the little bottles would land on the floor. \"The minibar might have mini snacks,\" Arthur was muttering, getting out of his chair and stumbling to it. He opened it and exclaimed, \"Look, Eames! They have Pringles!\" Eames tried to hold back his laughter, but just couldn\\'t when Arthur came back to the table holding a bright red canister of chips. \"You hate Pringles, Arthur.\" But Eames watched as Arthur carefully peeled off the plastic lid, then the inner seal, finally plucking out a chip and taking a bite. \"I don\\'t hate Pringles,\" Arthur said after chewing and swallowing. \"I just like the original flavor. I feel the same way about Lays, I\\'m satisfied with the original, and maybe the honey barbecue ones.\" \"See? We\\'re learning new things about each other now that Cobb is home.\" Arthur picked up another chip and pointed at Eames with it. \"There are things I don\\'t want you to learn about me.\" Eames paid close attention. \"Embarrassing things or things that will send men to kill me in the night?\" Then Eames began to guess at what those things might be. \"Your first suit was plaid. You are of royal blood. Somewhere there is a picture of you in an adorable bunny costume. Your dimples are the work of a skilled plastic surgeon.\" Arthur shook his head and said, \"\\'m supposed to be a magic nanny. My grandmother said so.\" Then Arthur laughed, not noticing the shocked look on Eames\\'s face. \"And fuck you, my dimples are real!\"[Chapter 3] Arthur woke up feeling hungover, but at least he woke up in bed, covered up by a blanket, with someone laying next to him- Arthur\\'s eyes snapped open when he realized he wasn\\'t alone. That there was Eames, curled up under the same blanket, but still a respectful distance away from Arthur on the generously sized bed. To Arthur\\'s knowledge, there had been no sexual activity, but he\\'d gotten pretty drunk, so maybe he\\'d better be mature and gently wake Eames up to ask. Yes, that was an excellent place to start. But Arthur carefully got out of the bed, not daring to jostle the forger awake as he did what he could to avoid doing any of it. He didn\\'t want to be mature. He didn\\'t want to listen to what Eames remembered him saying the night before when he was still flying from their surviving an impossible job and then drinking too much whiskey. The room was slightly chilly and Arthur looked back at the warm bed, and his sleeping bed mate, with a trace of longing that had less to do with his feet getting cold and more to do with the fact that there was a damned reason he\\'d not wanted to get involved like this! He shook his head and took stock of the situation; still wearing his clothing, definitely a plus, his suit jacket draped over his luggage near the closet, shoes tossed close to it. His clothing had been loosened. Either he, or maybe Eames, had thought to remove his tie and waistcoat, to unbutton his shirt collar so he wouldn\\'t wake up uncomfortable. Arthur examined his bare feet and wondered where the socks had gone. There was something sort of intimate about the thought of Eames helping him get comfortable enough to sleep off being crocked. He started to feel reassured that nothing happened aside from the most damning thing he could recall; that he\\'d told Eames about the magic nanny thing. Sure, his memory got a little vague after that. He remembered laughing a lot, so maybe it wasn\\'t so horrible? Maybe Eames would honestly think that Arthur was ridiculous after he\\'d put a few away? Still mulling those thoughts over, Arthur retreated to the bathroom with a change of clothes and the zippered bag full of his preferred toiletries. He\\'d shower and think about what to do. After a short shower and shave, Arthur still hadn\\'t thought of anything that would help. He\\'d brushed his teeth, annoyed that he\\'d forgotten to grab something for his headache before bothering to wash up. He would get it once he\\'d left the restroom, put together yet casual, only sort-of ready to deal with whatever lay ahead. He\\'d leave the bottle on the table with an empty water glass, because while Arthur had said he wasn\\'t going to be Eames\\'s caregiver, he still believed in being polite. He\\'d invited Eames to his hotel room, after all, and being a good host didn\\'t have to be used with just his actual home in mind. But when Arthur left the bathroom he noticed that Eames was still sleeping. Arthur checked the alarm clock on the nightstand and frowned. It wasn\\'t even 8:00 a.m. yet. Naturally an early riser, Arthur had considered the effects of the ten hour flight, the three levels of their shared dream, and the strain it would place on all of them. Arthur shouldn\\'t have been so surprised that Eames was sleeping in. It just meant that Arthur would have a chance to get his thoughts in order. The deal with Arthur and thinking or planning, was that he did it best while occupied with something else. He could go for a walk or a jog, order breakfast and coffee, or do what had been nagging him when he passed the mess on the table to reach the shower. Arthur wasn\\'t a neat freak. He liked things to be organized, clean, and out of the way when not in use. The remains of his and Eames\\'s meal and alcohol binge littered the table. He looked around the room and noticed that there were things that could be moved for the sake of making packing and leaving by check-out easier. Arthur looked at Eames again, noticing that the man was resting peacefully. He resolved that he\\'d get this done by himself as quietly as possible. Which meant that he would resist the urge to hum, whistle, sing, or snap his fingers at the things that needed to be put away or put into order so the hotel staff could take care of it. If he was alone, he\\'d not be able to completely resist using his gifts to make the work easier. As he\\'d gotten older, dealt more with Cobb or Cobb\\'s children, he\\'d began to do it unintentionally. Like singing Cobb to sleep so he\\'d stop being creepy, or encouraging the children to clean their rooms by making it a game- Arthur would do his grandmother\\'s tricks for easy cleaning when James and Phillipa were so young they couldn\\'t distinguish fantasy from reality, he couldn\\'t help but sing to himself and snap his fingers at unorganized stuffed animals, making their teddy bears or Barbies go dancing into their toy boxes while they clapped and tried snapping their fingers at things too! Arthur had loved the looks of surprise on their faces! They\\'d laugh and tug on Arthur\\'s hands, begging him to show them how to make things move like magic! And when they\\'d tell their parents, Arthur would pull the long suffering facial expression he practiced in the mirror for when he had to pretend that the children were exaggerating over a game Arthur had made up, because of course Arthur wasn\\'t capable of magic! When Arthur practiced that face in the mirror, his reflection, behaving as a separate entity, would narrow his eyes at Arthur and say: \"Grandmother wouldn\\'t have to lie.\" Arthur may have begun to avoid interacting with his reflection for longer than necessary when he was getting himself ready for the day. Just this morning Arthur had patiently ignored the way his reflection had stopped mimicking the action of brushing his teeth to spit out a mouthful of toothpaste foam as Arthur continued diligently brushing, just so he could say: \"He\\'s gonna find out, stupid.\" So when Arthur began to hum softly, not actually singing, because that would be a surefire way to wake Eames up, the room began to get itself in order because Arthur wanted it to. He hummed, and on a whim softly snapped his fingers at the army of tiny empty alcohol bottles to watch them march off the table and jump into a nearby trashcan that obligingly slid closer to the table to catch each one. Another snap forced the plates to become a neat stack, dirtied utensils on the top. Used napkins fluttered like birds into the trashcan. Arthur wasn\\'t sure who had done it, but the printed up list of prices for the stuff in the minibar had been folded into a paper airplane and made a crash landing on the carpet. One snap forced the paper plane to unfold itself, creases gone, so it could be returned to the minibar, but not before Arthur read it and rolled his eyes at what he\\'d have added to his bill. Arthur gestured to his dirty clothes, snapping twice to encourage the wrinkled suit and other articles of clothing to fold and then arrange themselves neatly in his unzipped luggage. Arthur was so busy doing these things that he didn\\'t notice it when Eames rolled over, yawned widely, and spent a full minute staring at Arthur tidying the room by snapping his fingers and humming. \"Well,\" Eames said slowly. \"I guess you were telling me the truth last night.\" Arthur froze, his attention diverted from the empty can of Pringles he was in the middle of making flip end over end like a red cylindrical gymnast across the table to join the rest of the stuff in the trashcan. When Arthur looked away the Pringles can stopped mid-flip and rolled off the table to hit the carpet. The point man began, against all logic and reason, to blush heartily in embarrassment as if Eames seen him naked. To be honest, Arthur would greatly prefer it if Eames had seen him naked. That could be easier to explain, given the way he explained it. The many and varied ways he could explain being naked in his own hotel room could involve all sorts of problems with his clothing like accidental stains or emergency tailoring. Hell, Arthur might even be able to swing a surprise seduction attempt because anyone with eyes could see the way they danced around each other like idiots. But Eames wasn\\'t an idiot, he was just persistent and flirted a lot. No, Arthur was an idiot. Arthur experienced a sinking feeling as he was sure that this was going to lead to the mature conversation he had been trying to avoid. His fucking reflection had been right. \"If we\\'re still going to be partners I have a lot I need to explain to you,\" Arthur began, forcing himself to make eye contact with Eames, to will away the blush that had no doubt pinked his cheeks and his ears, making him look years younger and as threatening as a magic nanny was probably meant to be. Eames sat up in bed, shifting the blankets aside to reveal that he\\'d also been sleeping mostly dressed in an outfit from the day before. He reached into his pocket, no doubt checking his totem to be certain he wasn\\'t dreaming, then nodded. \"Can we talk about it over breakfast? I shouldn\\'t complain because I drank you under the table, but I\\'ve got a nice headache brewing-\" Blush fading, Arthur noticed the bottle of ibuprofen on the table and figured if he\\'d been found out, he\\'d been found out. Why hide it? Arthur snapped his fingers at the bottle and watched it fly through the air towards Eames, who managed to catch it. He rattled the bottle and raised his eyebrows at Arthur, still working on his reaction to this. \"I\\'ll get you some water for those pills, and then we can decide what we\\'ll have for breakfast.\"[Chapter 4] \"These are our options,\" Arthur said as Eames took his pills with the water Arthur had brought him, sitting on the side of the bed they\\'d shared and watching Arthur like he was the most fascinating person ever. Having the undivided attention of Eames always made Arthur feel special, so he savored it while he could. There was no telling what would happen after the forger had heard everything Arthur was going to say over breakfast. \"There\\'s room service. From what I could tell of the area there\\'s a few different places we could go if room service isn\\'t appealing.\" Arthur began to list them off. \"There are two diners and a coffee shop.\" Eames placed the empty water glass on the nightstand, finished with it, but he was fidgety without something to occupy his hands; Eames rubbed the palms of his hands against his thighs, nervous maybe. \"Do you want privacy for this conversation, Arthur? Is the information sensitive? Will revealing anything to me put you or anyone else in danger?\" Arthur raised his eyebrows. \"I\\'m not the product of a government experiment. I\\'m also not an alien. My family has specific skills, the Poppins gift, as we call it.\" Arthur felt relief when Eames didn\\'t choose to run outside after hearing this information. The forger looked interested instead of horrified or scared. \"You said that you\\'re supposed to be a magic nanny. \" Arthur nodded gravely, unintentionally frowning over what he\\'d chosen to reveal to Eames when he was tipsy. Things would have been so much easier if he\\'d only done something mildly embarrassing instead of revealing personal information about himself. \"Yes. The gift tends to skip a generation; my grandmother Mary wasn\\'t pleased when I chose to do something else with my life. To try and be anything but a magic nanny. It isn\\'t something I\\'ve been able to escape; its something I\\'m skilled in, obviously, but I don\\'t want to be that.\" Eames nodded. \"And you keep getting roped into it, right?\" Arthur sighed and agreed. \"That\\'s why I gave you such specific conditions before agreeing to work together.\" \"I can catch a shower,\" Eames was saying, plucking at his wrinkled black shirt. \"If you\\'re comfortable talking in public I wouldn\\'t mind hitting the diner after we check-out.\" \"Perfect,\" Arthur agreed. He didn\\'t see the point in lingering in the hotel room just to continue telling Eames details about his life, his family. It was unlikely that there would be anyone who would understand what Arthur was saying without proper context. It all sounded perfectly innocent and normal without the proper context! \"She\\'s practically perfect in every way?\" \"Yes.\" Eames frowned at Arthur, poking his over easy eggs with his fork, breaking the yolks so they dribbled onto his hashbrowns. \" Every way .\" Arthur nodded. \"That\\'s still how my grandmother measures up, yes. And before you ask, I\\'ve not been measured with that tape before. I\\'ve got no idea where I stand with it, but to be honest, I doubt its flattering.\" Eames was politely silent while Arthur drank some coffee, waiting till the point man was finished to say, \"I think you\\'re too hard on yourself about this nanny business.\" \"It\\'s hard not to be, Eames. A Poppins rarely deviates from the family calling when they have the gift. I\\'m probably as skilled as my grandmother but I just can\\'t see myself waiting around for people who need me to look after them. I can\\'t spend my time sitting on a cloud and checking my phone for texts and emails, Eames! I just can\\'t!\" \"On a cloud?\" Eames\\'s eyebrows went up. \"You\\'ve done that before?\" Arthur kept talking, even though he was sure that he should have left that part out. There was something about mentioning the cloud thing that made him want to talk about all the other weird stuff that came with his gift, whether he wanted them or not. It was strange, but talking about it with Eames didn\\'t make him feel as horribly embarrassed as he once thought it would. \"Yes, I was being chased down by some idiots who thought they could settle a score and steal my PASIV. So I checked for a stiff breeze, opened my umbrella, and then took off. I hid up in a cloud bank until I was sure they\\'d given up or checked themselves into a hospital; I was sure at least one of them caught sight of me getting lifted away.\" Eames wasn\\'t even attempting to pretend to eat now. He watched Arthur, mouth hanging open a little bit, before recovering enough to ask another question. \"You can fly?\" \"No, the wind does all the work for me! My umbrella, too. It was a gift from my grandmother, made by the same person who made her own, just without the parrot head handle, because while I may be able to wave away all sorts of odd things about me or my gifts, using an umbrella decorated with a noticeable parrot head is a little too much.\" Eames nodded in agreement. \"Parrots don\\'t seem to be your style. I bet yours is basic black, retractable for convenience, spring-loaded for increased attack capabilities.\" \"Basic black, but with a bamboo crook handle. Not collapsible, just a manual umbrella. It was sent to me not long after I started in dreamshare and ended up working with the Cobbs.\" \"And their children.\" Arthur nodded. \"And their children.\" He sighed. \"When I got it, I kind of got worried about what it meant, you know? My grandmother has been around, well, almost forever . It\\'s the gift, really. All Poppins with the gift have these fantastically extended lives. It would make sense that she wanted me to have an umbrella symbolic of what we do, but I rarely take it out, even when it rains.\" Eames frowned. \"Then how did you have it the day you had to hide in the cloud bank?\" Arthur shrugged, a little embarrassed. \"I was running, they were gaining on me, and all I was thinking about was how the hell I was going to escape with as few injuries as possible, the PASIV intact. Then my umbrella appeared in my other hand, gone from the umbrella stand I\\'ve got in my home where it had been sitting gathering dust. It came to me when I needed it then, and might do it again if I truly needed it.\" The point man was quiet for a moment, astounded over all the things he\\'d revealed to Eames during their breakfast. He\\'d barely eaten his waffle, and was still working on his first cup of coffee. He took a sip and noticed that it really needed a warm-up. \"I know that this is a lot to take in, and if any of it bothers you we can part ways with no problems.\" \"Are you crazy, Arthur? There\\'s no way I\\'d lose a chance to work with you!\" \"Maybe if I was a regular point man-\" \"You\\'re better than a regular point man, Arthur, you\\'re the best! Even better now that I have proof you\\'re practically perfect. \" Arthur did blush this time, shaking his head. \"That was my grandmother. I\\'m just Arthur.\" Eames grinned for the point man. \"I\\'m going to change your mind. You know that, don\\'t you? You\\'re the best point in dreamshare. And you\\'re magic. We\\'re going to have an excellent time working together!\" Arthur didn\\'t fight Eames too hard on that one. It was a difference in opinion, but they still would work well together. It also didn\\'t hurt that one person now knew his secret, and hadn\\'t run away or called the papers. It was a good start to their partnership. His grandmother might even call it supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.[Chapter 5] Arthur had yet to say that deciding to tell Eames about his secret and agreeing to become his partner in dreamshare was the best thing ever. First, it wasn\\'t something he\\'d make known. Not in this line of work. He was a point man who was also a magic nanny (or a point-nanny, which Arthur hated on principle because when he took point, he took point and didn\\'t willingly use his gifts as a Poppins when he was on the clock) and a thing like that could easily ruin his reputation as the best point man. But not saying anything about it (not the decision, not Arthur\\'s feelings on being a point man, nanny, or some combination of the two) didn\\'t change the fact that it was so, so true. Arthur was free to entertain the idea of hiring a skywriter, sending a Tweet, or grabbing someone passing him by on the street to tell them about how great things were going because it wouldn\\'t have changed the fact that working with Eames was wonderful. That telling the forger about his family oddness, his gift, was one of the best decisions he could have made. Despite how well they worked together, how smoothly the jobs went now that Arthur didn\\'t have to deal with Cobb\\'s shade of Mal ruining everything, it didn\\'t change the fact that sometimes a successful extraction or carefully chosen inception would end in gunfire and a not-so-merry chase. As they took a short-cut, running through a condemned parking structure, gun shots pitted the cement pillars and walls, all that remained standing of the structure. Clutching the PASIV in one hand, his Glock 17 in the other, Arthur cursed to himself over the turn this job was taking. He tried to come up with a few positives to balance out the negatives. At least the area was empty of witnesses and traffic. They might even have a chance to run for their car Hiding behind another cement pillar, Arthur leaned against it and watched as Eames returned fire, then ducked behind the pillar again. The forger was still flushed from all the running, and Arthur took a moment to enjoy the fact that this guy- this guy- was the one he had agreed to run with when things didn\\'t go well. Because the look Eames sent him was still businesslike, but tinged with concern, with worry. \"Any chance of being able to whisk us away with that umbrella, darling?\" Arthur shifted, noticed something being crushed beneath his shoes and grimaced once he realized he\\'d been standing in chalk- his shoes, once polished and pristine, now had a sheen of cheerful yellow chalk dust. \"No breeze,\" Arthur said as he noticed more chalk on the ground, that some of the walls and pillars of this parking structure had been covered in chalk graffiti. \"But I have another idea that should work...\" Arthur put the PASIV on the ground, leaning it against the pillar. He snatched up a couple of sticks of chalk and pressed them into Eames\\'s hand. \"Draw a scene or landscape on the the ground. Draw anything you like, but do it quickly!\" Eames frowned at Arthur, but immediately knelt on the ground, keeping his gun within reach as he began to draw something using the lime green chalk. Arthur could hear the sounds of someone running towards their hiding place, it wouldn\\'t take them long to enter into a more direct sort of conflict. The point man already knew what the weather was like; close to sunset, but clear skies with no chance of rain. If they timed it properly they\\'d make it! Eames finished and glanced up at Arthur. The point man gestured for him to stand, then grabbed the PASIV, and looked over his shoulder before taking a deep breath, saying it quickly as if that would make it sound less silly. \"I want you to think, wink, double blink, and then jump into the drawing.\" Instead of asking Arthur how that could be possible, Eames holstered his gun and nodded. Then Eames did all of them while Arthur kept watch. The fact that he did all of them without questioning Arthur, that he did all of them even though they sounded ridiculous, made Arthur experience a strange fluttering feeling in his chest. The fact that Eames had that much faith in him, the fact that Eames jumped into his own chalk drawing of some kind of landscape with rolling green hills and a purple lane to walk down. There might have been trees to shade the purple lane, but with only three colors to work with there was a lot of blurring and blending going on. Another bullet whizzed by and lodged itself into the pillar Arthur was standing behind. It was time to go! Looking at the chalk drawing, Arthur said, \"Whenever I doubt there\\'s a way I could love you more, you surprise me, Mr. Eames.\" Then Arthur did it just as his grandmother described in her stories. After thinking, winking, and double blinking, Arthur jumped into Eames\\'s chalk drawing, still holding his PASIV and his gun![Chapter 6] Jumping through the chalk drawing, taking that hop , wasn\\'t like falling through anything else he\\'d experienced in real life or dreams. And considering his work and all the dangerous situations he found himself in, he\\'d done a lot of jumping. The benefit of this sort of jump was there wasn\\'t a risk of physical damage. Passing through the one dimensional drawing, the flat landscape with few of the tricks Arthur was certain Eames would have employed to give the chalk drawing a sense of depth though it was truly only one dimensional, but hadn\\'t because there wasn\\'t time; Arthur felt nothing as he made the jump- not the chalk, not the concrete, not anything. Like a trapdoor or a Penrose stairway, this was a way of cheating the architecture of a fantasy setting or dreamed up place while still topside. Technically. He found Eames sitting on the purple path surrounded by masses of green that could be grassy hills and blurred trees. If Eames wasn\\'t having a panic attack, this might be okay. But when Arthur reached him, Eames was having a calm, completely rational conversation with a talking animal. \"No,\" Eames was saying, answering a talking rabbit\\'s question. \"I haven\\'t been here before. Unless I\\'m dreaming it?\" \"How did you get here, Eames?\" Arthur asked, trying not to notice how the rabbit perked up at the sight of him, even if Arthur was still carrying a gun and the PASIV. Arthur cringed and made sure to holster the weapon. \"I followed the advice of a smartly dressed magic point man and hopped into a chalk drawing to escape from our mark\\'s men.\" Eames smiled up at the point man and then nodded to the small rabbit. \"This fellow seemed to think I\\'d come to see a man named Bert.\" Arthur paled. \"What?\" Eames noticed right away. He got to his feet and moved closer to the other man. \"What did I say? You look like you\\'ve seen a ghost!\" \"Pretty much,\" Arthur admitted speaking to the rabbit that was only a couple of feet away, not doing more than twitching its nose in interest and waiting for their answer. \"Could you please take me to see him? I\\'m his grandson.\" Looking back at Eames, Arthur noticed that the man was a little shocked, but doing his best to not show it. He\\'d done so well with all the weird things that Arthur would say or do, but this was probably going to strain the limits of his good natured acceptance of Arthur\\'s oddness. \"Okay, I\\'ll be straight with you,\" Arthur said too quickly, as if he could fill the awkward silence fast enough to prevent any lasting damage. \"This stuff? All of it?\" Arthur waved one hand, gesturing to the scenery, the environment, and the patiently waiting talking rabbit. \"I have no idea what this is about. But I\\'m gonna have to find out...this place isn\\'t something that just anyone can access whenever they want. Not like we did. But this reminds me way too much of what happens with projections-\" \"Feels a bit like a dream level,\" Eames agreed with Arthur. \"No one\\'s extracting from us or trying to incept us. I may not have built the level, but I made the door...this is an existing level of something or someplace, and the door let us in. Things exist here. I don\\'t know about you, Arthur, but in all the dreams I\\'ve walked through I haven\\'t run into any animal projections that can talk.\" Arthur wondered if he should mention the singing. That if this was what he thought it was, there might be talking and singing animals, just like his grandmother\\'s stories. Then he did just that. \"Don\\'t be surprised if there are more animals that can talk. Or sing. My grandmother would always mention that sort of thing.\" At those words the little rabbit perked right up! \"Mary!\" The rabbit almost sang, \"Yes, she\\'s here today, too!\" Arthur couldn\\'t help it. He froze. \"Here? Like, right now?\" The rabbit nodded quickly, looking so very happy! \"Yes, she\\'s with Bert today, sir. I\\'m sure she won\\'t be bothered that you\\'ve come to visit here.\" Arthur had a moment where he wanted to check his totem to be sure, but he had a feeling that what it told him would be slightly skewed. This place was slowly beginning to flesh itself out as more than what Eames had sketched out; the trees and bushes were leafy, the beaten path they stood on was shifting from the bright purple of the chalk to a deepening aubergine dirt path. If he listened carefully, he\\'d catch the snatches of conversation from animals in the trees. Squirrels or birds, most likely. \"Sure,\" Arthur answer the rabbit. \"By the way, what\\'s this place called?\" Eames looked from Arthur to the rabbit, probably curious to see what this would lead to. Arthur had a sinking feeling that this wasn\\'t going to be very surprising, considering what he already knew from the stories. \"Of course,\" the rabbit said. \"This is Jolly Holiday!\" Arthur\\'s shoulders slumped, and almost as if he couldn\\'t prevent it, he half-sung to himself, \" Ain\\'t it a glorious day. \" Then he cursed and shot Eames an apologetic look because he\\'d almost completely launched into the song his grandmother sometimes saved for singing during one of her Bert-related stories. Eames\\'s raised his eyebrows. \"We\\'re going to meet your grandparents here.\" \"Considering how strange my life is, it wouldn\\'t completely surprise me if I find my grandmother here. My grandfather is another story.\" \"Why is that?\" Arthur didn\\'t want to launch into a discussion about Bert\\'s death. He only knew what his grandmother told him about it. And to be honest, he was curious (and mortified) by the entire situation. After finding reason after reason to hide from his family, by running away and attempting to become anything but a magic nanny, his grandmother had finally managed to work her way into his dreamshare criminal lifestyle. Whether she truly meant to do that or if this was just a fluke, Arthur wasn\\'t sure. He\\'d have to ask. \"Because my grandfather is supposed to be dead, Eames.\"[Chapter 7] Arthur and Eames followed after the rabbit. \"I\\'m sorry, Arthur.\" Arthur was holding the PASIV in a white-knuckle grip, purposely not touching his totem, going over the many things his grandmother would say to him now that they\\'ve met in this way. Well, unless she was a projection in this peculiar, nearly dreamed up setting. \"Don\\'t worry about the path,\" Arthur said, thinking that Eames was referring to the way the aubergine chalked road was blurring as they walked. Really hard to avoid it when one walked inside a chalk drawing. \"It would be even worse if we happened to trip on nothing and fall on the road. If that happened we\\'d also technically be wearing the road since the chalk that depicts the road in reality could be wiped away by a thorough sweeping, or god forbid, the rain.\" Arthur considered it, frowning as he walked and listed off the reasons. \"It\\'s definitely a possibility since the condemned parking structure we left from didn\\'t have a roof. If it rained the drawing could be washed away...\" \"Arthur?\" \"Sorry,\" Arthur said, apologizing for the obvious tactic of ignoring what he was about to run into. \"I\\'m sorry, Eames. I\\'m just- I don\\'t even think that \\'worried\\' will cover what I\\'m feeling right now. I need a bigger word. Something that means the complete opposite of the biggest word I\\'ve ever heard.\" \"What word is that?\" \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" Arthur said smoothly without stumbling over it. He\\'d had plenty of practice learning to say it when he was a child as his mother and grandmother often spoke of it or used it in conversation. He gave his teachers migraines when he would include it in any of his spelling assignments. They would insist it wasn\\'t a word and drop points off of sentences that otherwise had perfect spelling and grammar. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious became the theme for many of his parent-teacher conferences. Secretly, Arthur wanted to know what Eames thought about the word. It was such an Eamesian word, even if it was something bandied about in Arthur\\'s family. Arthur knew that it wasn\\'t a word that was associated with him as a stuffy, rule-abiding, kill joy of a point man. No, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious wasn\\'t a point man word. So Arthur used words like specificity and tried to think of the opposite of supercalifragilisticexpialidocious to describe this moment now. \"You could just add a prefix and describe this experience as un-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious but that kind of takes the magic away from the word.\" \"I tried doing that after all of my elementary school spelling assignments began to be graded very harshly. Then I started including very long words that weren\\'t my grandmother\\'s favorite word. It was kind of like a linguistic curve ball.\" \"A verbal sucker punch?\" \"I\\'ll accept that. Yes, I started using bigger words that could sound just as ridiculous to anyone else, but were still valid. I was protesting their opinions.\" Arthur smiled to himself, remembering it. \"I once used the word \\'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis\\' in a sentence.\" \"What did that look like on paper?\" His third grade teacher had covered the sentence in red question marks. Arthur remembered it fondly now, but when he was a child it had frustrated him endlessly. He\\'d worked hard on that assignment! \"Billy complained to the school nurse about his recently diagnosed pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, and was sent home early.\" Arthur smiled as Eames laughed. \"I had to find some way to use both \\'complained\\' and the longest word in the dictionary. Ms. Jones didn\\'t even try to argue with my mother!\" \"Do you feel a little better now?\" Oddly enough, Arthur did feel better. The conversation had vented some of his nervous energy, redirected his thoughts from what was coming. He nodded and kept close to Eames, both still following the rabbit. \"That was nice of you, but I completely swept away your apology with my case of nerves. Why were you apologizing?\" The forger shrugged. \"I\\'m sorry that the job went south. I\\'m sorry it forced you to send us here, where you\\'ve basically been forced into a confrontation with your grandmother. Your grandfather being here probably doesn\\'t make this any easier. So I\\'m sorry for all the stuff that led up to this,\" Eames gestured, seeming to include the the scenery, the road, the rabbit, and himself as covering this . \"It\\'s confusing,\" Arthur admitted. \"I\\'ve avoided her for so long. Before, she was so disappointed in me for joining the army instead of using my gifts. Then it was dreamshare. And after what happened with Cobb and Mal I didn\\'t want to drag my family into that mess. I promised myself that I\\'d make amends. That I\\'d see my family more often after Cobb was settled and back with the kids...but don\\'t try to take the blame for this happening, Eames. It was bound to happen at some point.\" Some of the tension left Eames frame, but there was something that lingered, something hard for Arthur to pinpoint until he noticed the way that Eames kept looking towards their destination- that just towards the end of the road there would be a space where the rabbit swore Arthur\\'s grandmother and Bert would be at this time of day. That there was a grove with enough space to allow for what the rabbit described as a café, and the trees provided shade and the birds hid in the boughs, chirping or talking to pass the time as Bert and Mary Poppins shared the afternoon together. \"Are you nervous?\" Arthur finally asked. \"She won\\'t hurt you, I swear it. She\\'s practically perfect, not homicidal!\" This made Eames laugh in spite of himself. \"It\\'s more than silly, but I guess that I am a little intimidated. This would be the first time in a long time that I met anyone\\'s family.\" Then he cleared his throat and chanced a look at Arthur. \"When I initially got down here, I could hear you, you know? It\\'s kind of like how it is when dreaming with the PASIV. If someone says something or touches you as you dream, how it translates into something within the dream?\" Arthur paled as he recalled his exact words before taking the jump into the chalk drawing. Whenever I doubt there\\'s a way I could love you more, you surprise me, Mr. Eames. \"I found myself on a purple road which became more realistic the longer I examined it,\" Eames explained. \"Then the wind blew. It rustled the blurry boughs of the trees, defined the shapes, but not the leaves.\" Eames reached up and plucked a leaf from one of the low hanging branches as they passed it. It stained his fingers with lime-green chalk dust but appeared as detailed as any other freshly plucked green leaf in reality. He let it flutter to the ground as they continued on, Arthur following after the forger who was intent on continuing the trip as he spoke to Arthur. \"I heard your voice. Friendly breeze went right past me, leaving your words where I could hear them this far down...\" Arthur\\'s mouth was dry. He was scrambling for something to say that was more than vowel sounds. This wasn\\'t a conversation he wanted to have. It was far too soon to talk about feelings. That Eames heard him say it was enough to make Arthur reevaluate his current state. Previously made a statement about loving Eames, Eames had heard it, and Arthur was now trapped in Jolly Holiday on the way to see his grandparents, one alive and the other dead, but still present. Somehow. This was just getting to be too much! If Arthur wasn\\'t careful his two current physical sensations would merge in an embarrassing way in this setting- because in this dream like setting it was totally possible for Arthur\\'s worry about throwing up from the stress to merge with the butterflies he was feeling from the way Eames was looking at him. The forger kept stealing glances. The man was a little knowing, a little nervous, but just as accepting as always, and Arthur almost couldn\\'t take it. Arthur wasn\\'t going to vomit butterflies in front of this man. \"I-\" Eames reached for Arthur\\'s freehand and said, \"We can talk about this later. Nothing has changed, Arthur. Nothing at all. We\\'re two dream criminals on our way to visit your grandparents.\" \"If they\\'re really my grandparents,\" Arthur said with a sigh. \"Until I see them myself, I can\\'t be sure if they\\'re real. I\\'ll have to smile and ask questions; maybe answer a dozen or twenty more.\" \"Then it\\'s excellent we went down here together, isn\\'t it? We can watch each other\\'s backs, distract them, then cut and run if absolutely necessary. I won\\'t leave you down here.\" \"Me neither, Eames,\" Arthur said, finding himself squeezing Eames\\'s hand, reassuring the one still reassuring him . They really were an excellent team, Arthur thought, it would be shame for it to end because of something as stupid as a comment over a chalk drawing or an unexpected visit to Arthur\\'s family in the same chalk drawing. The forger smiled for him. \"Any dress code I should be aware of?\" Arthur considered it, then thought to ask the rabbit. It wasn\\'t too far away, hopping along at a pace that gave Arthur and Eames some privacy for conversations, but didn\\'t allow them to lose sight of it. \"Excuse me,\" Arthur asked the rabbit, who paused and twitched its curiously twitched its nose at them, waiting for them to draw even and stop to speak. \"Mary and Bert...they wouldn\\'t happen to be in Victorian fancy dress, would they?\" The rabbit perked up at the mention of costumes, and examining what the two dream criminals were already wearing. \"Oh, yes, but please don\\'t feel obligated to join in. It\\'s been so long, Mary will be happy to see you even without a fancy dress costume!\" They were standing a couple feet away from the grove. At this distance Arthur could hear distinctly human voices. Soft laughter and conversation between a man and women. Arthur nodded and took a deep breath; he thanked the little rabbit for leading the way, and then looked to Eames. He blinked because Eames had dreamed up a modest bouquet of Spring flowers. Eames laughed when he noticed Arthur\\'s surprise. He offered the flowers to Arthur. \"For your grandmother, Arthur,\" Eames said. \"We may not be shooting projections and running from angry clients, but this still can be done strategically. Flowers are a peace offering. Flowers can also be used as a weapon. Let\\'s see how this plays out.\" Arthur had to let go of Eames\\'s hand to take the flowers, hoping that he wasn\\'t blushing too much. An involuntary response, really. Did it mean that he wanted Eames to give him flowers? Obviously flowers were a lovely gift and very thoughtful, Arthur rationalized. He just never got them. He made Eames pause before they entered the grove. Arthur shifted his hold on the flowers and the PASIV to get one hand free, and then reached out. Arthur was very aware of the way that Eames became still and watchful as Arthur touched his shirt collar, which had been sticking up since their hasty exit from that job. It was crooked, so Arthur quickly adjusted it so that Eames looked less like he\\'d been running from people with guns. Nice and presentable. Nothing would stop it from being paisley, but Arthur could care less about the pattern. \"Now you\\'re perfect,\" Arthur said, holding the PASIV in one hand, the flowers in the other. Then they walked side by side into the grove.[Chapter 8] \"Arthur, what a surprise! Please, sit with us!\" Arthur\\'s grip tightened on the PASIV. It grounded him in place, it grounded him in this surreal moment. He held the flowers gently, not wanting to bruise or break the stems of the bouquet Eames had dreamed up as a gift. Or a weapon, Arthur reminded himself as he continued to walk closer to the pair seated at the table. A table where they were currently being served by talking penguins . Arthur almost stopped at the sight of them. \"We\\'re okay,\" Eames said with a smile, no doubt noticing Arthur\\'s reaction to the penguins while hiding any reaction of his own behind a pleasant smile. For all Arthur knew, Eames could have purposely been forging that smile to hide what he was really feeling. \"They\\'re just penguins. I doubt the penguins will attack...unless they have in the past?\" Arthur shook his head, and was relieved when he noticed how Eames slipped his hand away from where his gun was holstered. \"Please don\\'t shoot the penguins. They\\'re only waiters. They are penguin waiters that already look like they\\'re wearing tuxedos because obviously they\\'re penguins . They\\'re only penguins with neat little bowties.\" Arthur wasn\\'t going to mention that one of the first Halloween costumes he got to design for himself was based off of his grandmother\\'s story. He wasn\\'t going to explain the effort he\\'d put into it, only at the young age of six, to try and make himself look like one of grandmother\\'s singing and dancing penguin waiters. Arthur wasn\\'t sure how he\\'d react if one of those penguins got shot. Arthur was sure he sounded ridiculous for worrying over penguins that weren\\'t supposed to be real in the first place, but still. Arthur took his mind off of that topic and listened for Eames\\'s reply. Hoped for a reply, really. \"Bowties are cool,\" Eames said, not disappointing Arthur. Eames purposely didn\\'t look over at Arthur as he said it, but Arthur could definitely see the hint of Eames\\'s real smile showing through the one he currently wore. \"We are going to have a lot to talk about after this,\" Arthur said softly. Whether Eames somehow knew about or was able to guess that Arthur had a secret love of Doctor Who would have to be the second thing they were going to discuss once they got out of this place, but only if the first topic didn\\'t lead to an uncomfortable termination of their successful working relationship. Thankfully, Arthur was distracted from that line of thought when he got within two feet of the table, noticing how his grandmother had risen from her chair to greet him properly. What Arthur had previously described to Eames as the \"fantastically extended lives\" of a gifted Poppins, but barely touched on was that despite the physical aging process, both Arthur and Mary retained youthful faces and figures. Of course there were signs of aging in each person, but they were minimal at best. For instance, though Mary Poppins should have been bent with age, white-haired and wrinkled, she remained as tall and fair as any of the photos from her daughter\\'s youth. Arthur got a chance to see if she appeared as youthful as he remembered when he first offered his grandmother the flowers, then after she had thanked him for the gift and opened her arms for a hug, Arthur carefully set the PASIV on the level ground so he could give his grandmother a proper hug. \"You haven\\'t changed,\" Arthur said as he hugged her close. \"I guess your hair is a little grayer, but you still look so young! Is this what I\\'m going to experience too?\" Arthur had to force himself to get back on track, to ask the important questions. \"What are you doing here?\" His grandmother pulled away with a gentle smile, cupping Arthur\\'s cheek with one hand. \"Not going to play along with societal niceties? Done with the small talk?\" \"I respect you too much to pretend that this is a normal turn of events,\" Arthur sighed. \"We\\'re in a chalk drawing. You\\'re having lunch with a dead man. I\\'m too worried to ask how you\\'re doing, though maybe I should ask to get a better idea of what\\'s going on...\" Mary pressed a kiss against Arthur\\'s cheek. \"I\\'ll start. It\\'s been so long, Arthur. I miss you. Your mother misses you. You haven\\'t seen the family since you became a dream criminal.\" She frowned over the word. \"Is that the proper term?\" \"Yes,\" Eames said, stepping in smoothly from where he had been politely observing. He offered to shake her hand, but was clearly surprised when Mary gently slipped her arms away from her grandson, and moved to embrace him next. If Eames was at all surprised by Arthur\\'s grandmother, he didn\\'t show it. He politely hugged her. He introduced himself. \"I\\'m Eames. It\\'s nice to meet you, ma\\'am.\" \"You brought me the flowers, didn\\'t you?\" Arthur and Eames shared a surprised look, Eames looking at the point man from over Mary\\'s shoulder. Arthur raised his eyebrows and shrugged, gesturing that Eames should continue. \"...I thought that it would be a good way to break the ice, yes.\" Mary pulled away from Eames and nodded, satisfied with his answer. \"Well, they\\'re lovely.\" She brushed at wrinkles that didn\\'t even exist on the skirt of her white dress, before sitting back down at the table. \"I\\'m sure you have plenty of questions, Arthur,\" Mary paused and then indicated the man seated across from her at the table. \"But first I\\'d like to introduce you to Bert.\" Arthur stood stock still with Eames beside him as a reassuring presence. Both examined the man Mary claimed was Bert. Wearing a boater hat, an orange and red stripped jacket, and white pants to match, Bert was in the middle of explaining something to the penguins still gathered around his side of the table. He appeared to be as youthful as Mary, but Arthur couldn\\'t recall if anyone (his mother or grandmother) ever mentioned him having special gifts like the Poppins. \"Practically perfect,\" he pronounced, nodding in Mary\\'s direction as he rested his cane against the table. \"If she says it, then it gots to be true. Her Arthur comin\\' by and bringin\\' a friend?\" Then he turned his attention on the visitors, he focused on Arthur in particular. \"Very image of Mary,\" he commented, looking at Arthur and then looking back at Mary as if to compare, though it wasn\\'t necessary. \"I wish I\\'d seen you before,\" Bert said, his sunny mood deflating a bit. But not too much, and not for very long either. In no time he was humming something that suspiciously sounded like one of the songs Arthur\\'s mother taught him, one she learned from her mother, one that Mary must have sung with Bert. \"He\\'s not real,\" Arthur pronounced. \"And god, his accent is horrible .\" \"Cockney,\" Eames suggested, putting his two cents in, but also frowning over the term. \"Something\\'s off about it, but I can\\'t put my finger on what. \" Bert didn\\'t even flinch at Arthur\\'s words. He made no comments, but did fondly smile at Mary. \"Bert is a memory,\" Mary said, reaching out to touch his hand. \"He may be the same age he was before, wearing the old costume, spending a jolly holiday with me, but still, just a memory. It\\'s been lovely,\" Mary said as she patted his hand. \"But we can meet another time. I have to speak with our grandson now, but we\\'ll always have next time.\" Bert agreed, standing and moving to her side of the table so he could give her a chaste kiss on the cheek while Arthur was still standing there uncertainly. \"Maybe another time, Arthur?\" Arthur forced himself to nod. He also didn\\'t jump when Bert disappeared. Nothing was disturbed when Bert left- no shuddering like in a dream, no angry projections to zero in on invasive dreamers. Maybe if they had enough time they\\'d be able to test the differences between dreaming with a PASIV and jumping into works of art. But not today. \"Grandmother,\" Arthur began, \"I\\'m a point man. Eames is a forger. We both work in dreamshare. This is called a PASIV,\" Arthur picked up the PASIV and showed it to Mary before continuing. \"In dreamshare persistent projections known as shades can debilitate or harm dreamers. If Bert is your shade-\" Mary shook her head. \"Not a shade. He\\'s not violent, he doesn\\'t hurt anyone. He\\'s not a dream, dear. He\\'s a memory. He\\'s Bert just as I remember him.\" Then she laughed at her own expense. \"What you said about his accent is true. It\\'s been so long now that I think I\\'ve warped his accent a bit. What sounded charming in 1910 is kind of silly in the 2000s.\" Arthur wasn\\'t sure what to say about this. He never met the man. He only heard stories about him, and even those were few and far between. Arthur grew up with the songs his mother had learned from her mother, and had held onto the small tidbits of information he got about Bert. He had a chance to learn more, but did he really want to open that door again? Considering that they\\'d run into each other by accident, it would be the perfect reason to reestablish their family ties. Arthur would never admit it out loud, but there were times that he missed visiting his family on holidays. He was an uncle, and a rather bad one since he didn\\'t come by. He\\'d send things, he\\'d call, but there were times during his work with Cobb that it was too dangerous and would have led to his quasi-magical family being targeted by the worst in dreamshare! But that was over with. Maybe there was going to be a chance in the future for things to change. His grandmother was watching him, and Arthur was sure that she knew everything thought that had passed through his head. It was something in her smile that told him she was aware of his train of thought, but that she wouldn\\'t bother him just now. She\\'d allowed an ocean to separate them for so long. Mary Poppins wasn\\'t just practically perfect in nearly every way. She was also patient . \"Do you remember how to get out of the drawing, Arthur?\" Eames laughed in response to Mary\\'s question. Something a little nervous, but also sort of surprised. \"Oh, I hope he does! I took a leap of faith of sorts to get here. That\\'s not even adding in the winking and the blinking!\" Mary began to laugh! \"Just like your grandfather,\" Mary said through her laughter. \"He always tried to do it the more complicated way.\" \"We still got here,\" Arthur muttered, fighting through an embarrassed blush that turned his ears, cheeks, and neck slightly pink. She apologized, but was as firm as she had been with the children she governed. \"The way that works for you will be best,\" she advised. \"You can\\'t expect to do all of the things I\\'ve done. You can\\'t expect to do them exactly the same way, in the same order, or with the same results. We may be almost magical but we still have individual traits, quirks, and points of view. I know that you don\\'t like the idea of being a nanny,\" Mary told Arthur. \"I know that you\\'ve fought against it. But I think that you\\'ve used your gifts in the best possible way, applying them to the work that you do now. You\\'re the best, aren\\'t you?\" Arthur refused to answer that. He was still puzzling over the idea that he really had applied all the skills of a magic nanny to his work in dreamshare. He did take care of others. And while he wasn\\'t as amazing as his grandmother, he was still hailed as the best. As almost perfect. A practically perfect point man, maybe. So Eames confirmed it for Mary. He jumped into the conversation and eagerly proved it. \"Yes, Arthur is definitely the best. That\\'s how I describe him to other dreamsharers.\" \"You also call me a stick in the mud with no imagination,\" Arthur reminded him, moving to the forger\\'s side so he could join the conversation and remain close. And speak with his grandmother, of course. \"Do you really think I can say that now? After everything you\\'ve shown me, darling?\" Eames reached out and took Arthur\\'s free hand. The PASIV was in Arthur\\'s other hand, but his grip wasn\\'t as tight as before. He was relaxing into this moment. As strange as it was, it was also perfect. His old worries about disappointment began to rear their ugly heads, but there was a gentle reminder that they were not alone. Though Bert was gone, the table was gone, and the penguins were gone, the grove still held Mary. She watched Arthur with an expression that bordered on amused and fond. This conversation was going to have to wait till they didn\\'t have an audience member related to Arthur. \"You must have a lot to talk about,\" Mary said, digging the tip of her parasol into the grass. She looked immaculate, but somehow warmer than Arthur remembered her seeming to be when he was a child. He wondered if that was how he also came across to others. Slightly aloof, cold, or distant, but still warm? He didn\\'t have her blue eyes or her raven dark hair, but their similarities extended further than eye color or skin tone or anything else like that. They were both professional, hard working, and possessed natural timing. She knew when it was time to leave- the East wind would blow, the job would be over, and she\\'d fly away using her umbrella. But Arthur was different. His natural timing was attuned to dreams, to planning, to being a point man, and eventually joining up with Eames. That was all natural. It was all excellent. \"Yeah,\" Arthur answered her. \"We do. I\\'ll speak to you soon,\" he assured her. \"I\\'ll want to learn more about the chalk drawings, about the things within them, and I\\'d like to learn more about Bert. If that\\'s okay?\" Then Arthur looked at Eames. \"I need you to trust me on this. Listen to what I say and we\\'ll get home easy.\" \"Whenever you\\'re ready, darling.\"[Chapter 9] The implications of Arthur\\'s words didn\\'t sink in until they had made it out of the chalk drawing, after they scouted the area and found that the men who had chased them to the parking structure had eventually left, and even after they finally made it to their car to discover it hadn\\'t been vandalized or tampered with while they were gone. Arthur had all the time in the world to think about how he\\'d used the word \"home\" when speaking to Eames about leaving Jolly Holiday. It felt very significant because they had no home to go to. Arthur had secured an excellent hotel suite for the job, though. They wondered over their luck rather than have that talk while in transit. They chatted about the lack of scratches or dings on the body of their rental. The tires hadn\\'t been flattened while they were away. There wasn\\'t a single broken window. Since their radio hadn\\'t been stolen, Arthur was able to flip it on to find something loud to fill the silence when it eventually came. Because once they\\'d run out of positives about their getaway car (no banana in the tail pipe, no sugar in the gas tank, neither eggs nor shaving cream were used to hurt the paint, the floor mats were still there, and the leather seating was still pristine) it became so much harder to skirt around what they both had on their minds. Their restraint was admirable. That restraint was lifted after they locked the door to their hotel room. Arthur gently placed the PASIV next to the bed, then turned to Eames and said, \"I understand if you have second thoughts now.\" \"No second thoughts, Arthur,\" Eames replied. \"Really? None of this has shaken your faith in our working relationship? I told you to jump into a chalk drawing where we happened to run into my grandmother and her dead husband.\" \"That was still better than Cobb\\'s shade of Mal. That and the threat of Limbo definitely didn\\'t make the Fischer job a jolly holiday,\" Eames said while pulling off his jacket. \"If the penguin waiters wearing bowties were the equivalent of projections in that place, they had to be some of the most well-behaved projections I\\'ve ever seen in dreamshare. If this is what our jobs will be like in the future, how could you even dream that I\\'ll try and quit working with you?\" Arthur noticed how familiar this conversation was. They\\'d had one just like it when Eames found out about Arthur\\'s gift. \"I would like to be completely honest with you,\" Arthur said. \"I want to get everything out in the open. All of it.\" Eames had approached Arthur, but seemed to be waiting for some other signal or sign. He could have taken the easy route and commented on Arthur\\'s unspoken love of Doctor Who. Then they could have had a fun discussion about how Eames had figured it out considering how Arthur was certain that he hadn\\'t ever made Doctor Who related comments, talked about the series, or watched it when Eames was around. It could be true that Eames was intuitive or lucky. But Eames didn\\'t go that route. He got to the point and stayed there. \"Do you really love me, darling?\" Arthur closed his eyes for just a moment as he worked up the nerve to give an answer. There was really only one answer but he had to fight against the typical answer he\\'d give as Arthur, best point man in dreamshare. He\\'d also have to ignore a trait his grandmother had passed on to him: his ability to never explain anything if he didn\\'t want to. \"Absolutely,\" Arthur said honestly. \"Ever since we became a team you\\'ve shown me how capable and dependable you are. So accepting of me being...well, being me . A Poppins, I mean. So far nothing I\\'ve said or done has completely fazed you. You ask me questions, and then come up with solutions, and it\\'s all been so damned easy . Why is that?\" Eames considered the question. \"Why should it have to be so difficult? Loving you is as easy as breathing.\" Then Eames looked at the king sized bed. He came to some sort of decision, removed his shoes, and fell back onto the soft- but not too soft-mattress. When he was settled, Eames gave Arthur an expectant look before patting the empty space beside him. \"There\\'s plenty of space, love. It wouldn\\'t be the first time we\\'ve shared a bed.\" So Arthur did it. He removed just enough to feel comfortable while lying down next to Eames. He ditched his coat, slipped off his shoes, loosened his tie, and then lay beside the forger. Like many things he did with Eames, sharing space on a bed was easy. \"I knew that I was hopelessly attracted to you after our very first job together. I used to have this oath about never setting myself up for disappointment.\" Eames nodded. \"A good policy to have.\" \"And it worked for a little while, but then Cobb finally got back to his kids, and we teamed up! How in the hell was I going to avoid disappointment if I worked every job with you? I was sure that I\\'d find all sorts of things to wreck my feelings for you! But it hasn\\'t happened once. It hasn\\'t happened ever. You never make me feel disappointed. Like I said before, whenever I doubt there\\'s a way I could love you more, you surprise me. And I\\'m not ashamed to say I love it.\" Arthur felt, god, how to even begin to put to words? He loved the way Eames had turned his head and looked at him as Arthur said these ridiculous things! But it felt good to explain it all to Eames. It always felt good to reveal some other facet, some other fact that he\\'d kept buttoned up or hidden because of how weird it made him feel. But he\\'d shown more of his odd Poppins skills today than on any other day they shared. He felt so light . Arthur almost had to double check and see if he was floating like his grandmother\\'s Uncle Albert. He was about to ask Eames if he noticed anything. Arthur turned on his side, wondering over the vague phantom sensation of levitation, when Eames leaned in closer and kissed him. Fitting together easily and neatly a moment was spent with Eames cupping Arthur\\'s cheek with one hand and Arthur pulling Eames\\'s closer by gripping the collar of his shirt. When Arthur pulled away to take a breath he asked, \"Am I floating?\" Eames raised his eyebrows. \"Is that a compliment? I\\'ll take it as a compliment, darling. I\\'ll gladly go back to kissing you once I\\'m certain you aren\\'t floating off the bed, okay?\" Eames made it a point to check even though Arthur was clearly still on top of the mattress. \"Yes, you\\'re still on the bed.\" \"Good. I know that you accept my weirdness, but spontaneous floating seems like it might be too much. I\\'ll tell you stories about it, though.\" Eames pulled Arthur closer. \"Interesting, darling. Do you have any other stories about the stuff that makes you magical?\" Arthur submitted to Eames\\'s wish for cuddling, because anyone other than Cobb was acceptable for cuddling. Arthur was certain that he was going to really enjoy the cuddling benefits with Eames. \"Okay, let\\'s see. My reflection has a mind of its own but mostly mirrors what I\\'m doing.\" \"Excellent.\" \"I have a very good singing voice. I can also sometimes make things move when I sing, hum, or whistle.\" \"You\\'re the life of the party. You\\'ll impress everyone with your skills at karaoke!\" \"I\\'m not doing karaoke, Eames. I can\\'t think of anything else.\" \"Then you\\'re perfect,\" Eames said, pressing another kiss against Arthur\\'s lips, then a second one against Arthur\\'s throat. \"Not practically perfect because that\\'s only almost perfect. You\\'re perfect. You\\'re magical and smart and I\\'m so lucky to have teamed up with you.\" Arthur smiled contently. \"You say that now, Mr. Eames. Just wait till we have to hide in the clouds to avoid people trying to kill us, or receive job offers from advertisements that rhyme . You know, \\'Wanted a point man and forger for one slightly unreasonable client.\\'\" \"I can\\'t wait.\" And that sounded perfect to Arthur too. ","Summary":" A.N- This is a blanket author\\'s note.

The glow from her tablet screen illuminated her face in a light blue wash. Her fingers quickly tapping on the screen. She stared so intently at the screen she didn\\'t notice that some on her black curly hair fell out of the messy bun she put her hair into, nor did she notice the door to her apartment opening. She jumped up when she heard the door close, causing the tablet to slide onto the couch. She grabbed her katana, which rested by the side of the couch and made her way to the entrance of her apartment. As she approached the entrance she heard noises of someone in the apartment. Then she heard keys hit the counter in her kitchen. There was only one person who had the keys to her apartment. She immediately leaned the katana against the wall. \"Arthur, you\\'re early\" the woman teased as she entered the kitchen. The tall young man stood there at the fridge, his dark brown eyes and short combed dark brown hair could not hide his loving smile. \"Is that why you are not ready?\" He asked looking her up and down. She looked down at herself, she wore an oversized t-shirt and black leggings and she noticed the cold of the floor seeping into her bare feet. \"I\\'ll go change\" She said as she left the room and walked to the bedroom. \"Caitlyn don\\'t take too long\" Arthur yelled after her as he put away some groceries. In her room Caitlyn changed into a beautiful red evening gown and matching high heeled shoes. When she entered the living room she saw Arthur standing by the couch with her katana in his hands. \"Why was this leaning against the wall and not in its holder? Did you think I was him?\" There was concern in his voice as he spoke. Caitlyn held back the tears wanting to burst out from behind her eyes as she nodded her head. Arthur could not see her cry, he would worry too much. Arthur hugged her tightly as she quietly nestled her head into his shoulder. \"He doesn\\'t come here, remember? This is the one place you have all to yourself.\" Arthur whispered as they stood in the center of the room. \"Do you want to stay here tonight?\" Arthur asked reassuring her as he grabbed her shoulders and looked into her emerald green eyes. \"No, I have been looking forward to tonight.\" Caitlyn replied with a smile and a glimpse of happiness returned to her face. \"Ok, let\\'s go\" Arthur kissed her on the forehead. He handed Caitlyn\\'s her tablet and she slid it into its grey cloth case. Caitlyn grabbed her black leather purse as they exited the apartment. A few minutes later they were seated at an expensive upscale seafood restaurant. \"Any ideas about a new job?\" Caitlyn added in her normal upbeat tone as she sipped her glass of white wine. \"Cobb is working on it.\" Arthur responded after finishing a bit of his salmon dish. \"We need to tell him, we cannot be sneaking around like this.\" Caitlyn said in a serious tone staring at Arthur, \"He needs to know. What if something was to happen when we are down there?\" \"He has his secrets, we have ours\" Arthur said as he hailed a waiter for their check. \"But the thing is we both know his secrets, even if he doesn\\'t know that we know\" Caitlyn remarked as they got up. \"What time is it?\" Arthur asked \"a few seconds until 12:15\" Caitlyn said as she checked her watch. Their 3 hours had come to an end too fast. They had stayed at the restaurant longer than they expected, which at this point should be expected. Arthur and Caitlyn could talk for hours and hours without having a silent moment. \"Ready?\" Caitlyn asked looking at Arthur \"Nope\" Arthur replied over his breath. He then grabbed her by the waist, pulled her closer to him and kissed her on the lips. Caitlyn wrapped her arms gently around Arthur\\'s neck and closed her eyes.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 - Waking in Reality When she opened her eyes, her vision was a little fuzzy, but it soon focused on the landscape painting in a golden frame on a muted pink wall. It took her a minute to realized where she was, in the hotel. She turned her head away from the painting to her right shoulder. She looked out the window, then down at herself. She pulled out the I.V. tube, got out of the chair and opened her grey tablet case. Inside was a black tablet and a faded hardcover book. Caitlyn took out the book and read the first line. She looked at herself in the mirror she wore grey slacks, a white short sleeved collared shirt, and a grey pinstripe vest; her black curly hair fell to her shoulders like a cascading waterfall. She was back in reality. She looked over her shoulder Arthur was slowly waking up, he was in his usual beige trouser and a long sleeved collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up halfway, and a dark red tie. She glanced at the clock 09:15 pm beamed back at her in neon green. They had been under for only fifteen minutes. \"That was a lovely date, The Atlantis how did you know?\" Caitlyn walked over to the seated Arthur, draped her arms around him and kissed his cheek. \"We were in your dreams, but I remember you talking about it.\" Arthur said as he lightly stroked Caitlyn\\'s forearm. \"You still think he wants to get you?\" Arthur asked looking concerned at Caitlyn. \"I did what I had to in order to get out. I sometimes wonder if that was enough\" Caitlyn said looking out of the hotel window. The lights from the city was scattered across the vastness of the open unbuilt areas. \"I am sure it was. I won\\'t let him hurt you again.\" Arthur had gotten up from his chair and stood behind Caitlyn putting his hand gently on her shoulders. She turned her head to see the end table. There was a Glock 17 resting on the table and a katana leaning against it. Caitlyn turned around to face Arthur. She put her right hand on his left cheek. Arthur leaned his cheek into her hand. \"Arthur, I...\" Caitlyn started. Arthur put his finger to his mouth, silencing Caitlyn, it was evident that he heard something. Caitlyn heard it too, footsteps slowing down outside Arthur\\'s hotel room. Caitlyn hurried around the room straightening up the chairs. Arthur quickly put the I.V. tubes back into a silver case. They had just finished, when there was a knock on the door. Caitlyn unlocked her black tablet screen, illuminating the surrounding air in a white light showing a completed advanced search. \"Who is it?\" Arthur asked the person behind the door \"Dom\" A male voice came through the wood hotel door. Arthur walked over to the wooden door and opened it. A man walked in, he wore black trousers, a black collar shirt, a black suit jacket, and a black silk tie. His blonde hair was combed back. His blue eyes looked around the room. As Dominick walked in Arthur closed the door and gave a look to Caitlyn. \"Looks like you two have been searching. Didn\\'t find anything?\" Dominick joked as he looked around the room. Caitlyn gave a look of relief back to Arthur. Dominick did not suspect anything. \"Did you find one, Cobb?\" Arthur asked Dominick. Dominick \"Dom\" Cobb was the group leader, he was also an extractor, which meant he took information out of people\\'s subconsciousness. \"Yeah, we are meeting the client tomorrow morning\" He remarked standing in the middle of the room. \"Who is the client?\" Caitlyn asked Dominick turned to look at her, \"Cobol\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 - The Job \"Cobol! Really, Cobb? You have to be kidding me\" Caitlyn look at Dominick concerned. \"What is wrong with Cobol, they pay well?\" Arthur asked looking a little confused. \"David is their main architect for espionage jobs.\" Caitlyn said looking over at Arthur. \"And they don\\'t like hackers so much.\" She added looking at Dominick. She was a gifted hacker. She was able to hack into the FBI when she was 10, CIA at 12, and the US military services at 14. Then she went global hacking major corporations for money. When she was 18 she turned her hacking ability into the brain, she would break into the electric synapses of the subconscious to gain information and send electrical signals to different parts of the subject\\'s brain. \"He won\\'t be our architect, I talked to them. We will choose our own.\" Dominick replied trying to ease the concern on Caitlyn\\'s face. Caitlyn had known Dominick and Arthur for almost 10 years. She also became very good friends with Dominick\\'s wife, Mallorie. Caitlyn\\'s unique skill set made her very useful to the team. \"Who is the architect?\" Arthur asked as he walked to the table in the room with files and started packing them into a suitcase. \"Nash is the only one available right now and we need to move on this.\" Dominick replied \"Where are we headed?\" Caitlyn asked picking up some files and putting them into the same suitcase. \"Cobol headquarters in Mombasa\" Dominick said as Caitlyn grabber her tablet and started tapping on it. \"3 tickets to Mombasa, business class and 3 hotel rooms by the city center.\" Caitlyn said has she finished tapping on the tablet\\'s screen. She slid her tablet into its grey case and placed in on the bed, \"We will be ready to leave in 10 minutes, Cobb.\" \"Very good job both of you\" Dominick started leaving, then he turned his head to call over his shoulder, \"Caitlyn thanks for the travel arrangements,\" with that he left the room, closing the door behind him. \"Do you think he knows?\" Arthur whispered to Caitlyn. \"No, he is too much in his own head, even in reality.\" Caitlyn replied staring at the door. \"Do you think he still misses her that much\" Arthur said as he packed his stuff from the room. \"We all still miss her that much. I don\\'t think he is going to get over it.\" Caitlyn said as she packed her things. \"You were going to say something earlier\" Arthur looked subtly hopeful at Caitlyn \"Oh I forgot.\" Caitlyn said looking away. She was little nervous to tell Arthur how she felt about him, maybe Arthur won\\'t react the way she wanted. She hadn\\'t really thought about it before nor had she ever had the chance. They were either talking about other things or researching. They had been dating via dream sharing for the past year and a half. They hadn\\'t told Dominick about it, they didn\\'t know how he would react. After she was finished packing her suitcase she turned to Arthur, who had also finished packing, \"Ready to go?\" \"Yeah\" his voice answered from behind her as she turned back to open the door. They wheeled out their suitcases into the hall, Arthur carrying a big black hard-cased handled create and Caitlyn carrying her grey tablet sleeve. They meet Dominick out the in the hall. They wheeled their suitcases out of the hotel, grabbed a cab, checked in at baggage and boarded their plane. On the plane Arthur was seated next to Caitlyn, Cobb was sitting a head of them a few rows. \"Get some sleep. We need you rested, once you get a subject you know you don\\'t stop until you found out everything about them.\" Arthur said softly as he held her hand intertwining their fingers. \"You are probably right\" Caitlyn said silently yawning. She closed her eyes and let her head fall onto Arthur\\'s shoulder. Arthur opened his book and began to read.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Traveling to Mombasa Dominick got out of his seat when the seat belt light was turned off. It was a long flight and he needed to stretch his legs, anything to make this flight seem shorter. He turned his head to look behind him. Arthur was reading a paper and Caitlyn was sleeping. Nothing he needed to worry about. The seat across the aisle from Arthur was open. Dominick made his way to the seat and sat down. Arthur watched Dominick has he sat down. Arthur was still a little worried that Dominick would find out about him and Caitlyn. He cared about her too much to let Dominick fire her from the team. He carefully pushed Caitlyn\\'s head to rest against the wall of the plane. \"What is going on?\" Arthur asked turning to Dominick \"Nothing, it was just getting stuffy in my seat\" Dominick answered loosening his tie. He always tried to look professional sometimes it made him feel claustrophobic. \"Did Cobol tell you anything about our subject?\"Arthur asked as the flight attendant handed them both sparkling water. \"Is she asleep?\" Dominick asked eyeing Caitlyn. \"Yeah she is out. Why?\" Arthur looked to Caitlyn, she looked so cute when she slept, then back to Dominick. \"She is not going to like the contact we report to.\" Dominick lowered his voice to a loud whisper. \"Don\\'t tell me it is David\" Arthur groaned with disappointment. David Morgan was a talented architect, designer of the dream space the team operates in, but his talent did not warrant his arrogance and dismissiveness. Dominick gave an affirmative glance at Arthur. \"She shouldn\\'t come with us to the meeting then.\" Arthur started to become defensive. \"Caitlyn can handle herself, we will be there too. She has grown so much since she last saw him\" Dominick reassured Arthur. They both were protective of her, she was the only one of her kind. They would have lost many clients and failed many missions if she was not a part of their team. \"Is he going down with us?\" Arthur asked cautiously, did really didn\\'t want to hear the wrong answer. \"No. I made sure of that. He will probably try, which is why Caitlyn cannot know until we meet David. She will be better suited to deal with the situation when she is not worrying about it beforehand.\" Dominick stated. Arthur knew Dominick was right, but this was Caitlyn they were talking about and he didn\\'t know what he would do if anything happened to her. \"Okay, I won\\'t tell her. But you are the one she is going to get mad at when she finds out.\" Arthur replied sipping his water. \"That is fine with me\" Dominick said as he shifted in the seat, \"how is she? I mean, how do you think she is?\" \"I don\\'t want to speak for her, but he did a number on her. Can\\'t you tell?\" Arthur replied \"Yeah, I know. Which is why I asked. I hoped that she would be okay.\" Dominick stated \"She seems okay, she doesn\\'t like talking about it. I think that is for the best.\" Arthur added \"Passengers please take your seats as we begin our descent.\" A voice stated over the intercom. Dominick got up and went back to his seat. Arthur helped Caitlyn\\'s head fall back onto his shoulder. It wasn\\'t long before the plane touched down and was being taxied to the terminal. \"Caitlyn, time to wake up\" Arthur whispered to her. Caitlyn opened her eyes, \"I slept to whole flight?\" \"Yeah, you needed it apparently. At least you will focus on the case.\" Arthur stated as the other passengers rose from their seat. Caitlyn and Arthur rose, they let Dominick in front of them. They grabbed their belongings from baggage claim, and took a taxi to their hotel. As they entered their rooms, Caitlyn asked \"I can get the name of our subject?\" \"Saito head of Proclus Global.\" Dominick replied before entering his hotel room. Caitlyn stood outside her door. Arthur walked up to her, \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah. It is just a big task. Saito is very well known. It would be time consuming to weed out the fake and the truth.\" Caitlyn stated looking at Arthur. \"Do you want help?\" Arthur said as he opened her hotel door. \"Don\\'t you need to sleep?\" Caitlyn asked \"I will be fine. We don\\'t meet the client until 10:00 am\" Arthur said. With that he and Caitlyn entered her hotel room.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 - The Nightmare Arthur was so tired that he fell asleep the minute his laid down on the bed. It made Caitlyn giggle a little as she looked at the clock 3:00 am glared back at her in a bright light. She took off his shoes, socks, tie, and jacket then gently moved the covers over him. She placed his things on the floor next to the bed. She set an alarm for 8:30 am. She tied her hair back into a bun as she sat at the desk in the room, took out her tablet and started touching the screen rapidly. Caitlyn became lost in the searching, note taking, and hacking that became part of her and Arthur\\'s researching routine. It seemed like she was searching for hours when there was a pounding that seemed to come from all around her. She looked up, she wasn\\'t in the hotel room anymore; instead she was a metal room with a double bed with clean white sheets, she had been here before 10 years ago and she never wanted to return. She looked down, her tablet and case was gone. Her security was gone. Again the pounding shook the walls. Caitlyn stood up and looked around. She found a door and opened it. The sunlight streamed through the leaves of the nearby trees. She recognized this place from her childhood. She stepped through the door, she was standing on the porch of a large wooden cabin, her childhood summer home. Caitlyn turn back to the metal door. It was not there anymore, it was replaced with a cherry red wooden door with a pane of glass in it. Caitlyn closed her eyes and thought about the metal box on the other side of the door. When she opened her eyes, she was on the other side of the red door; however, it was not the metal room she was expecting, she was standing in the kitchen on the cabin. She closed her eyes again and thought only about the metal room and the areas of the house it could be in. Everytime she opened her eyes she was in a different place of the cabin, but not in the metal room. A wave of panic washed over Caitlyn as the pounding started again. It was shaking every room she ran into to get away. She looked out a large window in the front living room, there standing a little way from the house was a young platinum blonde haired green eyed man. His face was contorted into a sinister smile, she remembered that smile, hair, eyes, and man, it was someone that she never wanted to see again. She closed her eyes and let out a scream to block out the pounding or maybe to scare the man away. She didn\\'t know why she screamed she just did, it was something instinctual. Caitlyn opened her eyes, her head was on the table her was working at. She glanced at the clock 5:30 am. Her tablet next to her head, its case still next to it. She opened it and pulled out the book. She sighed as she read the first line, she was in reality. She grabbed her room key and opened the hotel door. In the hall she found a soda machine and bought a soda. She stood staring at the soda machine as she opened and drank the soda. She closed her eyes and slowed her breathing. She started to feel better and made her way back to her hotel room. Arthur was up when she closed the door behind her. \"Where were you?\" Arthur asked \"I grabbed a soda\" Caitlyn said looking away from Arthur. She knew that Arthur knew that she only grabbed a soda when she didn\\'t want to sleep. \"Did you dream again?\" Arthur asked walking toward her. \"More like a nightmare. I was back there again, trapped and tortured, he was there.\" Caitlyn said as Arthur embraced her. \"Did you know you were dreaming? Arthur asked has he sat on the bed leaning against the headboard. \"Not a first, but then I tried projecting and it worked. Which only could mean a dream\" Caitlyn replied sitting next to him \"Are you okay\" Arthur asked very concerned as he held Caitlyn. \"Yeah. It wasn\\'t real anymore.\" Caitlyn sighed resting her head in his shoulder as her held her. These were her favorite moments, when Arthur showed how much he cared about her, even if it was because she was a valued team member. \"Do you need help with the research?\" Arthur finally asked after a while. He was trying to get her mind off of the dream. With what he knew she needed to be on her A-game if she was going to get through the meeting later that day. \"Yeah. Start with those files on the other side of the table\" Caitlyn said getting up. Arthur followed her to the table and sat across from her looking at paper as she tapped on her tablet. They spent their research time looking at articles, profiles and history, while stealing glances at each other. At 8:30 the alarm on Caitlyn\\'s tablet went off. Caitlyn went to shower as Arthur went to his room to change and shower. At 9:00 they both left their hotel rooms and met Dominick out in the hall. \"You have stuff on Saito\" Dominick asked Caitlyn as they walked to the entrance of the hotel. \"Some, not a lot, but it is good.\" Caitlyn said eyeing Dominick. He never questioned her abilities like this.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 - Meeting at Cobol Cobol headquarters was only a block and a half from their hotel, the team decided to walk. Walking let Caitlyn clear her head from the night. It was not long until they stood at the entrance of the tall skyscraper, which seemed a little out of place in the vastness that surrounded it. They entered the building and security escorted them to the 5th floor. As they got off the elevator the receptionist spoke to the security, which then left the three of them sitting on a plastic bright cherry red couch. They sat there for what left like an hour, until the receptionist said, \"Your contact will see you now, Mr. Cobb.\" She buzzed them into a large door. Standing on the other end of the door was a green eyed man in his early thirties; the light shining on his platinum blonde hair making it seem lighter, if that was at all possible. Caitlyn stood there for a moment frozen in fear. Dominick made the introductions \"David, it is good to see you. You remember Arthur Jones, our pointman. I would like to introduce Caitlyn Johnson, our hacker.\" Dominick said as he shook the blonde haired man\\'s hand. \"Dominick it is a pleasure to work with the best in the business. It is sad that you already picked an architect\" David replied, then he looked at Caitlyn, \"I would have loved to design the dream space.\" Caitlyn shuddered as David looked at her. She never wanted to see him again after what he did to her. \"Hello Caitlyn. I knew we would meet again.\" David said as he stood right in front of her. He stood so close that she would felt the warmth of his body. However, it felt different this time, not warm and inviting but secretive and evil. \"Hello David.\" Caitlyn stated firmly, maybe she could find the confidence that she normally had. \"Shall we get this meeting underway?\" Arthur asked looking at David as he stood closer to Caitlyn. \"Yeah. Please sit down.\" David seemed to have been pulled from his thoughts has he led the team into the conference room. \"We some information about Saito and have started to formulate a plan.\" Dominick said without taking his eyes off of David. \"Great, less work for me.\" David chuckled starting at Caitlyn. His gaze made her squirm but she just stared back, unmoved. She had learned a long time ago the only way to make David feel like he lost was to act as though he didn\\'t bother her. \"We found that he has a mistress in Venezuela, who is the wife of an important statesman in the country, he has been in the dream world before, and lastly, he is concerned about extraction of information from his subconscious.\" Caitlyn said checking her notes. \"Our plan is to use that information to get him to divulge his expansion plan.\" Arthur added \"Like blackmail?\" David asked with a puzzled look on his face \"No, we pose as extractors who want to help train his subconscious and extract the information that way.\" Dominick clarified for him. \"You have an architect? Because I have free for the job.\" David asked trying to seem innocent. Arthur gave a look to Dominick. \"We have an architect. Nash.\" Dominick replied. David gave look disgust. Caitlyn looked at Arthur. \"Nash is untalented and clumsy.\" David stated, \"I would be a much better architect for the job.\" Caitlyn stood up, \"No. Nash is fine. You are never ever getting access to my subconscious again. You will never be part of the team and you will never have me again. These two men here will make sure of that.\" She spoke unemotionally and clear. With that the team stood up and walked out of the room. Before she left, Caitlyn turned around, \"I will send the the information on the expansion plan after the job.\" She then turned back and exited the room. \"You okay?\" Arthur asked looking at Caitlyn as the team stood in the elevator. \"Actually, I am.\" Caitlyn answered smiling. \"What is the next steps?\" Dominick asked \"You and Nash are flying to Venezuela to find Saito\\'s secret apartment. That will be the first layer of the dream. The next layer will be a Japanese casino hotel, where we approach Saito about training his subconscious. After you and Nash are done in Venezuela you both will fly to Japan and meet me and Arthur there. Saito is having a surgery in a few days so we will extract then.\" Caitlyn said as they exited the Cobol building. \"Sounds like you two thought of everything.\" Dominick replied slightly amazed. \"We did. The best plans are the most specific.\" Arthur answered. Arthur was the team\\'s point man. It was his job to make sure all the specifics of the plan were laid out and researched. He was also a dreamer, a team member who constructs and maintains the dream space the team operates in.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 - The Saito Job It wasn\\'t long before Nash and Dominick were meeting Caitlyn and Arthur in Japan. They only stayed in Venezuela long enough for Nash to sketch the Saito\\'s apartment. The plan was well thought out, like all of Arthur\\'s plans were. However the plan didn\\'t take into account last minute changes. \"We have to move on Saito now\" Caitlyn said as she collected her tablet case. \"Why?\" Nash asked looking a little confused \"He is not going to have to surgery. He is taking a train to Tokyo this afternoon. I got us tickets and some help.\" Caitlyn responded as Arthur grabbed some gear as the team left the hotel. They made their way to the train station and boarded the train just in time. It wasn\\'t long before they found Saito\\'s compartment. He was already sleeping. There a teenager sitting across from Saito. \"The train attendant gave him some water, then he just fell asleep.\" The teenager stated as the team entered the compartment. \"You work fast\" Nash said to Caitlyn with amazement in his voice. \"I have too in order to get the job done\" Caitlyn said under her breath relief in her voice as Dominick and Arthur setup the silver case and I.V. tubes, their PASIV device, on the floor between the train seats. \"We have 15 minutes until the next stop. Put these headphones on Nash when the timer says twenty eight seconds left.\" Dominick told the teenager as the team started to place the I.V. needle into their arm. Caitlyn placed a small metallic tower with a blue light on it on the small table under the compartment window. The teenager hit the small round button in the center of the case and the team fell asleep. The team was standing on the busy sidewalk. Saito was walking a few steps ahead of them. They followed him as he walked toward his apartment. They managed to sneak behind him and knock him unconscious. They laid him down on the bed and connected him to the PASIV device Arthur was carrying with him. In the next room Caitlyn set up the team\\'s chairs. Arthur was carrying the case letting out the I.V. tubing connected to Saito into the room where Caitlyn and Dominick were setting up. Caitlyn pulled out her black tablet from its grey case and set in on the end table next to her running a hack into Saito\\'s subconscious. \"We good?\" Dominick asked as Arthur began undoing the rest of the I.V. tubes for the team going down the next level. \"Yeah.\" Arthur said sitting down and poking himself with the needle. Caitlyn and Dominick followed suit. Nash pushed the button. Dominick and Arthur were dressed in elegant tuxedos. Caitlyn was in a golden one sleeve formal evening gown. Her tablet and its case were on her lap. She was quietly and quickly tapping on it, but still looking up at Saito. Saito was sitting across a dinner table from them. An expensive meal was on the table in front of everyone. \"What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm?\" Dominick started. Saito put down his fork. It was clear he started to lose his appetite. The conversation was going downhill. \"What Mr. Cobb is trying to say is -\" Arthur was trying to salvage the conversation. \"An idea\" Dominick cut off Arthur, \"Resilient and highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it\\'s almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed, fully understood. That sticks, somewhere in the brain.\" Saito began to look intrigued at Dominick. \"For someone like you to steal?\" Saito asked eyeing Dominick. \"Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered making your thoughts vulnerable to theft. It\\'s called extraction.\" Arthur stated leaning on the table. Saito listened still eating his dinner. \"Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractors.\" Caitlyn spoke looking straight across the table to Saito. \"How can you do that\" Saito asked \"Because I am the most skilled extractor\" Dominick answered confidently. \"I know how to search your mind. I know the tricks.\" Dominick continued, \"And I can teach them to you. So that even when you are asleep your defenses are never down.\" Saito remained unmoved. Dominick got up and started to walk around the room, \"Look if you want our help, you are going to have to be completely open with me. I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your therapist, anyone. If this is a dream and you have a safe full of secrets, I need to know what is inside that safe. In order for this all to work, you need to let me in.\" Saito smiled, wiped his face and got up, \"Enjoy your evening gentlemen, lady,\" He motioned to Arthur and Dominick, and then to Caitlyn. He started to leave the room, \"As I consider your proposal.\" Arthur and Caitlyn stood up as Saito left the room. Caitlyn had pressed her tablet close to her stomach, covering it with the grey case. She relaxed and raised the tablet to look at it. She continued to tap on the screen. \"He knows\" Arthur said glaring at Dominick. Dominick just stared at the place where Saito exited. Caitlyn looked at her screen, \"brain waves seem normal. I don\\'t think so.\" The ceiling suddenly shook ever so slightly \"What is going on up there\" Arthur asked to noone in particular. Caitlyn closed her eyes and started to fade. She opened her eyes and the fading went away. \"Looks like a riot\" She said. They left the room walking on the bridge hallways. As they were walking, Caitlyn noticed a blip on her brain map of Saito\\'s brain. She looked up, Dominick and Arthur stopped walking. They were staring at a woman, with tanned skin, brown curly hair and blue eyes. \"What is she doing here?\" Arthur asked Dominick \"You two go back to the room. I will deal with this.\" Dominick commanded to Caitlyn and Arthur. \"I am almost cracked it. But you get a chance the code to the safe is 19-1-9-20-15. Dom please be careful, Mal is not real. Remember the job\" Caitlyn grabbed Dominick\\'s arm before he walked to the other woman.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 - The Saito Job Goes Wrong Arthur and Caitlyn closed the door to the room. Caitlyn was staring at the hacking countdown on her tablet as if just the mere thinking about it speeding up would make it do so. \"Is he going to show up too?\" Arthur asked looking concerned at Caitlyn. \"No, we are in your dream and Nash\\'s. Not mine\" Caitlyn said still staring at the tablet\\'s screen. Arthur walked up to her held her head in his hands and kissed her. Her tablet beeped. She pulled away from Arthur to check her tablet. \"Dom is in the safe\" Caitlyn said to Arthur, \"What was that, earlier?\" \"What was what?\" Arthur responded innocently. \"The kiss\" Caitlyn said looking into his brown eyes. \"I just wanted you to know that I -\" Arthur started but was cut off by a knock on the door. Arthur went to answer it. Standing in the doorway was Saito\\'s guards and Mal, guns pointed at Arthur and Caitlyn. Caitlyn set her grey case down covering her tablet. The guards grabbed her and Arthur and led them down to the room where they had been earlier that evening. Mal pointed her gun at Arthur, \"Please Dom, put the gun down\" Dominick looked at Arthur, who shook his head no. Caitlyn tried to free herself from the guard\\'s grasp. Dominick put his gun down and slid it across the table. \"Now the envelope, Mr Cobb\" Saito said sternly. \"Did she tell you or have you known all along?\" Dominick asked, with his hand up \"That you are here to steal from me or that we are actually asleep\" Saito said looking at Dominick. Dominick, Arthur and Caitlyn exchanged glances. \"I want to know the name of your employer.\" Saito continued. Mal cocked her gun and held it up to Arthur\\'s head, threatening Arthur. \"There is no use threatening him in a dream right Mal\" Dominick said staring at Mal \"It depends on what you are threatening\" Mal responded, \"killing him would just wake him up. But pain, pain is in the mind.\" Mal lowered the gun and shot Arthur\\'s knee. He yelled in pain, falling down as the guards were trying to keep him up right. Caitlyn tried harder to escape the guard\\'s hold on her. Tears started to form in her eyes. \"And judging by the decor, we are in your mind. Right Arthur?\" Mal continued aiming the gun at Arthur\\'s other knee. Dominick jumped and slid on the table to his gun as Caitlyn disappeared from the room. She reappeared in the room her and Arthur we\\'re just removed from. She grabbed her tablet and click the screen. She grabbed her katana. The room started to crumble. Dom must have killed Arthur. The dream was collapsing. She closed her eyes and thought about Dominick. She opened her eye and was standing right next to him. \"Did you get anything\" He asked as they ran away from the guards. \"I don\\'t know. I sent everything up. I will sort it out later.\" Caitlyn said slashing at the guards as Dominick fired a few rounds. Dominick opened the envelope, there were three sheets of paper with some of the writing blacked out. \"It is not all there, we failed\" Caitlyn said \"Not unless you can find something.\" Dominick said under his breath. They started running again. Dominick went up the stairs while Caitlyn ran to the left of the staircase. She didn\\'t notice a beam falling until it landed on her. Caitlyn woke up in a chair, sunlight from the sun pouring into the window. Nash was standing near her. She pulled out the I.V. tube, grabbed her tablet, and started tapping on it. She could hear Nash panic about something, but she wasn\\'t paying much attention. That was until she heard Arthur yell at Nash, \"Dunk him.\" She was out of her chair and pushed Dominick into the tub of water,they has set up, before Nash could turn around to complete Arthur\\'s request. She sat back down and continued tapping until Saito came in pointing a gun at her and Nash, Arthur followed behind him. Saito turned around to point his gun at Arthur as Dominick jumped out of the tub and wrestled Saito to the ground knocking the gun out of his hand. Dominick held Saito until he went unconscious. Arthur and Nash sat Saito in one of the chairs as Caitlyn pulled a chair to the corner of the room and continue tapping on her tablet. Saito regained consciousness. Arthur stared out the windows, Dominick sat across Saito. \"You came prepared\" Dominick said playing with Saito\\'s gun in his hands \"Not even my head of security knows about this place, how did you find out about it?\" Saito asked. \"It is very difficult for a man in your position to keep a love nest, especially when there is a married woman involved. Nothing is safe from me\" Caitlyn responded not looking up from her screen. \"She would never.\" Saito asserted looking behind him at Caitlyn, who was still typing on her tablet. \"Yet here we are, with a dilemma\" Dominick stated redirecting Saito to look at him. \"They are getting closer.\" Arthur stated from the window. The noise from the riots outside the build was getting louder. \"You got what you came for.\" Saito stated breathless. \"That is not true. You left out some key information, didn\\'t you? You held something back because you knew what we were up to.\" Dominick asserted, \"The question is why did you let us in at all?\" \"An audition\" Saito replied with a sly smile. \"An audition for what?\" Caitlyn asked still looking at her tablet. \"It doesn\\'t matter you failed\" Saito answered. \"We extracted every piece of information you had in there\" Dominick stated a little defensive. \"Your deception was obvious.\" Saito answered. Arthur looked at Dominick, then to Caitlyn. The explosions got closer. Caitlyn only glanced up enough to see that Nash was getting nervous. She was getting nervous, she almost hacked Saito\\'s brain. She was going to get the information. She heard something in the room, slight sound of faint music; a song she knew all too well, time was running out. She started tapping faster. She looked to Nash, then to Arthur. It was clear on Arthur\\'s face he heard the music too. \"Leave me and go\" \"You don\\'t understand, Mr. Saito, that corporation that hired us they won\\'t accept failure. We won\\'t last two days\" Dominick leaned in closer to Saito. Arthur looked to Caitlyn, \"What is going on\" \"I am working on it\" Caitlyn looked at Arthur, she hated when breathed down her neck, \" Just give me time.\" Arthur looked back outside and then back at Dominick, he was getting nervous. \"Looks like I am going to have to do this more simply\" Dominick got up threw Saito onto the carpet and point a gun at him, \"Tell us what you know NOW.\" Saito just laid face down on the carpet, \"I have always hated this carpet...,\" he moved his hand back and forth on it, \"...It\\'s stained and frayed in such distinctive ways, but definitely made out of wool…\" Caitlyn looked at her tablet, a notice went off. She watched the download bar reach 100%. She wiped the tablets hard drive, then she smashed her tablet onto the ground. \"He has figured it out\" She cried \"... Right now, I am lying on polyester. Which means I am not lying on the carpet in my apartment...\" Saito continued to move his fingers through the carpet. Dominick took a step back. Arthur looked furious at Nash. Caitlyn just looked out the window, the crowd outside was moving so close that there must be projections inside. \"...You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb. I am still dreaming\" Saito began to get up. Caitlyn watched Arthur disappear. They were out of time. Caitlyn knew she was next, she closed her eyes. When she opened them. Arthur was already out of his chair taking control of the PASIV device. She opened her tablet case on her lap, pulled out her tablet and checked it. \"I got some stuff. It may suffice for Cobol. But I cannot guarantee anything.\" Caitlyn said putting her tablet back in the case as well as placing the small metallic tower she had set up earlier back into the case. Dominick and Nash woke up around the same time. Arthur was fuming at Nash\\'s stupidity \"What is wrong with you, Nash. How do you mess up the carpet\" Arthur said to Nash as Arthur started to put away the PASIV device. \"It wasn\\'t my fault\" Nash stated \"How is it not your fault, you are the architect.\" Caitlyn pointed out. \"I didn\\'t know he was going to rub is cheek on it.\" Nash asserted \"Enough\" Dominick interjected as he checked Saito\\'s pulse. \"And you what the hell was all that?\" Arthur asked looking at Dominick. \"I had it under control\" Dominick stated not looking at Arthur. Caitlyn knew otherwise, she and Arthur exchanged glances. \"I hate to see it out of control\" Arthur said cleaning up. \"Listen every man for themselves.\" Dominick said as he threw some money to the teenager. Dominick, Caitlyn and Arthur exited the train using the back at the next stop. They made their way by cab to their hotel.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 - Aftermath of Saito Job Caitlyn spent the next few hours deciphering the information her tablet received from Saito\\'s brain. Arthur was pacing in her hotel room, he was trying to figure something out. Finally he stopped pacing and turned to Caitlyn. \"Did you manage to get something?\" He looked hopeful at her. \"Some. But Cobol won\\'t like it. It is not everything they asked for. I had to piece some information together, which you know they don\\'t like.\" Caitlyn said as she put her tablet away. Her suitcase were already packed and waiting by the end on her bed. Arthur has wheeled his suitcase next to Caitlyn\\'s when he entered the room. Caitlyn looked at her watch, \" Our ride is should be here soon. Let\\'s get Cobb. I haven\\'t heard from Nash either.\" They exited Caitlyn\\'s hotel room and knocked on the door two doors down. Dominick answered it. Caitlyn could tell he looked stressed and defeated, he must have talked to his kids. \"Our ride is here\" Arthur said as he and Caitlyn entered the room. \"You okay\" Caitlyn asked as they waited for Dominick to finish zipping up her bags. \"Yeah, I am fine. Why?\" Dominick tried to play it off how okay he was. \"Well, down in the dream. Mal showing up.\" Arthur stated \"Look I am sorry about your leg. It won\\'t happen again.\" Dominick said quickly glancing at Arthur \"It is getting worse isn\\'t it\" Caitlyn said trying to study Dominick\\'s reaction \"One apology is all you are getting.\" Dominick responded putting on his jacket and grabbing his bags, \"Where is Nash\" \"We don\\'t know. You want to wait?\" Arthur answered. \"No, Cobol knows we failed, best if we disappeared for a while.\" Dominick said heading towards the door. The three made their way to the rooftop \"Where will you go?\" Caitlyn asked Dominick as they walked to the helicopter. \"Buenos Aires. I can lie low there. Maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down.\" Dominick replied. He looked at Caitlyn and Arthur, \"How about you?\" \"Stateside\" They answered in unison. Arthur gave a look of concern at Caitlyn, she gave him the same look back. \"Send my regards\" Dominick replied. They reached the door of the helicopter. A man opened the door. Inside Nash was sitting, he looked scared. Across from Nash sat Saito. \"He sold you out\" Saito mused looking at them, \"Thought to come to me and bargain for his life. So I offer you the satisfaction.\" The man who had opened the door offered Dominick a gun. Dominick shook his head, \"That is not how way we deal with things.\" Saito knocked on the window and Nash was pulled out of the helicopter by some of Saito\\'s men. Dominick, Caitlyn, and Arthur filed into the helicopter across from Saito. The helicopter took off. \"What will you do with him\" Dominick asked looking at Saito. \"Nothing, but I can\\'t speak for Cobol engineering.\" Saito replied \"What do you want from us\" Caitlyn asked slightly concerned. \"Inception. Is it possible?\" Saito asked looking at Caitlyn. Caitlyn and Dominick shared a look. They both knew how possible it was. \"Of course not\" Arthur responded quickly, staring at Saito \"If you can steal an idea from someone\\'s mind, why can\\'t you plant one there instead?\" Saito asked looking at Arthur. \"Okay. Here is me planting an idea in your head. Don\\'t think of an elephant. What do you think of?\" Arthur spoke, cynicism bursted through every word he spoke. \"Elephants\" Saito conceded. \"Right. But it is not your idea because you know I gave it to you. The subject\\'s mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.\" Arthur explained Caitlyn felt guilty about not telling Arthur the truth as she exchanged another glance with Dominick, with whom she did share exactly how she got out of her relationship with David. \"It\\'s not true\" Caitlyn spoke up. Arthur looked at Caitlyn stunned. \"Can you do it?\" Saito asked looking at Caitlyn Arthur still looked stunned at Caitlyn. Caitlyn looked up from her grey case on her lap. She knew she could. \"Are you offering us a choice? Because I can find my own to square things with Cobol\" Dominick spoke. \"Then you do have a choice.\" Saito answered \"Then we choose to leave sir.\" Dominick replied. The helicopter landed on an airfield not far from a private jet. \"Tell the crew where you want to go\" Saito said pointing to the jet. Dominick, Caitlyn and Arthur filed out of the helicopter. \"Hey, Mr. Cobb\" Saito called out as the team walked away, \"How would you like to go home. To America. To your children.\" This stopped the team in its tracks. Dominick was the first to turn around and walk towards Saito. \"You can\\'t fix that. No one can.\" Dominick yelled over the sound of the helicopter blades. It was not for a lack of trying, Dominick had Caitlyn use her ability to fix it to no avail. \"Just like inception\" Saito mused. \"Dom, come on\" Arthur said to Dominick, but Dominick walked towards Saito. \"Fifty bucks says Dom takes this job\" Caitlyn whispered to Arthur \"Okay.\" Arthur whispered back. \"How complex is the idea?\" Caitlyn heard Dominick ask Saito as she walked to them. \"Simple enough\" Saito answered \"No idea is simple when you need to plant it in someone else\\'s mind\" Caitlyn started. \"My main competitor is an old man in poor health. HIs son will inherit control of the corporation. I need him to decided to break up his father\\'s empire.\" Saito said \"Dom, we should walk away from this\" Arthur said standing with the bags. \"Hold on...If I were to do this… Even if I could do it… I need a guarantee. How do I know you can deliver.\" Dominick said staring at Saito \"You don\\'t\" Saito answered back, \"But I can. So, do you want to take a leap of faith. Or become an old man filled with regret, waiting to die alone.\" Dominick nodded his head. Arthur slipped Caitlyn a fifty dollar bill. Caitlyn smiled a little as his hand slipped into hers as he gave her the money. \"Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely.\" Saito leaned back in his seat as the door closed and the helicopter took off. They boarded the jet. \"Paris, France. Please.\" Dominick told the pilot as the three boarded and sat down on the jet.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 - Traveling to Paris Caitlyn sat next to Arthur and across from a empty seat. Arthur sat across from Dominick. The flight attendants served them some food. They ate in silence for a while. Dominick was staring at his food. Arthur quietly slipped his left hand into Caitlyn\\'s right and intertwined their fingers. Dominick glanced up and Arthur let go and moved his hand back to his lap. Dominick looked out the window. \"Look, I know how much you want to go home.\" Arthur said playing with his food with his fork. He and Dominick exchanged glances. Dominick\\'s home life, or lack thereof, was a touchy subject. \"Inception can\\'t be done\" Arthur added \"Yes it can\" Caitlyn stated between bites. Arthur just stared at her in amazement. She never told him how she got out of her relationship with David. He never asked. \"Just have to go deep enough\" Dominick added. \"You don\\'t know that\" Arthur retorted. \"We both have done it before\" Caitlyn said looking at Arthur. \"Who did you do it to\" Arthur asked looking at Caitlyn. \"David\" Caitlyn answered not looking at Arthur, \"it was the only way I could stop him.\" With Caitlyn\\'s answer Arthur knew not to press the issue. They still had a few hours until they would land. Caitlyn got up and sat on the couch across from them. She didn\\'t realize how tired she was, she stretched out on couch and closed her eyes. When she opened them, she wasn\\'t on the plane anymore. She was inside the metal room with the clean bed. This time David was in there too. \"You will never escape me. You cannot outrun, hid or fight. You are helpless. No one can hear you scream here.\" His voice was cold and unemotional. She put her hand to her ears as he repeated his statement over and over again. She looked around the room. There was a desk with a computer. She sat down at the chair and began to type on the keyboard. She need to hack David\\'s mind again. She finished cracking it when the screen went black and words appeared on it in white. NO ESCAPE, NOT THIS TIME CAITLYN. She closed her eyes tight. She opened her eyes, she was back on the plane\\'s couch. Caitlyn got up, her black slacks slid on the floor as she made her way to plane\\'s bar. She found herself a caffeinated soda. She then made her way to the sleeping Arthur, his arm was draped over her tablet case. She carefully free the case from his arm. She opened it, pulled out the faded hardcover book. She let out a sigh of relief as she quietly read the first few lines of the book. Arthur stirred next to her, then he opened his eyes, \"Where is Dom?\" \"I don\\'t know. Bathroom maybe. I haven\\'t seen him\" Caitlyn replied. \"Why the soda?\" Arthur asked gesturing to the soda in her hands \"I need it. Can\\'t sleep right now.\" Caitlyn said sitting down next to him. \"I have a better idea\" Arthur said pulling out the silver PASIV case. He set it up and handed Caitlyn a needle. She smiled at him, he had read her mind. \"Only 5 minutes though. We can\\'t stay too long\" She whispered into his ear. She stuck the needle into her arm and was soon drifting off to sleep. They were sitting in Central Park, just talking about their former selves. Snow was falling all around them. Snow was already creating a large blanket over the park. They were dressed very warmly, drinking coffee. \"No brothers. 1 sister who my parents think is perfect.\" Caitlyn stated between sips \"No siblings\" Arthur replied. Caitlyn gathered up some snow and tossed it at Arthur, it hit his hat. Caitlyn giggled until she felt the cold of the wet snow hit her face. She and Arthur got up and started a snowball fight. They laughed until the alarm went off on Caitlyn\\'s watch. \"Ready\" she asked \"Nope\" Arthur said under his breath as he kissed her on the lip. He had pulled her closer to him and she wrapped her arms around him. They woke up and put away to PASIV device case just as Dominick came out of the bathroom. \"Why we going to Paris\" Arthur asked Dominick. \"We are going to need a new architect.\" Dominick said looking out the window.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 - Meeting Ariadne Caitlyn had secured all the needed paperwork to get into Paris. She has also secured a warehouse space. They had separated. Dominick was going to see his father - in - law to find a new architect. While Arthur and Caitlyn went to set up the warehouse. Arthur and Caitlyn were walking along the streets of Paris. Caitlyn was looking down at her tablet following the map to the space she had rented. \"How do you think Dom is doing?\" Arthur asked as he followed Caitlyn. \"I think it is hard for him. He wants to go home. This is just a reminder that he can\\'t see his kids\" Caitlyn said not looking up from her tablet. They walked in silence for a while. Arthur grabbed Caitlyn\\'s hand as they walked. \"Here it is\" Caitlyn said looking at the door to the building. They entered and made their way to the top floor. Light flooded the room as they exited the industrial elevator. The warehouse was spacious. \"Caitlyn, it is perfect\" Arthur said as he stepped into the room and glanced around. Caitlyn bowed and laughed, \"I know\" They got to work setting up. They unboxed some cases of PASIV devices. Dominick came in he was carrying a young woman, she had long brown curly hair. Her eyes were closed. \"Hook her up to the device.\" Dominick said as he laid her down on the lawn chair, \" This is Ariadne. An architect.\" Arthur hooked the girl to the PASIV device. Dominick hooked himself to it and laid back in the lawn chair. \"Set for 5 minutes.\" Dominick said before his eyes closed. Arthur pressed the button. \"Now what?\" Caitlyn asked turning around in a stool. \"We wait\" Arthur said unpacking a suitcase. Caitlyn tapped on her tablet, \"I got a hotel room for us, Dom and Ariadne. Just a block from here. They have some really bad firewall.\" Arthur stood beside her, \"What did David do to you?\" He reach out his hand. Caitlyn put her tablet down and took it. Their fingers intertwined. \"A lot more than I can tell you before they wake up\" she smiled coyly at him. She looked back down at her tablet. Arthur kissed her forehead and went back to final set up. It was not long before Arthur set up the music and Ariadne and Dominick woke up. \"Because it is never just dream is it?\" Dominick asked as Ariadne blinked her eye, \"And a face full of glass hurts like hell, when you are in it is feels real.\" \"That\\'s why the military developed dream sharing.\" Arthur commented standing over Ariadne \"It was a training program for soldiers. To shoot, stab, and strangle each other and then wake up.\" Caitlyn stated sitting on a metal stool. \"How did architects become involved?\" Ariadne asked, still laying down on the lawn chair. \"Well, someone had to design the dreams.\" Dominick answered, then he looked at Arthur, \" Why don\\'t you give us another five minutes.\" Arthur turned back to the PASIV device. \"Five minutes, we were talking for at least an hour.\" Ariadne stated in amazement. \"In a dream your mind functions more quickly. Therefore time feels more slow\" Dominick stated leaning back in the lawn chair. \"Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.\" Arthur stated as he set up the PASIV device. \"Why don\\'t you see what you can get up to in five minutes.\" Dominick stated. Arthur pressed the button. Ariadne leaned back and closed her eyes. Ariadne and Dominick were out. Caitlyn got up from the stool and walk across the tablet to stand next to Arthur. He embraced her and kissed her forehead again. \"Arthur I wanted to say that I…\" Caitlyn said while in his arms. There was an alert blaring from her tablet. \"Great\" Caitlyn complained as Arthur released her Caitlyn walked back to the stool and grabbed her tablet. A photo of her mother displayed on her screen. She swiped the screen and her mother appeared on the screen. \"Bonjour momma\" As Caitlyn spoke a hint of her french accent emerged. \"How are things going Cailyn\" Caitlyn\\'s mother\\'s voice was oozing with a heavy french accent. Her mother was french and her father was an American statesmen. \"Good momma. I am fine. Thing are fine\" Caitlyn said returning to her normal voice. \"Are you eating well\" Caitlyn\\'s mother asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Oui, momma\" Caitlyn answered \"Honey, you need love in your life. Why don\\'t you get back with David. He was such a lovely young man\" Caitlyn\\'s mother asked \"Momma, David was not nice to me. He broke up with me remember.\" Caitlyn said glancing at Arthur, who have a concerned glanced back. \"Anyway. Rebecca and her husband are doing well. She says that she couldn\\'t be happier\" Caitlyn\\'s mother said excitedly. \"Okay momma\" Caitlyn sighed, she rolled her eyes at Arthur, who laughed quietly Her mother kept comparing Caitlyn to her older sister, Rebecca, who was happily married to an architect that had introduced Caitlyn to David. Rebecca didn\\'t believe Caitlyn when she finally told them about David. \"Momma say hi to Arthur.\" Caitlyn turned the tablet around so that her mother could see Arthur standing across the able. \"Bonjour Arthur. Where is Dominick?\" Caitlyn\\'s mother was looking close at the camera. \"Dominick is out for a while Mrs. Johnson.\" Arthur answered. Caitlyn turned the camera around to face her, \"Momma I am sorry. I will visit when we are in Paris. Bye momma\" \"Bye Caitlyn\" her mother waved at the camera. Caitlyn pressed the red button on the bottom of the screen and the screen went black. Caitlyn sighed as she put the tablet down on the table. An another alert went off. Caitlyn looked at her screen. \"Ariadne is in trouble.\" Caitlyn said getting up. Arthur and Caitlyn stood around Ariadne waiting. They didn\\'t have to wait long. Ariadne jolted up gasping for air. Arthur knelt down and grabbed her hand. \"Hey it is okay. It\\'s okay. Look at me. You\\'re okay. You\\'re okay\" Arthur said trying to calm down Ariadne. \"I couldn\\'t I wake up. Why couldn\\'t I wake up?\" Ariadne asked, still sounding a little panicked. \"Cause there was still some time on the clock. You can\\'t wake up from within the dream unless you die.\" Arthur answered. \"She will need a totem\" Dominick said getting up. \"What\" Ariadne asked a little confused. \" A totem… It\\'s a small personal -\" Arthur started \"That is some subconscious you got there Cobb. She\\'s a real charmer\" Ariadne called after Dominick as he made his way to other room. Arthur and Caitlyn looked at each other. They knew who Ariadne was talking about. \"Ah… I see you have met Mrs. Cobb\" Caitlyn said handing Ariadne a glass of water. \"She is his wife?\" Ariadne asked in amazement \"Yeah\" Arthur replied. \"So a totem. You need a small object potentially heavy. Something you can have with you at all times. That no one else knows.\" Arthur continued \"Like a coin\" Ariadne asked \"No. It needs to be more unique than that. Like this… it is a loaded die.\" Arthur pulled out a red die from his vest chest pocket. Ariadne reached her hand out to it. Arthur pulled it away and stated calmly, \"I can\\'t let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose. See, only I know the balance and exact weight of this particular die.\" \"That way when you look at your totem, you know beyond a doubt that you are not is someone else\\'s dream.\" Caitlyn added sitting down on a lawn chair next to Ariadne. \"I-I don\\'t know if you can\\'t see what\\'s going on or if you just don\\'t want to, but Cobb has some serious problems that he has tried to bury down there.\" Ariadne looked to Caitlyn and Arthur. They quickly glanced at each other. They knew Ariadne was right. \"I\\'m not about to just open my mind to someone like that\" Ariadne continued. She got up and walked out. Arthur stared at Caitlyn, she looked back at him. No one spoke until they heard the door close. \"I don\\'t blame her\" Caitlyn said looking at the door then back at her tablet. She got up and made her way to the table by the lawn chairs. Arthur packed up the PASIV device. \"She\\'ll be back. I\\'ve never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before. Reality is not going to be enough for her.\" Dominick said as he walked into the room and to the table, \"And when she comes back... When she comes back you\\'re going to have her building mazes.\" \"Where are you going to be\" Arthur asked facing Dominick. \"I got to go visit Eames.\" Dominick said getting his stuff. \"Eames? No. He is back in Mombasa. That is Cobol\\'s backyard.\" Arthur stated. Caitlyn began typing on the tablet. The printer started up and printed out a ticket. \"Just tell me when you want to come back. It will be ready\" Caitlyn said handing Dominick the paper. \"Thanks, Caitlyn. Arthur, it is a necessary risk\" Dominick said putting on his jacket. \"Well, there are plenty of good thieves\" Arthur stated. \"We don\\'t just need a thief. We need a forger.\" Dominick said as he closed the door.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 - Paris Alone \"Well now what?\" Caitlyn asked turning to Arthur. \"How about a nice dinner. How about Amour?\" Arthur asked taking her hand and pulling her close to him. \"Sounds nice.\" Caitlyn replied looking into his eyes. Arthur smiled, he then held Caitlyn\\'s head in his hands and kissed her. She held his wrist as he did. She did not want this moment to end. Their dinner was nice, they talked and laughed. The next day, they were in the warehouse. Caitlyn was sitting on the stool at the table across from Arthur. \"That\\'s weird\" Caitlyn said with a raised eyebrow. \"What\" Arthur asked his eyebrow showed concern. \"Saito is in Mombasa. His plane landed soon after Dom\\'s\" Caitlyn said as she scrolled on her tablet. \"That was hours ago, why is your tablet showing an alert now.\" Arthur walked over to look over Caitlyn\\'s shoulder. \"Saito used his credit card. I have CCTV footage of it.\" Caitlyn said looking at Arthur. \"Dominick must have meet up with Eames by now.\" Arthur said a hint of disgust in his voice. \"Arthur why do you not like Eamas. Is it because we dated? Caitlyn asked. Eames Hardy and Caitlyn were a couple for two years after she dated David. Eames helped her get away of David. She broke it off shortly after Eames introduce her Dominick, Arthur, and Mallorie. Eames was the best forger Caitlyn ever met, he would mimic a subject\\'s projection and con his way through someone\\'s subconscious. \"No. He just has a different view than me.\" Arthur stated. \"Oh. He calls you a stick in the mud.\" Caitlyn replied \"Well his head is in the clouds.\" Arthur became a little defensive. Caitlyn giggled. She always thought Arthur was so cute, especially when he was on the defensive side of the conversation. Caitlyn and Arthur were busy staring at her tablet, when they heard a cough behind them. They turned around, Ariadne was standing just inside the warehouse. \"Dom said you would be back\" Arthur stated with a hint of smugness to his voice. \"I tried not to come, but…\" Ariadne started \"But there is nothing quite like it\" Caitlyn finished her sentence. She knew the feeling. That feeling was the reason that she was still going into the dream world even after all she had been through. \"It is just, pure creation. \" Ariadne added \"Should we look at some paradoxical architecture?\" Arthur said handing Ariadne a PASIV tube. The three hook themselves up to the PASIV device. They stood at a spiral staircase. They started walking up it. Caitlyn clutched her grey case. \"You\\'re going to have a master a few tricks. If you are going to build three complete dream levels.\" Arthur started. As they walked to the top of the stairs, a projection dropped a stack of papers. \"Excuse me\" Caitlyn said the projections. When Caitlyn looked up they had made their way to the middle of the staircase. She smiled slightly she loved Arthur\\'s tricks. \"What kind of tricks\" Ariadne asked as they continue up the stairs. Ariadne didn\\'t notice the switch. \"In a dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes. That lets you create closed loops, like the penrose steps\" Arthur stated Ariadne realized the trick when they reached their previous spot on the stairs. With the projection still picking up the papers off the staircase. \"So a closed loop like that will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.\" Arthur continued as the three walked down the staircase and outside. \"How big do these level have to be\" Ariadne asked, a hint of concern was hiding in her voice. \"Well it could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.\" Caitlyn responded. \"But they have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projection\" Arthur added \"A Maze?\" Ariadne asked \"Yeah a maze.\" Arthur answered. \"And the better the maze, then the longer we have before the projection catch us.\" Ariadne said as though she was thinking out loud. \"Unless you are me. Then rules can fly out the window\" Caitlyn added \"Why\" Ariadne stopped and blinked at Caitlyn. \"Well I\\'m a hacker. I break into the synapses of the subject\\'s brain and make it think pretty much anything.\" Caitlyn explained. \"That explains the tablet case.\" Ariadne said pointing to the case in Caitlyn\\'s hand. They continued walking. \"My subconscious seems polite enough.\" Ariadne noted Caitlyn and Arthur let out a laugh. \"Just wait. Things will turn ugly. No one like to feel someone else messing around in their mind.\" Arthur stated looking around. Some of the projections stared at the three. \"Dom can\\'t build anymore can he?\" Ariadne asked Caitlyn and Arthur shared a glance. \"Well, I don\\'t know if can\\'t, but he won\\'t\" Arthur said with a sigh. \"He thinks it is safer if he doesn\\'t know the layouts.\" Caitlyn added. \"Why?\" Ariadne pressed further. \"He won\\'t say. But i think it is Mal\" Arthur replied looking at Caitlyn. \"His ex-wife?\" Ariadne continued \"No, not his ex\" Arthur looked at Ariadne \"They are still together?\" Ariadne asked in amazement \"No she\\'s…. She\\'s dead. What you see in there is just his projection of her.\" Arthur said. \"What was she like in real life.\" Ariadne asked after a moment of thinking \"Lovely, compassionate, funny, supportive. A real friend.\" Caitlyn said tears formed behind her eyes. She didn\\'t want to hide them anymore. They opened their eyes. Caitlyn got up and went to the bathroom. \"What is wrong with her\" Ariadne asked as Caitlyn closed the door. \"Mal was her closest friend for years.\" Arthur said softly looking after Caitlyn with a deep look of concerned. \"You care about Caitlyn don\\'t you\" Ariadne noticed \"Um… we all do. She has been through a lot. Her ex fiance was an architect who trapped her into their shared dream world. He was put her down to the point she thought she was worthless. She hacked her way out of it.\" Arthur said looking at Ariadne, who was looking at the bathroom door with sympathy. An alert went off on Caitlyn\\'s tablet. Caitlyn came out of the bathroom wiping her eyes as she walked towards her tablet. She unlocked the screen and read the message. \"We have a name. Robert Fischer. I am going to stay here and research. Both of you can go if you want\" Caitlyn said without looking up. Ariadne grabbed her stuff and walked towards to door \"See you tomorrow?\" She asked at the door \"Yeah\" Arthur replied as Ariadne closed the elevator door. \"You okay?\" Arthur asked putting his arms around Caitlyn\\'s shoulder as she sat on a stool. \"Yeah. You tell her my backstory?\" Caitlyn asked eyeing Arthur. \"Yeah\" Arthur responded sitting on a stool next her, \"Caitlyn I just need to say I-\" \"Hey can you look through some on the Sidney Times for me?\" Caitlyn interrupted handing Arthur a stack of newspapers. \"Sure\" Arthur sighed..[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 - Eames It had been a week since Dominick\\'s arrival back in Paris with Saito and Yusuf, a chemist, the person who is able to create the serums they use to enter the dream world. Dominick made the introductions for Yusuf, \"This is Ariadne, our architect, Arthur, our pointman, and Caitlyn, our hacker.\" \"Hacker?\" Yusuf looked at Dominick with a raised eyebrow. \"Yeah. I can hack the brain\" Caitlyn stated with a hint of smugness. She never doubted her abilities, not anymore at least. \"And an Astro Projector if my memory serves correct.\" Saito added. \"Only a handful of people can do that\" Yusuf looked to Saito \"And you are looking at the best\" Dominick stated as Yusuf looked to Caitlyn. \"What is an Astro Projector?\" Ariadne asked looking at everyone \"I will have to show you sometime.\" Caitlyn answered. \"Did you manage to plant Eames?\" Dominick asked looking to Caitlyn. \"Yeah. It was easy. Fischer Marrow\\'s firewall was almost non existent.\" Caitlyn answered. \"Okay, finish the research. Ariadne work on the mazes. Yusuf, the serum. Great.\" Dominick said as he walked into a back room. Eames plane landed a week later. Caitlyn and Dominick met him at the gate. Caitlyn hugged him. \"Hello darling. It has been a while. How are you?\" Eames\\' british accent trickled out of every word as he hugged Caitlyn. \"I know. I am sorry. Dominick has us busy. I am good. Happy even.\" Caitlyn said teasily. They entered the warehouse after a cab ride from the airport. \"Ariadne, this is Eames. He is a forger.\" Dominick said as he rolled Eames luggage into a spare room. \"A what?\" Ariadne looked to Arthur \"A projection con artist. Is a more descriptive job title\" Arthur responded just loud enough for everyone to hear. \"Nice to see you too Arthur\" Eames looked to Arthur. \"Stop it you two\" Caitlyn said looking at the both of them. \"Now what do we know\" Dominick said coming back into the room and sitting at a chair. \"The vultures are circling. The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes the more powerful Peter Browning becomes. I\\'ve had ample opportunity to observe Browning. So in the first layer of the dream I can impersonate Browning and suggest concepts to Fischer\\'s conscious mind. Then when we take him a level deeper his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.\" Eames stated standing in the middle of the circle. \"So he gives himself the idea\" Arthur said thinking out loud. \"Precisely. That is the only way it would stick. The idea needs to seem self-generated.\" Eames answered. \"Eames… I am impressed\" Arthur said leaning back in his chair. \"Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated Arthur, thank you.\" Eames stated staring Arthur down. Their friendly rivalry was bubbling to the surface. Eames look smugly at Arthur. Arthur stared back a pleased look on his face, he had gotten under Eames\\' skin. \"Hey arrêtez-vous tous les deux. Stop it both of you\" Caitlyn spoke with such a sharpness her words could have been glass as she got up from her chair and into Eames\\' line of sight, between him and Arthur. The group looked at her. Eames and Arthur knew exactly what just happened, Caitlyn just got really mad. She only spoke french when she was really angry at someone or something. Caitlyn sat back down and started tapping on her tablet. She was still tapping on it and writing down on paper as Saito and Yusuf left. She paused a moment when Eames left to hug him goodbye, but soon went back to tapping. \"Bye darling\" Eames said kissing her cheek. As he did he stared at Arthur, who in turn looked away. \"See you tomorrow\" Caitlyn replied pecking his cheek. Arthur stayed on the other side of the table compiling the information Caitlyn was uncovering. Caitlyn heard Ariadne creating something and then her and Dominick talking; Caitlyn didn\\'t really care, she looked to Arthur. She put her tablet down, got up, walked over to Arthur and put her arms around his shoulders. \"I don\\'t know how my eyes are still able to process the information on that screen.\" She said as she rested her head on his shoulder. \"You manage. You\\'ve always have\" Arthur said stroking her hair. \"You and Eames have to stop the bickering. I know it is about me and not a difference in viewpoint. You don\\'t need to feel threatened by him. I don\\'t think of him in that way anymore.\" Caitlyn grabbed Arthur\\'s hand as he stood up facing Caitlyn. \"I know, but he still cares about you\" Arthur sighed \"Of course he does. He cares about me in the same way Dom does.\" Caitlyn said looking into Arthur\\'s eyes. \"What if I cared about you more\" Arthur said under his breath. Arthur pulled Caitlyn close to him and kissed her. Caitlyn\\'s arm draped over Arthur\\'s shoulder. They stood there for what seemed like forever to Caitlyn. \"Caitlyn… I need to tell you… I -\" Arthur started, but was interrupted. All of a sudden a door opened. Caitlyn and Arthur separated quickly, surprised. Dominick and Ariadne walked through and headed towards the exit. \"Goodnight, Dom\" Caitlyn called out as Dominick left Ariadne behind him. \"Find something good\" Dominick responded \" I will\" Caitlyn retorted as the elevator door closed. Caitlyn looked to Arthur, \"We need to tell them.\" \"We need to get Dom home\" Arthur answered[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 - Planning The next day the team sat in a circle. A white board at the front. Arthur handed out the information packets that Caitlyn created. \"His relationship with his father is nonexistent. He is wealthy and knows it. He likes to flaunt it. If the empire was to break up, it would ruin him financially.\" Caitlyn stated as she sat down. Dominick stood up, \"I will break up my father\\'s empire. This is an idea that Robert would choose to reject. Which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. The subconscious is motivated by emotions not reason. We need to find a way to translate the idea into an emotion.\" \"How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion.\" Arthur asked taking notes. \"That is what we are here to figure out\" Dominick said flipping through the packet, \"As Caitlyn stated Robert\\'s relationship with his father is stressed to say the least.\" \"Can we run with that? We could suggest to him that breaking up his father\\'s empire as an act of final rebellion against his father.\" Eames suggested \"If you want the emotional response to stick. I am going to have to hack into Robert\\'s brain and send an emotional signal to the correct part of the brain. Negative emotions are controlled by the right side of the brain, which is just harder to hack. And any way a positive emotion trumps a negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.\" Caitlyn stated looking at Arthur. \"We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this\" Dominick added. \"Well try this... My father accepts that I want to create for myself not follow in his footsteps.\" Eames stated. \"That might work\" Dominick said agreeing with Eames. \"Might...we\\'re going to need to do a little better than might.\" Arthur said looking concerned at Dominick. \"Oh. Thank you for your contribution, Arthur\" Eames said snarkily. \"Sacrebleu Eames lay off of him\" Caitlyn sighed rolling her eyes. \"Forgive me for wanting a little specificity Eames\" Arthur stated calmly, Eames gave Arthur a look so Arthur repeated, \" Specificity.\" \"Inception is not about being specific. When we get inside Robert\\'s mind, we\\'re going to have to work with what we find.\"Dominick said looking around. \"Sorry Dom, but inception is about the specific emotional response. Being specific was the only way I got David to break up with me and set me free.\" Caitlyn got up and stood next to Dom, \"Arthur is right. A might, won\\'t work. We need to be as specific as possible, then adapt as needed in the dream world.\" \"Okay, Ariadne work on the mazes. Coordinate with Yusuf, Arthur and Eames. Caitlyn see if there is any other information we need to know.\" Dominick stated as he walked into a back room. They split off into their little teams. Caitlyn was left alone with her tablet. She liked it that way. She wasn\\'t completely alone. Ariadne and the dreamers were off a little ways away at a different table. When Caitlyn glanced at them she would see Arthur looking at her, he would look away as she looked at him. It was a long time before Dominick reamgered, \"Do you have something ready for us Ariadne?\" \"Yes\" She answered \"Good. Arthur set up the PASIV\" Dominick stated looking at Arthur. Arthur obliged. Everyone hooked themselves to the device. They opened their eyes. Everyone was standing in an empty city intersection. \"On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father. And say \\'I will not follow in my father\\'s footsteps\\'. Then the next level down we feed him, \\'I will create something for myself\\'. Then by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns...\" Eames started \"...\\'My father does not want me to him like him\\', Right?\" Dominick finished \"Exactly\" Eames said looking at Dominick. \"Good design Ariadne\" Dominick smiled at Ariadne. They all woke up back in the warehouse. Dominick and Yusuf stood up. Arthur sat up \"Three layers down the dreams are going to start to collapse, with the slightest disturbance.\" Arthur stated with concern. \"Sedation. For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming we\\'ll have to combine the serum with an extremely powerful sedative.\" Yusuf replied \"Okay I think we are done here for today.\" Dominick said, then he whispered something to Yusuf, who nodded. They exited to the back room. Caitlyn grabbed her tablet, starting to do more research and planning. As the sky grew darker Saito and Ariadne left. Dominick and Yusuf were still in the back room. \"What do you think they are doing in there?\" Eames asked as he leaned against the table Caitlyn was sitting at. \"Experiments\" Caitlyn said still looking at her tablet. \"Really. You are buying that story\" Eames pressed further. Caitlyn put her tablet in her lap and gave a look of annoyance at Eames. \"What?\" Eames asked defensively \"Do you really think I bought the story. Dominick does not want to tell us and that it fine.\" Caitlyn said staring at Eames. Caitlyn returned to her tablet. Eames sat at a stool reading some files. Arthur walked in with a steaming bowl. \"You should eat\" Arthur said putting the bowl of mac and cheese in front of Caitlyn, \"It is homemade\" Caitlyn glanced up and smiled. Arthur made the best mac and cheese in the world. Caitlyn would often forget to eat when she was in research mode. She grabbed the fork on the side of the bowl and started eating. \"What am I. Chopped liver?\" Eames joked as Arthur sat done with another bowl of pasta. \"There is some in the other room\" Arthur pointed. Eames got up and went to the room that Arthur was pointing to. Caitlyn and Arthur watched him walk out. As soon as Eames was out of sight, Arthur kissed Caitlyn on the cheek. Caitlyn giggled. Dominick, Yusuf, and Eames left soon after. Caitlyn and Arthur were still cross checking facts as the three entered the elevator. Arthur was still looking at his notes as Caitlyn rested her head on the tablet waiting for search results and closed her eyes. The sky was starting to turn lighter when Caitlyn opened her eyes. She was on a lawn chair. Arthur walked toward her and handed her a cup of coffee. She sat up as Arthur sat on the edge and kissed her forehead. Caitlyn smiled. They heard the elevator door start to open and they stood up and moved a little bit away from each other. Dominick, Yusuf, Saito, Ariadne and Eames got out and started to sit down in the chairs around the whiteboard. Arthur and Caitlyn joined. \"Dominick, I ran some calculations, we will need about 10 hours for this job. Yusuf, tell us more about the serum you will be using.\" Caitlyn asked. Yusuf got up, \" The compound we\\'ll be using to share the dream creates a very clear connection between dreamers whilst actually accelerating brain function.\" \"In other words, it gives us more time on each dream level.\" Dominick stated \"Brain function will be about 20 times normal. When you enter a dream within that dream the effect is compounded. 3 dreams that 10 hours -\" Yusuf continued \"I\\'m sorry math was never my strong suit. How much time is that?\" Eames interjected sitting up. \"It\\'s a week the first level down, six months the second level and the third level down is -\" Dominick started to explain. \"It\\'s 10 years\" Ariadne mused. \"Who would want to be trapped in a dream for 10 years.\" Ariadne asked \"Depends on the dream.\" Yusuf answered. Caitlyn and Arthur exchanged a glance. \"So, once we\\'ve made the plant, how do we get out? I am hoping you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head.\" Arthur asked as he balanced his chair on the back two legs. \"A kick\" Dominick answered \"What is a kick\" Ariadne asked looking around. \"This is a kick\" Eames answered, as he did he tipped the front leg of Arthur\\'s chair up, with his foot, causing the chair to fall back. To avoid from falling Arthur had the lean forward, bringing the front legs back to the ground. Arthur leaned forward catching his breath as he glanced an annoying look at Eames, who smiled back. Eames\\' smile faded when he saw the dagger eyes Caitlyn was giving him. Eames looked back to Dominick. Caitlyn gave a concern glance to Arthur, who have her a reassuring glance back. \"It\\'s the feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake. It snaps you out of the dream.\" Dominick clarifying. \"Are we going to feel a kick with this kind of sedation?\" Arthur asked \"That is the clever part, I customized the sedation to leave inner ear function unimpaired. THat way however deep the sleep still feels falling or tipping\" Yusuf stated. \"Can we see a demonstration?\" Eames asked. \"Sure, Arthur do you mind\" Yusuf motion to an empty chair. Arthur got up and sat down in the chair, hooking up to the PASIV device. Arthur was soon asleep. Caitlyn put some pillows around the chair. Yusuf tipped Arthur backwards. Arthur jolted awake, but could not prevent himself from ending up on the pillows. They reset and Yusuf tipped Arthur to his right. Again Arthur jolted awake but not soon enough to catch himself. Eames started to giggle, Caitlyn shot a glance at him. It hurt her to see Arthur go through this. The floor wasn\\'t necessarily the softest. After the demonstration they all sat back in the circle. \"The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.\" Dominick added \"We could use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.\" Arthur suggested. \"Good idea. Let\\'s test it\" Dominick said pulling the PASIV device over, \"Caitlyn you are the subject. Saito stay here.\" \"What… Why… No\" Caitlyn stuttered. \"Your dream world is the most stable out of all of ours.\" Dominick stated. That was true. Davis had trapped inside the different levels of her dream world for a very long time before moving to his dream world, where Caitlyn had performed inception. However, she did not know what projections would show up or what world they would enter, she had so many. \"Okay\" Caitlyn conceded. Arthur gave her a look of concern. Saito pressed the button. \"Great, everyone ready?\" Dominick asked as he fell asleep. \"No\" Caitlyn whispered to herself as she closed her eyes.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 - Caitlyn\\'s Dream When she opened her eyes, everyone was standing in the elegant living room of her apartment. Caitlyn looked out the balcony, the lights of New York were bright against the darkening sky. The air was crisp but not too cold. \"Where are we?\" Ariadne asked \"My apartment in New York. The darkness below is Central Park.\" Caitlyn replied. \"This is a real place?\" Dominick asked annoyance growing in his voice. \"Yeah. I know. But some of the layout is different than in real life, so I know it is a dream.\" Caitlyn said, \"Follow me please. And don\\'t talk to the projection. It is creepy enough to have everyone here.\" She lead them out of her building into the streets of New York. They walked through the busy and bustling Time Square. \"Why do you have an apartment in New York?\" Yusuf asked over the yelling of the crowded street. \"My parents wanted me to be a dancer for most of my life, when I was 16 they bought me a place to live and dance. They wanted me closer to opportunities here. See how well that turned out.\" Caitlyn commented, as she did she stopped a group of teens dressed in light pink walked by. She turned as they past. \"Who are they?\" Ariadne asked \"Me and my dance friends\" Caitlyn mused. They continued walking past the streets of New York. They past a brightly lit seafood restaurant, Atlantis in bright lights hung above the door. Caitlyn just kept her eyes forward, until they reached a one story dance studio. Caitlyn unlocked and pulled open the door. 10 computer monitors were attached to a large desk and the wall across from the door. Couches and a vending machine lined the walls. One wall was a mirror, nothing stood in front of it. It looked like a former dance studio turned into a hackers paradise. Upbeat music began to play as they walked through the entrance. \"Don\\'t worry it will turn off soon. I use it to think.\" Caitlyn commented. Caitlyn walked over to the desk and reached under it pulling out a silver PASIV case. The group, besides Yusuf, hooked themselves up and sat down at the chairs in the middle of the room surrounded by pillows. They were all soon asleep again. When they opened their eyes, they were standing in a forest. \"The forest outside our house in LA\" Caitlyn commented. The wind began to pick up. It sounded as though a voice was being carried by the wind. A darkness seemed to seep through the trees. \"Run\" Caitlyn yelled as she spirited away from the darkness. Ariadne was the last to turn and run, the only reason she did was because she thought she saw a man with blonde hair walking just in front of the darkness. \"Who is that?\" Ariadne asked as Caitlyn stopped at a fork in the road. \"David. My ex fiancé.\" Caitlyn said still looking around. She looked down, laying on the grass was a metal baseball bat. Caitlyn picked up the bat and stood as David walked toward her. David raised his fist as though he was going to hit her. Caitlyn closed her eyes. In a blink on an eye Caitlyn was standing behind David. \"I am not afraid of you anymore.\" She yelled at him as she swung the bat, hitting the man upside the back of the bead. The man fell down to ground and didn\\'t move. Caitlyn turned around and started running again. The group soon came to a wooden cabin. They entered and made their way to the second floor. Caitlyn got out a black duffle bag and a PASIV case from under the bed. She handed the duffle bag to Arthur \"Blow the living room when it is time for the kick.\" Caitlyn said. The group was getting ready. Arthur looked around for a moment and pulled Caitlyn out to the hall. \"You okay?\" Arthur looked concerned at her \"Yeah, David shouldn\\'t bother you. He is gone\" Caitlyn said looking at Arthur \"That was easier for you than you thought\" Arthur said, he must have read her mind. \"The next part won\\'t. It is something I have not wanted to face for a while.\" Caitlyn lowered her voice. Arthur embraced her and kissed her. She held his head as he did. They seperated. \"You will do fine.\" Arthur stated comfortingly. \"Arthur, I wanted you to know. I -\" Caitlyn started \"Dom wants to know if you to are ready!\" Eames poked his head around the corner. \"Yeah.\" Caitlyn sighed. Caitlyn and Eames entered the room as Arthur went down stairs. \"Everything okay?\" Dominick ask falling asleep. Ariadne was asleep already. \"Yeah\" Caitlyn sighed as she put the needle into her arm. Eames followed suit. When Caitlyn opened her eye she was staring at a metal wall. She turned around the group was sitting in the front row. She was in a theater on a stage. The one place she did not want to be. Sitting a in the middle of the auditorium was a panel: her mother, her father, her sister, and Arthur. She looked to her left, there was herself at age 16. Music began to play. They both started to dance the same way. Caitlyn stopped, the music and her younger self stopped as well. She heard Ariadne whisper to Dominick. Caitlyn turned to her younger self. \"You don\\'t have to dance anymore.\" Caitlyn said as she hugged her 16 year old self. She watched her younger self walk off the stage. Caitlyn snapped her fingers and the music changed, it was upbeat but a somber message. She danced around on the the stage. The moves and techniques came flooding back. She stopped when the music ended. The panel began their negative criticism and how she let them down. \"Look, you all care enough about me to feel let down when I do something. Dad and mom, you were disappointed when I chose computers over dance. I disappointed you when I left David. But David was not a nice person, he was horrible and mean. He used the dream world to torture and hurt me. Sis...Becks...You were disappointed because I chose Eames and Dominick\\'s team over working with you, your husband, and David. I am not you, I will never nor could I ever be you, I have to go my own way...\" Caitlyn stopped when she reached Arthur, she didn\\'t want to say it in front of the group,\"Bumblebee…\" her nickname for how busy Arthur makes himself, \"I probably disappoint you the most, because I have not made peace with my parents and myself. I take my frustrations with my life out on myself. I don\\'t eat, I hardly sleep, I work too much. You watch me destroy myself and I know it hurts you, but you make me feel special and loved. I will tell you in person soon. The next chance I get.\" Caitlyn heard music, it was the signal. She closed her eyes, she opened them and they were in the cabin. She closed her eyes again, she opened them they were in the dance studio. She opened her eyes one last time, she was in the warehouse. Dominick, Yusuf, Ariadne, and Eames were already standing. Arthur was laying down on the lawn chair next to her staring at the ceiling. She got up and walked over to Dominick. \"I confronted my demons, you need to do the same\" She whispered to Dominick \"I have it under control\" Dominick looked at Caitlyn. \"Yusuf that is very powerful stuff\" Eames mused at Yusuf \"Thank you\" Yusuf replied \"I thought Dom\\'s subconscious was messed up.\" Ariadne stated \"Yeah. That is why I didn\\'t want to be the subject, but I guess it served Dom\\'s purpose.\" Caitlyn responded. \"At least we know the kick work\" Arthur said looking at Dominick. \"That is it for today\" Dominick stated to the group. Saito and Yusuf were the first to leave. Eames was next. \"You want to stay here or head back to the hotel?\" Arthur asked looking at Caitlyn \"Hotel please. I feel like I need a hot bath.\" Caitlyn said grabbing her jacket and bag as she, followed by Arthur, walked into the elevator. The elevator door closed. \"You know I really care about you, right?\" Caitlyn said looking at Arthur \"Yes. You know I really care about you, right?\" Arthur repeated looking at Caitlyn \"Yes\" Caitlyn said kissing Arthur.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 - Final Preparation Arthur and Caitlyn were the last ones into warehouse the next day, they were very late. \"Look who decided to show up. We were waiting for you. We need to check out the hotel scene for the subject.\" Dominick said. Eames giggled like he knew something secrete, which he probably did. They hooked up to the PASIV device. Caitlyn was sitting on the stairs of a grand hotel. Eames and Dominick were talking. \"Fischer doesn\\'t have any surgery schedule, there is not dental, nothing.\" Eames commented \"Wasn\\'t he supposed to have knee operation\" Dominick asked \"It is minor. They won\\'t put him under for that. There is nothing.\" Caitlyn said checking her tablet. \"We need at least a good 10 hours.\" Eames added. \"Sydney to Los Angeles.\" Saito stated turning around to face the group, \"One of the longest flight in the world. Fischer makes it every two weeks.\" \"He must be flying private then\" Dominick stated \"Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.\" Saito added \"It would have to be a 747.\" Arthur added joining the group. \"Why is that?\" Dominick asked \"On a 747 the pilot in up top, and first class is in the nose. Preventing anyone from walking through. But you would have to buy out the cabin, and the first class flight attendant.\" Arthur answered. \"On it\" Caitlyn started to tap of her tablet. \"I bought the airline\" Saito stated, causing Caitlyn to look up and stop tapping, \"It seemed neater.\" \"Looks like we have our 10 hours.\" Dominick stated as they started to exit the building, \"Ariadne, good work\" They opened their eyes. Dominick got up. \"Okay that is it for today.\" Dominick walked into the backroom. Saito was the first in the elevator. Yusuf left soon after. Eames helped Caitlyn and Arthur pack away some non essential material. \"I could go for a drink and a bite to eat\" Caitlyn said as the three entered the elevator \"I know a good place\" Eames said looking at Caitlyn and Arthur. Caitlyn and Arthur followed Eames down the street. They stopped at an pub. It looked rustic and like in belonged in London. \"Really Eames, missing home?\" Caitlyn teased. \"The drinks are good\" Eames reassured them. \"If you say so\" Arthur said under his breath looking at Caitlyn. They walked in, order a few drinks, and sat down at a table. Eames sat across from Arthur and Caitlyn. \"So Caitlyn. What was between the two of you in your dream yesterday.\" Eames asked eyeing the couple. \"Your imagination is acting up again, Eames\" Caitlyn said glancing at Eames as she took a sip of her drink. \"Caitlyn darling, you never teased me about my imagination before. Did I hit a nerve?\" Eames said watching Arthur for a reaction, which he got. Arthur\\'s face grimace with disgust when Eames spoke the word darling. \"I see I have upset Arthur.\" Eames teased \"You haven\\'t upset me\" Arthur leaned towards Eames \"Stop it the both of you\" Caitlyn leaned in and grabbed Arthur\\'s forearm. Arthur eased up and relaxed back into his chair, \"Eames stop teasing Arthur. Arthur don\\'t take everything Eames says personally\" \"Tell him that the two of you are not together anymore.\" Arthur said \"Is that a hint of jealousy I hear in our voice, Arthur, darling. Do you like Caitlyn?\" Eames mused \"It doesn\\'t matter Eames lay off of him. What is it to you?\" Caitlyn interjected \"Maybe I found the two of you to be a cute couple.\" Eames made a face at Caitlyn Caitlyn made the same face back. They looked like two siblings fighting over something stupid. An alarm on Caitlyn\\'s tablet went off, pulling Caitlyn away from her argument with Eames. She looked at the alert. \"We have to go.\" Caitlyn said standing up. \"What why?\" Arthur asked \"Maurice Fischer just died\" Caitlyn answered looking at him \"Just as we were getting to the good part\" Eames teased The three meet Saito and Yusuf outside the building as they made their way back to the warehouse. \"I just was about to call you. How did you find out?\" Caitlyn asked Saito as they walked in \"I have my ways\" Saito replied. Caitlyn gave a look to Arthur. When they entered Dominick and Ariadne were sitting on lawn chairs talking. \"It is time\" Saito said to Dominick as he walked in, \"Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney\" \"When is the funeral\" Dominick asked as he got up. \"Thursday.\" Caitlyn answered looking at her tablet, \"In Los Angeles.\" \"Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday, we should move\" Arthur added \"I already bought the tickets for us.\" Caitlyn added as Eames got the tickets to Sydney from the printer. Dominick and Ariadne talked in lowered voiced. Ariadne must have seen the elevator of memories, Caitlyn thought. \"Get us another seat on the plane\" Dominick commanded as he packed up the PASIV device. \"Done\" Caitlyn said as the printer roared to life once more. The team was off to the airport and to Sydney. Their plane right to Sydney was uneventful and boring. They made their flight from Sydney to Los Angeles without any problems. Saito and Dominick stood together looking at the plane. \"If I get on this plane and you don\\'t honor our agreement when we land, I go to jail for the rest my life.\" Dominick stated Saito as Caitlyn walked up to them, putting her phone into her pocket. \"Complete the job en route, I make one call from the plane. You will have no .\" Satio said \"How will you know we completed the job?\" Caitlyn wondered. \"He is down with us.\" Dominick responded \"What. We don\\'t need tourist on this job.\" Caitlyn complained. She hadn\\'t counted on people, who didn\\'t know what they were doing, coming with them. She knew it was going to be dangerous. \"Eames had similar sentiments\" Satio replied looking at Caitlyn. Caitlyn looked at Saito then to Dominick and then turned and boarded the plane. Arthur stopped her. The rest of the team walked past them. \"What is going on with you?\" Arthur asked gently grabbing her hands \"Nothing, I\\'m fine. Just stressed\" Caitlyn sighed. Arthur hugged her and kissed her on the forehead, \"Come on. We should board.\" Caitlyn checked her phone again. Her mom\\'s picture appeared next to some text. She put her phone into her pocket again and followed Arthur.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 - The Fischer Inception Job: Level 1 Ariadne and Saito were already sitting on their side of the first class cabin. Yusuf sat was next to Caitlyn\\'s assigned seat. Arthur sat across the aisle from her. Caitlyn opened her case and pulled out her small metallic tower with a blue light, a wireless transmitting tower, on her table. She opened up a book. She watched from the top of her book as Robert Fischer, a tall man with brown hair and blue eyes, walked to his seat. She saw Eames pickpocket Robert and hand Robert\\'s passport to Dominick. The plan was starting successful, but the real world was never the problem. The dream world was a whole other story. She glanced over to Arthur, who smiled at her. Caitlyn returned to her book. This was going to be a long flight. Soon the seatbelt sign turned off. She heard Dominick and Robert talking. It was not long before Dominick gave the signal that Robert was asleep. The flight attendant got the PASIV device and handed it to Arthur. Everyone grabbed an I.V. tube and connected the tube to them. The flight attendant sat by the device. Caitlyn looked at Arthur as she closed her eyes. When she opened them again she was sitting in a car wedged between Yusuf and Arthur. It was raining heavily. \"Couldn\\'t have peed before you went under\" Arthur complained as Yusuf got into the car \"Sorry\" Yusuf replied \"Too much free drinks before take off, eh Yusuf?\" Eames mocked \"Ha ha bloody, ha\" Yusuf countered. \"Well we know he is going to be looking for a taxi in this weather.\" Dominick noted Dominick drove the car down the busy streets of LA and rammed into a taxi. The taxi driver got out and yelled at Dominick, who pointed a gun at him. The driver ran away. Saito and Arthur got out of the car into the driver seat. Caitlyn leaned forward grabbing Eames shoulder, closed her eyes, and thought about Robert Fischer. She opened her eyes right as Robert was getting ready to get into the taxi Arthur was driving. As Robert got in Caitlyn and Eames entered the other side. \"What are you doing\" Robert asked annoyed \"We\\'re sorry we thought it was free\" Caitlyn said \"Well it is not\" Robert stated \"Maybe we could share\" Eames suggested \"Yeah maybe not. Can you pull over and get this-\" Robert stated Saito turned around from the front seat and pointed a gun at Robert, which caused Robert to stop talking for a while. \"Great\" Robert sighed after a while. Caitlyn turned to looked out the back window to see Ariadne step out onto the sidewalk curb. \"There is $500 in here and the wallet is worth a lot more, so you might at least drop me at my stop.\" Robert stated. \"I\\'m afraid it doesn\\'t-\" Eames started but gunshots rang out through the taxi. Caitlyn ducked down as the taxi screeched to a stop. The projections found them. Arthur backed the taxi up. Gunshots rang out followed by the sound of bullets ricocheting off the taxi. \"Cover him\" Arthur yelled \"Down,down, down\" Caitlyn said pulling Robert into a crouching position. \"What is going on\" Eames asked to anyone who would answer. Arthur moved the car backward and forwards hitting other cars nearby, as Saito and Eames shot at the militant projections. Bullets flew around them shattering glass. One bullet shattered the driver side window causing Arthur to duck, stopping the taxi. Arthur pointed a gun a fire a few shots at the projection shooting at them. Arthur kept driving back and forth trying to create a path. In the comotion no one noticed that Caitlyn was not longer in the car. She projected herself outside with her katana in hand started swinging it at the projections. Dominick, Ariadne and Yusuf showed up in a red car. Arthur backed up the taxi as Caitlyn projected herself back into it. As he backed up he cleared a path for the taxi. Arthur spun the taxi around and drove off. \"You alright?\" Arthur shouted over his shoulder \"I\\'m okay, I\\'m okay\" Eames answered back, turn to face the drive windshield. \"Yeah, I\\'m okay\" Caitlyn shouted back. Hearing her voice calmed Arthur down a little. \"Fischer is alright, unless he gets car sick\" Eames chimed in as he put a bag over Robert\\'s head. \"Saito?\" Arthur asked. There was a silence as Arthur turned to look at Saito. The look on his face told Caitlyn all she needed to know. Saito had been shot. The red car, Dominick had been driving, and the taxi, Arthur had been driving, pulled into an alleyway. Caitlyn and Eames got out of the taxi and opened the warehouse door. The two cars drove in. Dominick ran out of the car, \"Get Fischer into the back room now!\" he yelled as he ran to the taxi and pulled Robert out, handing him off to Yusuf. Arthur pulled Saito out of the taxi, kneeling down to examine Dominick ran over to help. \"Has he been shot, Is he dying?\" Dominick asked \"I don\\'t know\" Arthur responded, \"Where were you? What happened to you?\" \"We were blocked by a freight train\" Dominick answered standing up running his hand over his combed hair. \"Why would you put a train crossing in the middle of a downtown intersection.\" Arthur asked looking at Ariadne \"Well, I didn\\'t\" Ariadne protested the accusation \"Where did it come from\" Caitlyn asked staring at Dominick, she had her suspicion. \"Let me ask you a question. Why were we ambushed? Those were not normal projections. They have been trained for goodness sakes!\" Dominick yelled at Arthur and Caitlyn. \"You\\'re right\" Arthur responded. Caitlyn stayed quiet. She thought she had it covered. She pulled out her tablet and started tapping on it. \"How could he be trained?\" Ariadne asked \"Fischer had an extractor teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized.\" Caitlyn explained \"It should have shown up in the research, I\\'m sorry\" Arthur said looking at Dominick \"So why didn\\'t it\" Dominick yelled \"Calm down\" Arthur responded standing up facing Dominick \"Don\\'t tell me to calm down, this was your job. It was your responsibility. You were meant to check Fischer\\'s background thoroughly. We are not prepared for this type of violence.\" Dominick shouted at Arthur. \"We have dealt with sub-security before we\\'ll be a little more careful and we\\'re going to be fine.\" Arthur yelled back getting into Dominick\\'s face. \"This was not a part of the plan, Saito is dying for goodness sakes.\" Dominick yelled pointing at Saito as Eames and Yusuf entered the warehouse again. \"Dom, I did the research. I found out. I didn\\'t tell anyone.\" Caitlyn yelled back not looking up from her tablet causing Arthur to turn back and look at her. Domnick was about to say something when Eames walked toward Saito. \"Let me put him out of his misery\" Eames said pointing a gun at Saito \"Hey, hey, hey, no! Don\\'t do it\" Dominick said pushing Eames against the car. \"He is in agony. I am waking him up.\" Eames explained \"No it won\\'t wake him up\" Dominick breathed heavily trying to calm down. \"What do you mean it won\\'t wake him up? When we die in a dream we wake up\" Eames stated concern growing in his voice. \"Not from this\" Yusuf answered This argument caused Caitlyn to stop looking at her tablet and stare at Yusuf \"What do you mean\" Caitlyn asked concern and slight panic in her voice. \"We are too heavily sedated to wake up that way.\" Yusuf explained \"So what happens when we die?\" Eames asked \"We drop into limbo\" Dominick answered \"Are you serious\" Arthur and Caitlyn asked at the same time shock in both of their voices. \"Limbo?\" Ariadne asked \"Unconstructed dream space\" Arthur answered \"Well, what is down there?\" Ariadne asked again \"Just raw infinite subconscious. Nothing is down there. Except for whatever might be left behind by anyone sharing the dream who has been trapped there before.\" Arthur explained walking towards Dominick. \"Which in our case is you\" he stop a few inches from Dominick. \"And me\" Caitlyn spoke up, Arthur turned around again concern in his eyes. \"How long could we be stuck there?\" Ariadne asked \"Don\\'t even think about trying to escape until the sedation eased.\" Yusuf answered \"How long, Yusuf\" Eames asked anger and desperation in his voice \"Decades, it could be infinite. I don\\'t know\" Yusuf responded \"Let\\'s get Saito up stairs\" Arthur said picking up Saito, Yusuf and Caitlyn helped. \"Great. Thank you. Now we are trapped in Fischer\\'s mind, battling his own private army and if we get killed we\\'ll be lost in limbo \\'till our brains turn into scrambled eggs. \" Eames stated staring at Dominick before turning and following the rest of the group. \"I should have told you. I\\'m sorry\" Caitlyn said as they carried Saito \"What?\" Arthur asked \"The sub security training, when it came up in the research. I should have told you. I thought we could handle it\" Caitlyn replied They laid Saito down on a wooden table \"Someone got first aid\" Arthur asked as Saito groaned in pain \"I got it\" Caitlyn responded pushing Arthur aside to tend to Saito \"So you knew about these risks and you didn\\'t tell us?\" Arthur asked Dominick \"There weren\\'t meant to be risks. We were not supposed to be taking a load of gunfire\" Dominick responded. \"I said I was sorry.\" Caitlyn said over her shoulder, applying pressure the Saito\\'s wound. \"You had no right\" Arthur said still staring at Dominick \"This was the only way to go three layers deep\" Dominick responded \"And you, you knew about this and went along with it?\" Arthur turned to Yusuf \"I trusted him\" Yusuf said defensively \"You trusted him? What, when he promised you half his share?\" Arthur asked anger growing in his voice. \"No, his whole share. Besides, he said he\\'d done it before\" Yusuf said \"He\\'d done it before? What, with Mal? Cause that worked out so good?\" Arthur asked yelling at Dominick \"That has nothing to do with it.\" Dominick said \"We are doing what we have to in order for Dom to get back to his kids.\" Caitlyn said interrupting them, \"That is why I didn\\'t tell you about the sub security. If you knew you wouldn\\'t have gone through with the plan and this is our best shot to complete this job.\" \"So you let us into a war zone with no way out\" Eames said \"There is a way out, we go down. We complete the job as planned and do it as fast as possible.\" Caitlyn said turning back to her tablet. That seemed to calm things down. Arthur and Dominick went to shake down Robert for information about a safe\\'s code. Eames went to \"change\" into Browning. Dominick came back and Eames went with him to Robert and Arthur. Arthur and Dominick came back. Caitlyn looked up at Arthur, who was glancing at her. She looked away, she didn\\'t like it when she disappointed him; but she had her reasons. Dominick and Ariadne were talking. Yusuf was somewhere. Arthur grabbed Caitlyn\\'s arm and pulled her into another room. \"What is going on?\" Caitlyn asked concerned as they ducked out of sight. \"We need to talk\" Arthur said as he hugged her, \"During the shooting, the one thought in my head was that \\'I hope you were not injured or worse\\'.\" \"Arthur…\" Caitlyn whispered as she put her right hand on his left cheek, \"The same thought was going through my head.\" Arthur leaned his cheek into her hand. He leaned in closer and kissed her. \"Caitlyn… I-\" he started but was interrupted by Dominick \"We have to move\" Dominick said Arthur followed Dominick to collect Eames and Robert. Caitlyn helped Ariadne and Yusuf get Saito into the van. Arthur pulled Robert into the van and dabbed some sleeping serum on Robert, who promptly fell asleep. \"Code\" Caitlyn asked looking at Dominick \"528491\" Dominick answered her as Eames got out of the van and took off his hood. \"What did you get\" Caitlyn asked Eames, placing her tablet by her seat. \"That\\'s boy\\'s relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined\" Eames stated \"This helps us how\" Arthur asked getting ready \"The stronger the issues the more powerful the catharsis.\" Dominick stated \"How are you going to reconcile them if they\\'re so estranged\" Arthur asked walking toward the entrance of the warehouse with a gun. \"I am working on it\" Eames answered \"Work faster\" Arthur said under his breath as he walked to the windows and started shooting at the projections closing in. Everyone else was getting into the van. Caitlyn walked up next to him a gun in her hand. \"What are you doing\" Arthur asked concern evident in his voice \"Helping you\" Caitlyn said as she shot at the projections, \"We have to break out of here before we are totally boxed in.\" Arthur and Caitlyn ducked from the recocheting bullets. They continued to shoot and duck as the team got into the van. Caitlyn closed her eyes and projected herself behind the projections shooting at them. She pulled out her katana and swung it around. She had just finished when she saw a grenade flying at her. She closed her eyes and thought about Arthur. She opened her eyes, she was back that warehouse. Eames was holding a large gun \"What was that. You nearly killed me\" Caitlyn said to Eames. \"Sorry darling\" Eames replied The three returned to the van. Caitlyn sat behind Arthur, across from Ariadne. Yusuf drove off. The rest of the team started to prepare to go under again. \"We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.\" Dominick stated \"You are going to destroy his one positive relationship?\" Ariadne asked connecting herself. \"No, we repair his relationship with his father, whilst exposing his godfather\\'s true nature.\" Eames clarified connecting Robert and Saito, \"We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.\" \"What about his security? It is going to get worse as we go deeper\" Arthur asked \"I think we run with Mr. Charles.\" Dominick responded \"What?! No!\" Caitlyn chimed in \"Who is Mr. Charles\" Eames asked connecting himself \"Bad idea\" Arthur responded connecting himself \"The second we get into that hotel and approach Fischer his security is going to be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like we did on the Stein job.\" Dominick said connecting himself. \"So you have done it before\" Eames asked. \"Yeah, it didn\\'t work\" Caitlyn said connecting herself. \"The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious torn us to pieces.\" Arthur finished for her. \"Excellent, but you learn a lot right?\" Eames asked uneasy \"We need some kind of distraction\" Dominick stated changing the subject. \"How about a lovely lady I used before.\" Eames asked \"Listen, you drive carefully, all right? Everything down there is going to be unstable.\" Dominick said to Yusuf. \"Don\\'t jump too soon, we only got one shot at that kick.\" Arthur told Yusuf \"I\\'ll play the music to let you know it is coming the rest is on you.\" Yusuf responded, \"Ready?\" \"Ready\" the rest of the team responded. \"Sweet dreams,\" Yusuf said as he hit the button.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 - The Fischer Inception Job: Level 2 Caitlyn sat next to Arthur, she started tapping on her tablet. Ariadne sat across from them. They were wearing very stiff professional clothes. \"There goes Mister Charles\" Arthur said eyeing Dominick who was walking toward the lounge of the hotel. \"Who or what is Mister Charles?\" Ariadne asked looking around \"It\\'s a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.\" Arthur responded. Caitlyn continued to tap on her tablet. \"What is she doing?\" Ariadne asked pointing to Caitlyn \"She is buying us some time if Fischer\\'s subconscious turns on us.\" Arthur stated turning to Caitlyn. \"I am priming his brain to receive the signals from the idea we want to implant, we want him to feel happy about his father, so I am trying to prime the brain to receive those signals.\" Caitlyn said without looking up. They watched a very pretty blonde woman walk out of the lounge, followed by two men wearing suits. That woman was probably Eames. \"Why don\\'t you approve of this gambit\" Ariadne asked \"Because it involves telling the mark that he is dreaming. Which involves a lot of attention to ourselves.\" Arthur responded. \"Didn\\'t Cobb say never to do that?\" Ariadne asked \"Mm. So now you\\'ve notice how much time Dom spends doing things he said never to do\" Caitlyn said looking up. The room shook ever so slightly. Ariadne looked around a little scared \"Yusuf\\'s driving\" Arthur commented trying to explain the shake. There was some silence for a while. Then the room began to shake again. \"What is happening\" Ariadne looked around \"Dom is drawing Fischer\\'s attention to the strangeness of the dream. Which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer...For me.\" Arthur said Caitlyn looked up and around. The projections were staring at them as they walked by. This was the creepiest part for her. She hated feeling watched. More projections were staring at them Her focus was pulled to Arthur when he spoke. \"Quick give me a kiss\" Arthur said leaning toward Caitlyn. She paused for a moment, was Arthur really going to kiss her in front of Ariadne. She followed Arthur and leaned toward him, her lips pressing against his. Her heart skipped a beat. He pulled away from her, all three of them looked around. \"They\\'re still looking at you\" Ariadne said \"Oh well. It was worth a shot\" Arthur said as he winked at Caitlyn, who smiled back at him. \"We should probably get out of here\" Caitlyn said getting up. Arthur and Ariadne followed suit. The three of them got into the elevator. Arthur pressed the button for the fourth floor. The ride was silent, Caitlyn like it that way. The door opened and they made their way to room 491. Arthur took out a room key and opened the door. It looked like any ordinary hotel room. \"This room should be directly below 528, correct?\" Arthur asked \"Yeah\" Ariadne responded Arthur went over to the safe and unlocked it. He pulled out a black small duffle bag. He took out explosives. All of a sudden Arthur\\'s phone rang. \"Yeah\" Arthur responded to Dominick, who was on the other side of the phone. Arthur hung up, started to move some furniture, climbed onto it, and started sticking the explosives on the ceiling of the room. \"Do you use a timer?\" Ariadne asked \"No I will have to judge it for myself. While you are all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf\\'s kick\" Arthur replied getting off of the furniture. \"How will you know\" Ariadne asked. \"His music warns me. Then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge that should be unmistakable. So when get a nice synchronized kick. If it is too soon we won\\'t get pulled out. If it too late I won\\'t be able to drop us.\"Arthur continued to climb and place the explosives on the ceiling. \"Why not\" Ariadne asked \"Cause the van will be in free fall, can\\'t drop without gravity\" Caitlyn said, \"We should get moving to the fifth floor.\" The three of them left the room and made their way to the fifth floor using the stairwell. The elevator beeped. Dominick and Robert must be on the floor by now. Robert stopped when he saw the three other people waiting on the fifth floor. \"They\\'re with me. Go on.\" Dominick reassured Robert as the walked to Caitlyn, Arthur, and Ariadne. Robert stopped at 528. He nodded to Dominick, who in turned took out his gun and glanced at Arthur, who also took out his gun. Arthur and Dominick pointed their guns at the door as Dominick kicked it down. They entered the room military style, like police entering a suspect\\'s house. Arthur entered the bathroom as Caitlyn, Robert and Ariadne entered the room. \"Mr Charles\" Arthur said as he brought out a silver PASIV case. \" Do you know what that is Mr Fischer?\" Dominick asked Robert \"Yeah, I...I think so\" Robert stuttered, clearly shocked and confused about what was going on. \"They were trying to put you under\" Dominick said to Robert \"I\\'m already under\" Robert mused \"Under again\" Caitlyn chimed in \"What do you mean, a dream within a dream?\" Robert asked \"Something like that\" Cailyn said under her breath. \"Shhh\" Arthur hissed as they heard someone trying to open the room with a key. Dominick and Arthur pulled their guns. The door opened. An older man with white hair opened the door. Arthur grabbed the man wrist bringing him to his knees. \"Uncle Peter?\" Robert recognized the man who walked through the door. \"You said you were kidnapped together?\" Dominick asked Robert. \"Well, not exactly. They...They already had him. They were torturing him.\" Robert answered \"And you saw they torturing him\" Caitlyn asked eying Robert Robert shook his head. Then he looked like he figured it out, \"The kidnappers were working for you?\" \"Oh. Robert\" Peter Browning sighed \"You\\'re trying to get the safe open to get the alternate will.\" Robert continued disappointment emerged on his face as he looked at his godfather. \"Fischer Marrow has been my life. I can\\'t let you destroy it.\" Peter explained \"I\\'m not going to throw away my inheritance. Why would I.\" Robert raised his voice. \"I couldn\\'t let you raise to your father\\'s last taunt\" Peter continued. \"What taunt?\" Robert asked \"The will, Robert, that will! That is his last insult. A challenge to build something for yourself by telling you that you are not worthy of his accomplishments.\" Peter explained Robert paced the room for a minute, \"What, but that… that he was disappointed.\" \"I\\'m sorry\" Peter said under his breath, \"He is wrong. You can build a better company than he ever did.\" \"Mr. Fischer?\" Dominick said trying to get Robert\\'s attention, \"He is lying\" \"How do you know\" Robert whispered to Dominick \"Trust me, it\\'s what I do. He\\'s hiding something, and we need to find our what that is.\" Dominick whispered to Robert. Eames and Saito entered the room. Eames held Peter as Arthur connected him to the PASIV device. \"I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you\" Dominick said, \"We\\'ll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn\\'t want you to know.\" \"Alright\" Robert replied sitting down as Dominick connected him to the device. Robert and Peter were soon asleep. \"He is out\" Caitlyn said glancing at her tablet as she set it down. \"Wait, whose subconscious are we going into exactly?\" Ariadne asked \"We are going into Fischer\\'s, but I told him it was Browning\\'s, so he\\'d come be a part of our team.\" Dominick answered \"He is going to help us break into his own subconscious\" Arthur reiterated \"That\\'s right\" Dominick replied \"Security is going to run you down hard\" Eames said getting ready \"And I will lead them on a merry chase\" Arthur responded gleefully \"Just be back before the kick\" Eames reminded Arthur. Ariadne and Saito connected themselves to the device \"Ready?\" Arthur turned to Dominick, who was looking out the window \"Yeah\"Dominick responded, connecting himself \"Caitlyn?\"Arthur asked looking at her \"Wait…\" Caitlyn hugged Arthur, in front of everyone \"Arthur I need to tell you something\" \"No, Caitlyn, I really need to tell you how I feel\" Arthur said staring into her green eyes as he connected her to the device. \"I love you\" Arthur said. Eames, Ariadne, and Dominick just stared at them. Caitlyn smiled as Arthur leaned in and kissed her. She draped her arms around his neck as they continued to press their lips together. \"I love you too.\" Caitlyn answered as she laid down on the bed next to the PASIV device \"Woah\" Eames finally spoke. \"Go to sleep Mr. Eames\" Arthur said walking over to Eames. Arthur went back to PASIV device and Caitlyn. He leaned over her, stroked her hair and kissed her as he pressed the button.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 - The Fischer Inception Job: Level 3 Caitlyn stood in her winter snow outfit next to Eames, Saito and Robert. She looked through her binoculars, trying not to think about Arthur; however, Arthur\\'s kiss was still on her lips. She moved the binoculars to look at the hospital bunker, the militant projections were guarding the place. \"So we are not going to talk about you and Arthur\" Eames said to Caitlyn, \"I thought there was something between you two\" \"Eames, shut it. There is nothing to talk about.\" Caitlyn said still looking through her binoculars. She turned it to look at Dominick and Ariadne. They were a little ways up the mountain. Dominick was laying down looking through the sniper scope. It didn\\'t take long for Dominick and Ariadne to make their way down to them. \"Eames, this is your dream. I need you to draw the security away from the complex. You understand?\" Dominick stated \"Who guides Fischer in?\" Eames asked \"Not me. If I know the route everything could be compromised.\" Dominick said looking around \"I...I designed the place\" Ariadne chimed in \"No you\\'re with me\" Dominick said \"I could do it\" Saito stated \"I can go with\" Caitlyn spoke up \"Alright, you brief them on the route into the complex\" Dominick told Eames \"Fischer you are going with us\" Caitlyn stated to Robert. Eames, Saito, and Caitlyn stood around talking about the complex. Saito coughed and spat out some blood. \"You be careful, you have Arthur to get back to\" Eames teased Caitlyn, but there was a level of seriousness in his voice and gaze as he looked at Caitlyn. \"Good luck\" Caitlyn hugged Eames \"Come on Fischer\" Saito said as he took off on his skis. The three skied toward the mountain. The stopped at the base of the mountain, unhooked themselves from their ski equipment, put on their climbing equipment and began to climb the mountain. They had just begin to climb when Caitlyn saw a flare in the sky. Eames must have shot it to lure the projections away. They continued to climb. Caitlyn thought she heard a faint sound. However, the wind like to play tricks on the mind up on the mountain. They continued up the mountain side until she heard Eames\\' voice on the radio \"Cobb do you hear that?\" Eames\\' voice conveyed a hint of concern \"I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago. I thought it was the wind up here\" Caitlyn spoke into her radio. \"Yeah, I hear it. It\\'s music\" Dominick replied \"What do we do?\" Eames asked \"We move fast\" Dominick answered Caitlyn, Saito and Robert continued their way up the mountain. She had worked it out in her head. 10 seconds to jump, gives Arthur 3 minutes, which gave them 60 minutes. She looked up, Fischer and Saito where climbing ahead of her. They would not make it within the time frame. Ariadne\\'s voice rang through the radio, \"Saito, Caitlyn…\" \"Go ahead\" Saito said \"The air duct system...will bypass through the complex. It will get you to the room faster.\" Ariadne explained. They climbed faster. The mountain shook, snow started to fall from above them. Robert and Saito looked up the snow was moving fast. \"Avalanche\" Caitlyn yelled as she cut her climbing rope. Saito and Robert cut their ropes following Caitlyn. The three of them slid down the mountain toward the hospital bunker. The slope of the mountain slid them like rag dolls towards their destination. They were trying to outrun the tidal wave of snow, which was destroying everything in its path. Caitlyn didn\\'t know how long or far they had been traveling. She hit the ground pretty hard. The avalanche subsided as Caitlyn, Robert and Saito rolled to a stop. Robert and Saito groaned in pain. Caitlyn laid there breathing heavily a little astonished that she was still alive. She heard Eames voice over the radio, \"Cobb! Cobb did we miss it?\" \"Yeah, we missed it.\" Cobb responded. Caitlyn got up and trudged over to Robert and Saito. She helped Saito up, they both tried to help Fischer up. Fischer slapped their hand away and slowly got up \"Couldn\\'t someone have dreamt of a beach\" Robert breathed. \"What do we do now\" Eames\\'s voice came on the radio \"Finish the job before the next kick.\" Dominick replied \"What next kick\" Caitlyn asked \"When the van hits the water\" Dominick replied. Robert, Caitlyn, and Saito got up and made their way to the bunker. They found the entrance to the air duct. Saito opened Robert\\'s backpack and pulled out some explosive. Saito set the charge, while Caitlyn pulled out her tablet and started tapping. Saito and Robert came over to her, Saito pressed a button. The air duct exploded, opening up the air duct. They climbed in and made their way through, stopping only a few times because Saito was coughing up blood. Caitlyn helped Robert support Saito climb in the air duct. \"We are here\" Robert spoke into his radio. Caitlyn heard Dominick\\'s voice but not really his words. Saito started coughing again \"You okay?\" Robert asked Saito. \"I got him. Go on ahead.\" Caitlyn said pointing the path he needed to follow. Robert left her and followed the path. Caitlyn took a deep breath, she felt a hand cradle and something press again her cheek. It had to be Arthur one level above. She touched her cheek. She noticed Saito watching her. \"You love him very much?\" Saito huffed through painful breaths. \"Who?\" Caitlyn asked a little embarrassed \"Arthur. Your astro projecting enables you to connect to the ones you love even if you are in different dream levels.\" Saito explained \"I know how astro projecting works.\" Caitlyn replied, \"Yes I love him very much.\" \"You are lucky to find love like that in your lifetime\" Saito breathed Caitlyn smiled at him as she checked her tablet. The smile disappeared when she heard a shot from the chamber Robert walked into. As she entered, she heard another shot. She saw Mal on the floor. She looked out to the window where Dominick was suppose to be. She rushed over to Robert to tend to him. Eames entered the room and grabbed the AED. Caitlyn was applying pressure to Robert\\'s wound. Dominick and Ariadne entered soon after. \"What happened?\" Eames asked getting Robert ready for the AED. \"Mal killed Fischer\" Ariadne responded walking over to him. Caitlyn got up and looked at Dominick. She knew what Dominick was going to say before he spoke. \"I couldn\\'t shoot her\" Dominick breathed, \"There is no use in reviving him, his mind is already trapped down there. It is all over.\" \"So that is it then? We failed?\" Eames asked as he stopped tending to Robert and looked at Dominick in shock. \"We\\'re done. I\\'m sorry\" Dominick said looking defeated. Caitlyn didn\\'t know what to say, she was stunned. No matter how bad a job got, no matter how badly the team failed, no matter what Mal did to sabotage them, Dominick never ever gave up during a job. \"Well, it\\'s not me that doesn\\'t get back my family, is it?\" Eames said stilling back. Caitlyn turned and shot him a glance. Eames wasn\\'t helping the situation. \"It\\'s a shame. I really wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this one.\" Eames continued. \"Let\\'s set the charges\" Dominick said walking over to Eames and opening Eames\\' backpack. Ariadne looked to Caitlyn. Caitlyn had an idea what Ariadne was thinking. Caitlyn nodded to Ariadne. \"No there\\'s still another way! We just have to follow Fischer down there.\" Ariadne protested. \"Not enough time\" Eames replied. \"Ariadne is right and there will be enough time down there. And you will find him.\" Caitlyn added. Dominick and Eames looked to Caitlyn and Ariadne, both of whom had a firm confident look that should not be messed with. \"As soon as Arthur\\'s music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him. We can give him his own kick down below\" Caitlyn explained. \"Look you get him in there. As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital, and we all ride the kick back up the layers.\" Ariadne added. \"Well it is worth a shot\" Eames said closing his bag, \"If Saito can hold that guards off while I set the charges.\" \"Saito will never make it, will he?\" Dominick whispered to Eames, however Caitlyn could still hear him. Eames gave Dominick a look. Caitlyn knew that look meant nothing good. \"I\\'ll stay with Eames to help him.\" Caitlyn said looking at Dominick, \"Anyway I could project myself to your level if need me.\" \"How will you know if we need your help? Ariadne asked \"I just know.\" Caitlyn replied \"Cobb, come on. We\\'ve got to try this.\" Ariadne stated breathless. \"Go for it, but if you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you.\" Eames stated, glancing a concerned look at Caitlyn. \"They\\'re right\" Dominick said getting up and looking to Ariadne and Caitlyn Dominick grabbed a silver PASIV case and opened it. Caitlyn and Ariadne knelt down beside it. \"Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here? I mean, Mal\\'s going to be down there!\" Ariadne asked. \"I know where to find her. She\\'ll have Fischer.\" Dominick replied \"How do you know\" Ariadne asked hooking herself up to the PASIV device. \"Because, she wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her\" Dominick replied. \"Time to face your demons, Dom\" Caitlyn said hooking him to the PASIV device. \"Be safe\" Dominick reminded Caitlyn. \"No worries, I will. Tell Mal I miss her so much.\" Caitlyn whispered in Dominick\\'s ear. Dominick and Ariadne closed their eyes. They reached Limbo.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20- The Fischer Inception Job: Inception \"Why didn\\'t you go with them?\" Eames asked \"I already faced my demons. Dom has to face his.\" Caitlyn said tapping her tablet, \"You needed my help more than Dom did anyways.\" Caitlyn was so busy looking at her tablet, she did not see Eames walking towards her. She felt his arms around her. She looked up, Eames had her in a hug. She hugged him back. \"Eames your friendship is something that I have truly cherished. I love Arthur, I have for a while now\" She said as Eames let her go. \"I know. How long have you two been together?\" Eames asked \"Officially, three years.\" Caitlyn said looking at Eames. \"Did you like him went you met him? When I introduced you to Dominick and Arthur?\" Eames asked cautiously \"Eames, don\\'t ask questions you don\\'t want the answer to\" Caitlyn said looking out the window. She didn\\'t want to tell Eames that Arthur was the reason she broke up him. There was a spark between Caitlyn and Arthur that was present from the first time they met, that neither one of them could deny. Arthur was the reason why she wanted to join Dominick\\'s team. \"They\\'re coming\" Eames said gocking his gun. Caitlyn pulled out her katana, \"I\\'m ready.\" She could hear the snowmobiles approaching the bunker. Eames grabbed Saito and sat him upright by the air duct entrance to the room. The sound of gunfire and bullet ricocheting rang through the room as the projection shot at them. Eames looked at Caitlyn. Caitlyn nodded and closed her eyes. She opened her eyes. She was standing behind two projections shooting at them from a watch tower. She swung her katana at them. The two projection fell down hitting the snow far below them. She projected herself back to the room with Eames and Saito. Eames was handing Saito a gun. \"I need you… I need you to take care of Fischer, while I go set some charges, okay?\" Eames said \"No room for tourists on these jobs\" Saito answered. Caitlyn felt about her tourist comment she made back in Sydney. She didn\\'t mean for Saito to get shot. This was supposed to be an easy cover job for her, which turned out to be harder than she thought. Eames ducked his way back to his bag and grabbed the explosives. While Caitlyn set the AED pads on Robert\\'s chest and pressed analyze button. \"What do you need me to do?\" Caitlyn asked \"Give me some cover\" Eames shouted over the gunfire. They two rushed out of the room, down the stairs to the outside. Eames busted through the door and kicked one of the projections over the railing. Eames went right, Caitlyn went left. She swung her katana at any projection who would get close to her. She heard gunfire from Eames\\' gun. She projected herself behind some projections and swung at them causing them to fall. Caitlyn turned a corner of the complex, Eames was fighting a projection. It looked like he was losing. Caitlyn projected herself behind the projection and swung her katana. The projection stopped moving as he laid on the concrete. \"Hand me some charges, we can make it go by faster if I help\" Caitlyn said holding out her hands. Eames tossed her a smaller bag, filled a some of the explosives. She put the bag over one shoulder. Eames made his way round a half of the complex as Caitlyn made her way around her half. The projections tried to stop her, but nothing stood in her way when she was done taking them down. When Eames and Caitlyn made their way back to the room they found Saito dead. \"Come on, we can\\'t think about that right now\" Caitlyn said checking on Robert. She touched her lips again. She felt pressure on them. \"Arthur?\" Eames asked \"Yeah\" Caitlyn responded. Eames looked around the room. \"You hear the music?\" Caitlyn asked tapping on her tablet. \"Yeah\" Eames said pressing the shock button on the AED. That would get their attention in Limbo. A few seconds later, after another shock, Robert woke up. Eames helped him up. \"In there now. Go, go, go, go!\" Eames said pointing to the strong room. Robert got up, walked to the strong room door, and opened it. The door closed. \"I hope it works\" Eames mumbled standing next to Caitlyn as he opened the door, Caitlyn\\'s fingers hovering over a button on her tablet screen. Robert\\'s father was in a hospital bed a safe was visible by his bedside table \"It better\" She whispered back, \"This is my best work.\" Robert opened the safe by his father\\'s death bed. From her position Caitlyn could see the will. However, Robert was reaching for something else. \"Come on, come on\" Caitlyn whispered to herself. Robert pulled out a homemade pinwheel. Caitlyn pressed the button. Robert grabbed his father\\'s lifeless hand. Caitlyn pressed the button again. Her tablet gave a notice sound. She looked down, the Robert\\'s brain map shown green. The idea was planted. Caitlyn nodded at Eames and Eames hit the detonator. A series of explosions started. The room began to shake. Robert was still holding his father\\'s hand when he fell as the floor crumbled. Eames and Caitlyn fell as the ground under them gave way. She awoke in an elevator.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21 - The Fischer Inception Job: Finishing the Job She woke up again with only enough time to grab a quick breath before her body was immersed in water. As the van started sinking, Caitlyn could not make anything out, the water blurred her vision. Caitlyn began to panic until she felt a hand slip into hers and squeeze. Arthur gave her a mouth piece to a dive tank, she took a huge breath. When Arthur finished his, she noticed Ariadne was awake. Arthur took one last breath before he tried to get Dominick out of his seat belt, however, the seat belt was stuck and Arthur couldn\\'t manage it. Ariadne, Arthur, Caitlyn and Yusuf made their way to the surface of the water. They made their way to some rocks and climbed out. They sat down once they were out of the water. However, the rain was still pounding down on the ground. \"What happened\" Arthur asked Ariadne \"Cobb stayed\" Ariadne answered \"With Mal?\" Caitlyn asked, not really wanting an answer \"No, to find Saito\" Ariadne answered. Caitlyn let out a sigh, it was the answer she wanted. \"He\\'ll be lost\" Arthur stated \"No. He\\'ll be alright.\" Caitlyn replied, she always did have faith in Dominick. Arthur leaned in towards Caitlyn, his lips pressed against hers. \"I love you\" Caitlyn said as she rested her head on Arthur\\'s shoulder, \"I have wanted to tell you that for a long time\" \"Not as long as I have\" Arthur replied kissing her forehead. Caitlyn didn\\'t realize how tired she was. She didn\\'t really expel a lot of energy during the jobs, but this one was definitely different. Caitlyn closed her eyes as she slipped her hand into Arthur\\'s and intertwined their fingers. The bright light from the sun overhead forced her to open her eyes. Caitlyn had to put her hand to her forehead in order to see. Her eyes adjusted to the light, she could see that she was standing in the middle of a meadow. She let her fingers gracefully brush across the flower petals growing in the meadow. A figure appeared not far from her, his outline was very familiar to Caitlyn. Upon seeing it, she did not feel afraid instead she felt calm, happy, loved. The figure got closer it was Arthur. He embraced her, kissing her as he held her. She heard laughing of children behind her. She let go of Arthur, turning to see who made the noise. Two kids were running towards them, James and Phillipa Cobb. Caitlyn got down to their level to give them both a hug, in the distance she could see Dominick walking with someone, he was walking with Mallorie. Dominick and his family disappeared. They were replaced with Caitlyn\\'s mother and father, whom she both hugged. Arthur walked up to them, they all sat down on a picnic blanket. Caitlyn\\'s mother and father told stories of Caitlyn\\'s childhood, which made Arthur laugh. Caitlyn danced around in her flowy floral dressing; making everyone, including Caitlyn, laugh. Eventually her parents left. Caitlyn stared out into the vast cliffs beyond the meadow, Arthur came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. She turned her head and pressed her lips against his. Caitlyn closed her eyes, this was the happiest Caitlyn had felt in a long time. Caitlyn opened her eyes. She was facing Arthur who was smiling at her from across the aisle. She sat up and checked her tablet. The brain map on it was lighting up green, they completed the job. She collected her wireless transmitter and tablet and placed them into her grey case. She pulled out the book in the case and read it. To Caitlyn, may you find your way back to reality no matter where you hack. Your Friend Always, Mallorie. Congratulations! Today is your day. You\\'re off to Great Places! You\\'re off and away. You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose… She was in reality. She put the book away as she got up and crouched by Arthur \"Did you have a good dream?\" He whispered \"Yes. A happy one\" Caitlyn whispered back kissing him on the cheek. She glanced over to Dominick, who has seen her kiss Arthur before taking her seat. Caitlyn saw Saito sit up and dial from personal phones. About 20 minutes later the plane landed and was taxied to its terminal. The team departed separately, pretending not to know each other, except for Caitlyn and Arthur, who were holding hands as they walked toward customs. They were in line in front of Dominick, they both made it through easily. Caitlyn waited once they were on the other side, she wanted to make sure that Saito held up his end of the arrangement. She watched Dominick walk up to the counter and hand his passport over. She was getting nervous. The customs officer handed Dominick back his passport. \"Welcome home Mr. Cobb.\" Caitlyn heard the officer say. Dominick made it through, Saito had held up in end of the arrangement. They just had to get out of the airport with Robert suspecting nothing about the team. Arthur got a cart to collect Caitlyn\\'s and his were a few people a head of Dominick as they exited baggage claim. Caitlyn\\'s mother, father, and sister where waiting for them outside right behind Dominick\\'s father - in - law. Caitlyn ran up and hugged them. She introduced Arthur to her sister as Dominick walked by. Caitlyn glanced at him and quickly smiled, she saw Mal\\'s father pick up Dominick\\'s luggage and walk out to the parked cars. Caitlyn and Arthur got into her parents town car as her father put their luggage into the trunk. Caitlyn\\'s mother, father and sister also got into the car and the driver pulled away from the curb. \"Welcome to Los Angeles Arthur\" Caitlyn\\'s father said to Arthur \"Thank you Mr. Johnson.\" Arthur said as he looked to Caitlyn.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 - A Job Well Done They arrived at Caitlyn\\'s parent\\'s house, a large spacious mansion, on the outskirts of Beverly Hills. Caitlyn and Arthur settled into the guest house in the backyard of the estate. They were in the house for several hours when the phone rang. Caitlyn answered it, \"Hello?\" \"Caitlyn it is me\" Dominick\\'s voice replied \"Dom. How are James and Phillipa? Why are you calling?\" Caitlyn asked \"James and Phillipa are fine. They miss their godmother and godfather.\" Dominick started, \"I am calling about what you said to Arthur inside Fischer\\'s dream.\" \"Oh?\" Caitlyn\\'s voice could not hide concern \"I am really happy for the both of you. I wish you told me sooner, that way we could have celebrated the two of you sooner.\" Dominick laughed, \"I figured there was something between the two of you for the past year and half.\" \"I guess we didn\\'t want to you feel hurt or betrayed by us\" Caitlyn answered. \"I wouldn\\'t have. You two are really good for each other… Anyway Caitlyn I have to go, dinner is ready. Bye\" Dominick said \"Bye\" Caitlyn responded before she heard a dial tone Caitlyn put down the phone. Arthur walked into the room carrying two plates with steak on them. \"Who was that?\" He asked placing the plates down at the dinner table \"Dom\" Caitlyn answered taking a seat. \"What did he want?\" Arthur continued as he cut some of his meat. \"To congratulate us for finding each other.\" Caitlyn said before taking a bit of her steak. The next day Caitlyn invited Ariadne to go shopping with her. \"Enjoying LA?\" Caitlyn asked as they walked down the street \"Yeah. It is nice.\" Ariadne said looking around at all the sights. Ariadne and Caitlyn shopped for hours. Afterwards, Caitlyn dropped Ariadne off at her hotel. \"Ariadne, I am glad you took the job.\" Caitlyn said from the back seat. \"Me too\" Ariadne answered with a smile. Caitlyn\\'s driver drove away. That night Arthur and Caitlyn were invited by Eames to have dinner with him, Yusuf, Ariadne, and Dominick. \"As of today, Robert Fischer announced that he was going to dissolve Fischer Marrow\" Caitlyn said reading the headline from her tablet. \"I propose a toast to a job well done\" Eames said raising his glass. \"Here, here\" the rest of the group responded. As they all sat around telling stories about what happened during the job. Arthur stopped talking, which cause the rest of the group to look at him. \"I want to propose a toast to friends, family, and love\" Arthur said raising his glass \"Here, here\" the rest of the group answered back. \"And to Caitlyn,\" Arthur fished around in his pocket and pulled out a velvet box, \"Will you marry me?\" \"Yes.\" Caitlyn said getting up. As Arthur put the ring on her finger she kissed him. The group roared with praise. \"Let\\'s see the ring\" Eames said giving a nod to Arthur. Caitlyn held out her hand to show off the ring. They spent the rest of the night talking and laughing. The sky was lightening when they group said their goodbyes. Arthur and Caitlyn walked hand in hand to the car. They got into the front seat and Arthur drove them away.[Chapter 23] Chapter 23 - A Wedding and The Epilogue For months Caitlyn could do nothing else but show off the ring and plan her wedding. After they bought their own house in LA, Caitlyn focused all her energy into planning a gorgeous and exciting wedding that would be a very happy day for the both of them. Caitlyn\\'s mother helped with the planning. Arthur was happy to see Caitlyn focused on something other than research for a job. Arthur and Caitlyn were married three months after he proposed to her. Caitlyn didn\\'t want to wait, after what she went through with David, Arthur understood. The gang was in attendance, along with Caitlyn\\'s family, Arthur\\'s family, and other important people Caitlyn\\'s mother thought would be critical to have a wedding. Caitlyn\\'s dress was simple but very elegant. Caitlyn\\'s father walked her down the aisle. Dominick was standing by Arthur, as his best man. The ceremony was traditional but fun. The reception was full of dancing and laughs. After the reception Arthur and Caitlyn said their goodbyes to the gang and their families as they boarded a private jet to their honeymoon destination. They spend three weeks on a private pristine beach surrounded by tropical beauty. One day Caitlyn was tanning when her tablet began ringing. She looked at it, Dominick\\'s picture appeared on the screen. She swiped the screen, Dominick face appeared on screen. \"What, Dom? I\\'m on my honeymoon?\" Caitlyn spoke \"I need your help to do some deep web searching for jobs.\" Dominick said \"What do you need?\" Caitlyn sighed, she broke her promise to Arthur not to work during their honeymoon. \"A way to run a deep web search.\" Dominick responded Caitlyn tapped on her tablet \"Done, it should show up on your screen. Don\\'t worry about traces. The signal is being bumped off every continent.\" Caitlyn said laying her head back down on her towel. \"Thanks Mrs. Jones\" Dominick teased \"Bye Dom\" Caitlyn said as she tapped her screen, which went black. Their three week honeymoon was over too quickly. They were traveling back to the states. Dominick picked them up at the airport to give them other job. Which was completed in less than two week, extraction was easier when Mal or David were not interfering. Five months later Caitlyn got the surprise of her life. She was pregnant with twins. Nine months later Arthur and Caitlyn welcomed Mallorie and Victorie Jones into the world. Dominick was named their godfather, Ariadne was named their godmother. Having kids did not stop Arthur or Caitlyn from helping Ariadne, Eames and Dominick from completing extraction jobs. In fact their children made them better at their jobs, if that was even possible. Caitlyn wouldn\\'t over work herself and Arthur became a little more creative. They, especially Caitlyn, seemed to be very happy and they were. Because what is more resilient than an idea that destroys you is an idea that defines you, even if you don\\'t want to admit the idea to yourself. When Caitlyn and Arthur finally admitted their feelings for each other they became an unbreakable couple, who were truly and forever in love with each other. Saito was right, they were lucky to have found each other. After many successful jobs both for Cobol and other outside contracts, Dominick maintained his assertion that he was the best extractor in the business and moved his team\\'s headquarters to LA, Yusuf was hired by Dominick to be the teams chemist, Ariadne finished her Master\\'s degree and became the architect for Dominick\\'s team, Eames bought an apartment in LA and became the team\\'s permanent forger, Arthur continued to be the best point man for the team and Caitlyn became known the team\\'s astro projecting hacker, the only one of her kind.
